060 February 26 , 2009FEDS GRANT EMINENT DOMAIN AS COLLATERAL TO CHINA FOR U.S. DEBTS !
Beijing , China -- Sources at the United States Embassy in Beijing China have just CONFIRMED to me that the United States of America has tendered to China a written agreement which grants to the People 's Republic of China , an option to exercise Eminent Domain within the USA , as collateral for China 's continued purchase of US Treasury Notes and existing US Currency reserves !
The written agreement was brought to Beijing by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and was formalized and agreed - to during her recent trip to China .
This means that in the event the US Government defaults on its financial obligations to China , the Communist Government of China would be permitted to physically take -- inside the USA -- land , buildings , factories , perhaps even entire cities - to satisfy the financial obligations of the US government .
Put simply , the feds have now actually mortgaged the physical land and property of all citizens and businesses in the United States .
They have given to a foreign power , their Constitutional power to " take " all of our property , as actual collateral for continued Chinese funding of US deficit spending and the continued carrying of US national debt .
This is an unimaginable betrayal of every man , woman and child in the USA .
An outrage worthy of violent overthrow .
I am endeavoring to obtain images or copies of the actual document but in the interim , several different sources both in the US and in China have CONFIRMED this to me .
More details as they become available .
. . . . spread the word ASAP .
This is the third and final part of a three - part article on the Awk one - liners .
This part will explain
Awk one - liners for selective printing and deletion of certain lines .
See part one for introduction of the series .
If you just came to my website , then you might wonder , " What are these Awk one - liners and why are they famous ? "
The answer is very simple - they are small and beautiful Awk programs that do one and only text manipulation task very well .
They have been circulating around the Internet as awk1 line .
txt text file and they have been written by Eric Pement .

4. Selective Printing of Certain Lines
45 . Print the first 10 lines of a file ( emulates " head - 10 " ) .
awk ' NR < 11 '
Awk has a special variable called " NR " that stands for " Number of Lines seen so far in the current file " .
After reading each line , Awk increments this variable by one .
So for the first line it's 1 , for the second line 2 , ... , etc .
As I explained in the very first one - liner , every Awk program consists of a sequence of pattern - action statements " pattern { action statements } " .
The " action statements " part get executed only on those lines that match " pattern " ( pattern evaluates to true ) .
In this one - liner the pattern is " NR < 11 " and there are no " action statements " .
The default action in case of missing " action statements " is to print the line as - is ( it 's equivalent to " { print $ 0 } " ) .
The pattern in this one - liner is an expression that tests if the current line number is less than 11 .
If the line number is less than 11 , Awk prints the line .
As soon as the line number is 11 or more , the pattern evaluates to false and Awk skips the line .
A much better way to do the same is to quit after seeing the first 10 lines ( otherwise we are looping over lines > 10 and doing nothing ) :
awk ' 1 ; NR == 10 { exit }'
The " NR == 10 { exit } " part guarantees that as soon as the line number 10 is reached , Awk quits .
For lines smaller than 10 , Awk evaluates " 1 " that is always a true - statement .
And as we just learned , true statements without the " action statements " part are equal to " { print $ 0 } " that just prints the first ten lines !
46 . Print the first line of a file ( emulates " head - 1 " ) .
awk ' NR > 1 { exit } ; 1 '
This one - liner is very similar to previous one .
The " NR > 1 " is true only for lines greater than one , so it does not get executed on the first line .
On the first line only the " 1 " , the true statement , gets executed .
It makes Awk print the line and read the next line .
Now the " NR " variable is 2 , and " NR > 1 " is true .
At this moment " { exit } " gets executed and Awk quits .
That 's it .
Awk printed just the first line of the file .
47 .
Print the last 2 lines of a file ( emulates " tail - 2 " ) .
awk '{ y=x "
" $ 0 ; x=$ 0 } ; END { print y } '
Okay , so what does this one do ?
First of all , notice that " {y=x "
" $ 0 ; x =$ 0} " action statement group is missing the pattern .
When the pattern is missing , Awk executes the statement group for all lines .
For the first line , it sets variable " y " to "
line1 " ( because x is not yet defined ) .
For the second line it sets variable " y " to " line1
line2 " .
For the third line it sets variable " y " to " line2
line3 " .
As you can see , for line N it sets the variable " y " to " lineN - 1
lineN " .
Finally , when it reaches EOF , variable " y " contains the last two lines and they get printed via " print y " statement .
Thinking about this one - liner for a second one concludes that it is very ineffective - it reads the whole file line by line just to print out the last two lines !
Unfortunately there is no seek ( ) statement in Awk , so you can't seek to the end - 2 lines in the file ( that 's what tail does ) .
It 's recommended to use " tail - 2 " to print the last 2 lines of a file .
48 . Print the last line of a file ( emulates " tail - 1 " ) .
awk ' END { print }'
This one - liner may or may not work .
It relies on an assumption that the " $ 0 " variable that contains the entire line does not get reset after the input has been exhausted .
The special " END " pattern gets executed after the input has been exhausted ( or " exit " called ) .
In this one - liner the " print " statement is supposed to print " $ 0 " at EOF , which may or may not have been reset .
It depends on your awk program 's version and implementation , if it will work .
Works with GNU
Awk for example , but does n't seem to work with nawk or xpg4 / bin / awk .
The most compatible way to print the last line is :
awk '{ rec= $ 0 } END { print rec }'
Just like the previous one - liner , it 's computationally expensive to print the last line of the file this way , and " tail - 1 " should be the preferred way .
49 .
Print only the lines that match a regular expression " / regex / " ( emulates " grep " ) .
awk ' / regex / '
This one - liner uses a regular expression " / regex / " as a pattern .
If the current line matches the regex , it evaluates to true , and Awk prints the line ( remember that missing action statement is equal to " { print } " that prints the whole line ) .
50 .
Print only the lines that do not match a regular expression " / regex / " ( emulates " grep - v " ) .
awk '!/ regex / '
Pattern matching expressions can be negated by appending " ! " in front of them .
If they were to evaluate to true , appending " ! " in front makes them evaluate to false , and the other way around .
This one - liner inverts the regex match of the previous ( # 49 ) one - liner and prints all the lines that do not match the regular expression " / regex / " .
51 . Print the line immediately before a line that matches " / regex / " ( but not the line that matches itself ) .
awk '/ regex / { print x } ; { x=$ 0 } '
This one - liner always saves the current line in the variable " x " .
When it reads in the next line , the previous line is still available in the " x " variable .
If that line matches " / regex / " , it prints out the variable x , and as a result , the previous line gets printed .
It does not work , if the first line of the file matches " / regex / " , in that case , we might want to print " match on line 1 " , for example :
awk ' / regex / { print ( x== " " ?
" match on line 1 " : x ) } ; { x=$ 0 }'
This one - liner tests if variable " x " contains something .
The only time that x is empty is at very first line .
In that case " match on line 1 " gets printed .
Otherwise variable " x " gets printed ( that as we found out contains the previous line ) .
Notice that this one - liner uses a ternary operator " foo? bar : baz " that is short for " if foo , then bar , else baz " .
52 . Print the line immediately after a line that matches " / regex / " ( but not the line that matches itself ) .
awk '/ regex / { getline ; print }'
This one - liner calls the " getline " function on all the lines that match " / regex / " .
This function sets $ 0 to the next line ( and also updates NF , NR , FNR variables ) .
The " print " statement then prints this next line .
As a result , only the line after a line matching " / regex / " gets printed .
If it is the last line that matches " / regex / " , then " getline " actually returns error and does not set $ 0 .
In this case the last line gets printed itself .
53 .
Print lines that match any of " AAA " or " BBB " , or " CCC " .
awk '/ AAA|BBB|CCC /'
This one - liner uses a feature of extended regular expressions that support the | or alternation meta-character .
This meta - character separates " AAA " from " BBB " , and from " CCC " , and tries to match them separately on each line .
Only the lines that contain one ( or more ) of them get matched and printed .
54 . Print lines that contain " AAA " and " BBB " , and " CCC " in this order .
awk '/ AAA .* BBB .*CCC /'
This one - liner uses a regular expression " AAA.BBB.CCC " to print lines .
This regular expression says , " match lines containing AAA followed by any text , followed by BBB , followed by any text , followed by CCC in this order ! "
If a line matches , it gets printed .
55 .
Print only the lines that are 65 characters in length or longer .
awk ' length > 64 '
This one - liner uses the " length " function .
This function is defined as " length ( [ str ] ) " - it returns the length of the string " str " .
If none is given , it returns the length of the string in variable $ 0 .
For historical reasons , parenthesis ( ) at the end of " length " can be omitted .
This one - liner tests if the current line is longer than 64 chars , if it is , the " length > 64 " evaluates to true and line gets printed .
56 . Print only the lines that are less than 64 characters in length .
awk ' length < 64 '
This one - liner is almost byte - by - byte equivalent to the previous one .
Here it tests if the length if line less than 64 characters .
If it is , Awk prints it out .
Otherwise nothing gets printed .
57 .
Print a section of file from regular expression to end of file .
awk ' / regex /,0 '
This one - liner uses a pattern match in form ' pattern1 , pattern2 ' that is called " range pattern " .
The 3rd Awk Tip from article " 10 Awk Tips , Tricks and Pitfalls " explains this match very carefully .
It matches all the lines starting with a line that matches " pattern1 " and continuing until a line matches " pattern2 " ( inclusive ) .
In this one - liner " pattern1 " is a regular expression " / regex / " and " pattern2 " is just 0 ( false ) .
So this one - liner prints all lines starting from a line that matches " / regex / " continuing to end - of - file ( because 0 is always false , and " patter n2 " never matches ) .
58 . Print lines 8 to 12 ( inclusive ) .
awk ' NR==8 , NR==12 '
This one - liner also uses a range pattern in format " pattern1 , pattern2 " .
The " pattern1 " here is " NR==8 " and " pattern2 " is " NR==12 " .
The first pattern means " the current line is 8th " and the second pattern means " the current line is 12th " .
This one - liner prints lines between these two patterns .
59 .
Print line number 52 .
awk ' NR==52 '
This one - liner tests to see if current line is number 52 .
If it is , " NR==52 " evaluates to true and the line gets implicitly printed out ( patterns without statements print the line unmodified ) .
The correct way , though , is to quit after line 52 :
awk ' NR==52 { print ; exit }'
This one - liner forces
Awk to quit after line number 52 is printed .
It is the correct way to print line 52 because there is nothing else to be done , so why loop over the whole doing nothing .
60 .
Print section of a file between two regular expressions ( inclusive ) .
awk '/ Iowa / , /Montana /'
I explained what a range pattern such as " pattern1 , patter n2 " does in general in one - liner # 57 .
In this one - liner " pattern1 " is " / Iowa / " and " pattern2 " is " / Montana / " .
Both of these patterns are regular expressions .
This one - liner prints all the lines starting with a line that matches " Iowa " and ending with a line that matches " Montana " ( inclusive ) .
5. Selective Deletion of Certain Lines
There is just one one - liner in this section .
61 . Delete all blank lines from a file .
awk NF
This one - liner uses the special NF variable that contains number of fields on the line .
For empty lines , NF is 0 , that evaluates to false , and false statements do not get the line printed .
Another way to do the same is :
awk '/./'
This one - liner uses a regular - expression match " . " that matches any character .
Empty lines do not have any characters , so it does not match .

TORONTO -- Wal - Mart Canada Corp. is closing its small Sam's Club division , which never made it beyond six stores in Ontario , choosing to focus its efforts on the lucrative supercenter format instead .
The Canadian unit of retailing - giant Wal - Mart Stores Inc. has tried to make a go of the warehouse clubs , which charge a membership fee in return for wholesale - priced products , for the past five years .
Unlike the popular supercenters -- another 26 of which will open this year -- the half - dozen Sam's Clubs were n't meeting expectations , ...
John Updike , the great chronicler of sex and divorce among ordinary people in postwar America , died this morning , aged 76 .
A prolific novelist , short - story writer , poet and critic , Updike 's most famous works include The Witches of Eastwick , and his quartet of novels about the life of Harry " Rabbit " Angstrom .
Two of the Rabbit books won the Pulitzer prize for fiction - first Rabbit is Rich , in 1981 , and then Rabbit at Rest , in 1991 .
Updike 's death was announced by Nicholas Latimer of Alfred A Knopf , his publisher .
" It is with great sadness that I report that John Updike died this morning at the age of 76 , after a battle with lung cancer .
He was one of our greatest writers , and he will be sorely missed , " said Latimer in a statement .
A literary writer who frequently appeared on bestseller lists , the tall , hawk - nosed Updike wrote novels , short stories , poems , criticism , the memoir Self - Consciousness and even a famous essay about baseball great Ted Williams .
He was prolific , even compulsive , publishing more than 50 books in a career that started in the 1950s .
Updike won virtually every literary prize going ; only the Nobel eluded him .
To compensate , he awarded it to one of his fictional characters , Henry Bech , the womanising , egotistical Jewish novelist who featured in a number of his works .
Updike was famous for his depiction of sex ; in November 2008 , he won a lifetime achievement award at the Literary Review 's annual Bad Sex in Fiction award , which celebrates " crude , tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature " .
Born in 1932 in Shillington , a small town in Pennsylvania , Updike spoke for millions of Depression - era readers raised by " penny - pinching parents " , united by " the patriotic cohesion of world war two " and blessed by a " disproportionate share of the world 's resources " , and America 's postwar , suburban boom of " idealistic careers and early marriages " .
He captured , and sometimes embodied , a generation 's confusion over the civil rights and women 's movements , and opposition to the Vietnam war .
Updike was called a misogynist , a racist and an apologist for the establishment .
On purely literary grounds , he was attacked by Norman Mailer as the kind of author appreciated by readers who knew nothing about writing .
More often he was praised for his flowing , poetic writing style .
Describing a man 's interrupted quest to make love , Updike likened it " to a small angel to which all afternoon tiny lead weights are attached " .
Nothing was too great or too small for Updike to poeticise .
He might rhapsodise over the film projector 's " chuckling whir " or look to the stars and observe that " the universe is perfectly transparent : we exist as flaws in ancient glass . "
A tall , shy , priggish boy as a teenager , Updike found his greatest pleasure in drawing and writing .
He was an accomplished cartoonist and hoped to work as an animator for Walt Disney .
He wrote regularly for his high school newspaper , and won a scholarship to read English at Harvard .
He graduated in 1954 , and spent a year in Oxford studying at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of staff at the New Yorker .
In 1957 , he left New York , with its " cultural hassle " and melting pot of " agents and wisenheimers " , and settled with his first wife and four children in Ipswich , Massachusetts , a " rather out - of - the - way town " about 30 miles north of Boston .
" The real America seemed to me ' out there ' , too heterogeneous and electrified by now to pose much threat of the provinciality that people used to come to New York to escape , " Updike later wrote .
" There were also practical attractions : free parking for my car , public education for my children , a beach to tan my skin on , a church to attend without seeming too strange . "
As you may have read , a new piece of OS X malware has been discovered .
Intego has named this malware the OSX.RSPlug .
A Trojan Horse .
Note that this malware is not a virus — it ca n’t self - propagate from one machine to another .
It is , however , definitely malicious , and it ’s packaged in a well - designed trojan horse wrapper .
Your machine could be infected if you ’ve recently gone looking for some , um , less - than - flattering pictures of Britney Spears .
Thinking you ’ve found what you ’re looking for , you click a video to watch it , only to see a message stating that your machine lacks the necessary codec .
A disk image will then start downloading , and ( depending on the settings on your machine ) may then mount and launch an installer which asks for your admin password .
Rule # 1 : Do not install software from untrusted sources , especially if that software comes as an installer package and requests your administrator ’s password !
However , if you do proceed to run the installer , here ’s what will happen :
Sorry , but you wo n’t be able to watch those videos , as no codec was installed .
Your DNS will be changed to point to malicious DNS machines .
What this means is that even if you type www.apple.com in your browser ’s URL area , you may be taken there , to a phishing “ clone ” of that site , or to another site completely — such as a porn site .
Where you wind up depends solely on how the malicious DNS machines are configured .
If you consider ebay.com or paypal.com , for instance , the consequences may be dire .
A cron job ( scheduled task ) will run every minute to restore the malicious DNS info , in case you change it .
This is really bad .
Really .
And even though it ’s targeted at porn surfers today , the malware could easily be associated with anything else , like a new viral video site , or a site that purports to show commercials from the upcoming Super Bowl .
Because this thing may spread to other such sites , we spent some time investigating the trojan — no , not its source sites !— to determine the best way to tell if you ’ve been infected , as well as how to remove the software if you do find it on your machine .
How to detect the trojan horse
What makes this trojan sneaky ( for OS X 10.4 users , at least ) is that there ’s no visible way to see that the DNS information has been changed .
So how can you tell if you ’ve been infected ?
If you ’re a VirusBarrier user and you have your definitions updated as of today , VirusBarrier will both find and remove the trojan horse .
If you ’re running OS X 10.5 , open your Network System Preferences pane and select your active interface ( AirPort , Ethernet ) , then click Advanced .
On the Advanced screen , click on the DNS tab .
The leftmost box contains your DNS servers , and all the entries should be in black .
If the trojan has been installed on your machine , you ’ll see the phantom DNS in gray , listed above your normal DNS information , as seen in the image at right — the first two entries are the evil DNS , the last is the normal DNS .
Note :
There are other situations where the DNS info may be gray — it appears that if your DNS is provided by another machine , for instance , then your legitimate DNS information will be in gray , not black .
So while this may be an indicator , keep reading for the best way to be certain if your machine is infected .
The easiest way to tell if you ’ve been infected is to go to the top - level / Library ->
Internet Plug - Ins folder , and look for a file named plugins .
settings .
If you find one there , chances are , you ’re infected .
However , since the names used by the malware authors may change , it ’s best to check a couple of other spots as well .
The other thing to check is for the presence of the root cron job .
To do this , open Terminal ( in / Applications -> Utilities ) and type this command :
sudo crontab -l
Enter your admin password when asked , and Terminal will then display any cron tasks for root .
Typically this will be blank .
If you see this output , though , it means you ’ve got the malware :
* * * * * " / Library / Internet Plug-Ins/plugins.settings " >/dev/null 2>&1
If you really want to be sure , you can run scutil in Terminal ( it ’s an interface to configd , an OS X system utility ) .
Type scutil and press Return , then type this command at the prompt , followed by another Return : show State :/ Network / Global / DNS .
The output will look something like this :
< dictionary > {
ServerAddresses : < array > {
0 : 123.12.34.56
1 : 234.65.43.21
}
}
Those are all the DNS servers your machine knows about .
( You can type exit to get out of scutil and back to Terminal . )
Look at that list and compare it to what you see in the Network preferences panel — make sure you click into the two - line DNS Servers box there and use your down arrow key , just in case there are more servers listed than you can see .
The two lists should be the same .
If you see servers in the output from scutil that you do n’t see in the GUI , then the trojan has probably been installed .
How to remove the trojan horse
If you ’re infected , what ’s the easiest way to get rid of the trojan horse ?
As noted above , VirusBarrier will do the job , using today ’s virus definitions .
However , you can do it yourself , if you wish , though it will require a tiny bit of Terminal work .
Here ’s what you need to do — and yes , I infected my own machine and tested this ( on OS X 10.5 , but OS X 10.4 should be identical ) to make sure it works .
In the Finder , navigate to / Library -> Internet Plug - Ins , and delete the file named plugins .
settings .
Empty the trash .
This deletes the tool that sets the rogue DNS Server information .
In Terminal , type sudo crontab -r and provide your admin password when asked .
This deletes the root cron job that checks the DNS Server settings .
You can prove it worked by typing sudo crontab -l ; you should see the message “ crontab : no crontab for root . ”
Open your Network System Preferences panel , go to the DNS Server box , and copy the entries you can see to a Stickies note , TextEdit document , or memorize them .
Now retype those same values in the box , then click Apply .
Reboot your Mac .
After you reboot , you can confirm you ’re free of the trojan horse ( in OS X 10.5 ) by opening the Advanced pane of the Network System Preferences panel and looking at the DNS tab — you should n’t see any gray entries .
In Tiger , to really prove that you ’re free of the infestation , use the scutil command detailed above , as that ’s the only way to see all the DNS Servers your machine knows about .
As always , the best way to avoid these things is to not install software from untrusted sources — especially if it comes as an installer package and requests your administrator ’s password !
But if you do get infected , at least you ’ll know how to confirm you have an issue , and remove the troublesome software .

This article has been updated to reflect other causes of gray DNS entries , as well as a better method of detecting the presence of the malware . ]

MONTGOMERY --
A new report shows that Alabama literacy rates improved from 1992 to 2003 but some counties are still double the national average illiteracy rate of 14.5 percent .
The study by the National Center for Education Statistics was released today and showed 15 percent of Alabamians lacked basic literacy skills in 2003 , an improvement from 21 percent in 1992 .
The study did n't issue rankings , but 12 states had illiteracy rates that were higher than Alabama 's while 36 and the District of Columbia had lower illiteracy rates .
South Carolina matched Alabama 's rate of 15 percent .
Shelby County had the lowest rate of illiteracy with 7 percent while Bullock County was the highest at 34 percent .
Contours of Crisis : Plus ça change , plus c’est pareil ?
First in a series of articles on the current crisis .
By Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan
This is a web - only article from the website of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This is a web - only article , available only at www.dollarsandsense.org.
Part I | Part II | Part III
This is the first in a series of short articles we plan to write on the current crisis .
Our aim in this series is threefold : to outline some of the important contours of the crisis ; to situate these patterns in historical context ; and to reflect on their possible causes and implications .
Since the crisis is still ongoing , such analysis can only be cursory and suggestive .
But it is nonetheless useful to put our preliminary research and thoughts in writing .
By spelling out what we do know ( or think we know ) about the crisis , we can better identify what we do n’t know and need to ask .
This paper sets the stage for the series .
It outlines the conventional wisdom about the cause of crisis ; it describes the chronology of events ; and it contrasts the pattern and magnitude of the current downturn with those of earlier episodes .
The overall picture painted by this analysis is highly stylized : crises appear to come and go with remarkable regularity , their oscillations are fairly similar and they share the same order of magnitude .
The whole process seems almost “ automatic , ” and automaticity is reassuring : it suggests that the current crisis has run much of its course and that doom and gloom will soon give way to a new upswing .
But what if this automaticity is a mirage ?
The Mismatch
Most observers like to blame the ongoing turbulence in the global political economy on finance — or more precisely , on a mismatch between finance and reality .
The mismatch begins with the assumption that there are two types of capital : “ real ” and “ financial . ”
Real capital is a productive entity , made of machines , structures , work in progress and ( some say ) knowledge .
Financial capital is a symbolic entity , consisting of equity and debt claims on real capital .
In a perfect world , the two types of capital are exactly equal : the dollar value of GE ’s stocks , bonds and other outstanding obligations represents the productive value of the company ’s capital stock , so the two magnitudes must be the same .
The assets and the entitlements to the assets have to match , by definition .
But the world is n’t perfect .
Greed and fear , irrationality and fraud , corruption and manipulation , insufficient competition and too much government , overregulation and excessive deregulation , imperfect information and short - term memory , all conspire to distort the picture .
These distortions cause finance to deviate from its “ fair value , ” either up or down .
And as the deviation grows larger , finance ceases to mirror reality .
It becomes a “ fiction . ”
The current crisis , goes the argument , is the unavoidable consequence of such deviation .
Since the 1980s , we are told , finance has inflated into a huge bubble , having risen far above the underlying stocks of real assets .
But then , whatever goes up must come down .
Since finance , in the final analysis , is merely the image of the real thing , at some point it has to shrink back to its “ true ” size .
And that is exactly what we are now witnessing : a violent financial crisis that dispels the fiction and brings finance down to its “ par value . ”
The Excess Unwound
According to the mismatch thesis , the current turmoil started in the U.S. housing market .
This was the epicenter .
From here the tremor spread like a tidal wave : first to the entire U.S. FIRE sector ( an acronym for “ finance , insurance and real estate ” ) , then to every financial market around the world , and finally to the so - called “ real economy . ”
This domino sequence is listed in Table 1 and illustrated in Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Figure 1 shows the rise and fall of U.S. house prices , along with the expansion and contraction of the FIRE sector .
Prices of homes started to soar in 1997 / 8 .
According to the pundits , the blaze was fuelled by three key actors .
The first was Fed Chairman and Ayn Rand acolyte Alan Greenspan , who lowered interest rates in the belief that “ human nature ” would limit risk taking .
The second were the financial institutions that gladly ignored the risks and went on to offer mortgages to anyone willing to borrow .
And the third were the eyes - wide - shut regulators , who seemed unable to see what was going on even if they cared .
House prices had nowhere to go but up , and within a decade they tripled .
Everyone was bullish .
Home buyers were eager to borrow , convinced that prices would go on rising and that their houses could always be resold at a profit .
The bankers bent over backwards to lend them the money — and then melted the individual mortgages into large pools of asset - backed securities .
And the so - called investment community — including “ high net - worth individuals , ” large corporations , money managers and the banks themselves — lined up to buy tranches of the new “ structured investment vehicles , ” usually without asking too many questions .
And for a while there was little to ask about .
Since house prices were rising , default was n’t an issue .
A home owner who could n’t service his mortgage would have his house repossessed and quickly resold to the next sucker in line , often at a higher price .
And if the parties still felt that there was some residual risk left , they could always offset the hazard with higher interest rates , mortgage insurance and a whole slew of derivatives .
The process seemed so robust that even “ sub - prime ” mortgages , lent to borrowers with little or no income , received a triple - A grading from honest - to - god analysts and fail - proof rating agencies . [ Note 1 ]
By the early 2000s , the real - estate boom went global .
Worldwide , the annual issuance of asset - back securities rose nearly five - fold — from $ 532 billion in 2000 to $ 2.5 trillion in 2006 — with much of the expansion accounted for by mortgage - backed instruments , whose new issues rose from $ 275 billion in 2000 to over $ 2 trillion in 2006 .
In the United States , repackaging reached record levels .
By the early 2000s , over half of all single home mortgages and roughly one third of multifamily home mortgages were melted and resold as securities — up from 10 and 5 % , respectively , in 1980 . [ Note 2 ]
There was simply no way to lose money in this business , and the stock market certainly reflected that belief .
The real - estate boom encouraged many other forms of debt financing , ranging from plain vanilla , to the exotic , to the kinky .
And with U.S. FIRE companies cutting a profit on every deal , the total equity capitalization of their sector nearly quadrupled — from $ 1 trillion in 1997 to $ 3.7 trillion in 2007 .
And then the music stopped .
As Figure 1 shows , in July 2006 , U.S. house prices started to drop .
Initially , investors hung in suspension .
Pretending as if nothing had happened , they continued to buy FIRE stocks , pushing the market even higher .
But the downward spiral in house prices persisted — and then , suddenly , in May 2007 , everyone started rushing for the door .
By September 2008 , house prices were down nearly 25 % relative to their 2006 peak , while U.S. FIRE stocks went into free fall .
In October 2008 , the total market capitalization of the sector was more than 50 % below its May 2007 peak .
The gathering storm did n’t register immediately on the broader stock market .
Figure 2 shows the market capitalization of three broad aggregates — U.S. FIRE equities , all U.S. equities , and all world equities .
The three series are denominated in current $ U.S. and plotted on a logarithmic scale to facilitate comparison . [ Note 3 ]
The data show that , while the U.S. FIRE sector started to drop in May 2007 ( marked by the vertical line in the chart ) , the overall U.S. and global stock markets took another five months before tanking .
However , once the broad reversal started , the downward convergence was swift .
From October 2007 to October 2008 , U.S. listed corporations lost 38 per cent of their market capitalization , while the global market lost 46 percent .
The last to join the downward spiral was the so - called “ real economy . ”
Figure 3 shows the U.S. Composite Index of Coincident Indicators , a weighted average of four indicators that move more or less together with the business cycle . [ Note 4 ]
Although this Composite Index pertains only to the United States , in the current environment of global integration it provides a good proxy for world trends .
The figure presents two manifestations of the index : one is the actual level ; the other is the annual rate of change , calculated by comparing the same month in successive years ( so that the reading for October 2008 denotes the rate of change from October 2007 , etc. ) .
The growth series , plotted at the bottom of the chart , shows that the “ real economy ” started to decelerate at the end of 2006 .
But the actual level of the index , depicted by the top series , peaked at the end of 2007 ( marked by the vertical line in the figure ) and started its month - to - month declines only in early 2008 .
So on the face of it , the world appears to be in the midst of a finance - led crisis , a decline triggered and significantly amplified by the collapse of fictitious capital .
“ The salient feature of the current financial crisis , ” explains George Soros , “ is that it was not caused by some external shock .
...
The crisis was generated by the financial system itself . ” [ Note 5 ]
According to this view , the biggest distortion was in the U.S. housing sector , whose bubble was the largest and first to deflate .
The next victim was the broader financial market , which was also grossly inflated and therefore justly punctured .
And the last to capitulate was the “ real economy , ” whose excesses obviously were more limited yet certainly worthy of a periodic cleanup .
But that is only half the story .
Toward a New Upswing ?
The mismatch thesis tells us that fictitious capital , by its very nature , tends to distort the picture in both directions : it grows by too much in the upswing , only to shrink by too much in the downswing .
And indeed , many experts are already wondering if finance has n’t beendeflated .
Measured against the historical record , the current market collapse certainly is extremely large .
The magnitude of this collapse is contextualized in Figure 4 and Figure 5 , where we show the history of U.S. stock prices since 1820 .
Before examining these charts , though , note that they express stock prices not in actual dollars , but in constant dollars .
The latter measure is computed by dividing actual stock prices ( expressed as an index ) by consumer prices ( also expressed as an index ) .
This computation serves to “ purge ” from the stock market index the effect of inflation ( and occasionally deflation ) .
And once inflation has been expunged , the result represents stock prices denominated in constant dollars — i.e. , in dollars with a “ constant purchasing power . ” [ Note 6 ]
Why is it so important to distinguish between the two measures ?
To answer this question , note that stock prices in actual dollars can always be expressed as the product of two separate magnitudes : ( 1 ) the average price level of all commodities ( in actual dollars ) , and ( 2 ) the ratio between stock prices and the average price level ( which yields a pure number ) .
This decomposition is true by definition :
Now , during periods of inflation or deflation , changes in the average price level ( the first component on the right - hand side of the equation ) , can easily overwhelm changes that are unique to the stock market ( the second component on the right ) .
To illustrate , between 1900 and 2008 , actual stock prices rose 133 - fold .
In terms of our equation , most of this increase was due to inflation : the average price level rose nearly 30 - fold , whereas the ratio of stock prices to the average price level rose less than fivefold .
[ Note 7 ]
Clearly , stock owners are focused primarily on the second component .
At the very minimum , their concern is not to keep up with inflation but to outperform it , and that is why we gauge the long - term performance of the stock market in constant dollars rather than actual ones .
[ Note 8 ]
With this qualification in mind , let us return now to Figure 4 .
The chart shows the stock market index in constant prices , plotted against a logarithmic scale .
The vertical grey bars indicate what we consider to be major bear markets — i.e. , periods during which the stock market suffered protracted declines .
As it turns out , there is no general definition for a bear market — let alone a “ major ” one .
So we ’ve devised our own .
In what follows we define a major bear market as a multiyear period during which stock prices , measured in constant dollars , move on a downtrend , and in which each successive peak is lower than the previous one .
According to this definition , over the past two centuries , the United States experienced six major bear markets .
These periods are listed in Table 2 , along with the cumulative declines in stock prices .
A similar picture emerges from Figure 5 , which measures the annual growth rate of the stock market index ( again , in constant dollars ) .
The thin line in the chart shows the percent variation from year to year .
The thick line smoothes these variations as a 10 - year moving average — meaning that every observation in the series measures the average annual growth rate in the previous ten years .
[ Note 9 ]
The last data points in Figure 5 are for 2008 .
The year - to - year change shows a drop of 40 % — on par with the record declines of 1917 , 1931 , 1937 and 1974 .
Furthermore , as the moving - average series indicates and Figure 4 confirms , this decline was n’t a fluke event , but rather part of a decade - long bear market .
According to the smoothed series , the market peaked in 1998 , with the 10 - year moving average growth rate hovering around 13 % .
From then on , annual growth rates decelerated , and by 2008 pushed the 10 - year moving average down to nearly – 4 % .
To the eyes of a seasoned financier , these magnitudes mean that the crisis may be approaching a bottom .
According to Figure 5 , prior crises were similarly bounded .
Their highest starting point , measured by the 10 - year moving average series , was 13 % ( in 1929 and in 1959 ) , and their lowest trough , measured by the same series , was – 8 % ( in 1920 ) .
The extent of deceleration in growth rates , measured by the peak - to - trough difference of the 10 - year moving average , ranged from a low of 6.5 % ( during in the 1834 - 1842 crisis ) , to a high of 15.5 % ( in 1928 - 1948 ) .
The present crisis , measured by the 10 - year moving average series , has already met or exceeded these extreme values .
It started from a record ceiling of 13.3 % ; its current low is – 3.6 % ; and the extent of its deceleration , computed as the difference between these two values , marks a new record : 16.9 % .
For long - term investors , these numbers indicate that much of the crisis is probably behind them .
And the news gets even better .
According to Figure 4 , historically , each major bear market was followed by a long bull run , and each of those bull runs pushed stocks to a new record high .
These upswings occurred in 1842 –1850 , 1857–1905 , 1920 –1928 , 1948 –1968 and 1981 –1999 , and it is n’t far fetched to think that a new one may soon be brewing .
Given that the present bear market is approaching historical lows , and since previously such bottoms were always followed by major upswings , many forward - looking strategists — from permanent bull Barton Biggs , to Wizard of Omaha Warren Buffet , to doom - and - gloom Martin Wolf — are now advising their followers to fasten their seat belts .
[ Note 10 ]
News from the so - called “ real economy ” is likely to remain very bad and may possibly get worse — but most of the negatives are already “ in the price . ”
And since fictitious capital is notorious for “ overreacting , ” particularly during deep downturns , current stock prices offer a once - in - a - life - time buying opportunity for those prescient enough to see into the next takeoff .
But , then , if the market has bottomed and the upswing is so certain , why is n’t every investor buying ?
Financial Cycles and the Reordering of Society
It is easy to fall for the aesthetic gyrations of the stock market .
Their stylized cycles make them look natural .
They “ revert to mean , ” as Francis Galton would have it .
They oscillate within fairly clear boundaries .
Their ups and downs seem almost automatic ( at least in retrospect ) .
Their regularities are so neat many are tempted to forget David Hume and extrapolate the past into the future .
And here lies the problem .
The long - term cycles of the stock market , no matter how stylized and regular they seem , are not self - generating .
They do n’t just happen on their own .
Each cycle has a reason , and that reason is deeply social and historically unique .
Note that , during the twentieth century , every oscillation from a bear to a bull market was accompanied by a systemic societal transformation :
The crisis of 1905 – 1920 marked the closing of the American Frontier , the shift from robber - baron capitalism to large - scale business enterprise and the beginning of synchronized finance .
The crisis of 1928 – 1948 signaled the end of “ unregulated ” capitalism and the emergence of large governments and the welfare - warfare state .
The crisis of 1968 –1981 marked the closing of the Keynesian era , the resumption of worldwide capital flow and the onset of neoliberal globalization .
Furthermore , none of these transformations were “ in the cards . ”
Most observers in the 1900s did n’t expect managerial capitalism to take hold ; few in the 1920s anticipated the welfare - warfare state ; and not too many in the 1960s predicted neoliberal regulation .
All three transformations involved a complex set of conflicts , their trajectories were all fuzzy , and their outcomes were all but impossible to anticipate .
In other words , underneath the seemingly repetitive long - term patterns of the market lies an open- ended and inherently unpredictable reordering of the entire political economy .
Although past bear markets have always given way to long bull runs , these transitions were never automatic .
Each and every one of them reflected a profound transformation of the underlying social structure .
And in our view , this correspondence still holds .
In order for the current crisis to end and a new upswing to begin , something very big has to happen : the social structure must change .
The precise nature of this transformation — assuming it occurs — is likely to remain opaque until the process is well under way .
But one thing seems clear enough .
A new upswing means the rekindling of accumulation , and if we are to understand what this upswing might entail , we need to go back to the beginning and start from the entity that matters most : capital .
For more on that issue , stay tuned for the next installment in our series .

While walking into a Whole Foods market recently , I was greeted by two Greenpeace recruiters , and we talked about Japanese whaling in the Antarctic and clashes between whalers and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society .
I asked why Greenpeace did not send a boat to the region this season and was told it 's because Australia and New Zealand , which do not approve of disruptive tactics by the two groups , had announced it would not respond to any emergency arising from the clashes .
In an e-mail , John Hocevar , campaign manager for Greenpeace USA , did not confirm this .
He replied : " We are focusing our pressure where it can have the most impact , on the decision makers in Tokyo . "
Hocevar noted that two Japanese - based Greenpeace activists were jailed and facing prison sentences of up to 10 years for their roles " in blowing the whistle on illegal whale meat smuggling . "
In May , Greenpeace posted its version of the story on its website :
" Greenpeace Japan used undercover investigators and the testimony of informers to expose that large amounts of prime cut whale meat were being smuggled from the whaling ship Nisshin Maru disguised as personal baggage , labeled " cardboard " or " salted stuff " and addressed to the private homes of crewmembers .
" Greenpeace activists Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki intercepted one box out of four sent to one address , discovered it contained whale meat valued at up to $ 3,000 , and took it to the Tokyo public prosecutor . "
The two were subsequently arrested and charged with stealing whale meat .
Greenpeace considers them political prisoners .

Chrysler Murdered My Uncle By DEREK WRIGHT
ON SEPTEMBER 22 , 2007 , the Chrysler Corporation murdered my uncle , Jon Kelley Wright .
After working over twenty - two years at the die casting plant in Kokomo , Indiana , he was crushed to death by the machine he operated in a gruesome but utterly preventable workspace disaster .
Widely heralded as “ the safest operator in that plant ” by his coworkers , Kelley had long been an outspoken critic of management ’s dangerous practices and an advocate for safety on the job .
Early in 2007 , my uncle and some of his coworkers demanded meetings with management about the terrible condition of the safety equipment on their die casting machines .
Management said that it was n’t “ cost effective ” to fix the problems .
Since management knew about the faulty safety equipment for months , and the company refused to fix it , I ’ve stopped referring to my uncle ’s death as a workspace “ accident . ”
Kelley produced transmission cases for Chrysler vehicles .
The die casting plant where he worked is a loud and dangerous place .
The ceiling of the building is a network of rails where giant crucibles of molten aluminum fly overhead to replenish the enormous die casting machines .
I ’ll never forget how my uncle told me that on his first week on the job , one of these crucibles was derailed and fell to the ground , crushing and incinerating one of the workers .
It ’s no wonder that Kelley was so concerned with workplace safety .
The die casting machines for transmission cases are huge , and these days , they ’re mostly automated .
A series of sensors signal a computer with the exact state of the machine , whether the last part has been properly ejected , whether it ’s ready to cast another part , and so on .
The job of a die cast operator in today ’s auto - parts industry mostly involves watching the machine to make sure it keeps working , and to debug any problems that might arise .
For the large parts such as transmission cases debugging a problem or making an adjustment often involves opening up the machine and walking inside .
One of the sensors on the machine notices when the door is open and completely shuts down everything else .
When the door is open , it is supposed to be impossible for the machine to function .
For months in the Kokomo plant , these sensors had been malfunctioning .
At least the sensor was designed to “ fail safe , ” meaning that when it was n’t working , it told the computer the door was open ( and therefore , the machine was disabled ) even when the door was closed .
Early in the morning on September 22 , my uncle ’s machine apparently froze up .
The computer claimed that the part that had just been cast was n’t properly ejected .
As usual , Kelley opened up the machine and went inside to pull the part and adjust the pneumatic pins that are supposed to eject the transmission cases after they cool off .
Apparently , it ’s common for these pins to get out of alignment , since they ’re just screwed into place ( one of my uncle ’s coworkers later told me that the pins would n’t malfunction so often if Chrysler stopped cutting corners and just welded them into position instead of relying on the cheaper but weaker screws ) .
However , even though the door was still wide open , as soon as Kelley got the pins adjusted , the machine fired another part with my uncle still inside .
Every one of Kelley ’s coworkers who came to the funeral said that he was probably the safest operator in the plant , and one of the most outspoken about health and safety issues .
None of them can believe that he did something stupid or careless to put himself in harm ’s way .
When they got to the machine and opened it up to find my uncle ’s remains , they looked over the whole machine and discovered that someone had put a glove over the sensor that was supposed to see if the door was open , rendering the sensor useless ( such that it always thought the door was closed ) .
No one knows where this glove came from .
Some of his coworkers said that management had removed the glove before Occupational Health and Safety Administration ( OSHA ) arrived .
Many things about the situation remain a mystery , and will probably never be known .
Two things , however , are certain .
First , there ’s no way Kelley knew that glove was there , or he never would have gone inside the machine .
Second , that glove would never have been there if Chrysler replaced the faulty sensors as soon as workers in the plant reported the problems .
Chrysler ’s immediate response to the incident was to shut down the whole plant for 24 hours .
According to [ my uncle ’s ] coworkers , this shutdown served two purposes : to clean up the place before OSHA arrived , and to allow OSHA to begin its official investigation .
The next day , Chrysler brought in some “ grief counselors ” to talk to the other workers on the line and convince them to get back to work .
The coworkers were furious ( and still grieving the loss ) and basically told these counselors they had no idea what they were talking about .
Then , one of the workers on the line stood up and said “ if you do n’t feel like you ’re ready to safely operate these machines again right now , go home , ” and the entire shift left the plant , most of them going out for breakfast together to continue talking and grieving .
Some of the newspaper stories about the “ accident ” reported that production was halted for two days , but the second day was a voluntary shutdown by Kelley ’s coworkers .
At some point during these two days , Chrysler went through the plant and finally fixed or replaced the door sensors on the die casting machines , though it ’s unclear if that was before or after OSHA came through .
My uncle ’s funeral was heart wrenching , inspiring , and enraging .
When the immediate family first arrived at the funeral home , we were overwhelmed with all the flowers that people had sent .
The funeral director said they had never had so many flowers for someone .
However , as we read through all the cards , we came upon one modest bouquet right next to the coffin that pushed me from grief mixed with joy into rage .
The card read “ Our condolences to the family of the deceased employee — Chrysler LLC ” .
They could n’t even be bothered to put his name there ?
And how dare they sign it “ LLC ” to remind us of their “ limited liability corporation ” status ?
After quickly polling the rest of my family on their feelings , they agreed to let me do something about it , so I promptly removed Chrysler ’s “ condolences ” from the room , and we moved around some other bouquets to give more prominent display to the ones from our cousins and the UAW local my uncle belonged to .
Once the guests started arriving , it was incredible to hear story after story about how much Kelley was loved and respected in the plant .
One story in particular stuck with me , since I had heard similar ones from my uncle before he was killed .
Kelley loved to fish , and he loved a good fish fry .
At least once a year , usually after a successful fishing trip with some of his coworkers , he ’d bring a giant outdoor fryer and a few big bags of fish fillets into work .
The person on the machine next to his would watch his machine all night , and Kelley would spend most of the shift frying fish for his coworkers .
They ’d just spread out newspapers on the floor of the plant , as if it was a picnic .
Something about the image of my uncle frying fish all night for his coworkers really touched me .
In the midst of an incredibly loud , dirty , dangerous , inhumane place , here was Kelley , trying to give it some humanity .
I love him for that , and it was clear from everyone who came to the funeral that they do , too .
Since the funeral , I ’ve learned more than I ever wanted to know about the inner workings of a company like Chrysler .
First of all , it ’s company policy to pay for the funeral services of workers they ’ve killed .
Furthermore , at least in Indiana , they ’ve set up a scholarship fund for the children of killed workers to attend college — so long as they go to one of the public Indiana schools .
They ’re obviously trying to blunt the worst of the anger — there ’d probably be rebellion if the families had to pay the bills for these funerals .
I have to assume that the scholarship fund works as a tax shelter for the company , in addition to providing whatever PR benefits they can get out of it .
I learned that my aunt is eligible to collect 500 weeks of workers ’ compensation payments at a percentage of my uncle ’s paycheck at the time he was killed .
However , signing the form to start collecting payments would absolve Chrysler of any legal liability regarding Kelley ’s death .
It also seems that management has gone on the offensive in terms of intimidating the other workers in the plant .
Before and during the funeral , coworker after coworker expressed their rage , and proudly asserted their willingness to testify to the facts of the case and the events of the previous several months .
When our family ’s lawyer approached them to do exactly that , not a single coworker was willing — all had been frightened off by the fear of losing their jobs .
Apparently , Chrysler has figured out how much it costs to kill one of their workers , and decided that , in the infamous words of Bill Clinton ’s former Secretary of State Madeline Albright , “ the price , we think , is worth it . ”
As painful as this experience has been , it is not unique .
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , 5,840 people were killed on the job in 2006 .
That ’s sixteen people a day .
If there was a gang murdering sixteen people a day , even for a few days , that would be headline news around the country .
But this group of corporate killers goes on killing , day after day , year after year .
At most the individual cases make the local news ( rarely as headlines ) .
This lethal gang is composed of the managers and bureaucrats making the cold calculation that it is cheaper and more profitable to set up scholarship funds for the children of murdered workers and , when forced , to pay out small settlements than it is to operate a plant with enough safety precautions that no one would be killed on the job .
Instead of doing jail time for their murderous computations , these people get bonuses and promotions .
My uncle ’s early and preventable death has been a tragic loss for our family , his coworkers , and all who knew him .
Kelley named me as the beneficiary on one of his modest life insurance policies , and to turn some of my grief and anger into positive action , I have decided to use the money to endow the Jon Kelley Wright Workers ’ Memorial Fund through the Center for Economic Research and Social Change .
This fund will allow Haymarket Books to publish an annual series of books about the labor movement and other struggles of working people to change the world .
The first title in the series is Labor Wars by Sidney Lens .
I hope that the Jon Kelley Wright Workers ’ Memorial Book Series will inspire others to dedicate their lives to the struggle for a world where safety on the job is more important than profits , and that it will help keep the memory of my beloved uncle alive .
So , we ’re inviting anyone else who has lost someone they love in a workplace disaster to memorialize their loved one through this book series , and we ’ll print all of the names on the dedication page of each book .

On Friday , the FDIC closed and facilitated the sale of two CA savings banks , Downey Savings and Loan , the bank unit of Downey Financial Corp ( NYSE : DSL ) and PFF Bank and Trust , Pomona , CA .
All deposit accounts and all loans of both banks have been transferred to U.S. Bank , NA , lead bank unit of US Bancorp ( NYSE : USB ) .
All former Downey and PFF Bank branches reopen for business today as branches of U.S. Bank .
Earlier this year we wrote positively about Downey and the funding advantages it had over larger thrifts such as Washington Mutual due to the solid deposit base and strong capital .
Indeed , as of Q3 2008 , the bank ’s Tier One leverage ratio was over 7.5 % , more than two points over the minimum , and its charge offs had actually fallen compared with the gruesome 400 basis points of default reported in the previous period .
But since the September resolution of WaMu and Wachovia , the FDIC , it seems , is not willing to wait to resolve institutions , even banks that are apparently solvent and not below any of the traditional regulatory triggers for closure .
The visible public metrics indicating soundness did not dissuade the Office of Thrift Supervision and FDIC from seizing both banks and selling them to USB .
The purchase of Downey and PFF is good news for the depositors and borrowers , who will all be offered the FDIC ’s prepackaged IndyMac mortgage modification program as a condition of the USB acquisition .
Bad news for the investors and creditors , who now see their already impaired investments wiped out .
The resolution of Downey illustrates both the best and the worst aspects of the government ’s remediation efforts .
On the one hand , we have argued that the government should be pushing bad banks into the arms of stronger banks to improve the overall condition of the system .
The good people at the FDIC do that very well – when politics does not intervene .
In the case of Downey and PFF , it appears that the OTS and FDIC projected forward from the current above - peer loss rates and concluded that a prompt resolution was required .
Reasonable people can argue whether this is the right call .
But when we see the equity and debt holders of DSL , Washington Mutual or Lehman Brothers taking a total loss , we have to ask a basic question : why is it that the debt holders of Bear Stearns and AIG ( NYSE : AIG ) are granted salvation by the Federal Reserve Board and the US Treasury , but other investors are not ?
If the rule of driving money to the strong banks ( see “ View from the Top : A Prime Solution to the US Banking Crisis ” ) safety and soundness is to be effective , it must be applied to all .
And now you know why we have questions about the nomination of Tim Geithner to be the next Treasury Secretary .
If you look at how the Fed and Treasury have handled the bailouts of Bear Stearns and AIG , a reasonable conclusion might be that the Paulson / Geithner model of political economy is rule by plutocrat .
Facilitate a Fed bailout of the speculative elements of the financial world and their sponsors among the larger derivatives dealer banks , but leave the real economy to deal with the crisis via bankruptcy and liquidation .
Thus Lehman , WaMu , Wachovia and Downey shareholders and creditors get the axe , but the bondholders and institutional counterparties of Bear and AIG do not .
Few observers outside Wall Street understand that the hundreds of billions of dollars pumped into AIG by the Fed of NY and Treasury , funds used to keep the creditors from a default , has been used to fund the payout at face value of credit default swap contracts or “ CDS , ” insurance written by AIG against senior traunches of collateralized debt obligations or “ CDOs . ”
The Paulson / Geithner model for dealing with troubled financial institutions such as AIG with net unfunded obligations to pay CDS contracts seems to be to simply provide the needed liquidity and hope for the best .
Fed and AIG officials have even been attempting to purchase the CDOs insured by AIG in an attempt to tear up the CDS contracts .
But these efforts only focus on a small part of AIG ’s CDS book .
The Paulson / Geithner bailout model as manifest by the AIG situation is untenable and illustrates why President - elect Obama badly needs a new face at Treasury .
A face with real financial credentials , somebody like Fannie Mae CEO Herb Allison .
A banker with real world transactional experience , somebody who will know precisely how to deal with the last bubble that needs to be lanced – CDS .
Last Thursday , we gave a presentation to the New York Chapter of the Risk Management Association regarding the US banking sector and the long - term issues facing same .
You can read a copy of the slides by clicking here .
As part of the presentation ( Page 17 - 21 ) , IRA co-founder Chris Whalen argued the case made by a reader of The IRA a week before ( see “ New Hope for Financial Economics : Interview with Bill Janeway , ” ) that until we rid the markets of CDS , there will be no restoring investor confidence in financial institutions .
Here is how we presented the situation to about 200 finance and risk professionals in the auditorium of JPM last week .
Of note , nobody in the audience argued .
1 ) Start with the $ 50 trillion or so in extant CDS .
2 ) Assume that as default rates for all types of collateral rise over next 24 - 36 months , 40 % of the $ 50 trillion in CDS goes into the money .
That is $ 20 trillion gross notional of CDS which must be funded .
3 ) Now assume a 25 % recovery rate against that portion of all CDS that goes into the money .
4 ) That leaves you with a $ 15 trillion net amount that must be paid by providers of protection in CDS .
And remember , a 40 % in the money assumption for CDS is VERY conservative .
The rise in loss rates for all type of collateral over the next 24 months could easily make the portion of CDS in the money grow to more like 60 - 70 % .
That is $ 40 plus trillion in notional payments vs. a recovery rate in single digits .
Q : Does anybody really believe that the global central banks and the politicians that stand behind them are going to provide the liquidity to fund $ 15 trillion or more in CDS payouts ?
Remember , only a small portion of these positions are actually hedging exposure in the form of the underlying securities .
The rest are speculative , in some cases 10 , 20 of 30 times the underlying basis .
Yet the position taken by Treasury Secretary Paulson and implemented by Tim Geithner ( and the Fed Board in Washington , to be fair ) is that these leveraged wagers should be paid in full .
Our answer to this cowardly view is that AIG needs to be put into bankruptcy .
As we wrote on TheBigPicture over the weekend , we ’ll take our queue from NY State Insurance Commissioner Eric Dinalo and stipulate that we pay true hedge positions at face value , but the specs get pennies on the dollar of the face of CDS .
And the specs should take the pennies gratefully and run before the crowd of angry citizens with the torches and pitchforks catch up to them .
President - elect Obama and the American people have a choice : embrace financial sanity and safety and soundness by deflating the last , biggest speculative bubble using the time - tested mechanism of insolvency .
Or we can muddle along for the next decade or more , using the Paulson / Geithner model of financial rescue for the AIG CDS Ponzi scheme and embrace the Japanese model of economic stagnation .
And , yes , we can put AIG and the other providers of protection through a bankruptcy and force the CDS market into a quick and final extinction .
Remember , when AIG goes bankrupt the insurance units are taken over by NY , WI and put into statutory receiverships .
Only the rancid CDS positions and financial engineering unit of AIG end up in bankruptcy .
And fortunately we have a fine example of just how to do it in the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
Our friends at Katten Muchin Rosenman in Chicago wrote last week in their excellent Client Advisory : “ On November 13 , 2008 , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its U.S. affiliates in bankruptcy , including Lehman Brothers Special Financing and Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper ( collectively , “ Lehman ” ) filed a motion asking that certain expedited procedures be put in place to allow Lehman to assume , assign or terminate the thousands of executory derivative contracts to which they are a party .
If Lehman ’s motion is granted , counterparties to transactions that have not been terminated will have very little time to react and will likely find themselves with new counterparties and no further recourse to Lehman because , by assigning contracts to third parties , Lehman will effectively receive , by normal operation of the Bankruptcy Code , a novation . ”
The bankruptcy court process also allows for parties to terminate or “ rip up ” CDS contracts , something that has also been fully enabled by the DTCC .
The bankruptcy can dispose and the DTCC will confirm .
BTW , while you folks in the Big Media churned out hundreds of thousands of words last week waxing euphoric about the prospect for enhanced back office clearing of CDS contracts , the real issue is the festering credit situation in the front office .
Truth is that the DTCC and the other dealers , working at the behest of Mr. Geithner , Gerry Corrigan and many others , have largely fixed the operational issues dogging the CDS markets .
The danger of CDS is not a systemic blowup – though that will come soon enough .
It is the normal operation of the now electronically enabled CDS market wherein lies the threat to the entire global financial system , this via the huge drain in liquidity illustrated above as CDS contracts are triggered by default events .
The only way to deal with this ridiculous Ponzi scheme is bankruptcy .
The way to start that healing process , in our view , is by the Fed emulating the FDIC ’s treatment of DSL , withdrawing financial support for AIG and pushing the company into the arms of the bankruptcy court .
The eager buyers for the AIG insurance units , cleansed of liability via a receivership , will stretch around the block .
By embracing Geithner , President - elect Barack Obama is endorsing the ill - advised scheme to support AIG directed by Hank Paulson et al at Goldman Sachs and executed by Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke .
News reports have already documented the ties between GS and AIG , and the backroom machinations by Paulson to get the deal done .
This scheme to stay AIG ’s resolution cannot possibly work and when it does collapse , Barak Obama and his administration will wear the blame due through their endorsement of Tim Geithner .
The bailout of AIG represents the last desperate rearguard action by the CDS dealers and the happy squirrels at ISDA , the keepers of the flame of Wall Street financial engineering .
Hopefully somebody will pull President - elect Obama aside and give him the facts on this mess before reality bites us all in the collective arse with , say , a bankruptcy filing by GM ( NYSE: GM ) .
You see , there are trillions of dollars in outstanding CDS contracts for the Big Three automakers , their suppliers and financing vehicles .
A filing by GM is not only going to put the real economy into cardiac arrest but will also start a chain reaction meltdown in the CDS markets as other automakers , vendors and finance units like GMAC are also sucked into the quicksand of bankruptcy .
You knew when the vendor insurers pulled back from GM a few weeks ago that the jig was up .
And many of these CDS contracts were written two , three and four years ago , at annual spreads and upfront fees far smaller than the 90 plus percent payouts that will likely be required upon a GM default .
That ’s the dirty little secret we peripherally discussed in our interview last week with Bill Janeway , namely that most of these CDS contracts were never priced correctly to reflect the true probability of default .
In a true insurance market with capital and reserve requirements , the spreads on CDS would be multiples of those demanded today for such highly correlated risks .
Or to put it in fair value accounting terms , pricing CDS vs. the current yield on the underlying basis is a fool ’s game .
Truth is not beauty , price is not value .
If you assume a recovery value of say 20 % against all of the CDS tied to the auto industry , directly and indirectly , that is a really big number .
The spreads on GM today suggest recovery rates in single digits , making the potential cash payout on the CDS even larger .
As Bloomberg News reported in August : “ A default by one of the automakers would trigger writedowns and losses in the $ 1.2 trillion market for collateralized debt obligations that pool derivatives linked to corporate debt …
Credit - default swaps on GM and Ford were included in more than 80 percent of CDOs created before they lost their investment - grade debt rankings in 2005 , according to data compiled by Standard & Poor’s . ”
At some point , Washington is going to be forced to accept that bankruptcy and liquidation , the harsh medicine used with other financial insolvencies , are the best ways to deal with the last , greatest bubble , namely the CDS market .
When the end comes , it will effect some of the largest financial institutions in the world , chief among them Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) , JPMorganChase ( NYSE : JPM ) , GS and MS , as well as some large Euroland banks .
The impending blowback from a CDS unwind at less than face amount is one of the reasons that the financial markets have been pummeling the equity values of the larger banks last week .
Any bank with a large derivatives trading book is likely to be mortally wounded as the CDS markets finally collapse .
We do n’t see problems with interest rate or currency contracts , by the way , only the great CDS Ponzi scheme is at issue – hopefully , if authorities around the world act with purpose on rendering extinct CDS contracts as they exist today .
Call it a Christmas present to the entire world .
Indeed , as this issue of The IRA goes to press , news reports indicate that C is in talks with the Treasury for further financial support under the TARP , including a “ bad bank ” option to offload assets .
[ EDITOR : Already approved by Treasury and the Fed ] .
A bad bank approach may be a good model for applying the principle of receivership to the too - big - too fail mega institutions , but the cost is government control of these banks .
Q : Does a “ bad bank ” bailout for C by Treasury and FDIC qualify as a default under the ISDA protocols !?
We ’ve been predicting that Treasury will eventually be in charge of C .
On the day the government formally takes control , we say that Treasury should and hire FDIC to start selling branches and assets .
Thus does the liquidation continue and we get closer to the bottom of the great unwind .
Stay tuned .

Question : Christmas themed or not ? ”
“ Jeffrey SIGMA PHI drank too many jag shots last night and is wondering if he ’s a terrible person . ”
These are just the type of stream - of - thought dilemmas that used to make up a vast majority of non-sequitur , slightly neurotic prayers .
Now , instead of being broadcast straight to the omniscient mind of the Almighty , they ’re simply typed into Twitter and sent into what Twitter calls “ the public timeline . ”
“ I think I used to pray because I felt unsure , ” says housewife Sandy McMartin .
“ Even silly little choices , like what kind of juice to drink in the morning … you never know , so I would just ask our Lord .
Of course , he never really answered , so I just usually chose the one that my heart said was right — or the one with the most fiber . ”
Taylor Thompson , a 13 - year - old girl , phrases it more casually , “ Praying used to be kind of like rubbing a lucky marble , or bringing a problem to a magic eight - ball .
I was taught to pray as often as I could , but … to be honest … I can get a reply almost instantly right on my Twitterberry app . ”
God first noticed the lack in pointless prayers about six months ago .
Suddenly , he says , “ I just was n’t hearing as much about Patty from Nestle Creek ’s hedonistic neighbors , or Susan O’Reilly ’s challenges at planting a perennial garden .
By now , I ’m almost completely out of the loop with how people ’s diets are going and their reflections on ‘ American Idol . ’
I even need to read 17 - year - old Kaitlynn Peterson ’s Twitter just to see what her student council is working on .
It ’s certainly a new era for me .
Throughout all eternity , I ’ve never seen anything like this . ”
God himself cannot get a Twitterberry application or download one of the various applications the iPhone offers mobile users .
“ It ’s a space - time continuum thing , ” He tried to explain , “ wireless Internet is a no - go when you ’re outside of time .
We have to use dial - up . ”
While the creator of the universe does experience some anxiety at the threat posed to praying by instantly accessible social networking , he has found some benefit .
“ Atheists , ” he exclaimed , “ have some juicy thoughts !
I can usually only get access to their consciousness stream when they ’re , you know ‘ in a foxhole , ’ but when they ’re just out on the town , they can be quite witty . ”
Right now ,
God says he ’s trying to decipher Neil Gaiman ’s Twitter , but he just ca n’t follow all the “ @’s , ” and statements like , “ Global cupcakes for all = logistic problems . ”
Outside of broadcasting their thoughts at any given time , Twitter has also become a means of free advertising on the Internet , wherein users can direct followers straight to new web content .
Where that trend will lead remains ambiguous , but as God points out , “ Constant self - promotion became passé after the crusades . ”
God , who has been in the habit of keeping a low profile for the last two millennia , has no plans of getting his own Twitter , but notes that if he did , his username would be strictly guarded .
“ Just keep in mind , ” he warned , “ I ’m watching you ! ”
The Australian government 's plan to censor the entire Internet hit another major snag this week after two of the country 's largest ISPs , Telstra and InterNode , announced they would not participate in the government 's proposed filtering tests .
Many of the ISPs in Australia , in fact , are either refusing to join the test , joining it only to prove it wo n't work ( iiNet ) , or only testing a scaled - down version of what 's intended to be the final model ( Optus ) .
We 've covered the numerous flaws in Australia 's plan in some detail , and the ISPs are citing some of the same issues as reasons for why the plan wo n't work .
At present , the government is planning a two - tier system .
The first tier ( compulsory for all Australians ) would block all " illegal " material ( as deemed such by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
The content blacklist is not to exceed 10,000 URLs , but when the ISP Optus begins actually testing the first tier next year , it will be working with a cut - down list of 1,300 rather than the expanded list of 10,000 .
The second tier of censorship filtering is meant to be an opt - out system that will block both the illegal content and " content deemed inappropriate for children . "
Said content will again be deemed appropriate or inappropriate by ACMA .
The government seems to be completely out of touch with the technological requirements and logistical flaws of its own plan .
Filtering for just the first tier of this plan is problematic enough — clearly the ISPs think so — but filtering all Internet traffic for those on the second tier of the plan will consume a disproportionate amount of ISP resources for a small group of customers .
Deep packet inspection ( DPI for short ) does n't just require additional processing resources and expensive equipment , it creates latency problems that are n't easy to address .
Adding more bandwidth to the the network , in this case , does nothing to increase performance and might actually retard it ; more incoming packets means still more data that must be inspected and properly routed .
Faster DPI equipment can theoretically speed the process , but the window in which such inspection can take place without impacting the end user 's experience is small .
According to The Age , Communication Minister Stephen Conroy 's office is long on rhetoric but a bit dicey on the actual facts .
The minister himself has apparently written to critics and told them that the upcoming tests would be " live trials over a closed network test that will not involve actual customers , " but has neglected to explain how one performs a live test without deploying the service to a group of customers .
The government 's plans are opposed by a coalition of non-majority Australian parties , the aforementioned ISPs , and anti-censorship protesters .
The recent flurry of negative publicity surrounding the Internet Watch Foundation 's decision to block Wikipedia based on a single image ( since retracted ) wo n't do anything to help the government 's plan , either .
To date , Senator Conroy maintains that the government 's filtering system will use the same IWF blacklist as Britain , opening the country to the same sorts of filtration issues .

Designer Abhinav
Dapke has come up with a green lighting concept that appears to be modeled on the easy old - school chore of taking out the laundry to be dried by the sun .
His Go Rack design centers around a combo cloth that is layered with flexible OLED displays , solar cells , and a textured , safety plastic .
A person simply takes out the light ' ironing board / clothes rack ' body outside , unspools the legs , and places the backside of the cloth ( the solar cells ) in an optimal angle to receive sunlight .
In order to let a user know the power charge level , a small time indicator is also embedded on the side of this cloth .
Once the panel is full , the body is once again erected , the cloth is folded in ( exposing only the plastic ) and the aluminum legs are used to conduct energy , once connected to a base inside a home .
Presumably , you can then use the regulator switch to modulate the level of illumination .
The brightness of the light , if and when this concept is ever brought to light , will depend on the materials chosen for the plastic .
I like this idea mainly because it's a simple , probably cheap way to bring solar light into the home without re-building the whole structure of a house .
But there are potential problems .
The single Go Rack wo n't be enough to provide enough lighting for a whole house .
Also , the body of the rack needs to be engineered with enough safety features that transferring the aluminum legs after days left out in the sun can't lead to scalding injuries , and the OLED layers need to be durable enough to withstand the constant folding .
Still , it 's a quality concept that we'd love to check in action in the next few years .

for casual readers of business coverage — that is , most of us — the past 18 months have been a crash course in things we never knew existed but that , we are told , have already done us all irreparable harm .
Not only are the problems catastrophic , goes the somewhat frustrating message , but it is already too late to do anything about them — other , that is , than pay for them .
In looking back on how we got here , the business press assumes a tone of rueful omniscience , as in this late - 2007 New York Times piece on regulatory laxity under Alan Greenspan : “ Had officials bothered to look , frightening clues of the coming crisis were available . ”
Of course , the clues the Times cites in the very next sentence — the ceaseless research of the North Carolina - based Center for Responsible Lending — were available had anyone bothered to look .
So , a reader might well ask , why did n’t the media ?
I worked as a Wall Street Journal staff writer for eight years ending in December 2004 and now critique the business media full time at the Columbia Journalism Review .
I ’ll attest that business journalists as a rule are as smart , sophisticated , and plugged - in as they seem .
And yet that army of professional business reporters — an estimated 9,000 or so nationwide in print alone — for all practical purposes missed the biggest story on the beat .
Why ?
In October , Howard Kurtz , the Washington Post media critic , rounded up the opinions of a few practitioners .
Some bravely took the blame ( “ We all failed , ” ventured cnbc ‘s Charlie Gasparino ) , but the majority chose to blame the audience : “ If we had written stories in late 2000 saying this whole thing ’s going to collapse , ” said Fortune managing editor Andy Serwer , “ people would have said , ‘ Ha ha , maybe , ’ and gone about their business . ”
Ditto Marcus Brauchli , a top Wall Street Journal editor during the bubble before taking over last July as executive editor of the Washington Post : “ I regret that when I was at the Journal , we did n’t keep the focus on some of these questions , including the possible moral hazard posed by the structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These are really difficult issues to convey to a popular audience . ”
There was a handful of heroes at the major publications who tried to get the word out .
But the good , hard - hitting , arm ’s - length stories will have to be compared to what else was gushing out of the 30 - inch business - news drainpipe — those Citigroup earnings stories , those edgy - yet - flattering profiles of Merrill Lynch ’s Stan O’Neal , Lehman Brothers ’ Dick Fuld , et al. , the pieces noting how Countrywide Financial ’s Angelo Mozilo liked to dress well , etc. , not to mention the Home Depot marketing stories , the personal finance columns , and all the cheerleading and Flip That House fluff that diverted resources from the real task at hand .
What was really the business - press message ?
It was certainly not that mortgage lenders and Wall Street had linked up to flood the market with defective products .
it is true , though , that the circumstances conspired to make the press ’ job harder — much harder — than usual .
Consider , first , the industry ’s own failing financial health .
In 1998 , the New York Times Company ’s newspaper segment generated profit margins of 24 percent — about the sector ’s average then — according to John Morton , a leading industry analyst .
The comparable figure for the first half of 2008 is 8.5 percent .
This so - called margin compression affects the newspaper industry generally , extends to the magazine business , and has led to a collapse in stock prices across the board .
The Times Company traded for $ 50 a share as recently as 2002 .
Today , it ’s around $ 10 and still considered a “ sell ” by some analysts .
Its market capitalization — stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding — is $ 1.5 billion , half of which is its stake in its new Eighth Avenue headquarters .
The value the market places on its prospects is basically zero .
The demise of the mainstream media , especially newspapers , has been forecast for decades , but the years following the tech wreck of 2000 — the period of the housing bubble — opened a new , defining chapter .
The most shocking plunge in values came , Morton says , around mid-2007 , just about the time the credit crisis burst into full view .
For instance , the market capitalization of the Journal Register Company , publisher of the New Haven Register and hundreds of smaller papers , has fallen more than 99 percent since the start of 2007 — long before , it ’s worth remembering , the credit crisis made business flameouts commonplace .
In newspapering , it was the business model itself that fell apart .
Around the same time , the drip of newsroom cuts became a deluge — in all , newspapers lost 13,000 jobs last year — and business news has n’t been spared .
Chris Roush , director of the Carolina Business News Initiative at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill , estimates that the number of print business reporters around the country has fallen 25 percent since 2000 , to 9,000 .
Business pages of major regional papers have been especially hard - hit : Since 2004 , the Washington Post business staff has lost 30 of its top reporters .
The Los Angeles Times has lost at least 15 , leaving it with a total of around 50 .
Yes , we ’ve seen the launch of a brand - new TV news channel , Fox Business News — but that ’s just another competitor chasing the same shrinking advertising market .
And in any case , no one should be under the illusion that TV business news , with its gaze narrowly focused on the gyrations of the stock market concerns , could ever have offered the kind of long - term warnings that would have saved its viewers ’ nest eggs .
Newspapers were supposed to be different .
When I arrived at the Journal as a staff writer in the law group , in 1996 , Dow Jones ’ & Co. ’s market cap was more than $ 4 billion .
That was back when the paper had a law group , and a Philadelphia bureau , a Pittsburgh bureau , and several Canadian bureaus .
It also used to have a cafeteria and a guy who pushed a coffee cart around the floor twice a day .
Dow Jones was never a corporate giant , but it was a big , sturdy company , about the same size as many of the Wall Street firms it covered .
( Morgan Stanley was about a $ 5 billion company in the mid-1990s . )
You can argue that size does n’t matter ; all I can say is that it made for a confident , freewheeling environment , where the staff was encouraged to take a chance once in a while , maybe even think big .
A Journal reporter had swagger .
Penelope Muse Abernathy , a Journal executive until 2006 and now a professor of media economics at Chapel Hill , says the late - 1990s economic expansion fed a virtuous cycle in which profits funded good journalism that would attract more readers and profit .
“ If you were a business reporter , these were the gravy train days , ” she says .
Indeed .
I rode in black cars , lunched at all the places you read about , and more than once flew across the country to report a 1,200 - word story .
Every year , Dow Jones dropped an amount equivalent to 15 percent of my gross pay into a pension account , just like that .
When I picked up the Journal on my doorstep in the late 1990s , the Monday edition was the size of the Brooklyn phone book .
But not for long .
Dow Jones made particular strategic missteps that need not trouble us here , but those merely left it somewhat more unprepared than other media companies when the tech meltdown ushered in a severe advertising recession , one made permanent by the rise of the Internet .
By the time I left at the end of 2004 , the newsroom had gone through at least three rounds of layoffs , all white - knuckle , morale - crushing affairs .
Benefits were cut to the point that the once - gung - ho staff took to picketing around a giant inflatable rat .
Office politics became Byzantine , and productivity demands on the newsroom — more , faster — grew ever more pronounced .
Time - consuming investigations were undertaken at the reporter ’s own risk :
If a lead did n’t pan out — no matter why — it hit your productivity numbers , putting your career in peril .
This was n’t subtle stuff .
The paper , despite occasional bright spots , became rote , formulaic , dull .
The Journal ‘s weakened condition , financially and journalistically , cleared the way for Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation to buy it in 2007 .
Since then , the new owner ’s experimentation — more political news , cutting back the copy desk , revamping sections — has not helped the journalism .
The paper has done some fine work , but in no sense did it dominate the crisis story as the Journal dominated core financial stories in the past .
The disintegration of the financial media ’s own financial underpinnings could not have come at a worse time .
Low morale , lost expertise , and constant cutbacks , especially in investigative reporting — these are not conditions that produce an appetite for confrontation and muckraking .
In 2002 , the Times ‘ Gretchen Morgenson won a Pulitzer for beat reporting on Wall Street , beating single - handedly , in the view of some , the entire Journal staff .
Jesse Eisinger , a former financial columnist for the Journal and now a senior writer for Portfolio , says the paper , like business journalism generally , clung to outdated formulas .
Wall Street coverage tilted toward personality - driven stories , not deconstructing balance sheets or figuring out risks .
Stocks were the focus , when the problems were brewing in derivatives .
“ We were following the old model , ” he says .
but it was n’t just the media abdicating their watchdog role :
Just as financial news outlets were weakening , regulators were also abandoning the field , leaving business reporters starved of the investigative leads they rely on .
Back in the 1980s , a great deal of tough Wall Street coverage was driven by the aggressive work of prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( sec ) .
But then came the Clinton - era push toward deregulation that reached its extremes during the Bush administration as the federal government unceremoniously pulled the finance cops off the beat .
For a time , Eliot Spitzer filled the void with his aggressive prosecution of Wall Street misdeeds , but for the most part , covering financial corruption without regulators was like trying to clap with one hand .
Take the Federal Trade Commission .
In 2002 , the agency announced a then - record $ 240 million predatory lending settlement involving Citigroup ’s giant subprime units , and covering no fewer than 2 million customers .
Since then the ftc has brought no major consumer lending cases .
Zero .
The last such case brought by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , against Providian National Bank , came in 2000 .
The haplessness of the sec under Chairman Christopher Cox is now widely recognized as a major contributor to the collapse .
But the commission ’s passivity also hamstrung Wall Street reporters :
It is worth remembering that prior to the Enron , WorldCom , Adelphia , and Tyco scandals earlier this decade , the sec had already opened formal investigations into each doomed company — forcing disclosures that tipped off investors , yes , but also providing road maps and official cover to the financial press .
( The problems at Enron , a special case , were first uncovered by a short seller , who tipped off reporters . )
Contrast that with the most recent disasters : Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , aig , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac had all collapsed before the sec had even launched an investigation .
The spectacle of Lehman employees carrying out boxes of records — on television ! — was too much for Jonathan Weil , a Bloomberg columnist who is known for breaking an early Enron story in 2000 while at the Journal .
In a column last September , he wrote “ Is there anybody left in the government with a pulse ?
Where ’s the yellow police tape ?
How about a cease - and - desist order to prevent document destruction ?
Can anyone give me a good reason why Lehman offices should n’t be treated as a crime scene now ? ”
But the regulatory absence only goes so far as an excuse for the press , says Michael Hudson , who began reporting on subprimes in the 1990s at the Roanoke Times and joined the Journal in 2006 .
He ’s now with the Center for Responsible Lending .
“ It ’s true the federal regulators disappeared , ” Hudson says .
“ But there were lots of state regulators who were going after this in a big way , lots of people on the ground , lawyers , consumer advocates , scholars , who saw what was happening , and the press did n’t give them much attention . ”
in may 1990 , the Wall Street Journal published “ The Reckoning , ” a devastating , 7,000 - word account by Susan Faludi , then a staff writer , of the human toll wrought by the leveraged buyout of the Safeway grocery chain .
It is safe to say that that piece , which tied the Safeway lbo to workers ’ suicides , heart attacks , and more , would never be proposed , let alone published , today .
Faludi ’s article was distinguished by more than its scope and length .
It also took on a practice that at the time was at the very heart of Wall Street ’s business model , not to mention one of the preeminent firms of the era , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co .
It then expanded the story ’s scope to take into account the social costs of high finance .
Similarly , the Journal ‘s Alix Freedman took on the tobacco industry at the height of its power in 1996 , when she won a Pulitzer for stories exposing how ammonia additives heighten nicotine ’s potency .
By contrast , in the past few years , business - news outlets , increasingly burdened financially , less confident editorially , competing ever more fiercely among themselves , torn by the tradeoff between access and scrutiny , have slowly given away their sense of perspective .
The result was an insiders ’ conversation — journalism that , while well executed on Wall Street ’s terms , in the end missed the point .
There have been exceptions — a preliminary list would include Shawn Tully at Fortune , John Hechinger and others at the Journal , Mara Der Hovanesian at BusinessWeek , Diana Henriques and others at the New York Times , and Scott Reckard at the LA Times .
But to this day , and even after the collapse , the most complete accounts of the mortgage mess have been provided not by the mainstream business press , but by This American Life ‘s “ Giant Pool of Money , ” and Chain of Blame , a book published last year by reporters for the Orange County Register and National Mortgage News .
Over the past decade , business news has become ever more inward looking , more incremental , and more specialized .
In covering Merrill Lynch , for instance , news outlets focused on Stan O’Neal ’s hard - charging style , but entirely from a perspective of whether it would help Merrill shareholders .
A Fortune headline from 2004 read , “ Stan O’Neal may be the toughest — some say the most ruthless — ceo in America .
Merrill Lynch could n’t be luckier to have him . ”
There was no exploration , in Fortune or elsewhere , of Merrill ’s huge push into subprimes until after O’Neal was ousted in 2007 .
Increasingly , business coverage has addressed its audience as investors rather than citizens , a subtle but powerful shift in perspective that has led to some curious choices .
The Journal , for example , at times seemed to strain to find someone other than Wall Street to blame for the mortgage mess : A December 2007 story announced that borrower fraud “ goes a long way toward explaining why mortgage defaults and foreclosures are rocking financial institutions , ” though no such evidence exists .
Another Journal story last March accused “ about half ” of foreclosed - upon borrowers of trashing their homes .
The source for the “ half ” bit : a PR firm working for real estate clients .
Forbes , meanwhile , in a misbegotten investigation last March of Martin Eakes , the head of the Center for Responsible Lending and one of the few heroes of the subprime mess , suggested Eakes had fought to ban abusive lending in order to help the tiny nonprofit credit union he runs .
Seriously .
Competition has only exacerbated this narrowing of vision .
Mergers - and - acquisition coverage rose from its place as one beat among many to a full - fledged obsession generating multiple stand - alone sections and publications .
But no matter how titillating , deal stories are of limited relevance to most readers , and dependent entirely on the good graces of Wall Street sources .
The rise of M&A coverage represents the triumph of Wall Street insiderism .
It is the opposite of Faludi ’s vision .
Significantly , M&A has become a business - press career launching pad : Andrew Ross Sorkin , who writes the Times ‘ DealBook column , and former Wall Street Journal M&A reporter Nik Deogun are among the field ’s superstars .
Another insider obsession is outsize personalities in the corner office : Coverage of Citigroup produced reams of profiles of its influential former chief , Sandy Weill , his successor , Chuck Prince , and his protégé - turned - rival , Jaime Dimon , but precious little about Citigroup ’s role in bringing subprime lending from the mortgage industry ’s margins into the mainstream .
It was left to Hudson , then freelancing for the 3,000 - circulation Southern Exposure , to tell that story ( and win a Polk Award ) .
Personality profiles , critical as they may be , are comfortably within the narrowing business - press discourse .
Plus they ’re a lot easier , and less risky , than investigations — and it ’s that part of business journalism that has been allowed to wither , says Katie Benner , a Fortune writer .
“ It ’s much easier to write a story saying something is a bubble than saying it ’s a fraud , ” she notes .
“ If business - news organizations want to be taken seriously , they need to invest in investigative journalism . ”
Needless to say , chances for that look slim right now — but it is more than just a question of resources .
Predatory lending happened in plain sight ; it did n’t take a muckraker to see what was wrong .
Yet business journalism kept its blinders on , played it safe , fixated on stock market concerns , and allowed its BS detector to atrophy just when it was needed most .
Sure , there has been , and will be , excellent retrospective work — similar to the Journal ‘s 2002 look back on the Enron - WorldCom - Tyco period , which won a Pulitzer , but in my view was akin to kicking the wreckage after the plane had crashed .
This kind of “ explanatory ” reporting is by definition too late .
It is a lower form of journalism than probing coverage before the fact , which is the hardest to do but in the end what readers — investors , citizens — really need .
Who will blow the whistle on the next disaster in the making ?
Where ’s the next subprime mess ?
Barring a major reordering of resources and priorities , do n’t count on the business media to find out .
“ The press were kind of prisoners of respectability , ” Hudson says .
“ With exceptions , they really want official sources ; they want official approval ; they do n’t want to be too out front .
They do a good job after the fact , but not beforehand , when it counts . ”

A close brush with a distracted driver is enough to intimidate any avid bicycler from riding at night .
You ’ve probably seen small blinkers and flashers tucked just below the seat but that is n’t enough .
As a daily driver in a very bike friendly city , I can attest I usually do n’t notice those blinkers until I ’m within a few hundred yards of the bicycler .
That leaves very little distance and time to react if I were to collide with them .
Only a small fraction of streets have dedicated bike lanes , and with an installation cost of $ 5,000 – $ 50,000 per mile , we should n’t expect to find them everywhere anytime soon .
LightLane projects a crisply defined virtual bike lane onto pavement , using a laser , providing the driver with a familiar boundary to avoid .
With a wider margin of safety , bikers will regain their confidence to ride at night , making the bike a more viable commuting alternative .
I want one now .

The decision may deepen Nawaz Sharif 's rift with the ruling PPP Pakistan 's Supreme Court has upheld bans on former prime minister and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and his brother , Shahbaz , from elected office .
Nawaz Sharif 's PML - N party holds power in Punjab province .
His brother is chief minister but must now step down .
Nawaz Sharif accused President Asif Ali Zardari of being behind the ban .
Mr Sharif said it was because he would not back down in his campaign to have judges sacked by ex-president Pervez Musharraf reinstated .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says that the court order will deepen the rift between the Sharifs and the federal government and increase the chances of political instability in the country .
Falling out Last June , the high court in the city of Lahore upheld an earlier ruling that barred Nawaz Sharif from running in a parliamentary by -election .
The court said he was ineligible to stand because of a 1999 conviction .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
One of the Sharif lawyers , Akram Sheikh , confirmed that their latest appeal in the Supreme Court had been dismissed .
Nawaz Sharif said Mr Zardari was behind the ban as the president opposed his stance on the judges .
Nawaz Sharif said the president had offered a deal to resolve the issue last month in a meeting with his brother .
" You give up your campaign against the judges and they will rule that you are eligible , " Mr Sharif said his brother was told by the president .
Mr Sharif said Shahbaz Sharif immediately refused the offer , but " we choose to keep it secret till now " .
Mr Zardari has made no comment yet on the allegation .
Mr Sharif said the latest ruling would not change his policy and called for a nationwide protest against the court ruling on Thursday .
President Zardari had a hand in the decision , Nawaz Sharif believes Nawaz Sharif is not an MP at the moment , but analysts say the court order will force Shahbaz Sharif to step down from the post of Punjab 's chief minister .
Nawaz Sharif had been convicted in connection with the 1999 hijacking of a plane carrying then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf .
The event led to Gen Musharraf ousting Mr Sharif in a coup and going on to become president .
Nawaz Sharif had returned from exile , hoping his ban from office would be lifted by a democratically elected government .
The PML - N and Pakistan 's ruling party PPP then emerged as the two biggest parties after last year 's elections , trouncing allies of Pervez Musharraf .
They formed a fragile coalition and managed to force Mr Musharraf out of office .
But soon after , Mr Sharif fell out with the PPP leader , Mr Zardari , and they split over the issue of the reinstatement of the judges .
Our correspondent , Barbara Plett , says the latest ruling raises fears of a return to the bitter political infighting that characterised elected governments in the 1990s , now though , at a time when Pakistan is facing security and economic crises .

Charges have been laid against two off - duty B.C. police officers who were allegedly involved in the beating and robbery of a delivery truck driver in downtown Vancouver last week .
Jeffrey Roger Klassen , a 38 - year - old New Westminster constable , is charged with assault .
West Vancouver Const .
Griffin Gillan is charged with robbery .
Both officers are due to appear in court on Feb. 9 , according to Vancouver police spokesperson Tim Fanning .
A second charge of possession of stolen property against Klassen was not approved by the crown .
A 28 - year - old Delta officer has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the incident by Vancouver Police , but will face a Police Act investigation over his involvement in the incident .
Surrey resident Firoz " Phil " Khan , 47 , was dropping off newspapers to pay boxes and local hotels in the 600 - block of Burrard Street early on Jan. 21 , when he claims he was kicked and beaten by the three off - duty police officers .
He says the officers stole his cellphone and $ 200 from his wallet .
Vancouver police say evidence suggests the Delta officer may have been trying to stop the beating .
Khan told CTV
News he believes the attack was racially motivated , and that the officers shouted " we do n't like brown people " during the alleged assault .
The attack took place in front of a taxi driver who took two of the officers from the Roxy nightclub to the location near the Hyatt Hotel .
Two City of Vancouver employees , Meatr Chima and Phil Pilon , also witnessed the assault and stepped in to help .
They say the attack on Khan was so brutal they actually feared for his life , not to mention their own .
Speaking from his Surrey home last week , Khan says one of the only reasons he 's alive is because the two city workers stopped to help .
" Thank God there was a lot of city workers that I know that clean the streets in downtown Vancouver , " he said .
He said he had suffered serious injuries to his head and internal injuries after the attack .
He also lost a filling and chipped a tooth .

Sen .
Norm Coleman was in Wright County on Friday and though his visit to an Xcel facility in Monticello was to discuss energy issues , reporters asked him , of course , about the election recount .
He said several times that he has confidence in the Canvassing Board .
He also said he 's not involved in the day - to - day recount .
Asked at one point whether he would concede if the board certified Al Franken as the winner , as the senator had suggested Franken do the morning after the election , Coleman did n't answer directly .
However , he expressed second thoughts about his comments that morning .
He noted that his lead at the time was substantially larger , more than 700 votes , and also that he had n't slept in 36 hours .
Now , he said , " I do n't think I 'd have made the same statement . "
During a response to a previous question about ballot challenges , Coleman said : " My sense is , there are games being played on both sides and it would be great if they would put the games aside . "
Of the recount , he said : " I 've got faith we 'll get it done the Minnesota way . "
He also said he 's confident he 'll prevail .
" The vote will be what the vote will be , " he said .
" I 'm not walking around wringing my hands worried about the recount . "
Tom Daschle will be Secretary of Health and Human Services a Democratic official said .
Daschle will be secretary of HHS
Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) will be secretary of health and human services in the Obama administration , with the delicate mission of shepherding a health care bill through Congress at a time of punishing budget constraints , two senior Democratic officials said .
Daschle was also considered for health care czar in the White House , but President - elect Barack Obama ’s transition team decided he could be more effective with “ Secretary ” in front of his name .

“ Of all the proposals that Obama wants to enact , health care requires the most input and tough negotiations , ” one of the Democratic officials said .
“ No one knows the House and Senate like Tom Daschle . ”
Daschle was also considered for White House chief of staff before that post went to Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill . ) .
Daschle , who will be 61 next month , will focus on what the official called the “ 30,000 - foot ” part of the job , with powerful deputies handling day - to - day matters .
“ He ’s going to do the broader perspective , ” the official said .
Daschle was an early mentor of Obama's , encouraging the freshman senator to consider running for president despite the long odds .
Daschle helped line up support for Obama in the Senate — and after losing his reelection fight in 2004 , Daschle sent his key operatives and aides to work for Obama in his Senate office and his presidential campaign .
He is not a registed lobbyist , but he works as a " special public policy adviser " at the law firm Alston & Bird , advising clients on public policy related to financial services , health care , energy , telecommunications and taxes , according to the firm 's website .
Daschle 's wife , however , is one of Washington 's top lobbyists .
Linda Daschle , a former deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration , represents airlines , airports and aviation manufacturers as a lobbyist with Baker Donelson .
She recused herself from lobbying the Senate while her husband served there , and might have to wade through a similar thicket with him taking the health and human services post .
" Ms. Daschle regularly represents companies before both the executive and legislative branches , " according to a bio on her firm 's website .
Tom Daschle also served eight years in the House .
He was Senate majority leader from 2001 to 2003 , when Republicans regained the Senate majority .
His official biography says : “ During his tenure as Leader , Daschle co-managed only the second impeachment trial of a U.S. president , led the Senate in response to the attacks of September 11th , 2001 and the anthrax attack on his office one month later . "
His biography adds : “ Born in Aberdeen , South Dakota , Senator Daschle attended South Dakota State University and graduated in 1969 .
Following college , he served for three years as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force Strategic Command .
After military service , he spent five years as an aide to South Dakota Senator James Abourezk . ”
Roll Call first reported Daschle ’s selection at HHS .

Politics
Chomsky and Herman explain their brilliant " propaganda model " , which illustrates how the media functions in Western democracies and what constraints exist on what it can and can't say , and why .
Written in 1988
The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and symbols to the general populace .
It is their function to amuse , entertain , and inform , and to inculcate individuals with the values , beliefs , and codes of behavior that will integrate them into the institutional structures of the larger society .
In a world of concentrated wealth and major conflicts of class interest , to fulfill this role requires systematic propaganda .
In countries where the levers of power are in the hands of a state bureaucracy , the monopolistic control over the media , often supplemented by official censorship , makes it clear that the media serve the ends of a dominant elite .
It is much more difficult to see a propaganda system at work where the media are private and formal censorship is absent .
This is especially true where the media actively compete , periodically attack and expose corporate and governmental malfeasance , and aggressively portray themselves as spokesmen for free speech and the general community interest .
What is not evident ( and remains undiscussed in the media ) is the limited nature of such critiques , as well as the huge inequality in command of resources , and its effect both on access to a private media system and on its behavior and performance .
A propaganda model focuses on this inequality of wealth and power and its multilevel effects on mass - media interests and choices .
It traces the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news fit to print , marginalize dissent , and allow the government and dominant private interests to get their messages across to the public .
The essential ingredients of our propaganda model , or set of news " filters , " fall under the following headings : ( 1 ) the size , concentrated ownership , owner wealth , and profit orientation of the dominant mass - media firms ; ( 2 ) advertising as the primary income source of the mass media ; ( 3 ) the reliance of the media on information provided by government , business , and " experts " funded and approved by these primary sources and agents of power ; ( 4 ) " flak " as a means of disciplining the media ; and ( 5 ) " anticommunism " as a national religion and control mechanism .
These elements interact with and reinforce one another .
The raw material of news must pass through successive filters , leaving only the cleansed residue fit to print .
They fix the premises of discourse and interpretation , and the definition of what is newsworthy in the first place , and they explain the basis and operations of what amount to propaganda campaigns .
The elite domination of the media and marginalization of dissidents that results from the operation of these filters occurs so naturally that media news people , frequently operating with complete integrity and goodwill , are able to convince themselves that they choose and interpret the news " objectively " and on the basis of professional news values .
Within the limits of the filter constraints they often are objective ; the constraints are so powerful , and are built into the system in such a fundamental way , that alternative bases of news choices are hardly imaginable .
In assessing the newsworthiness of the U.S. government 's urgent claims of a shipment of MIGs to Nicaragua on November 5 , 1984 , the media do not stop to ponder the bias that is inherent in the priority assigned to government - supplied raw material , or the possibility that the government might be manipulating the news , imposing its own agenda , and deliberately diverting attention from other material .
It requires a macro , alongside a micro- ( story - by - story ) , view of media operations , to see the pattern of manipulation and systematic bias .
SIZE , OWNERSHIP , AND PROFIT ORIENTATION OF THE MASS MEDIA : THE FIRST FILTER
In their analysis of the evolution of the media in Great Britain , James Curran and Jean Seaton describe how , in the first half of the nineteenth century , a radical press emerged that reached a national working - class audience .
This alternative press was effective in reinforcing class consciousness : it unified the workers because it fostered an alternative value system and framework for looking at the world , and because it " promoted a greater collective confidence by repeatedly emphasizing the potential power of working people to effect social change through the force of ' combination ' and organized action . "
This was deemed a major threat by the ruling elites .
One MP asserted that the working class newspapers " inflame passions and awaken their selfishness , contrasting their current condition with what they contend to be their future condition - a condition incompatible with human nature , and those immutable laws which Providence has established for the regulation of civil society . "
The result was an attempt to squelch the working - class media by libel laws and prosecutions , by requiring an expensive security bond as a condition for publication , and by imposing various taxes designed to drive out radical media by raising their costs .
These coercive efforts were not effective , and by mid-century they had been abandoned in favor of the liberal view that the market would enforce responsibility .
Curran and Seaton show that the market did successfully accomplish what state intervention failed to do .
Following the repeal of the punitive taxes on newspapers between 1853 and 1869 , a new daily local press came into existence , but not one new local working - class daily was established through the rest of the nineteenth century .
Curran and Seaton note that
Indeed , the eclipse of the national radical press was so total that when the Labour Party developed out of the working - class movement in the first decade of the twentieth century , it did not obtain the exclusive backing of a single national daily or Sunday paper .
One important reason for this was the rise in scale of newspaper enterprise and the associated increase in capital costs from the mid-nineteenth century onward , which was based on technological improvements along with the owners ' increased stress on reaching large audiences .
The expansion of the free market was accompanied by an " industrialization of the press . "
The total cost of establishing a national weekly on a profitable basis in 1837 was under a thousand pounds , with a break - even circulation of 6,200 copies .
By 1867 , the estimated start - up cost of a new London daily was 50,000 pounds .
The Sunday Express , launched in 1918 , spent over two million pounds before it broke even with a circulation of over 200,000 .
Similar processes were at work in the United States , where the start - up cost of a new paper in New York City in 1851 was $ 69,000 ; the public sale of the St. Louis Democrat in 1872 yielded $ 456,000 ; and city newspapers were selling at from $ 6 to $ 18 million in the 1920s .
The cost of machinery alone , of even very small newspapers , has for many decades run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars ; in 1945 it could be said that " Even small - newspaper publishing is big business . . . [ and ] is no longer a trade one takes up lightly even if he has substantial cash - or takes up at all if he does n't . "
Thus the first filter - the limitation on ownership of media with any substantial outreach by the requisite large size of investment - was applicable a century or more ago , and it has become increasingly effective over time .
In 1986 there were some 1,500 daily newspapers , 11,000 magazines , 9,000 radio and 1,500 TV stations , 2,400 book publishers , and seven movie studios in the United States - over 25,000 media entities in all .
But a large proportion of those among this set who were news dispensers were very small and local , dependent on the large national companies and wire services for all but local news .
Many more were subject to common ownership , sometimes extending through virtually the entire set of media variants .
Ben Bagdikian stresses the fact that despite the large media numbers , the twenty - nine largest media systems account for over half of the output of newspapers , and most of the sales and audiences in magazines , broadcasting , books , and movies .
He contends that these " constitute a new Private Ministry of Information and Culture " that can set the national agenda .
Actually , while suggesting a media autonomy from corporate and government power that we believe to be incompatible with structural facts ( as we describe below ) , Bagdikian also may be understating the degree of effective concentration in news manufacture .
It has long been noted that the media are tiered , with the top tier - as measured by prestige , resources , and outreach - comprising somewhere between ten and twenty - four systems .
It is this top tier , along with the government and wire services , that defines the news agenda and supplies much of the national and international news to the lower tiers of the media , and thus for the general public .
Centralization within the top tier was substantially increased by the post - World War II rise of television and the national networking of this important medium .
Pre-television news markets were local , even if heavily dependent on the higher tiers and a narrow set of sources for national and international news ; the networks provide national and international news from three national sources , and television is now the principal source of news for the public .
The maturing of cable , however , has resulted in a fragmentation of television audiences and a slow erosion of the market share and power of the networks .
The twenty - four media giants ( or their controlling parent companies ) that make up the top tier of media companies in the United States .
This compilation includes : ( 1 ) the three television networks : ABC ( through its parent , Capital Cities ) , CBS , and NBC ( through its ultimate parent , General Electric [ GE ] ) ; ( 2 ) the leading newspaper empires : New York Times , Washington Post , Los Angeles Times ( Times - Mirror ) , Wall Street Journal ( Dow Jones ) , Knight - Ridder , Gannett , Hearst , Scripps - Howard , Newhouse ( Advance Publications ) , and the Tribune Company ; ( 3 ) the major news and general - interest magazines : Time , Newsweek ( subsumed under Washington Post ) , Reader 's Digest , TV Guide ( Triangle ) , and U.S. News ~ World Report ; ( 4 ) a major book publisher ( McGraw - Hill ) ; and ( 5 ) other cable - TV systems of large and growing importance : those of Murdoch , Turner , Cox , General Corp. , Taft , Storer , and Group W ( Westinghouse ) .
Many of these systems are prominent in more than one field and are only arbitrarily placed in a particular category ( Time , Inc. , is very important in cable as well as magazines ; McGraw - Hill is a major publisher of magazines ; the Tribune Company has become a large force in television as well as newspapers ;
Hearst is important in magazines as well as newspapers ; and Murdoch has significant newspaper interests as well as television and movie holdings ) .
These twenty - four companies are large , profit - seeking corporations , owned and controlled by quite wealthy people .
All but one of the top companies for whom data are available have assets in excess of $ 1 billion , and the median size ( middle item by size ) is $ 2.6 billion .
Approximately three - quarters of these media giants had after - tax profits in excess of $ 100 million , with the median at $ 183 million .
Many of the large media companies are fully integrated into the market , and for the others , too , the pressures of stockholders , directors , and bankers to focus on the bottom line are powerful .
These pressures have intensified in recent years as media stocks have become market favorites , and actual or prospective owners of newspapers and television properties have found it possible to capitalize increased audience size and advertising revenues into multiplied values of the media franchises - and great wealth .
This has encouraged the entry of speculators and increased the pressure and temptation to focus more intensively on profitability .
Family owners have been increasingly divided between those wanting to take advantage of the new opportunities and those desiring a continuation of family control , and their splits have often precipitated crises leading finally to the sale of the family interest .
This trend toward greater integration of the media into the market system has been accelerated by the loosening of rules limiting media concentration , cross- ownership , and control by non-media companies .
There has also been an abandonment of restrictions - previously quite feeble anyway - on radio - TV commercials , entertainment mayhem programming , and " fairness doctrine " threats , opening the door to the unrestrained commercial use of the airwaves .
The greater profitability of the media in a deregulated environment has also led to an increase in takeovers and takeover threats , with even giants like CBS and Time , Inc. , directly attacked or threatened .
This has forced the managements of the media giants to incur greater debt and to focus ever more aggressively and unequivocally on profitability , in order to placate owners and reduce the attractiveness of their properties to outsiders .
They have lost some of their limited autonomy to bankers , institutional investors , and large individual investors whom they have had to solicit as potential " white knights . "
While the stock of the great majority of large media firms is traded on the securities markets , approximately two - thirds of these companies are either closely held or still controlled by members of the originating family who retain large blocks of stock .
This situation is changing as family ownership becomes diffused among larger numbers of heirs and the market opportunities for selling media properties continue to improve , but the persistence of family control is clear .
Also evident is the enormous wealth possessed by the controlling families of the top media firms .
For seven of the twenty - four , the market value of the media properties owned by the controlling families in the mid-1980s exceeded a billion dollars , and the median value was close to half a billion dollars .
These control groups obviously have a special stake in the status quo by virtue of their wealth and their strategic position in one of the great institutions of society .
And they exercise the power of this strategic position , if only by establishing the general aims of the company and choosing its top management .
The control groups of the media giants are also brought into close relationships with the mainstream of the corporate community through boards of directors and social links .
In the cases of NBC and the Group W television and cable systems , their respective parents , GE and Westinghouse , are themselves mainstream corporate giants , with boards of directors that are dominated by corporate and banking executives .
Many of the other large media firms have boards made up predominantly of insiders , a general characteristic of relatively small and owner - dominated companies .
The larger the firm and the more widely distributed the stock , the larger the number and proportion of outside directors .
The composition of the outside directors of the media giants is very similar to that of large non-media corporations ... active corporate executives and bankers together account for a little over half the total of the outside directors of ten media giants ; and the lawyers and corporate - banker retirees ( who account for nine of the thirteen under " Retired " ) push the corporate total to about two - thirds of the outside - director aggregate .
These 95 outside directors had directorships in an additional 36 banks and 255 other companies ( aside from the media company and their own firm of primary affiliation ) .
In addition to these board linkages , the large media companies all do business with commercial and investment bankers , obtaining lines of credit and loans , and receiving advice and service in selling stock and bond issues and in dealing with acquisition opportunities and takeover threats .
Banks and other institutional investors are also large owners of media stock .
In the early 1980s , such institutions held 44 percent of the stock of publicly owned newspapers and 35 percent of the stock of publicly owned broadcasting companies .
These investors are also frequently among the largest stockholders of individual companies .
For example , in 1980 - 81 , the Capital Group , an investment company system , held 7.1 percent of the stock of ABC , 6.6 percent of KnightRidder , 6 percent of Time , Inc. , and 2.8 percent of Westinghouse .
These holdings , individually and collectively , do not convey control , but these large investors can make themselves heard , and their actions can affect the welfare of the companies and their managers .
If the managers fail to pursue actions that favor shareholder returns , institutional investors will be inclined to sell the stock ( depressing its price ) , or to listen sympathetically to outsiders contemplating takeovers .
These investors are a force helping press media companies toward strictly market ( profitability ) objectives .
So is the diversification and geographic spread of the great media companies .
Many of them have diversified out of particular media fields into others that seemed like growth areas .
Many older newspaper - based media companies , fearful of the power of television and its effects on advertising revenue , moved as rapidly as they could into broadcasting and cable TV .
Time , Inc. , also , made a major diversification move into cable TV , which now accounts for more than half its profits .
Only a small minority of the twenty - four largest media giants remain in a single media sector .
The large media companies have also diversified beyond the media field , and non-media companies have established a strong presence in the mass media .
The most important cases of the latter are GE , owning RCA , which owns the NBC network , and Westinghouse , which owns major television - broadcasting stations , a cable network , and a radio station network .
GE and Westinghouse are both huge , diversified multinational companies heavily involved in the controversial areas of weapons production and nuclear power .
It may be recalled that from 1965 to 1967 , an attempt by International Telephone and Telegraph ( ITT ) to acquire ABC was frustrated following a huge outcry that focused on the dangers of allowing a great multinational corporation with extensive foreign investments and business activities to control a major media outlet .
The fear was that ITT control " could compromise the independence of ABC 's news coverage of political events in countries where ITT has interests . "
The soundness of the decision disallowing the acquisition seemed to have been vindicated by the later revelations of ITT 's political bribery and involvement in attempts to overthrow the government of Chile .
RCA and Westinghouse , however , had been permitted to control media companies long before the ITT case , although some of the objections applicable to ITT would seem to apply to them as well .
GE is a more powerful company than ITT , with an extensive international reach , deeply involved in the nuclear power business , and far more important than ITT in the arms industry .
It is a highly centralized and quite secretive organization , but one with a vast stake in " political " decisions .
GE has contributed to the funding of the American Enterprise Institute , a right - wing think tank that supports intellectuals who will get the business message across .
With the acquisition of ABC , GE should be in a far better position to assure that sound views are given proper attention .
The lack of outcry over its takeover of RCA and NBC resulted in part from the fact that RCA control over NBC had already breached the gate of separateness , but it also reflected the more pro-business and laissez - faire environment of the Reagan era .
The non-media interests of most of the media giants are not large , and , excluding the GE and Westinghouse systems , they account for only a small fraction of their total revenue .
Their multinational outreach , however , is more significant .
The television networks , television syndicators , major news magazines , and motion - picture studios all do extensive business abroad , and they derive a substantial fraction of their revenues from foreign sales and the operation of foreign affiliates .
Reader 's Digest is printed in seventeen languages and is available in over 160 countries .
The Murdoch empire was originally based in Australia , and the controlling parent company is still an Australian corporation ; its expansion in the United States is funded by profits from Australian and British affiliates .
Another structural relationship of importance is the media companies ' dependence on and ties with government .
The radio- TV companies and networks all require government licenses and franchises and are thus potentially subject to government control or harassment .
This technical legal dependency has been used as a club to discipline the media , and media policies that stray too often from an establishment orientation could activate this threat .
The media protect themselves from this contingency by lobbying and other political expenditures , the cultivation of political relationships , and care in policy .
The political ties of the media have been impressive .
... fifteen of ninety - five outside directors of ten of the media giants are former government officials , and Peter Dreier gives a similar proportion in his study of large newspapers .
In television , the revolving - door flow of personnel between regulators and the regulated firms was massive during the years when the oligopolistic structure of the media and networks was being established .
The great media also depend on the government for more general policy support .
All business firms are interested in business taxes , interest rates , labor policies , and enforcement and nonenforcement of the antitrust laws .
GE and Westinghouse depend on the government to subsidize their nuclear power and military research and development , and to create a favorable climate for their overseas sales .
The Reader 's Digest , Time , Newsweek , and movie - and television - syndication sellers also depend on diplomatic support for their rights to penetrate foreign cultures with U.S. commercial and value messages and interpretations of current affairs .
The media giants , advertising agencies , and great multinational corporations have a joint and close interest in a favorable climate of investment in the Third World , and their interconnections and relationships with the government in these policies are symbiotic .
In sum , the dominant media firms are quite large businesses ; they are controlled by very wealthy people or by managers who are subject to sharp constraints by owners and other market - profit - oriented forces ; and they are closely interlocked , and have important common interests , with other major corporations , banks , and government .
This is the first powerful filter that will affect news choices .
THE ADVERTISING LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS : THE SECOND FILTER
In arguing for the benefits of the free market as a means of controlling dissident opinion in the mid-nineteenth century , the Liberal chancellor of the British exchequer , Sir George Lewis , noted that the market would promote those papers " enjoying the preference of the advertising public . ''
Advertising did , in fact , serve as a powerful mechanism weakening the working - class press .
Curran and Seaton give the growth of advertising a status comparable with the increase in capital costs as a factor allowing the market to accomplish what state taxes and harassment failed to do , noting that these " advertisers thus acquired a de facto licensing authority since , without their support , newspapers ceased to be economically viable . "
Before advertising became prominent , the price of a newspaper had to cover the costs of doing business .
With the growth of advertising , papers that attracted ads could afford a copy price well below production costs .
This put papers lacking in advertising at a serious disadvantage : their prices would tend to be higher , curtailing sales , and they would have less surplus to invest in improving the saleability of the paper ( features , attractive format , promotion , etc. ) .
For this reason , an advertising - based system will tend to drive out of existence or into marginality the media companies and types that depend on revenue from sales alone .
With advertising , the free market does not yield a neutral system in which final buyer choice decides .
The advertisers ' choices influence media prosperity and survival .
The ad - based media receive an advertising subsidy that gives them a price - marketing - quality edge , which allows them to encroach on and further weaken their ad - free ( or ad - disadvantaged ) rivals .
Even if ad - based media cater to an affluent ( " upscale " ) audience , they easily pick up a large part of the " downscale " audience , and their rivals lose market share and are eventually driven out or marginalized .
In fact , advertising has played a potent role in increasing concentration even among rivals that focus with equal energy on seeking advertising revenue .
A market share and advertising edge on the part of one paper or television station will give it additional revenue to compete more effectively - promote more aggressively , buy more saleable features and programs - and the disadvantaged rival must add expenses it cannot afford to try to stem the cumulative process of dwindling market ( and revenue ) share .
The crunch is often fatal , and it helps explain the death of many large - circulation papers and magazines and the attrition in the number of newspapers .
From the time of the introduction of press advertising , therefore , working - class and radical papers have been at a serious disadvantage .
Their readers have tended to be of modest means , a factor that has always affected advertiser interest .
One advertising executive stated in 1856 that some journals are poor vehicles because " their readers are not purchasers , and any money thrown upon them is so much thrown away . "
The same force took a heavy toll of the post - World War II social - democratic press in Great Britain , with the Daily Herald , News Chronicle , and Sunday Citizen failing or absorbed into establishment systems between 1960 and 1967 , despite a collective average daily readership of 9.3 million .
As James Curran points out , with 4.7 million readers in its last year , " the Daily Herald actually had almost double the readership of The Times , the Financial Times and the Guardian combined . "
What is more , surveys showed that its readers " thought more highly of their paper than the regular readers of any other popular newspaper , " and " they also read more in their paper than the readers of other popular papers despite being overwhelmingly working class .... "
The death of the Herald , as well as of the News Chronicle and Sunday Citizen , was in large measure a result of progressive strangulation by lack of advertising support .
The Herald , with 8.1 percent of national daily circulation , got 3.5 percent of net advertising revenue ; the Sunday Citizen got one - tenth of the net advertising revenue of the Sunday Times and one - seventh that of the Observer ( on a per- thousand - copies basis ) .
Curran argues persuasively that the loss of these three papers was an important contribution to the declining fortunes of the Labour party , in the case of the Herald specifically removing a mass - circulation institution that provided " an alternative framework of analysis and understanding that contested the dominant systems of representation in both broadcasting and the mainstream press . "
A mass movement without any major media support , and subject to a great deal of active press hostility , suffers a serious disability , and struggles against grave odds .
The successful media today are fully attuned to the crucial importance of audience " quality " : CBS proudly tells its shareholders that while it " continuously seeks to maximize audience delivery , " it has developed a new " sales tool " with which it approaches advertisers : " Client Audience Profile , or CAP , will help advertisers optimize the effectiveness of their network television schedules by evaluating audience segments in proportion to usage levels of advertisers ' products and services . "
In short , the mass media are interested in attracting audiences with buying power , not audiences per se ; it is affluent audiences that spark advertiser interest today , as in the nineteenth century .
The idea that the drive for large audiences makes the mass media " democratic " thus suffers from the initial weakness that its political analogue is a voting system weighted by income !
The power of advertisers over television programming stems from the simple fact that they buy and pay for the programs - they are the " patrons " who provide the media subsidy .
As such , the media compete for their patronage , developing specialized staff to solicit advertisers and necessarily having to explain how their programs serve advertisers ' needs .
The choices of these patrons greatly affect the welfare of the media , and the patrons become what William Evan calls " normative reference organizations , " whose requirements and demands the media must accommodate if they are to succeed .
For a television network , an audience gain or loss of one percentage point in the Nielsen ratings translates into a change in advertising revenue of from $ 80 to $ 100 million a year , with some variation depending on measures of audience " quality . "
The stakes in audience size and affluence are thus extremely large , and in a market system there is a strong tendency for such considerations to affect policy profoundly .
This is partly a matter of institutional pressures to focus on the bottom line , partly a matter of the continuous interaction of the media organization with patrons who supply the revenue dollars .
As Grant Tinker , then head of NBC - TV , observed , television " is an advertising supported medium , and to the extent that support falls out , programming will change . "
Working - class and radical media also suffer from the political discrimination of advertisers .
Political discrimination is structured into advertising allocations by the stress on people with money to buy .
But many firms will always refuse to patronize ideological enemies and those whom they perceive as damaging their interests , and cases of overt discrimination add to the force of the voting system weighted by income .
Public - television station WNET lost its corporate funding from Gulf +
Western in 1985 after the station showed the documentary " Hungry for Profit , " which contains material critical of multinational corporate activities in the Third World .
Even before the program was shown , in anticipation of negative corporate reaction , station officials " did all we could to get the program sanitized " ( according to one station source ) .
The chief executive of Gulf +
Western complained to the station that the program was " virulently anti-business if not anti-American , " and that the station 's carrying the program was not the behavior " of a friend " of the corporation .
The London Economist says that " Most people believe that WNET would not make the same mistake again . "
In addition to discrimination against unfriendly media institutions , advertisers also choose selectively among programs on the basis of their own principles .
With rare exceptions these are culturally and politically conservative .
Large corporate advertisers on television will rarely sponsor programs that engage in serious criticisms of corporate activities , such as the problem of environmental degradation , the workings of the military - industrial complex , or corporate support of and benefits from Third World tyrannies .
Erik Barnouw recounts the history of a proposed documentary series on environmental problems by NBC at a time of great interest in these issues .
Barnouw notes that although at that time a great many large companies were spending money on commercials and other publicity regarding environmental problems , the documentary series failed for want of sponsors .
The problem was one of excessive objectivity in the series , which included suggestions of corporate or systemic failure , whereas the corporate message " was one of reassurance . "
Television networks learn over time that such programs will not sell and would have to be carried at a financial sacrifice , and that , in addition , they may offend powerful advertisers . '
With the rise in the price of advertising spots , the forgone revenue increases ; and with increasing market pressure for financial performance and the diminishing constraints from regulation , an advertising - based media system will gradually increase advertising time and marginalize or eliminate altogether programming that has significant public - affairs content .
Advertisers will want , more generally , to avoid programs with serious complexities and disturbing controversies that interfere with the " buying mood . "
They seek programs that will lightly entertain and thus fit in with the spirit of the primary purpose of program purchases - the dissemination of a selling message .
Thus over time , instead of programs like " The Selling of the Pentagon , " it is a natural evolution of a market seeking sponsor dollars to offer programs such as " A Bird 's - Eye View of Scotland , " " Barry Goldwater 's Arizona , " " An Essay on Hotels , " and " Mr. Rooney Goes to Dinner " - a CBS program on " how Americans eat when they dine out , where they go and why . "
There are exceptional cases of companies willing to sponsor serious programs , sometimes a result of recent embarrassments that call for a public - relations offset .
But even in these cases the companies will usually not want to sponsor close examination of sensitive and divisive issues - they prefer programs on Greek antiquities , the ballet , and items of cultural and national history and nostalgia .
Barnouw points out an interesting contrast : commercial - television drama " deals almost wholly with the here and now , as processed via advertising budgets , " but on public television , culture " has come to mean ' other cultures . ' . . .
American civilization , here and now , is excluded from consideration . ''
Television stations and networks are also concerned to maintain audience " flow " levels , i.e. , to keep people watching from program to program , in order to sustain advertising ratings and revenue .
Airing program interludes of documentary - cultural matter that cause station switching is costly , and over time a " free " ( i.e. , ad - based ) commercial system will tend to excise it .
Such documentary - cultural - critical materials will be driven out of secondary media vehicles as well , as these companies strive to qualify for advertiser interest , although there will always be some cultural - political programming trying to come into being or surviving on the periphery of the mainstream media .
SOURCING MASS -MEDIA NEWS : THE THIRD FILTER
The mass media are drawn into a symbiotic relationship with powerful sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest .
The media need a steady , reliable flow of the raw material of news .
They have daily news demands and imperative news schedules that they must meet .
They cannot afford to have reporters and cameras at all places where important stories may break .
Economics dictates that they concentrate their resources where significant news often occurs , where important rumors and leaks abound , and where regular press conferences are held .
The White House , the Pentagon , and the State Department , in Washington , D.C. , are central nodes of such news activity .
On a local basis , city hall and the police department are the subject of regular news " beats " for reporters .
Business corporations and trade groups are also regular and credible purveyors of stories deemed newsworthy .
These bureaucracies turn out a large volume of material that meets the demands of news organizations for reliable , scheduled flows .
Mark Fishman calls this " the principle of bureaucratic affinity : only other bureaucracies can satisfy the input needs of a news bureaucracy . "
Government and corporate sources also have the great merit of being recognizable and credible by their status and prestige .
This is important to the mass media .
As Fishman notes ,
Newsworkers are predisposed to treat bureaucratic accounts as factual because news personnel participate in upholding a normative order of authorized knowers in the society .
Reporters operate with the attitude that officials ought to know what it is their job to know ....
In particular , a newsworker will recognize an official 's claim to knowledge not merely as a claim , but as a credible , competent piece of knowledge .
This amounts to a moral division of labor : officials have and give the facts ; reporters merely get them .
Another reason for the heavy weight given to official sources is that the mass media claim to be " objective " dispensers of the news .
Partly to maintain the image of objectivity , but also to protect themselves from criticisms of bias and the threat of libel suits , they need material that can be portrayed as presumptively accurate .
This is also partly a matter of cost : taking information from sources that may be presumed credible reduces investigative expense , whereas material from sources that are not prima facie credible , or that will elicit criticism and threats , requires careful checking and costly research .
The magnitude of the public - information operations of large government and corporate bureaucracies that constitute the primary news sources is vast and ensures special access to the media .
The Pentagon , for example , has a public - information service that involves many thousands of employees , spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year and dwarfing not only the public - information resources of any dissenting individual or group but the aggregate of such groups .
In 1979 and 1980 , during a brief interlude of relative openness ( since closed down ) , the U.S. Air Force revealed that its public - information outreach included the following :
140 newspapers , 690,000 copies per week Airman magazine , monthly circulation 125,000 , 34 radio and 17 TV stations , primarily overseas , 45,000 headquarters and unit news releases , 615,000 hometown news releases , 6,600 interviews with news media , 3,200 news conferences , 500 news media orientation flights , 50 meetings with editorial boards , 11,000 speeches .
This excludes vast areas of the air force 's public - information effort .
Writing back in 1970 , Senator J. W. Fulbright had found that the air force public - relations effort in 1968 involved 1,305 full - time employees , exclusive of additional thousands that " have public functions collateral to other duties . "
The air force at that time offered a weekly film - clip service for TV and a taped features program for use three times a week , sent to 1,139 radio stations ; it also produced 148 motion pictures , of which 24 were released for public consumption .
There is no reason to believe that the air force public - relations effort has diminished since the 1960s .
Note that this is just the air force .
There are three other branches with massive programs , and there is a separate , overall public - information program under an assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the Pentagon .
In 1971 , an Armed Forces Journal survey revealed that the Pentagon was publishing a total of 371 magazines at an annual cost of some $ 57 million , an operation sixteen times larger than the nation 's biggest publisher .
In an update in 1982 , the Air Force Journal International indicated that the Pentagon was publishing 1,203 periodicals .
To put this into perspective , we may note the scope of public - information operations of the American Friends Service Committee ( AFSC ) and the National Council of the Churches of Christ ( NCC ) , two of the largest of the nonprofit organizations that offer a consistently challenging voice to the views of the Pentagon .
The AFSC 's main office information - services budget in 1984 - 85 was under $ 500,000 , with eleven staff people .
Its institution - wide press releases run at about two hundred per year , its press conferences thirty a year , and it produces about one film and two or three slide shows a year .
It does not offer film clips , photos , or taped radio programs to the media .
The NCC Office of Information has an annual budget of some $ 350,000 , issues about a hundred news releases per year , and holds four press conferences annually .
The ratio of air force news releases and press conferences to those of the AFSC and NCC taken together are 150 to 1 ( or 2,200 to 1 , if we count hometown news releases of the air force ) , and 94 to 1 respectively .
Aggregating the other services would increase the differential by a large factor .
Only the corporate sector has the resources to produce public information and propaganda on the scale of the Pentagon and other government bodies .
The AFSC and NCC cannot duplicate the Mobil Oil company 's multimillion - dollar purchase of newspaper space and other corporate investments to get its viewpoint across .
The number of individual corporations with budgets for public information and lobbying in excess of those of the AFSC and NCC runs into the hundreds , perhaps even the thousands .
A corporate collective like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had a 1983 budget for research , communications , and political activities of $ 65 million .
By 1980 , the chamber was publishing a business magazine ( Nation 's Business ) with a circulation of 1.3 million and a weekly newspaper with 740,000 subscribers , and it was producing a weekly panel show distributed to 400 radio stations , as well as its own weekly panel - discussion programs carried by 128 commercial television stations .
Besides the U.S. Chamber , there are thousands of state and local chambers of commerce and trade associations also engaged in public relations and lobbying activities .
The corporate and trade - association lobbying network community is " a network of well over 150,000 professionals , " and its resources are related to corporate income , profits , and the protective value of public - relations and lobbying outlays .
Corporate profits before taxes in 1985 were $ 295.5 billion .
When the corporate community gets agitated about the political environment , as it did in the 1970s , it obviously has the wherewithal to meet the perceived threat .
Corporate and trade - association image and issues advertising increased from $ 305 million in 1975 to $ 650 million in 1980 .
So did direct - mail campaigns through dividend and other mail stuffers , the distribution of educational films , booklets and pamphlets , and outlays on initiatives and referendums , lobbying , and political and think - tank contributions .
Aggregate corporate and trade - association political advertising and grass - roots outlays were estimated to have reached the billion - dollar - a - year level by 1978 , and to have grown to $ 1.6 billion by 1984 .
To consolidate their preeminent position as sources , government and business - news promoters go to great pains to make things easy for news organizations .
They provide the media organizations with facilities in which to gather ; they give journalists advance copies of speeches and forthcoming reports ; they schedule press conferences at hours well - geared to news deadlines ; they write press releases in usable language ; and they carefully organize their press conferences and " photo opportunity " sessions .
It is the job of news officers " to meet the journalist 's scheduled needs with material that their beat agency has generated at its own pace . "
In effect , the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize the mass media , and gain special access by their contribution to reducing the media 's costs of acquiring the raw materials of , and producing , news .
The large entities that provide this subsidy become " routine " news sources and have privileged access to the gates .
Non-routine sources must struggle for access , and may be ignored by the arbitrary decision of the gatekeepers .
It should also be noted that in the case of the largesse of the Pentagon and the State Department 's Office of Public Diplomacy , the subsidy is at the taxpayers ' expense , so that , in effect , the citizenry pays to be propagandized in the interest of powerful groups such as military contractors and other sponsors of state terrorism .
Because of their services , continuous contact on the beat , and mutual dependency , the powerful can use personal relationships , threats , and rewards to further influence and coerce the media .
The media may feel obligated to carry extremely dubious stories and mute criticism in order not to offend their sources and disturb a close relationship .
It is very difficult to call authorities on whom one depends for daily news liars , even if they tell whoppers .
Critical sources may be avoided not only because of their lesser availability and higher cost of establishing credibility , but also because the primary sources may be offended and may even threaten the media using them .
Powerful sources may also use their prestige and importance to the media as a lever to deny critics access to the media : the Defense Department , for example , refused to participate in National Public Radio discussions of defense issues if experts from the Center for Defense Information were on the program ; Elliott Abrams refused to appear on a program on human rights in Central America at the Kennedy School of Government , at Harvard University , unless the former ambassador , Robert White , was excluded as a participant ; Claire Sterling refused to participate in television - network shows on the Bulgarian Connection where her critics would appear .
In the last two of these cases , the authorities and brand - name experts were successful in monopolizing access by coercive threats .
Perhaps more important , powerful sources regularly take advantage of media routines and dependency to " manage " the media , to manipulate them into following a special agenda and framework ( as we will show in detail in the chapters that follow ) .
Part of this management process consists of inundating the media with stories , which serve sometimes to foist a particular line and frame on the media ( e.g. , Nicaragua as illicitly supplying arms to the Salvadoran rebels ) , and at other times to help chase unwanted stories off the front page or out of the media altogether ( the alleged delivery of MIGs to Nicaragua during the week of the 1984 Nicaraguan election ) .
This strategy can be traced back at least as far as the Committee on Public Information , established to coordinate propaganda during World War I , which " discovered in 1917 - 18 that one of the best means of controlling news was flooding news channels with ' facts , ' or what amounted to official information . "
The relation between power and sourcing extends beyond official and corporate provision of day - to - day news to shaping the supply of " experts . "
The dominance of official sources is weakened by the existence of highly respectable unofficial sources that give dissident views with great authority .
This problem is alleviated by " co-opting the experts " - i.e. , putting them on the payroll as consultants , funding their research , and organizing think tanks that will hire them directly and help disseminate their messages .
In this way bias may be structured , and the supply of experts may be skewed in the direction desired by the government and " the market . "
As Henry Kissinger has pointed out , in this " age of the expert , " the " constituency " of the expert is " those who have a vested interest in commonly held opinions ; elaborating and defining its consensus at a high level has , after all , made him an expert . "
It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions ( meaning those that are functional for elite interests ) to continue to prevail .
This process of creating the needed body of experts has been carried out on a deliberate basis and a massive scale .
Back in 1972 , Judge Lewis Powell ( later elevated to the Supreme Court ) wrote a memo to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urging business " to buy the top academic reputations in the country to add credibility to corporate studies and give business a stronger voice on the campuses . "
One buys them , and assures that - in the words of Dr. Edwin Feulner , of the Heritage Foundation - the public - policy area " is awash with in - depth academic studies " that have the proper conclusions .
Using the analogy of Procter & Gamble selling toothpaste , Feulner explained that " They sell it and resell it every day by keeping the product fresh in the consumer 's mind . "
By the sales effort , including the dissemination of the correct ideas to " thousands of newspapers , " it is possible to keep debate " within its proper perspective . ''
In accordance with this formula , during the 1970s and early 1980s a string of institutions was created and old ones were activated to the end of propagandizing the corporate viewpoint .
Many hundreds of intellectuals were brought to these institutions , where their work was funded and their outputs were disseminated to the media by a sophisticated propaganda effort .
The corporate funding and clear ideological purpose in the overall effort had no discernible effect on the credibility of the intellectuals so mobilized ; on the contrary , the funding and pushing of their ideas catapulted them into the press .
As an illustration of how the funded experts preempt space in the media we can analyse the " experts " on terrorism and defense issues who appeared on the " McNeil - Lehrer News Hour " in the course of a year in the mid-1980s .
We can see that , excluding journalists , a majority of the participants ( 54 percent ) were present or former government officials , and that the next highest category ( 15.7 percent ) was drawn from conservative think tanks .
The largest number of appearances in the latter category was supplied by the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , an organization funded by conservative foundations and corporations , and providing a revolving door between the State Department and CIA and a nominally private organization .
On such issues as terrorism and the Bulgarian Connection , the CSIS has occupied space in the media that otherwise might have been filled by independent voices .
The mass media themselves also provide " experts " who regularly echo the official view .
John Barron and Claire Sterling are household names as authorities on the KGB and terrorism because the Reader 's Digest has funded , published , and publicized their work ; the Soviet defector Arkady Shevchenko became an expert on Soviet arms and intelligence because Time , ABC - TV , and the New York Times chose to feature him ( despite his badly tarnished credentials ) .
By giving these purveyors of the preferred view a great deal of exposure , the media confer status and make them the obvious candidates for opinion and analysis .
Another class of experts whose prominence is largely a function of serviceability to power is former radicals who have come to " see the light . "
The motives that cause these individuals to switch gods , from Stalin ( or Mao ) to Reagan and free enterprise , is varied , but for the establishment media the reason for the change is simply that the ex-radicals have finally seen the error of their ways .
In a country whose citizenry values acknowledgement of sin and repentance , the turncoats are an important class of repentant sinners .
It is interesting to observe how the former sinners , whose previous work was of little interest or an object of ridicule to the mass media , are suddenly elevated to prominence and become authentic experts .
We may recall how , during the McCarthy era , defectors and ex-Communists vied with one another in tales of the imminence of a Soviet invasion and other lurid stories .
They found that news coverage was a function of their trimming their accounts to the prevailing demand .
The steady flow of ex-radicals from marginality to media attention shows that we are witnessing a durable method of providing experts who will say what the establishment wants said .
FLAK AND THE ENFORCERS : THE FOURTH FILTER
" Flak " refers to negative responses to a media statement or program .
It may take the form of letters , telegrams , phone calls , petitions , lawsuits , speeches and bills before Congress , and other modes of complaint , threat , and punitive action .
It may be organized centrally or locally , or it may consist of the entirely independent actions of individuals .
If flak is produced on a large scale , or by individuals or groups with substantial resources , it can be both uncomfortable and costly to the media .
Positions have to be defended within the organization and without , sometimes before legislatures and possibly even in courts .
Advertisers may withdraw patronage .
Television advertising is mainly of consumer goods that are readily subject to organized boycott .
During the McCarthy years , many advertisers and radio and television stations were effectively coerced into quiescence and blacklisting of employees by the threats of determined Red hunters to boycott products .
Advertisers are still concerned to avoid offending constituencies that might produce flak , and their demand for suitable programming is a continuing feature of the media environment .
If certain kinds of fact , position , or program are thought likely to elicit flak , this prospect can be a deterrent .
The ability to produce flak , and especially flak that is costly and threatening , is related to power .
Serious flak has increased in close parallel with business 's growing resentment of media criticism and the corporate offensive of the 1970s and 1980s .
Flak from the powerful can be either direct or indirect .
The direct would include letters or phone calls from the White House to Dan Rather or William Paley , or from the FCC to the television networks asking for documents used in putting together a program , or from irate officials of ad agencies or corporate sponsors to media officials asking for reply time or threatening retaliation .
The powerful can also work on the media indirectly by complaining to their own constituencies ( stockholders , employees ) about the media , by generating institutional advertising that does the same , and by funding right - wing monitoring or think - tank operations designed to attack the media .
They may also fund political campaigns and help put into power conservative politicians who will more directly serve the interests of private power in curbing any deviationism in the media .
Along with its other political investments of the 1970s and 1980s , the corporate community sponsored the growth of institutions such as the American Legal Foundation , the Capital Legal Foundation , the Media Institute , the Center for Media and Public Affairs , and Accuracy in Media ( AIM ) .
These may be regarded as institutions organized for the specific purpose of producing flak .
Another and older flak - producing machine with a broader design is Freedom House .
The American Legal Foundation , organized in 1980 , has specialized in Fairness Doctrine complaints and libel suits to aid " media victims . "
The Capital Legal Foundation , incorporated in 1977 , was the Scaife vehicle for Westmoreland 's $ 120 - million libel suit against CBS .
The Media Institute , organized in 1972 and funded by corporate - wealthy patrons , sponsors monitoring projects , conferences , and studies of the media .
It has focused less heavily on media failings in foreign policy , concentrating more on media portrayals of economic issues and the business community , but its range of interests is broad .
The main theme of its sponsored studies and conferences has been the failure of the media to portray business accurately and to give adequate weight to the business point of view , but it underwrites works such as John Corry 's expose of the alleged left - wing bias of the mass media .
The chairman of the board of trustees of the institute in 1985 was Steven V. Seekins , the top public - relations officer of the American Medical Association ; chairman of the National Advisory Council was Herbert Schmertz , of the Mobil Oil Corporation .
The Center for Media and Public Affairs , run by Linda and Robert Lichter , came into existence in the mid-1980s as a " non-profit , nonpartisan " research institute , with warm accolades from Patrick Buchanan , Faith Whittlesey , and Ronald Reagan himself , who recognized the need for an objective and fair press .
Their Media Monitor and research studies continue their earlier efforts to demonstrate the liberal bias and anti-business propensities of the mass media .
AIM was formed in 1969 , and it grew spectacularly in the 1970s .
Its annual income rose from $ 5,000 in 1971 to $ 1.5 million in the early 1980s , with funding mainly from large corporations and the wealthy heirs and foundations of the corporate system .
At least eight separate oil companies were contributors to AIM in the early 1980s , but the wide representation in sponsors from the corporate community is impressive .
The function of AIM is to harass the media and put pressure on them to follow the corporate agenda and a hard - line , right - wing foreign policy .
It presses the media to join more enthusiastically in Red - scare bandwagons , and attacks them for alleged deficiencies whenever they fail to toe the line on foreign policy .
It conditions the media to expect trouble ( and cost increases ) for violating right - wing standards of bias .
Freedom House , which dates back to the early 1940s , has had interlocks with AIM , the World Anticommunist League , Resistance International , and U.S. government bodies such as Radio Free Europe and the CIA , and has long served as a virtual propaganda arm of the government and international right wing .
It sent election monitors to the Rhodesian elections staged by Ian Smith in 1979 and found them " fair , " whereas the 1980 elections won by Mugabe under British supervision it found dubious .
Its election monitors also found the Salvadoran elections of 1982 admirable .
It has expended substantial resources in criticizing the media for insufficient sympathy with U.S. foreign - policy ventures and excessively harsh criticism of U.S. client states .
Its most notable publication of this genre was Peter Braestrup 's Big Story , which contended that the media 's negative portrayal of the Tet offensive helped lose the war .
The work is a travesty of scholarship , but more interesting is its premise : that the mass media not only should support any national venture abroad , but should do so with enthusiasm , such enterprises being by definition noble .
In 1982 , when the Reagan administration was having trouble containing media reporting of the systematic killing of civilians by the Salvadoran army , Freedom House came through with a denunciation of the " imbalance " in media reporting from El Salvador .
Although the flak machines steadily attack the mass media , the media treat them well .
They receive respectful attention , and their propagandistic role and links to a larger corporate program are rarely mentioned or analyzed .
AIM head , Reed Irvine 's diatribes are frequently published , and right - wing network flaks who regularly assail the " liberal media , " such as Michael Ledeen , are given Op - Ed column space , sympathetic reviewers , and a regular place on talk shows as experts .
This reflects the power of the sponsors , including the well - entrenched position of the right wing in the mass media themselves .
The producers of flak add to one another 's strength and reinforce the command of political authority in its news - management activities .
The government is a major producer of flak , regularly assailing , threatening , and " correcting " the media , trying to contain any deviations from the established line .
News management itself is designed to produce flak .
In the Reagan years , Mr. Reagan was put on television to exude charm to millions , many of whom berated the media when they dared to criticize the " Great Communicator . ''
ANTICOMMUNISM AS A CONTROL MECHANISM - THE FIFTH FILTER
[ Libcom note : this text was written during the Cold War and this section reflects this ]
A final filter is the ideology of anticommunism .
Communism as the ultimate evil has always been the specter haunting property owners , as it threatens the very root of their class position and superior status .
The Soviet , Chinese , and Cuban revolutions were traumas to Western elites , and the ongoing conflicts and the well - publicized abuses of Communist states have contributed to elevating opposition to communism to a first principle of Western ideology and politics .
This ideology helps mobilize the populace against an enemy , and because the concept is fuzzy it can be used against anybody advocating policies that threaten property interests or support accommodation with Communist states and radicalism .
It therefore helps fragment the left and labor movements and serves as a political - control mechanism .
If the triumph of communism is the worst imaginable result , the support of fascism abroad is justified as a lesser evil .
Opposition to social democrats who are too soft on Communists and " play into their hands " is rationalized in similar terms .
Liberals at home , often accused of being pro-Communist or insufficiently anti-Communist , are kept continuously on the defensive in a cultural milieu in which anticommunism is the dominant religion .
If they allow communism , or something that can be labeled communism , to triumph in the provinces while they are in office , the political costs are heavy .
Most of them have fully internalized the religion anyway , but they are all under great pressure to demonstrate their anti-Communist credentials .
This causes them to behave very much like reactionaries .
Their occasional support of social democrats often breaks down where the latter are insufficiently harsh on their own indigenous radicals or on popular groups that are organizing among generally marginalized sectors .
In his brief tenure in the Dominican Republic , Juan Bosch attacked corruption in the armed forces and government , began a land - reform program , undertook a major project for mass education of the populace , and maintained a remarkably open government and system of effective civil liberties .
These policies threatened powerful internal vested interests , and the United States resented his independence and the extension of civil liberties to Communists and radicals .
This was carrying democracy and pluralism too far .
Kennedy was " extremely disappointed " in Bosch 's rule , and the State Department " quickly soured on the first democratically elected Dominican President in over thirty years . "
Bosch 's overthrow by the military after nine months in office had at least the tacit support of the United States .
Two years later , by contrast , the Johnson administration invaded the Dominican Republic to make sure that Bosch did not resume power .
The Kennedy liberals were enthusiastic about the military coup and displacement of a populist government in Brazil in 1964 .
A major spurt in the growth of neo -Fascist national - security states took place under Kennedy and Johnson .
In the cases of the U.S. subversion of Guatemala , 1947 - 54 , and the military attacks on Nicaragua , 1981 - 87 , allegations of Communist links and a Communist threat caused many liberals to support counterrevolutionary intervention , while others lapsed into silence , paralyzed by the fear of being tarred with charges of infidelity to the national religion .
It should be noted that when anti-Communist fervor is aroused , the demand for serious evidence in support of claims of " communist " abuses is suspended , and charlatans can thrive as evidential sources .
Defectors , informers , and assorted other opportunists move to center stage as " experts , " and they remain there even after exposure as highly unreliable , if not downright liars .
Pascal Delwit and Jean - Michel Dewaele point out that in France , too , the ideologues of anticommunism " can do and say anything . ''
Analyzing the new status of Annie Kriegel and Pierre Daix , two former passionate Stalinists now possessed of a large and uncritical audience in France , Delwit and Dewaele note :
If we analyze their writings , we find all the classic reactions of people who have been disappointed in love .
But no one dreams of criticizing them for their past , even though it has marked them forever .
They may well have been converted , but they have not changed .... no one notices the constants , even though they are glaringly obvious .
Their best sellers prove , thanks to the support of the most indulgent and slothful critics anyone could hope for , that the public can be fooled .
No one denounces or even notices the arrogance of both yesterday 's eulogies and today 's diatribes ; no one cares that there is never any proof and that invective is used in place of analysis .
Their inverted hyper -Stalinism - which takes the usual form of total manicheanism - is whitewashed simply because it is directed against Communism .
The hysteria has not changed , but it gets a better welcome in its present guise .
The anti-Communist control mechanism reaches through the system to exercise a profound influence on the mass media .
In normal times as well as in periods of Red scares , issues tend to be framed in terms of a dichotomized world of Communist and anti-Communist powers , with gains and losses allocated to contesting sides , and rooting for " our side " considered an entirely legitimate news practice .
It is the mass media that identify , create , and push into the limelight a Joe McCarthy , Arkady Shevchenko , and Claire Sterling and Robert Leiken , or an Annie Kriegel and Pierre Daix .
The ideology and religion of anticommunism is a potent filter .
DICHOTOMIZATION AND PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGNS
The five filters narrow the range of news that passes through the gates , and even more sharply limit what can become " big news , " subject to sustained news campaigns .
By definition , news from primary establishment sources meets one major filter requirement and is readily accommodated by the mass media .
Messages from and about dissidents and weak , unorganized individuals and groups , domestic and foreign , are at an initial disadvantage in sourcing costs and credibility , and they often do not comport with the ideology or interests of the gatekeepers and other powerful parties that influence the filtering process .
Thus , for example , the torture of political prisoners and the attack on trade unions in Turkey will be pressed on the media only by human rights activists and groups that have little political leverage .
The U.S. government supported the Turkish martial - law government from its inception in 1980 , and the U.S. business community has been warm toward regimes that profess fervent anticommunism , encourage foreign investment , repress unions , and loyally support U.S. foreign policy ( a set of virtues that are frequently closely linked ) .
Media that chose to feature Turkish violence against their own citizenry would have had to go to extra expense to find and check out information sources ; they would elicit flak from government , business , and organized right - wing flak machines , and they might be looked upon with disfavor by the corporate community ( including advertisers ) for indulging in such a quixotic interest and crusade .
They would tend to stand alone in focusing on victims that from the standpoint of dominant American interests were unworthy .
In marked contrast , protest over political prisoners and the violation of the rights of trade unions in Poland was seen by the Reagan administration and business elites in 1981 as a noble cause , and , not coincidentally , as an opportunity to score political points .
Many media leaders and syndicated columnists felt the same way .
Thus information and strong opinions on human - rights violations in Poland could be obtained from official sources in Washington , and reliance on Polish dissidents would not elicit flak from the U.S. government or the flak machines .
These victims would be generally acknowledged by the managers of the filters to be worthy .
The mass media never explain why Andrei Sakharov is worthy and Jose Luis Massera , in Uruguay , is unworthy - the attention and general dichotomization occur " naturally " as a result of the working of the filters , but the result is the same as if a commissar had instructed the media : " Concentrate on the victims of enemy powers and forget about the victims of friends . ''
Reports of the abuses of worthy victims not only pass through the filters ; they may also become the basis of sustained propaganda campaigns .
If the government or corporate community and the media feel that a story is useful as well as dramatic , they focus on it intensively and use it to enlighten the public .
This was true , for example , of the shooting down by the Soviets of the Korean airliner KAL 007 in early September 1983 , which permitted an extended campaign of denigration of an official enemy and greatly advanced Reagan administration arms plans .
As Bernard Gwertzman noted complacently in the New York Times of August 3I , 1984 , U.S. officials " assert that worldwide criticism of the Soviet handling of the crisis has strengthened the United States in its relations with Moscow . "
In sharp contrast , the shooting down by Israel of a Libyan civilian airliner in February 1973 led to no outcry in the West , no denunciations for " cold - blooded murder , '' and no boycott .
This difference in treatment was explained by the New York Times precisely on the grounds of utility : " No useful purpose is served by an acrimonious debate over the assignment of blame for the downing of a Libyan airliner in the Sinai peninsula last week . ''
There was a very " useful purpose " served by focusing on the Soviet act , and a massive propaganda campaign ensued .
Propaganda campaigns in general have been closely attuned to elite interests .
The Red scare of 1919 - 20 served well to abort the union organizing drive that followed World War I in the steel and other industries .
The Truman - McCarthy Red scare helped inaugurate the Cold War and the permanent war economy , and it also served to weaken the progressive coalition of the New Deal years .
The chronic focus on the plight of Soviet dissidents , on enemy killings in Cambodia , and on the Bulgarian Connection helped weaken the Vietnam syndrome , justify a huge arms buildup and a more aggressive foreign policy , and divert attention from the upward redistribution of income that was the heart of Reagan 's domestic economic program .
The recent propaganda - disinformation attacks on Nicaragua have been needed to avert eyes from the savagery of the war in El Salvador and to justify the escalating U.S. investment in counterrevolution in Central America .
Conversely , propaganda campaigns will not be mobilized where victimization , even though massive , sustained , and dramatic , fails to meet the test of utility to elite interests .
Thus , while the focus on Cambodia in the Pol Pot era ( and thereafter ) was exceedingly serviceable , as Cambodia had fallen to the Communists and useful lessons could be drawn by attention to their victims , the numerous victims of the U.S. bombing before the Communist takeover were scrupulously ignored by the U.S. elite press .
After Pol Pot 's ouster by the Vietnamese , the United States quietly shifted support to this " worse than Hitler " villain , with little notice in the press , which adjusted once again to the national political agenda .
Attention to the Indonesian massacres of 1965 - 66 , or the victims of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor from 1975 onward , would also be distinctly unhelpful as bases of media campaigns , because Indonesia is a U.S. ally and client that maintains an open door to Western investment , and because , in the case of East Timor , the United States bears major responsibility for the slaughter .
The same is true of the victims of state terror in Chile and Guatemala , U.S. clients whose basic institutional structures , including the state terror system , were put in place and maintained by , or with crucial assistance from , U.S. power , and who remain U.S. client states .
Propaganda campaigns on behalf of these victims would conflict with government - business - military interests and , in our model , would not be able to pass through the filtering system .
Propaganda campaigns may be instituted either by the government or by one or more of the top media firms .
The campaigns to discredit the government of Nicaragua , to support the Salvadoran elections as an exercise in legitimizing democracy , and to use the Soviet shooting down of the Korean airliner KAL 007 as a means of mobilizing public support for the arms buildup , were instituted and propelled by the government .
The campaigns to publicize the crimes of Pol Pot and the alleged KGB plot to assassinate the pope were initiated by the Reader 's Digest , with strong follow - up support from NBC - TV , the New York Times , and other major media companies .
Some propaganda campaigns are jointly initiated by government and media ; all of them require the collaboration of the mass media .
The secret of the unidirectionality of the politics of media propaganda campaigns is the multiple filter system discussed above : the mass media will allow any stories that are hurtful to large interests to peter out quickly , if they surface at all .
For stories that are useful , the process will get under way with a series of government leaks , press conferences , white papers , etc. , or with one or more of the mass media starting the ball rolling with such articles as Barron and Paul 's " Murder of a Gentle Land " ( Cambodia ) , or Claire Sterling 's " The Plot to Kill the Pope , " both in the Reader 's Digest .
If the other major media like the story , they will follow it up with their own versions , and the matter quickly becomes newsworthy by familiarity .
If the articles are written in an assured and convincing style , are subject to no criticisms or alternative interpretations in the mass media , and command support by authority figures , the propaganda themes quickly become established as true even without real evidence .
This tends to close out dissenting views even more comprehensively , as they would now conflict with an already established popular belief .
This in turn opens up further opportunities for still more inflated claims , as these can be made without fear of serious repercussions .
Similar wild assertions made in contradiction of official views would elicit powerful flak , so that such an inflation process would be controlled by the government and the market .
No such protections exist with system - supportive claims ; there , flak will tend to press the media to greater hysteria in the face of enemy evil .
The media not only suspend critical judgment and investigative zeal , they compete to find ways of putting the newly established truth in a supportive light .
Themes and facts - even careful and well - documented analyses - that are incompatible with the now institutionalized theme are suppressed or ignored .
If the theme collapses of its own burden of fabrications , the mass media will quietly fold their tents and move on to another topic .
Using a propaganda model , we would not only anticipate definitions of worth based on utility , and dichotomous attention based on the same criterion , we would also expect the news stories about worthy and unworthy victims ( or enemy and friendly states ) to differ in quality .
That is , we would expect official sources of the United States and its client regimes to be used heavily - and uncritically - in connection with one 's own abuses and those of friendly governments , while refugees and other dissident sources will be used in dealing with enemies .
We would anticipate the uncritical acceptance of certain premises in dealing with self and friends - such as that one 's own state and leaders seek peace and democracy , oppose terrorism , and tell the truth - premises which will not be applied in treating enemy states .
We would expect different criteria of evaluation to be employed , so that what is villainy in enemy states will be presented as an incidental background fact in the case of oneself and friends .
What is on the agenda in treating one case will be off the agenda in discussing the other .
We would also expect great investigatory zeal in the search for enemy villainy and the responsibility of high officials for abuses in enemy states , but diminished enterprise in examining such matters in connection with one 's own and friendly states .
The quality of coverage should also be displayed more directly and crudely in placement , headlining , word usage , and other modes of mobilizing interest and outrage .
In the opinion columns , we would anticipate sharp restraints on the range of opinion allowed expression .
Our hypothesis is that worthy victims will be featured prominently and dramatically , that they will be humanized , and that their victimization will receive the detail and context in story construction that will generate reader interest and sympathetic emotion .
In contrast , unworthy victims will merit only slight detail , minimal humanization , and little context that will excite and enrage .
Meanwhile , because of the power of establishment sources , the flak machines , and anti-Communist ideology , we would anticipate outcries that the worthy victims are being sorely neglected , that the unworthy are treated with excessive and uncritical generosity , that the media 's liberal , adversarial ( if not subversive ) hostility to government explains our difficulties in mustering support for the latest national venture in counterrevolutionary intervention .
In sum , a propaganda approach to media coverage suggests a systematic and highly political dichotomization in news coverage based on serviceability to important domestic power interests .
This should be observable in dichotomized choices of story and in the volume and quality of coverage ... such dichotomization in the mass media is massive and systematic : not only are choices for publicity and suppression comprehensible in terms of system advantage , but the modes of handling favored and inconvenient materials ( placement , tone , context , fullness of treatment ) differ in ways that serve political ends .

Former Autodesk CEO Carol Bartz , credited for that company 's turnaround , has agreed to face another challenge , but on a much larger scale , accepting an offer to become Yahoo CEO .

Yahoo's Bartz : Safe Choice , Not Necessarily The Right One
Sue Decker Quits Yahoo
Sue Decker 's Farewell Memo
An Ex-Yahoo's Advice For Carol : Beware Yahoo's ' Say No ' Culture
A former Yahoo executive yesterday told us that inside the company , Carol is considered an ally to Yahoo president Sue Decker and Yahoo ad sales boss Hilary Schneider -- a sign that both top executives may stay with the company under the new boss .
Because Carol sits on the Intel board alongside Decker and with former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang on Cisco 's board , this former Yahoo executive went so far as to call Carol a " board buddy " of Yahoo 's current top management .
This source also questioned the relevancy of Carol 's background at a software firm to the media and Internet industries in which Yahoo competes .
Still , Yahoo analyst Matin Pyykkonen told CNBC the move is " an overall positive for Yahoo , " and one reader offered this glowing review after learning Yahoo was considering Carol for the CEO gig :
Carol is one of the brightest and toughest CEO 's in valley history .
She grew Autodesk from a small $ 250 million company to a billion dollar venture .
Along the way the company became the dominant company in it 's sector .
On her first day at Autodesk , she was diagnosed with cancer .
She took 30 days off for agressive treatment and , as promised , returned to work a month later .
She was still very sick and feeling the effects of continuing chemotherapy .
She would arrive early and puke in the parking lot , then go to work .
She 's a very smart manager .
One of the reasons Autodesk did so well is that she iknows how to run a very tight and lean enterprise .
I have no doubt she can do the restructuring and cost cutting part of what is needed at Yahoo .
She can certainly shape the company up financially and structurly .
You are right , however , about her experience in the consumer space .
What I do know about her is that she knows what she does n't know .
She 's a fast study and will surround herself with very smart people .
Carol is a real talent .
They could do worse .
Here 's how shareholders are reacting to the news :
Big questions remain about what Carol will mean for Yahoo .
Will the Microsoft search deal finally happen ?
Will a AOL - Yahoo merger talks -- which advanced far enough that media execs from both companies spent two days planning how to mash their sites together -- finally resolve ?
More reader reactions from our post , " The Real Carol Bartz : Assessing Yahoo's New CEO Crush " :
I was at Autodesk 2003 – 2007 .
There ’s no doubt that Carol was very smart and very perceptive .
But , she relied on her staff ( most Carl Bass ) to do most of the thinking and implementation .
One can argue that this is the job of a CEO , but like most ex-Sales people , Carol was not a visionary .
She was a strong organizer / director .
What I found appalling , though , was that she only worked 1 ½ - 2 days / wk on adsk business .
The rest was on external board related stuff ( boards that she sat on ) and her personal time .
If Yahoo wants a part - time CEO , who is not a visionary — she ’d be a great choice .
I do n't know Carol Bartz personally but her reputation for years has been as " generic CEO " .
Autodesk has been one of the stodigest companies in the valley the whole time she has been there .
She was always on the shortlist for big CEO jobs literally going back to the mid 90's -- she was always on any list put together by any recruiter -- but always just stayed at Autodesk .
I assume she is a fine board member of Intel and Cisco but I would observe that it is very hard to find female CEO 's to put on boards out here , and a lot of diversity pressure .
If they do hire Carol Bartz , one upside surprise in the hire is that she actually does have a technology / software background .
That was not a requirement going into the search .
I 'm not sure Carol is a real candidate , but I 've known / watched Carol for nearly 20 years ; going back to her days at Sun , where she led services .
Her historical strengths are well documented :
- she understands how to pursue , build , and execute on consensus themes .
Autodesk was a zero sum gain until she put the company on another trajectory .
Autodesk may not be exciting by today 's web standards , but it was a company with massive potential , which then failed to capitalize on an immense market lead .
Sound familiar ?
Carol came in and uprighted the company and set it back on the path to regaining the stature it deserved .
- her relationships with internal teams / leadership and external influencing sources has been thoroughly tested and she earns very high marks from everyone
- she is extremely customer / market driven
- she has a fondness for great engineering
- she is very prudent about which challenges she takes on and she has rarely failed
Her perceived weaknesses might be :
- she has never mingled with the web fanboy club so the perception will be that while web business execution relies on many of the same principles of software business execution , her new audience may not understand
- her age may hinder her ability to secure support internally .
Her efforts to make a multi-billion dollar company successful may be thwarted by those who believe web success only requires 4 good developers and a few hundred k in start up funding
Yes ; she commuted to Autodesk in a limo .
She had " retired " from Sun when Autodesk recruited her .
She was not going to move and the commute sucked .
She figured out a clever way to resolve the issue , which allowed her to be productive during what would normally be downtime .
Frankly , I like that kind of thinking .
In summary ; focus on her demonstrated abilities to execute because that is what Yahoo has failed to accomplish .
When Carol Bartz took over Autodesk , it was a Programmer 's Paradise .
She kicked some serious @$$ and put in a real management structure .
And fought breast cancer at the same time .
A few years later when the dotbomb was about to drop , she has the foresight to cut to the bone in advance .
As a result Autodesk was able to rebuild later and went on a real growth spree .
She does n't have specific web / consumer experience , but I think Yahoo needs a strong leader at the top .
Anybody who thinks Bartz will play second fiddle ( as one commentor suggested ) does not know what they are talking about .
She has zero web chops .
That 's the answer .
AUTOCAD is a non competitor leader .
3D studioMax , Maya and other are just softwares Autodesk clients use togheter with AUTOCAD .
She is not the ideal leader for a in - troubles company , surrounded by new competitors every day .
In addition , Yahoo need to focus its businees line , fired no money - maker apps .
Autodesk fortune is on its perfect program , Autocad , very special , very powerfull , but just ONE !
Media company business it 's more like the ocean , and Autodesk lives on Everest top .
Good news and bad news : Good : hard nosed ceo ; public co experience , accomplished and successful , good relationships and wall street cred .
Has already told Decker she is out .
Bad News : Zero internet experience .
Loves engineering so she will try to compete w/ google .
Limo's to work every day ( great , another prima donna ) .
60 years old and not in touch with consumers who actually may use her product .
No consumer experience Question marks : Will Jerry stay or go .
If he stays , because Y needs " internet " experience , she is doomed and Y is doomed .
What is her strategy ???
Her negs are such that she really needs to answer the strategy question ( " where should we focus ? " remains the fundamental challenge ) so successfully to allay concerns that she does n't really understand the business .
then obviously her ability to bring in a team that can execute incredibly well ( and in this case they 're going to need to make axelrod / plouffe look like laurel / hardy if they 're going to pull it off ) and bring in the expertise she lacks .
Bartz is another Fiorina -- a * superstar * CEO whose reputation precedes their ability .
The market 's focus on CEO 's is absurd .
Companies are organizations composed of many , many actors .
Bartz 's success is based upon the excellent organization at Autodesk which built itself ( Yes , Virginia , companies are often self - organizing . ) on a great product in a growing market with the right trends .

My Opinion of Most of Today 's Herb .
My Opinion of most of today ’s herb :
For the record : IMNSHO most of the herb available today I find to be sub-par .
None of the varieties circulating today are part of my repertoire for a reason .
None of it occupies my personal stash for the same reasons .
Some of the hashish I am encountering is gaining in purity ( mainly due to technique and process such as vacuum distilled , pharmaceutically pure ether extracts or gas / columnar extractions , etc. ) but still lacking in quality and overall desirability .
Hopefully soon someone will have enough quality varieties going to produce some good herb , resins and oil .
My personal stash is 100 % of my own making .
The main problem I encounter with current day herb is that of bland potency , usually resulting in some form of discomfort or anxiety inducing effect .
The second most common problem I encounter with today ’s herb is tolerance burnout .
The next most common problems I find is short duration of high and a very low ceiling to the high — meaning that the ‘ high ’ is short lived and that the more of it consumed does not broaden the experience .
Another problem I encounter has to do with duration of shelf life , though this may be as much due to curing technique as genetics .
I recently sampled a variety called “ Grunk ” ( for Grape / Skunk I ’m assuming ) that looked and tasted great , it had a strong punch that was acceptable , but the duration of the high was miniscule .
Also , the tolerance burnout of the Grunk was quickly achieved negating whatever desirability it possessed .
I am sorry to seem like such a pot snob , but I feel compelled to be honest about the subject .
I have had discussions with some commercial producers who insist upon growing plants that produce the greatest bulk of highly potent but not very desirable product from an always limited space
They ask my opinion and I suggested F - 13 ( and today would recommend either F - 13 , Vanilluna or flo ) to which they scoff ; “ I get 15 % more production with my ‘ brand - x super bud ’. ”
I try to argue that 15 % more mediocre herb is just that : 15 % more mediocre herb .
It is hopefully merely a matter of time before demand inspires an increase in commercial quality of herb , and truly sincere entrepreneurs rise to the occasion to once again produce , import and distribute a truly quality product .
A relevant story here is the one about the time we ( Americans ) came the closest to legalizing herb .
This was in 1978 when 11 states decriminalized possession laws .
In my opinion , much of that progress is directly related to the fact that there was so much really good herb commercially available then .
1978 was the time that the highland sativa ( Oaxaca , Thai , Colombia , etc. ) occupied a large niche in the commercial market .
This fact was due to the efforts and cooperation of producers / importers and distributors who made a concerted effort to satisfy the quality demands of a public that had the opportunities to experience so much high quality offerings , a public with the ability to exercised that choice .
The hashish of the era was also some of the best — also due to production / importation / distribution choices made toward quality .
Ideally , a 15 % reduction of production in lieu of increased quality and desirability would increase the value ( and demand ) of the overall product by more than 15 % .
Again , hopefully , this will merely be a matter of time as more sincere efforts are focused on quality production .
A good example of what I am referring to would be the wine industry and the production / distribution and sales of ‘ fortified ’ wines .
Sure , some people may appreciate the bland potency and economy of ethylene glycol ( anti- freeze ) added to their wine , but there really is no acceptable quality substitute for a fine Merlot , Pinot or Chardonnay .
Some argue that the medical community often demands certain extreme potencies for reduction of specific pains and ailments .
My response is that given the choice , most people will choose desirable quality over bland potency every time .

California's PG&E Announces 500 MW Solar Initiative
February 24th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
California utility PG&E has been a reluctant investor in renewable energy — until now .
The utility announced yesterday a five - year plan to produce 500 MW of solar energy from a collection of midsize projects located in Northern and Central California .
That ’s enough power for 150,000 homes and 1.3 percent of PG&E ’s electrical demands ..
The solar panels will be mounted on rooftops and utility poles .
PG&E ’s last major direct investment in renewable energy was 10 years ago .
Since then , it has only bought electricity from third party sources .
The utility ’s new project should help California reach its goal of 33 percent renewable energy by 2020 .
The plan is expected to be approved by the state ’s Public Utilities Commission later this year and will likely be implemented by 2015 .

The Daily Telegraph .
A man has launched a campaign in Japan to convince the government that people are in need of a law that would allow marriages with comic characters
In one week , more than 1,000 people have signed Taichi Takashita 's on - line petition , according toTakashita decided to launch an online appeal hoping to get one million signatures which would later be presented to the government of Japan .
He said : " I am no longer interested in three dimensions .
I would even like to become a resident of the two - dimensional world .
" However , that seems impossible with present - day technology .
Therefore , at the very least , would it be possible to legally authorise marriage with a two - dimensional character ?
" Comic books known as " manga " , animated " anime " films and on - line virtual reality games have become increasingly popular in Japan , with fictitious characters frequently elevated to celebrity status .
One person who supported the petition , wrote : " For a long time I have only been able to fall in love with two - dimensional people and currently I have someone I really love .
" Even if she is fictional , it is still loving someone .
I would like to have legal approval for this system at any cost .

WHY THE HONEY BEE IS DECLINING
To put the qualms of anthropomorphizing aside , the short answer ( for the folks making chit chat ) :
Bees are fed up with the way we treat the dirt and not gonna take it anymore !
They are pissed !
Longer answer :
It 's not CCD colony collapse distortion we are dealing with , it 's PCD : People Collapse Disorder .
You can tell the world !
Collapse Disorder is from having no interest in the foundation of our ecosystem .
Rather , our history is a longstanding anthropocentric domination of the landscape .
Science got shafted .
We all did !
This sucks !
Everything is this illusion of control .
The goals of our technologies are not conducive to the well - being of our species or life on the planet but founded on the phony idea of profit as the only success in life .
Land is simple because it is just everything out there .
We try to make it complex by being just one thing .
It 's a cultural definition of “ food ” or “ lawn . ”
The time to keep it as such is money .
The acknowledgement of our surroundings wastes time .
Be afraid .
Are you really gonna sell me " Sterility is the answer ? "
Something mediocre that provides income right now ?
We do n't know anything .
Every action is a futile effort .
coumaphos foomafoss .
Fight the mite and say goodnight !
Protect the bees and buzz with ease .
These emergency , section 18 , under - the - EPA nerve agents now lace most beeswax in the country and shorten bee life spans - what about the microbes ?
- while the targeted varroa mite enjoys its quickly - adapted , chemical - resistant genetics .
I ’ve seen resistant mites crawling merrily on the treatment strips !
jitterbuggin out .
Our most “ advanced ” science now a national catastrophe , and somebody made money .
And , you know , somebody stayed in business without ever using it .
It 's quicksand , dawg .
I 'm just jaded because before I knew , I handled a lot of coumaphos with my bare hands while working in commercial bee outfits .
What is an experiment with so many unforeseen variables ?
We have infinite variables in the hive - I lost the citation for that .
How can you pin down a house , a car , or a bee hive as objects when everything is just a process of patterns , decay and renewal ?
To assign additional value to these things is going against their nature .
Is anyone insulted ?
Our interference is demeaning to the eons - old shared genetic wisdom that has evolved its own niche in our world .
It is demeaning to us , who apparently more than any other species have the capability of altering environments , either in support of or against biodiversity .
We can not act on a false knowledge and expect living things to flourish without artificial crutches .
It 's a system .
A boat with a hole in the foundational level .
We are sinking more with each new attempt to sustain it .
There are bees out there who are learning to swim .
Our Lack of Connection :
Lack of beekeepers , young people interested in apiculture and farming in general
Inhibitive costs of starting beehives
Government , our USDA bee labs , and private university research , sponsored and controlled by agrichemical companies made rich , lately , by ubiquitous , unchecked neonicotinoids – farmers AND HOMEOWNERS using imidacloprid and other systemics in products like Gaucho and Merit - section 18 chemicals unregulated by the EPA , shown to compromise the insect nervous system but used in the US anyway !
Now more popular than Round Up .
Generational knowledge gaps in stewarding bees and subsistence lifestyle .
In 2008 the USDA announced that by 2012 the U.S. will be importing at least 40 % of its produce , mostly from China .
Lack of forage .
What ’s going on here ?
Corn corn corn !
Corn , cotton , and soy .
The 3 most invasive plants in the country .
Lack of biodiversity – poor nutrition for bees from monoculture farming - demands of moving hives
Lack of genetic diversity - a hundred years of pushing for “ better bees , ” artificial breeding
Oversized bees , overused comb
Mites , pests , fungi , bacterium – often blamed as the problem , though are symptoms of an already compromised immunity , or what some call stress .
The industry takes a “ nuc the enemy ” approach strengthening the mite genetic makeup - no trust in the bees ability to cope , no balance allowed to evolve – poisons used inside the hive showing fatal residuals and microbial imbalances .
you all know that thymol makes the bee 's wax cuticle more permeable to toxins , right ?
Feelings of panic / chaos .
Hurry and worry sound the same and mean to same thing .
The Revolution is overdue and the late fees are self - replicating .
Where do we find ourselves in 2009 ?
Happy ?
Bitter ?
In the past few generations we have nearly lost all semblance of living off our cooperative land , the ability to find joy in what we already have , and the courage to slow down , appreciate , and aid the natural cycles .
It ’s OK .
Rather than the competitive isolation and egotism that drives our capitalist system now we must reapply ourselves to diversity , community , and energy .
Resentment is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die !
COMMERCIAL BEEKEEPERS ARE NOT THE ENEMY .
Pointing the finger never helps dig up and boil the problem , be it among our families , circles of friends , or our governmental relations and how we think our justice system works .
Damning a small manifestation of the ills brought about by our economic system does not create change .
Change is positive and resets things to let them grow .
It starts immediately … wait , it has already started .
No one wants to see bees die , especially those that rely on them for their livelihood .
Migratory pollinators , queen breeders , honey packers , and others that make their living from bees are doing all they can to keep hives alive in a system of land management that poisons and malnourishes our bees .
Because of the diligent work and innovative methods in the beekeeping industry , we still have food on our tables in this country .
But it is too much for us , the bees , and the atmosphere .
The beekeeping industry is folding before our eyes , starting long before CCD came into the picture .
Our entire system of food production and distribution , the way we live in cities , what our generation has relied on and not questioned , are about to be turned upside down .
The courage now is in acting on a new vision .
The future will see many people growing their own food and working to help each other be caretakers of the landscape and create diversity .
Clean water falls from the sky , our most valuable energy is stored in our own bodies , and one glorious solution rises in the east every morning … on a bee hive in every backyard .
This is yippie hippie stuff .
For the right now : more hives than televisions .
That ’s our goal at Anarchy Apiaries .
Many of my friends and I believe we are now at the next cataclysm for our species .
That quick leap of evolution that happens everyso often millenia .
It staggers along and does n’t change much for thousands of years , sometimes millennia , until suddenly , WHAM , major events redefine the relationships on the planet .
We fondly refer to this as “ the sh*t hitting the fan , ” a familial phrase that strengthens our bonds .
This could occur through population crash brought on by famine , disease , ecological disaster , ice age , or nuclear war / fallout , though our work with the natural world leads us to one optimistic , ultimate solution : our AGREEMENT .
When we agree , our divisions dissolve and we become free .
The whole “ survival of the fittest ” dogma is a point of view founded on animosity , competition , and hatred that still permeates our social structure .
Even Darwin did n’t like the way it was going .
Our world is a Survival of the Kindest .
To redefine what it means to be human in the next phase , we will build a world with love and trust for each other and all life .
This is not a hippie - dream of rainbows and flowers but an obligatory call to action , to take down hierarchical power structures and free the planet .
We are not alone .
We need only look to the precedents of symbiosis already in our world and release them from exploitative control .
Bees and flowering plants have been dancing together for 100 million years .
The bees can guide us to a new paradigm .
To be a natural bee - steward in this way is truly carrying a torch .
After years spent in honey bee death camps ( despite the honest and dishonest efforts of so many good people ) , I have seen bees thrive again by abandoning the mechanizations thought to make beekeeping more “ profitable ” at the cost of the bees ’ long term health .
Gurus in natural beekeeping have laid the groundwork to reverse these trends .
Do I claim my bees are survivors ?
Usually most survive , yes .
Do I claim they are productive ?
Hey , man , my bees do n't work for you , me , or anybody .
They are bees .
When times are good , like Hudson Valley NY in 2010 , they do really well .
SMALL CELL BEEKEEPING
( hey , do these come in my size ? )
Dee and Ed Lusby in Arizona were the first to promote a smaller , closer - to - natural cell size comb .
As far as we know , the Lusby 's are the only commercial scale beekeepers who never treated their bees for varroa mites .
A lot of honey is made out there in the desert .
Dee started the yahoo organic beekeepers newsgroup and hosts the National Organic Beekeeping Conference in February in Arizona .
Her writing can be found in the POV section of beesource.com .
For over 100 years the beekeeping industry has been oversizing bees , typical capital - driven thinking “ bigger is better , ” bigger bees make more honey .
It was only a matter of time before an opportunist arrived that really took advantage of an oversized bee .
That pest is apparently the varroa mite .
I discovered that bees , when shook from “ standard ” beehive comb into an empty box with no hexagon - ridged foundations , will build a slightly smaller size wax cell than they had been forced to previously .
Once a generation of bees hatches from that smaller sized comb and is shook again into an empty box , they construct an even smaller cell for their broodnest core .
By allowing each generation of bees to draw its own comb , the width of the cells in the core brood area shrinks and seems to stabilize after 6 to 7 generations at a much smaller size than the ubiquitous industry standard .
Once this cell size is reached , the bees are able to keep varroa mites below life - threatening levels and secondary diseases are less frequent , perhaps do to less stress .
I will not offer you any data on this other than my own observations .
More so , from what I 've seen , the hive ’s morale is off the charts , incomparable to large cell hives .
Today , smaller sized ( 4.9 mm ) foundation is available from bee supply companies , as well as intermediary steps ( 5.1 mm ) , so often the regression can be completed in two actions of having the bees draw all new combs .
This is still difficult to complete in a single year , especially up north .
An all - plastic fully drawn smaller cell comb , with plastic cell walls , called Honey Super Cell can “ instantly ” downsize the bees .
I hear many bees often will use mann lake pf -120s , which are smaller cell size .
Then once a generation of smaller bees hatches , this plastic can be removed and the bees allowed to draw wax again .
( They hate plastic . )
Caught swarms are already on their way and are not at an advantage being shaken onto more than one established comb .
The small cell camp figures , at the time of varroa mite introduction , most wild hives were first generation swarms from domestic hives and not fully regressed to a natural cell size .
Thus we saw most feral hives disappear when varroa came .
They are slowly coming back .
Some never died .
I beelieve in my heart .
Some bees can not be killed .
This past summer when the oldest intact beehives ( 3000 years old ) ever discovered were exhumed in Israel and still had comb in them , what was the cell size ?
Did anyone look at the cell size in eastern Russia when the USDA discovered that the honey bees there were thriving in the presence of varroa ?
Of course the imported Russian queens were introduced right onto 5.4 mm comb .
Is all this cell - size stuff true ?
I do n't know .
Do I count mites in my hives ?
No . I do n't care .
Small cell beekeeping is not a silver bullet .
Studies have argued that smaller comb does not reduce mite counts , but this kind of beekeeping is not about getting lower mite counts or eradicating the “ enemy ” but a means of alleviating stress on bees to let them find their own balance after a period of healing .
This is a more holistic beekeeping .
As my bees became stable on smaller size comb , my life changed .
Suddenly one frame of brood hatched out twice as many bees as I expected .
Queens laid better patterns and faster .
The hives seemed inspired in a way I had never seen in my six years of commercial beekeeping .
After years of seeing struggle , death , and darkness in the bee industry , now I do n’t worry about anything anymore .
I also see plenty of large cell hives in small operations thriving without treatments .
I often believe that a hive gets sick only after prolongued broodrearing - from swarm prevention and stimulative feeding .
Do n't blame the beekeepers .
In most cases , their hands are tied .
TOP BAR HIVES
Once my hives were established on small cell comb , I stopped using foundation .
Less mechanization , labor , and energy while stepping aside to let the bees do what only they know best .
After all , they ’ve been using the social system for 80 million years .
I used 3 - frame nucs ( baby hives ) and have the bees draw new comb from scratch in between two drawn frames .
These small hives want to draw mostly worker comb to establish a field force , and they do so perfectly often having cell sizes down to 4.7 mm , and I think smaller , here in New York state .
I will never buy foundation again .
This works for me , maybe not for you .
I looked for a more efficient bee house – one that takes less energy and materials to build but can still allow for inspections .
The history of top bar hives predates the modern commercial model by untold thousands of years .
The Langstroth hive we use today was popularized during the Industrial Revolution , when beekeeping was becoming a profitable business and needed to be standardized for suppliers to create monopoly .
Suddenly , the box hive was in every corner of the world .
Also as suddenly , new diseases appeared like foul brood , sac brood , nosema , chalk brood ...
Combs were being spun and saved every year and harboring pathogens .
Bees were being shared and shuffled around the country and spreading disease .
The swarming instinct was and still is suppressed .
Major die - offs began to occur immediately , and have continued in about every decade since , the latest being called CCD .
Even though the manipulation of movable combs brought about these new diseases , the industry declared war on feral bees and the old - school , “ unscientific ” beekeeping as dark pools of disease .
Every state passed laws banning fixed comb hives that do n’t allow easy inspection – the homemade skeps and gums – further locking beekeepers into the new industrial model .
With the passing of a generation , all other types of bee houses and methods were forgotten .
To purchase a complete hive today with bees and the necessary gear , costs can range up to $ 400 .
The hive kits come complete with plastic , oversized foundation and a line of chemical treatments and gadgets to hopefully keep the bees alive .
In redesigning my beekeeping , I found top bar hives an affordable and easy - to - manage system .
Are bees in a top bar hive healthier ?
I observe that the bees are less anxious and grow as fast as or faster than Langstroth hives .
However , a comparison in survival must make note of a different kind of management .
In changing the way I built the boxes , I also changed the way I manage the hives .
In the core brood nest – the front half to two - thirds of the hive , I do not interchange or space out comb .
The bees follow their own cycles , design their own comb , and raise their own queens , processes that most Langstroth beekeepers are trying to control .
However , they fight with money , and I fight with time .
They will run out of money before I run out of time .
( I stole that from Utah Phillips . )
Keeping top bar hives , and everything I strive for , is about the irreducible minimum .
All you need to work this hive is a means for collecting honey , though a veil is good to have around as well as a means of blowing smoke on the bees every once in a while .
The system goes against the grain of an industry burdened with inventions .
Beekeepers are certainly a creative lot , but creativity also lies in simplicity and appreciating functionality .
Rather than solutions depending on action where you are , think of restarting and NOT doing this , CULLING out this unnecessary step .
Slow down and interfere less , and problems that arise will most likely take care of themselves with time .
A honey flow is just around the corner .
Our mental calamity is one of this Age of Alienation ’s greatest achievements .
A top bar hive requires NONE of the following :
• A lot of money .
• Protective gear ( Optional .
If you want to avoid stings , do not keep bees .
I never wear a veil with my 200 hives .
Ever .
Stings are rare once you learn how to move like fluid .
The bees are excellent teachers .
Getting stung is a blessing . )
• Smoker ( a smudge works just as well ) .
Bees allowed to build their own comb are a more cohesive family , less stressed , and calmer .
The method of going one bar at a time causes little disturbance .
• Hive tool ( a knife , sharp antler or rock is fine )
• Extractor ( a waste of time , finances , and energy )
• Chemical miticides , antibiotics ( do n’t get me started on this again )
• Artificial sugar / protein feed ( bees benefit from feed and this is your choice .
In some locations the bees might need feed in a dearth until they are adapted .
When you get your first crop of honey , save some combs for emergencies )
• A storage facility .
No storage means no trouble with wax moths and no transmitting foulbrood or possibly nosema ceranae and CCD next year .
• A strong back .
No heavy boxes to lift .
Brood is easily inspected at any time .
• College degree in woodworking .
These can be built with just a few saw cuts and screws .
• Bee friendly neighbors .
It looks like a nice planter , not those stacked , square harbingers of pain our society has been trained to fear .
This is an ideal hive for any backyard or rooftop anywhere .
• Your own land .
Folks love bees these days .
Some just might not know it yet .

The carbon molecules in graphene ( top ) each possess only three bonds , leaving free electrons to conduct charge .
Adding hydrogen ( bottom ) creates a fourth bond , locking up the free electrons and converting the sheet to an insulating state ( Image : Science )
Computer processors may soon have one fundamental aspect in common with their owners – a structure composed largely of carbon , rather than silicon .
Graphene , carbon arranged in atom - thick sheets , is already known to be an excellent conductor , but electronics requires the ability to insulate too , as well as electrical properties in between those two extremes .
Now research has shown that the material can be easily modified to act as an insulator , paving the way for efficient all - carbon electronics ( see our feature What happens when silicon can shrink no more ? ) .
Advertisement
The semiconductor industry exploits the “ whole periodic table ” to manufacture its components , says Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester , UK .
“ But what if a single material is modified so that it covers the entire spectrum needed for electronics ? ”
Graphene could be that material , he says .
Using a single material could simplify construction and allow near - seamless interconnections between conductors and semiconductors – currently as much of a headache for the chip manufacturers as the need to constantly shrink transistors .
Just add hydrogen
Discovered in 2004 , graphene is made from sheets of carbon atoms in a hexagonal “ chicken wire ” arrangement .
The material is an ideal conductor – electrons whiz through the layers at near the speed of light .
Novoselov and colleagues have shown the material can be easily modified to act as an insulator by adding hydrogen atoms to its surface .
The new material – called graphane – is made by exposing a graphene sheet to ionised hydrogen gas for two hours .
The carbon - hydrogen bonds created lock away electrons that in graphene are free to move as current .
Alex Savchenko at the University of Exeter in the UK thinks the new find is significant .
“ In electronics , all digital elements – transistors – switch signals on and off , so they should have a large difference between the open and closed - state resistances , ” he says .
Graphene ordinarily lacks that “ band gap ” , and finding a way to add it has kept physicists busy in recent years .
One - sheet wonder
“ The new study offers perhaps [ the most ] practical solution , ” Savchenko says .
Using the technique , it is possible to tune the graphene to be conductor , insulator , or anything in between .
That paves the way for a sheet of graphene to be transformed into a working chip with conductive interconnections and semiconducting transistors simply by changing its chemistry in different areas .
Novoselov ’s study comes a week after Philip Shemella and Saroj Nayak at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , New York , reported a similar insulating effect by depositing pure graphene on a silicon - dioxide substrate ( Applied Physics Letters , DOI : 10.1063/1.3070238 ) .
The researchers found that the oxygen atoms in the substrate form covalent bonds with the graphene , which has the same effect as bonding with hydrogen – it turns the graphene into an insulator .
“ The discovery of graphane and our results are related , ” says Shemella .
“ Both studies are interesting for extending the versatility of graphene - based structures . ”

Russia has been plagued by racist attacks in recent years A Moscow court has found seven skinheads guilty of 20 racially motivated murders in Russia 's capital .
The court said the gang had carried out the killings between August 2006 and October 2007 and had also tried to murder 12 other people .
Prosecutors said the defendants - most of whom were minors at the time of the attacks - had formed a gang to target non-Slavic migrants in the city .
The court is due to begin considering the sentences on Thursday .
Two other members of the gang were acquitted for lack of evidence .
Leniency plea
During the trial , the prosecution argued that the defendants had formed an organised group with the aim of murdering migrants from Asian and Caucasian regions of the former Soviet Union .
In other words , they targeted people who did not look white , or Slavic , the BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow reports .
The trial was conducted behind closed doors , and for that reason exact details of the case are few , our correspondent says .
But Russian media reports say some of the accused readily admitted their guilt - even appearing to take pride in what they had done .
A court spokeswoman said the jury had decided that all of those convicted - with the exception of two identified as the organisers of the gang - deserved leniency .
The spokeswoman said the maximum prison term for a minor under Russian law was 10 years .
Even in a city frequently plagued by racist violence , this gang 's crimes stand out , our correspondent says .
Russia has been plagued by a series of racially motivated attacks , some of them fatal , in recent years .
Between January and October this year 113 people were killed in racist attacks in Russia and 340 were wounded , according to the Moscow Human Rights Bureau .

Stop repeating yourself .
Computers thrive on the mundane and their cycles are cheaper than yours .
Leave the mindless stuff to them .
Ever worked on an ad - hoc web project with a small team ?
The logistics are often painful .
Setting up new projects involves everyone tweaking server configurations .
The process of switching between projects varies between dev machines and involves a few minutes in context switch .
Deploying is a manual , 5 step process .
These repetitive tasks enable development but are not development .
We ’ve felt the pain and experienced the costs .
The obvious cost is time wasted doing things manually : minutes here and minutes there begin to add up .
As team size grows the lost productivity grows with it .
The not - so - obvious cost is perhaps far more costly : resistance .
When there ’s friction in setting up a new project on your own machine you resist trying out a co-workers ’ work .
When there ’s friction in moving between two project ’s configurations you resist moving between projects .
When there ’s friction in getting a new machine setup you resist doing secondary development on a laptop .
You get the point .
Not only do you waste time doing repeatable tasks but you resist doing repeatable tasks more often .

It turns out computers are really good at doing boring , repetitive stuff .
My New Year ’s resolution : Stop stealing their thunder .
Hunt and Thomas ’
The Pragmatic Programmer put my mind to work on identifying repetitive tasks and automating everything .
So far this has resulted in a company - wide scripting ‘ workbench ’ .
This library of bash scripts is shared across all developer machines .
The workbench is a collection of scripts that perform common development tasks .
The simple ‘ command ’ level scripts are operating system independent and can be composed into higher level ‘ macro ’ scripts .
Need to install a new project ?
Run the project install script that uses the simpler scripts to check out source , configure and restart apache , modify the tcp / ip hosts file , etc .
The script workbench is shared under a git version control system so as any developer adds a new script or improves an existing one those changes are tracked and circulated immediately .
Future posts will cover the workbench in more detail but a couple of quick notes on lessons learned thus far :
Using MinGW / MSYS makes scripting across Windows / Mac / * nix environments practically painless .
Some handy tools ( like wget ) are missing from MSYS on Windows , but armed with the core Unix utilities as well as ssh / scp ( and PuTTy ’s plink ) and git has been enough to tackle the repetitive tasks we wanted to eliminate .
The learning curve for bash scripts and unix tools like sed is not painless but is more rewarding than you may expect .
This tutorial was handy when learning how to navigate the cryptic depths of sed .
Though the syntax and regular expressions are n’t completely self - revealing , the feeling of automating common conf file manipulations with sed is pure bliss .
. Automation is an investment .
Especially if you ’re learning more about how to automate certain tasks or doing it for the first time .
Investment a few days to automate a 10 minute process that happens twice a week will not pay off immediately .
“ But why should I build a machine that automatically cleans my room ?
I rarely ever clean it . ”
Some tasks are rarely performed because they ’re rarely needed .
Other tasks are rarely performed because you rarely want to perform them .
There is a value in automating everything , but the most valuable tasks to automate are the tasks you would do a lot more of if only you did n’t have to do them .
“ Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations we can perform without thinking . ”
– Alfred North Whitehead
Invest some time in yourself and your team to automate the processes you do often and the processes you should do more often .
Create a system that allows your co-workers to benefit from each other ’s investments in automating repetitive tasks .
Foster a culture that enables your programmers to act more like programmers and less like automatons .

Enlarge By Ron Edmonds , AP Vice President Biden , left , looks on as President Obama speaks to mayors from across the country Friday in the White House .
HURRICANE KATRINA HURRICANE KATRINA
Latest news : Coverage of the Gulf Coast 's recovery Aftermath : Directly after Hurricane Katrina | Weather blog Archival graphics : Photos , satellite images , maps , audio TELL US :
How are you coping and rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina ?
WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Obama said Friday that residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast still are trying to rebuild three years after Hurricane Katrina and have not received the support they deserve from Washington .
His words amounted to sharp , though indirect , criticism of former President George W. Bush 's oversight of the Katrina recovery efforts .
Katrina was blamed for more than 1,600 deaths and $ 41 billion in property damage .
THE OVAL : Obama & Biden appeal to mayors ; pledge their help Obama promised a stepped - up and sustained commitment to the region .
" The residents of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast who are helping rebuild are heroes who believe in their communities and they are succeeding despite the fact that they have not always received the support they deserve from the federal government , " Obama said in a statement .
" We must ensure that the failures of the past are never repeated . "
Bush was widely believed to have botched the response to the devastating storm of August 2005 by being too slow to respond .
The country watched in shame as the catastrophe cemented images of Bush being out - of - touch : flying over a flooded New Orleans , praising his beleaguered emergency management chief for a " heckuva job . "
To provide more support , Obama said he would extend the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding , a position created by Bush that was set to expire at the end of this month , until September .
The president also is dispatching two Cabinet secretaries to visit New Orleans and other storm - ravaged parts of the Gulf Coast .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan will tour the region March 5 - 6 .
Also Friday , Obama told a gathering of mayors at the White House that the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package will help struggling cities , but both Washington and the mayors have a responsibility to spend the money wisely .
" The American people are watching , " Obama said .
" They need this plan to work .
They expect to see the money that they 've earned — they 've worked so hard to earn — spent in its intended purposes without waste , without inefficiency , without fraud . "
In the days since the White House and Congress came to terms on the massive economic stimulus package , the political focus has shifted to how it will work .
Obama has staked his reputation not just on the promise of 3.5 million jobs saved or created , but also on a pledge to let the public see where the money goes .
Using his presidential pulpit to discuss the economic stimulus program , Obama demanded accountability , from his friends in local government as well as his own agencies .
He said the new legislation gives him tools to " watch the taxpayers ' money with more rigor and transparency than ever , " and that he will use them .
" If a federal agency proposes a project that will waste that money , I will not hesitate to call them out on it , and put a stop to it , " he said .
" I want everyone here to be on notice that if a local government does the same , I will call them out on it , and use the full power of my office and our administration to stop it . "
He used the phrase " call them out " to mean challenge or publicly expose .
Miami Mayor Manny Diaz , who leads the U.S. Conference of Mayors , said he welcomed Obama 's warning .
" Absolutely .
We get called out every day at the local level , " Diaz said , drawing laughs from other mayors in a gathering with reporters on the White House driveway .
" We have plenty of constituents who will be doing that before the president does . "
The economic plan will inject a sudden boost of cash into transportation , education , energy and health care .
Beyond new spending , it aims to aid people through a package of tax cuts , extended unemployment benefits and short - term health insurance help .
The cost will be added to a growing budget deficit .
Also Friday , the Obama administration is holding the first meeting of its newly formed presidential task force on the auto industry .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Larry Summers will lead the meeting at the Treasury Department , administration officials said .
The administration announced the formation of the task force earlier this week after deciding not to appoint an auto czar to oversee the multibillion - dollar bailout packages extended to General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC .
The two companies submitted requests on Tuesday for an additional $ 21.6 billion .

“ IN THE old days , ” laments the retired mobster , with a broad smile , slicked hair and a heavily tattooed body , “ the yakuza served a useful purpose in society to solve civil disputes and keep the streets clean . ”
He draws on his cigarette , the stub of an amputated little finger visible in his beefy hand .
“ Now ” , he goes on , “ it has lost its samurai spirit to moneymaking . ”
Or perhaps , the yakuza — Japan 's organised - crime groups that date from the 17th century — are getting squeezed .
For most of the post - war period they operated openly : tolerated by the public , used by politicians and protected by police .
Crime will happen anyway , went the argument , so better to know whom to call when it crosses the line .
In the 1950s ministers and industrialists relied on the mobsters and nationalist groups to quash unions and socialists .
The gangs upheld classic Japanese virtues of manliness and loyalty — and paid for mistakes by slicing off one of their fingers in atonement .
But this orderly way of life is fraying .
The floundering economy has eaten into revenue from traditional activities that required muscle , such as gambling , prostitution and loan - sharking .
To compensate , the groups have ploughed into financial fraud , stock manipulation and cybercrime , giving rise to a new generation of gangster - nerds , more interested in business than blackmail .
Still , the yakuza boasts 84,000 members ( of whom half are “ part - timers ” ) and is estimated to haul in as much as ¥ 2 trillion ( around $ 21 billion ) annually .
Moreover , the public has become slightly less accepting after bouts of mob violence , traditionally hidden , that claimed innocent lives .
On February 20th around 160 people from Tokyo's Akasaka district sought a court injunction to bar Inagawa - kai , a big crime syndicate , from occupying an office building , arguing that it might bring violence to the area .
In August residents of the city of Kurume sought a similar injunction against a local gang .
A 1992 anti-mob law clearly defined illegal behaviour and penalised companies with yakuza ties .
It also established a non-profit group called the National Centre for the Elimination of Boryokudan ( crime syndicates ) , to advise companies on avoiding the yakuza and rally citizens to complain , as in the recent suits .
But the law is not all that it seems .
The nationwide centres it created , grumble both senior police and racketeers , provide lucrative sinecures for retired police officers .
This recalls amakudari , or “ descent from heaven ” — the practice of rewarding government officials with cushy , post - retirement jobs in the area of their official responsibility .
Companies are “ encouraged ” to donate to the centres , and to hire retired officers to help them comply with the law .
Owners of pachinko - parlours ( venues for a popular sort of pinball ) and others now hire security firms using former policemen .
Having yakuza at the door invites trouble with the law .
So companies are , in effect , paying off the cops rather than the mob .
Many bars and restaurants still prefer the yakuza to the police for handling troublesome customers .
The service is better .
Still , the breakdown of the traditional order irks the former crime boss .
Pondering the changes , he uses the word natsukashii ( nostalgia ) , as the smoke from his cigarette wafts into nothingness .
He said : " It dragged me across the boat and would have pulled me in had my colleague not grabbed my trousers - it was like the whole earth had just moved .
I knew it was going to a big one .
Ever since working with the Anygma team , the idea of a purely functional operating system has been stirring in my head :
An operating system that stays denotational and composable all the way down to the device drivers .
In this world , we have to make no sacrifices like IO to interface with the impure ideas around us .
We can still communicate with the outside world by modeling them in a pure way .
Just to be clear : I will not be accepting comments about the feasibility of the idea itself ( eg. do n’t say “ but the idea of an operating system is necessarily stateful ” or any of that bull ) .
Comments and criticisms about the approach I describe are more than welcome .
So this has been stirring away .
Then at Thursday ’s Boulder functional programmers group , somebody mentioned Squeak .
I had seen Squeak a long time ago , and was amazed and impressed by the concept .
There is no distinction between compile time and runtime , between source code and program .
Everything is just objects floating around in the world .
And of course this matches perfectly with the purely functional operating system idea .
It sucks to program with text .
Programs are not text .
Ultimately , programs are their denotation , but we need a representation .
I say that representation is abstract syntax .
Our program editors output abstract syntax , which the compiler turns into real objects .
Text does n’t have to enter the equation anywhere .
I do n’t think this idea fits Haskell ’s type system very well .
We need something closer to dependent types , because types have to be objects floating around in the world too .
So , while I ’m at it , I think I ’m going to make a pure language — pretty close to , but not exactly Haskell — which is the core abstraction language .
Maybe something both expressive and barebones like PiSigma .
But I ’ll need a real - world language to go on top of that .
Hubris indeed .
So !
What ’s the large - scale plan ?
I am going to assume nobody will help me ( other than to offer suggestions ) in these early stages .
This is a Grand Vision ( TM ) , and I doubt anybody but me is going to get excited enough to contribute until it starts coming together at least a little .
But I am completely excited , as this is the culmination of an idea that has been developing for years .
Oh , and that was at the beginning of the large - scale plan because excitement is the top point in my book — engineering is secondary to motivation .
I do n’t really know anything about drivers or hardware or any of that , and this undertaking is already way too huge for me .
Therefore , I ’m going to go the route of Squeak and implement an image - based sandbox — an OS inside an OS .
I ’ll start by choosing a core language and making a really slow proof - of - concept interactive text - based interpreter for it .
At that point , many options open up , depending on what I ’m inspired to do at any moment : improve the language frontend , work on graphical hooks , start work on a faster interpreter or JIT , start designing the FRP essentials , ….
As for the FRP essentials , why do I think they will be more possible in this new concept than in Haskell ?
Well , I have a sophisticated RTS extension that I think will handle that , which I will blog about riiiight … now !
( And there are a few ways to compromise in case that idea does n’t pan out )
Oh , btw , I ’m calling this project Dana , after da man Dana Scott .
This may be the most controversial column I have ever written depending upon your views concerning the use of marijuana .
Presently , the use of it is illegal for the majority of American citizens .
The use of it for medical reasons is legal in 12 states who use different criteria for the use of it .
Just recently , Michael Phelps who won eight gold medals for swimming in last year ’s Olympics was caught using marijuana as he smoked it using a water pipe .
Since then , he has apologized publicly for doing so and has lost millions in endorsements from companies like Kellogg ’s .
I feel this is a knee - jerk reaction to punish an athlete for using marijuana where some of our politicians have claimed to have used it in the past .
One such politician is our current president , Barack Obama and yet , look at what he has accomplished since he came clean in his past use of it .
He became our first African - American president and not because of his use of it , but what he was able to accomplish in serving the people .
Those companies pulling their endorsements from Phelps should reconsider .
Now here is the controversial part : Perhaps it is time to revisit this debate on whether or not to actually legalize marijuana .
It just may be a boost to our ailing economy .
If we actually legalize it to be sold in controlled businesses similar to liquor stores , just think of how the government can tax this new commodity .
It can be taxed like cigarettes and liquor presently are and those who choose to use it can come out of the closet so to speak .
This country already tried prohibition when it came to the use of alcohol and we see that it did not work .
It drove many underground to consume it in ‘ Speakeasies ’ .
It was later repealed via the 21st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
Think of the manufacturing base that can spring up around it such as making good old American bongs .
Something to think about as we see plant - after - plant close .
As many industries go belly - up , think of the many cottage industries that can spring up by selling these products .
New businesses are always a plus for an ailing economy .
In Rachael Baldwin ’s column for The Collegian , right off the bat she writes , “ The legalization of marijuana would greatly impact the U.S. economy .
According to the Drug Enforcement Administration , DEA , website , marijuana is “ America ’s most valuable crop . ”
With Washington looking for sources of cash to infuse into our economy , just think if it got down off its moral high - horse and legalized it .
Found money !
Baldwin goes onto opine , " Marijuana crops in the United States are worth about 35.8 billion dollars per year , which is 12.5 billion more dollars per year than corn , the second most profitable crop .
If taxed like alcohol and tobacco , marijuana could bring in even more money . "
I see revenue and where those who chose to smoke it , would not have to rely on this commodity coming from South America .
Just think of how this will affect those drug lords ?
Oh they will be kept busy with the production of cocaine and crystal - meth which are highly addictive drugs and should be the ones targeted .
But , if the production of marijuana and the sale of it is estimated in the billions , we can take those billions away from their deadly hands .
As congress will be looking to make cuts in certain programs such as food stamps which have been cut from this stimulus bill , Baldwin writes , " Legalization of marijuana could also save law enforcement agencies an astronomical amount of money .
Miron estimates that marijuana legalization could save the United States as much as 7.7 billion dollars in law enforcement costs per year . "
With the amount we can tax this commodity with , plus how much we can rake in growing our own crops as well as how much we can save in prosecuting any offenders :
That $ 780 billion dollar stimulus bill can be paid down in no time .
Baldwin cites in her article that marijuana is not addictive as I have read in other articles in the past and that can allay the fears of those who would oppose this legalization .
Your morning cup of coffee is far more addictive than marijuana .
Should you discontinue the use of marijuana , there are no withdrawal symptoms as there is with cigarettes .
If folks are still afraid of legalizing marijuana , Baldwin writes , " there are an estimated 435,000 deaths per year in the United States due to tobacco use and 85,000 deaths due to alcohol ... So , how many people die every year from using marijuana ?
Zero .
That ’s right , the use of marijuana alone has not been shown to cause any deaths . "
I have heard of these statistics in the past and it truly boggles the mind how liquor and cigarettes are the legal commodity instead of marijuana .
In the past , I have been resistant to this idea of legalizing marijuana , but knowing how much money it does bring in due to and underground market and seeing the facts of how safe it is compared to cigarettes and alcohol , I feel this is the time to revisit this debate .
One thing about our government is if they see dollar signs mentioned in any debate , their eyes pop open and perhaps their minds can be changed .
If the government sees something it can tax , that usually gets their attention .
Am I advocating the use of it ?
No , I am not .
That choice if we made marijuana legal would be up the adults that choose to consume it .
I say adults because there is already an age criteria for the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes .
What I have not even touched upon but equally important is the production of hemp which is also illegal in this country .
In this USA Today article , you will read , “ Hemp products still account for only a small percentage of the $ 15 billion a year market for organic goods , but the Hemp Industries Association says sales are rising by 50 % a year .
Gero Leson , an agricultural researcher in Berkeley , Calif. , says hemp products will account for about $ 15 million this year in retail food sales and $ 40 million in cosmetics and body products . ”
This was an article that was published in 2005 .
Imagine if we legalized hemp how it can help jump - start this economy .
Think of the products which are American products could be sold to consumers .
Think of the industries that can spring up surrounding this commodity .
Back when this article was published , they wrote , " Canadian farmers planted more than 24,000 acres of hemp this year , nearly triple the 2004 total . "
Why not give the farmers in this country a chance when so many have been hurt and allow them to grow these crops which are not only financially beneficial to them , but to our economy as a whole ?
Will our elected leaders think this idea is meritorious or stick to their old ways of thinking ?
Maybe it is about time that we as a people who do see the merit in legalizing marijuana and other products that come from it , should be the ones nudging our politicos along .
I know that this idea will be met with scorn from various anti-drug organizations , but as commercials remind us to drink responsibility , newer ones can say , smoke responsibly .
What Were the Cherubim ?
By W. F. Albright
Today we think of a cherub as a tiny winged boy , following the tradition of Renaissance artists .
This conception was directly borrowed from pictures of Graeco - Roman “ loves ” or Erotes , familiar to us from the excavations of Pompeii .
The actual appearance of the cherubim of the Old Testament was already forgotten before the time of Christ , and Josephus ( first century A.D. ) says that “ no one can tell what they were like . ”
Since the veil of the Tabernacle was decorated with embroidered cherubim , and the walls and the religious objects of Solomon ’s temple lavishly adorned with them .
we ought to be able to identify them in contemporary Syro- Palestinian art .
The account of the Ark of the Covenant shows that only a creature with wings can be considered .
If , therefore , we study all known representations of animals and hybrid creatures , partly animal , we find one which is much more common than any other winged creature , so much so that its identification with the cherub is certain : that is the winged sphinx or winged lion with human head .
In Egypt the wingless sphinx and the griffin appear ; in Babylonia and Assyria the winged bull with a human head prevails ; but in Syria and Palestine it is the winged sphinx which is dominant in art and religious symbolism .
The God of Israel was often designated as “ He who sitteth ( on ) the cherubim ” ( I Sam. 4:4 , etc. ) .
The conception underlying this designation is well illustrated by representations of a king seated on a throne supported on each side by cherubim , which have been found at Byblus [ Byblos ] , Hamath , and Megiddo , all dating between 1200 and 800 B.C.
One shows King Hiram of Byblus ( period of the Judges ) seated upon his cherub throne .
Pottery incense altars found at Taanach and Megiddo are archaeological parallels to the wheeled lavers ( “ bases ” ) of Solomon ’s temple , which were decorated with lions and cherubs , according to I Kings 7:36 .
The primary function of the cherub in Israelite religious symbolism is illustrated by two biblical passages .
A very ancient hymn , found twice in the Bible , has the words , “ And He rode upon a cherub and did fly ” ( I Sam . 22:11 [ 2 Sam. 22:11 ] , Ps. 18:11 [ English , Ps. 18:10 ] ) ; the second is Ezek.
10:20 .
The conception of the deity as standing or as enthroned on an animal or hybrid creature was exceedingly common in the ancient Near East , but it was most common in Syria and Northern Mesopotamia between 2000 and 700 B.C.
In Babylonia the figure of a deity is replaced in certain cases by a winged shrine and later by a thunderbolt .
So in Israelite symbolism between 1300 and 900 B.C. , the invisible Glory ( Jehovah ) was conceived as enthroned upon the golden cherubim or standing on a golden bull .

New findings suggest that pouring iron into the ocean could help absorb excess greenhouse gases — unless , that is , it does n't help at all .
Interpretations of the study , in which researchers measured carbon that fell to the deep ocean after being consumed by plankton , differed widely among media outlets , underscoring the controversial and scientifically tricky nature of iron fertilization .
Some scientists and entrepreneurs say that artificially - added iron can be used to spur blooms of CO2 - gobbling plankton — a quick , effective and relatively cheap weapon in the fight against climate change .
Other scientists and environmentalists argue that ocean dynamics are too poorly understood to support such radical action , except in small - scale tests designed to provide baseline data .
The battle reached a new level this month , when an Indo - German research team aboard the Polarstern announced their plans to conduct iron fertilization tests in the Scotia Sea , only to be accused of carelessly flouting United Nations laws .
The German government temporarily halted the project before approving it on Monday .
In the latest study , published Wednesday in Nature , researchers observed naturally - occurring iron fertilization around the Southern Ocean 's Crozet islands , where eroding , iron - rich volcanic rocks fed an Ireland - sized plankton bloom that lasted for two months .
Three times more carbon fell to the deep ocean than in a nearby , bloom - free region — a significant difference , but less than expected .
The findings were widely reported , and interpreted in wildly differing ways .
" Legal or not , this kind of ' ocean engineering ' may not suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere to reverse climate change , " reported the New Scientist .
" Seeding the oceans with iron is a viable way to permanently lock carbon away from the atmosphere and potentially tackle climate change , " said the Guardian .
" Proposals to combat global warming by sowing the sea with iron to promote carbon - gobbling plankton may be badly overblown , " opined Agence - France Presse .
" Pumping iron into the ocean could help slow climate change , " headlined the Telegraph .
At present , it 's impossible to know who 's right .
Only more research will bring a verdict .
In a press release , study co-author Gary Fones , a University of Portsmouth marine geochemist , warned against excessive caution of the sort displayed by the German government in nearly grounding the Polarstern expedition .
“ Efforts to find a solution to global warming are under threat by those people who are most concerned about climate change , " he said .
" But legitimate experiments like this one are crucial to learning more about the effects of iron fertilisation and will help scientists evaluate the merits of such a scheme . ”

The American presidency , it has been said , is the most intimate of offices .
In the modern TV era , to elect a president - or even just to observe US politics from overseas - is to invite him and his family into your home for at least four years , and to learn altogether too much information about their lives .
Bill Clinton 's sexual activities are only the most lurid example of this ; in some ways , revelations of Jimmy Carter 's habit of reading Bible passages to his wife at bedtime were just as personal .
Yet as the administration of George Bush reaches its final days , it 's hard to escape the conclusion that even the last eight horribly eventful years have n't succeeded in revealing the character of the man .
You can , of course , call him a warmonger , or a liar , or a stooge of the super - rich , or someone with reckless disregard for his compatriots faced with natural disaster .
But these are labels , not descriptions of his internal life .
Despite countless biographies and speculative newspaper and magazine articles , we 're barely any closer to answering the question that seemed pertinent back before Florida , before 9/11 , before Iraq or Katrina : what , exactly , is going on in there ?
During Bush 's first campaign in 2000 , the consensus among many liberals was that he was an idiot , a barely literate simpleton in the Chauncey Gardiner mould .
Many of the greatest Bushisms date from those early days .
" Rarely is the question asked : is our children learning ? " a windcheater - clad Bush noted during a campaign stop in South Carolina , a couple of weeks before inviting a New Hampshire audience to imagine themselves in the shoes of a single mother " working hard to put food on your family " .
But only the steeliest critic could have denied that there was something likeable about him .
His verbal gaffes , supporters explained , were part of that appeal : he was a regular American , not a Washington egghead ; his intelligence was not intellectual but practical and interpersonal .
If you mocked when you heard him speculate about the effects of the merger of Time Warner with AOL - " Will the highways to the internet become more few ? " - that said more about you than it did about him , and what it said was that you were snobbish and out of touch .
This was propaganda , of course .
But then again , you try watching Journeys With George , Alexandra Pelosi 's documentary on the 2000 campaign , without being slightly charmed as the candidate jogs up and down the press bus , demonstrating the talking - fish toy Big Mouth Billy Bass with authentic excitement .
Nobody tries to use Bush 's gaffes to defend him these days , of course ; not many people try to defend him at all .
And the interesting thing was that , as his presidency conclusively unravelled , Bush got much better at avoiding the more superficial embarrassments : he largely stopped jumbling his words , walking into doors , or raving to journalists about the " unbelievable " White House dessert menu .
( " Yesterday ... we had this , I 'm not even sure , coffee ice - cream , surrounded by this unbelievable meringue , beautiful meringue , " he 's quoted as saying in Frank Bruni 's well titled campaign memoir , Ambling Into History . )
In view of the loss of life in Iraq and Afghanistan , there are those who will argue that it 's tasteless to dwell on the Bush presidency as comic turn - that it grants him too much to acknowledge his contribution to the gaiety of the planet , given the size of his contribution to its troubles .
But the comedy and tragedy of the Bush years are inextricably bound together .
The shudder with which we 'll remember them expresses both horror and laughter , and the laughter is important for staying sane .
Amid weightier matters , future historians will surely wish to record the following highlights of the outgoing president 's comic legacy .
The slapstick comedy
If you 'd wanted to invent a story to make Bush look foolish , you might have spun a tale of him choking on a pretzel while watching a football game , blacking out , injuring himself , and waking to find his dogs Spot and Barney fussing over him in concern .
But it happened , of course , as did the moment in Beijing in 2005 when he strode from a press conference directly into a locked door .
( What 's interesting is not so much the incident itself , which was the fault of his handlers , but the frozen , baffled smirk that fixes itself on his face as he realises he 's going to have to generate an alternative course of action in order to leave the room . )
Like many others , the incident seemed planned so as to hand easy one - liners to late - night television hosts - in this case , jokes about Bush 's lack of an exit strategy .
The inexplicable moments of pedantry
His own verbal infelicities notwithstanding , Bush could be strikingly petty about the slip - ups of others , and never more so than during the first presidential debate of the 2004 election campaign , when John Kerry mocked the notion that Bush had invaded Iraq with a grand coalition of global support .
" When we went in , " Kerry said , " there were three countries : Great Britain , Australia , and the United States .
That 's not a grand coalition .
We can do better . "
It 's almost possible to take pleasure in Bush 's delight as it dawns on him that Kerry has made an error .
" He forgot Poland ! " the incumbent president crows , as if that made all the difference .
It took mere days for " You forgot Poland ! " to become an anti-Bush catchphrase , appearing on T - shirts and bumper stickers .
The Bushisms
Misspeaking will be the lasting legacy of Bush 's public performances .
But not all Bushisms are alike : they fall , fairly neatly , into three categories .
In the first and classic version , it 's easy enough to tell what the president was trying to say , even if he manages to mangle his syntax more spectacularly than you might have deemed possible .
( " Families is where our nation finds home , where wings take dream " ; " Suiciders are willing to take innocent life in order to send the projection that this is an impossible mission " ; and his immortal commentary on the difficulties facing gynaecologists : " Too many OB - GYNs are n't able to practise their love with women all across this country . " )
In the second variety , the intended meaning is still discernible , but the result is almost zen - like , hinting at deeper significance or perhaps intentional humour .
( " They misunderestimated me " ; " What we Republicans should stand for is growth in the economy : we ought to make the pie higher . " )
Only a small number are truly , majestically baffling .
" This is still a dangerous world , " Bush noted in Iowa in 2000 .
" It 's a world of madmen and uncertainty and potential mential losses . "
The incidence of good Bushisms has sharply decreased in recent years , though he was on good form last September in Washington DC , recounting a trip to the seaside .
" I did n't grow up in the ocean , " he said .
" As a matter of fact - near the ocean - I grew up in the desert .
Therefore , it was a pleasant contrast to see the ocean .
And I particularly like it when I 'm fishing . "
The knack of being in the wrong place , at the wrong time
Nobody can really blame Bush for the fact that he was reading a book called The Pet Goat with a class of Florida schoolchildren on the morning of 9/11 , though arguably he should n't have continued to do so after being informed of the attacks .
( The unfair but amusing implication of much of the mockery seemed to be that books like The Pet Goat might have been the kind he naturally preferred - that he might have been reading The Pet Goat that morning even if he'd been scheduled to have the morning off , relaxing at home . )
But it soon began to look like a pattern : when hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans , Bush was on the tarmac of the airport in Phoenix , presenting John McCain with a large cake for his 69th birthday .
( After posing for photographs , the two men abandoned the cake at the airport , where it melted in the heat . )
The record - breaking vacations
As with his verbal errors , supporters sought to portray Bush 's many weeks at Prairie Chapel Ranch , near Crawford in Texas , as a virtue .
The " western White House " was where Bush reconnected with real America , they explained - and what better way to experience the lifestyles of ordinary Americans than on a $ 1.3 m , 1,583 - acre ranch featuring four houses and a helicopter hangar ?
In 2005 , with the Iraq war at its height , Bush headed to Crawford for five weeks - the longest presidential retreat for 36 years - spending his free time with chainsaw in hand , clearing mesquite , cocklebur and other uninvited plant life .
It 's never been conclusively established how much brush really needs clearing at Prairie Chapel ; one local farmers ' representative described Bush 's brush - clearing as " highly recreational " but , to be fair , there 's no evidence of aides having distributed brush especially so that the president could clear it .
The social inappropriateness
The competition is tough , but there 's a strong case that the single most excruciating televised moment of Bush 's presidency was the unsolicited back rub he bestowed upon the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , at the G8 summit in St Petersburg in 2006 .
The encounter barely lasts three seconds , in which the president approaches Merkel from behind and grasps her neck , prompting the chancellor to throw up her arms in shock , before hastily assuming an everything 's - OK smile .
But in those three seconds , Bush 's fraternity - house jocularity makes a head - on collision with the world of diplomatic propriety , and it 's painful to watch .
The shaky grasp of geography
" Often people ask me , " Bush said last year , " ' Why is it that you 're so focused on helping the hungry and diseased in strange parts of the world ? ' "
Many parts of the world did indeed remain strange to Bush , who sought to render them more familiar by bringing his own pillow everywhere he travelled .
" Do you have blacks , too ? " he is said to have asked the Brazilian president Fernando Cardoso in 2001 , though the evidence for this anecdote is far from conclusive .
As governor of Texas , he 'd already caused a minor stir - in Slovakia and Slovenia , anyway - by confusing Slovakia and Slovenia , though by 2006 he was more focused on building " an Iran that is capable of resisting Iranian influence " .
Pretty much the only use for this thing would be to mail it to the enemy the day before the battle in gift wrap , and pray they 're stupid enough to use it .
Want to use it as a sword ?
Also too bad , you 've got to hold it by this idiotic little grip made for revolvers , and the first time you stab somebody you 're going to get the tiny little barrel on the end crammed full of bad guy guts .
So the next time you try to use it as a gun , it 's going to blow your other hand off .
Want to use it as a gun ?
Well , too bad , you 've got like 20 pounds of sword weighing down the barrel while you try to aim it with one hand .
Want to put your hand on the end there to hold it up like a rifle ?
Congratulations , you 've just joined the " I sliced off all my fingers with a fantasy weapon " club .
Oh , by the fires of agony that swirl in my tortured heart , I declare this gunsword lamer than the last Cure album !
1 The Dalek Plunger
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Used By :
The Doctor Who enemy , the Daleks .
Also janitors , plumbers , housewives and , you know , anyone who needs to plunge .
Why It Could Be Cool :
The Daleks managed to conquer the universe countless times despite their inability to climb stairs , so they have to have something going for them .
... What is this show about ?
Why It Absolutely Is Not Cool :
Records are spotty , and the stories told around campfires are probably more legend than fact , but every little Dalek soldier grows up listening to the tale of the ancient Dalek warrior Lenny , the resourceful janitor who used his plunger to single - handedly fend off an entire battalion of overflowing toilets in the Great Sewage War .
From that day forth , no Dalek has ever gone to battle without their trusty plungers .

The plunger is n't the Dalek 's main weapon -- that would be the egg whisk thing to the left -- but it 's still pretty useful .
It can open doors , move things and strangle people .
You know what else can do that ?
Hands .
Why the Daleks chose to go with plungers over hands is never quite explained in the series but , then again , neither is the fact that they only have one eye that can easily be covered with a hat .
We do n't know how close the Doctor Who universe is to ours , but if its most feared soldiers look like they were put together out of whatever was lying around the kitchen , we guess it can't be all that bad .
No wonder an unarmed , eccentrically dressed British guy with a posh accent and a phone booth time machine is able to beat them so easily .

If we may credit Louis Uchitelles January 7 report in the New York Times , mainstream economists have , in effect , declared their intellectual bankruptcy .
According to Uchitelle ,
Frightened by the recession and the credit crisis that produced it , the nations mainstream economists are embracing public spending to repair the damage even those who have long resisted a significant government role in a market system .
. . .
Hundreds of economists who gathered here [ in San Francisco ] for the annual meeting of the American Economic Association seemed to acknowledge that a profound shift had occurred .
At their last meeting , ideas about using public spending as a way to get out of a recession or about government taking a role to enhance a market system were relegated to progressives .
The mainstream was skeptical or downright hostile to such suggestions .
This time , virtually everyone voiced their support , returning to a way of thinking that had gone out of fashion in the 1970s .
At this point , one cannot help but recall Proverbs 26:11 :  As a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly . 
Modern economics suffers from a variety of weaknesses and defects , among which faddishness ranks high .
The chronic pursuit of fads , however , springs from a more serious problem : the mainstream professions faulty epistemological foundation positivist presumptions that lead economists to believe that by aping nineteenth - century physicists they are acting as scientists .
Laboring under this grave misconception , they are destined to be blown erratically by the winds of changing events .
So tenuous is the contemporary appreciation of economic verities that the slightest apparent breakdown of the economic order completely befuddles the economists and sends them running about wildly in search of a new model that will predict better than the old , now discredited one .
Some are so discombobulated by unexpected turns of events that they project the breakdown of their superficial understanding onto the economic actors themselves .
Thus , Professor Peter Gottschalk of Boston College tells Uchitelle :  Our models are built on the assumption that on average people behave rationally and they do the right thing , but this time people did very much the wrong thing . 
Had Professor Gottschalk so much as dipped his toes into the deep waters of Ludwig von Misess treatise Human Action , he would understand that even the most rational actors may make mistakes .
Moreover , he would be equipped to understand how various government policies subsidizing near - universal home ownership , generating artificially cheap credit , intimidating reluctant lenders , and in effect promising to bail out any huge financial institution on the brink of bankruptcy created incentives that led perfectly rational people to act in a way that now seems to have been mistaken or even irrational .
Gottschalks misconception , however , scarcely puts him in a class by himself .
According to Janet Yellen , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ,  The new enthusiasm for fiscal stimulus , and particularly government spending , represents a huge evolution in mainstream thinking ,  which she expects to persist , in Uchitelles words , for as long as the profession is dominated by men and women living through this downturn . 
If this forecast turns out to be correct , a profession that allowed its misinterpretation of economic events during the Great Depression and World War II to lead it in the wrong direction for three or four decades will , after having reversed course somewhat since the 1970s , be reverting to the same misguided thinking it embraced in the immediate postwar period this time , however , without the excuse of the confusion engendered by a genuinely great depression .
As befits economists who lack sound theoretical moorings , those gathered at San Francisco had plenty of proposals ,  and their proposals were all over the lot . 
Modern economics is nothing if not trendy .
Often this trendiness reflects only the high marks given to the economist who uses a new and even more incomprehensible analytical tool a mathematical theorem or a statistical procedure cribbed from math and stats journals but sometimes , as now , it simply demonstrates how a drowning thinker will grasp any intellectual plank he happens to notice floating past .
The assembled economists did agree , however , on one important point : many said that once the recession ended , the nation should not go back to the system that held sway from Ronald Reagans election in 1980 to the present crisis .
It was one in which taxes , regulation and public spending were minimized .
Is it possible that the statement I have emphasized in the preceding quotation actually represents the beliefs of most economists ?
If so , then we can only conclude that they have somehow removed themselves from this planet and taken up residence in another world .
The idea that since 1980 taxes , regulation and public spending were minimized  cannot honestly be held by any sentient being who has paid the slightest attention to the events of the past thirty years a period during which federal receipts rose from $ 1,137 billion in 1980 to $ 2,588 billion in 2007 ( in constant 2007 dollars ) , federal outlays rose from $ 1,312 billion to $ 2,730 billion ( in constant 2007 dollars ) , real state and local taxes and expenditures increased by more than 150 percent , and regulations spewed out of Washington and the fifty state capitals as if the bureaucrats saw no need for taking heed of the morrow .
Notwithstanding all of these events and a great many others pointing in the same direction , the recent converts to active fiscal interventionism would have us believe that this ongoing blizzard of bigger and bigger government represented taxes , spending , and government regulation being minimized ?
The mind boggles at such flagrant nonsense .
Nor are mistaken views of recent economic history the only obtuseness reported from the AEA conference .
 Nearly every economist who spoke here agreed that a dollar invested in , say , a new transit system or in bridge repair is spent and respent more efficiently than a dollar that comes to a household in a tax cut . 
Say what ?
Politicians and bureaucrats use peoples money more judiciously than do the people who earned it ?
Granted that Uchitelle seems to have been referring here to whether the funds would be spent repeatedly for consumer goods , rather than being saved , and he simply misused the economic term efficiently ,  yet the observations inanity remains .
Do todays economists really take seriously the vulgar Keynesian idea of the Paradox of Thrift ?
Can they be such idiots that they suppose every dollar of income not spent for consumption goods goes under the mattress and stays there ?
How , one wonders , do they imagine the massive capital apparatus of the modern world came into being by peoples spending for immediate consumption every cent of income they ever received ?
Ah , yes , we must recall : modern macroeconomics proceeds in serene disregard of capital , its composition , its complex role in the time - structure of production , and its origin in saving .
Macroeconomics deals in unadorned aggregates , if it deals at all .
For todays macroeconomist , the aggregate capital stock is a given ,  and the present is all that matters , indeed , all that exists .
In the long run , all macroeconomists are dead .
I do not wish to conclude this little diatribe without acknowledging that a substantial amount of interesting and important work still goes on in the economic mainstream as the saying goes , some of my best friends are mainstream economists ( and I was once one myself ) .
Yet such work is the exception to the rule .
Much of the decent work takes place in fields such as economic history , the new institutional economics , public choice , and other applied areas that the professions aristocrats the so - called theorists and the theoretical econometricians view with disdain as labor fit only for the professions heavy - browed hod carriers .
No part of modern economics comes so close to being completely worthless as macroeconomics .
Looking back at the seventy - years since John Maynard Keyness General
Theory brought this style of analysis to prominence , one sees a series of stunningly simple - minded ideas , fallacious arguments , and utter disregard for basic questions at the foundation of the field , such as ,  What does national output mean , anyhow ?  and  Should government spending be included in GDP ?
Although a few economists have pondered these questions , their reflections for the most part have been flushed away by the never - ending flood of mindless mathematical exercises :
call it Q , call it C , call it I , call it G ;
do not trouble yourself as to what it might mean .
When in doubt , assume , assume , assume .
Then write down your assumptions in an arbitrary mathematical form and proceed as if the stipulated variables and their postulated relationships bore some relation to reality .
Now , with the financial debacle , the bailout fiasco , and the onset of a recession as provocations , mainstream economists are casting overboard the few little packets of their macroeconomics that contained half - plausible concepts and ideas , treating them as expendable cargo in a storm .
As if this hasty jettisoning were not enough , the frightened sailors are also snatching bits and pieces of jetsam left over from the theoretical and policy wreckage of the 1970s .
It s a pretty ugly sight , and as the storms intensify , it will probably get uglier .

Over 1,500 years ago , Rome fell to Germanic tribes once seen by the empire as a mere nuisance .
While the fall of the Roman Empire has spawned hundreds of theories and comparisons to modern troubles , this much at least is clear : no superpower is immortal .
Americans seem unable to conceive of a world in which we are not supreme , but we are slowly getting the message .
Much like the US today , Rome was once the world 's sole superpower .
An empire whose influence spanned across the entire Mediterranean and into Asia and Africa , few civilisations in history can rival the sheer breadth of Roman influence in global affairs .
Rome 's collapse was precipitated by numerous internal factors , but it also faced strengthening external threats that capitalised on the internal chaos of the western empire .
The small tribes which had fought the empire for years on the margins of their territory joined forces to form more powerful coalitions that the empire was unable to resist with its border armies .
Even toward the very end , the well - financed and organised Roman military was formidable , but too often Rome found itself wasting resources it desperately needed to survive on costly internal divisions .
After the fall of the western empire , the eastern empire , which had separated years earlier , fought mightily to recover the territories lost to the Germanic tribes in the west .
But it was a foolish endeavour .
Emperor Justinian 's attempts to re-conquer the west proved too difficult and merely wasted treasure and manpower .
The eastern empire would have been far better off consolidating its defences to prepare for what new threats would come later rather than throwing good resources after bad .
And thus the Roman empire , both east and west , found itself an increasingly small voice in a region of the world which once called them master .
As Barack Obama prepares to take office , some are predicting that America has reached the limits of its superpower status and is now facing a decline in our ability to shape world events .
America , like Rome , seems to play by different rules from other nations in world affairs , a nod to the idea of " American exceptionalism " and Reagan 's " Shining city on a hill " .
By virtue of its economic and military power , as well as a political system extolled for its superiority to all other systems , America has been the leader of the free world for the last 60 years .
But from China 's rapidly rising status as a global player , to Russia 's show of force in Georgia , to rising tensions in South Asia and the Middle East , America is facing a wide array of increasingly troubling threats , while struggling internally to recover from an economic collapse not seen since the Great Depression .
American supremacy in a post - cold war environment seems outmatched by a progressively more unstable world .
Like Rome , America has spread itself too thin and is unable to respond to new threats as they emerge with either a convincing show of military force or a skilled use of soft power to leverage its credibility in the world .
While the dangers we face were once diverse and scattered , the Iraq war pushed many of our enemies to see us as a common threat where religious differences would have otherwise made cooperation impossible .
Moreover , in collapsing the Ba'athist regime of Saddam Hussein , America has paved the way for an even less palatable Iranian dominance in the region .
While the comparison to ancient Rome is imperfect , there are nonetheless parallels worth considering .
America today faces the same dilemma of the eastern Roman empire : should it attempt to regain its lost global supremacy or fortify and adapt to the new world ?
Will we follow Virgil 's famous line from the Aeneid , " Rome , 't is thine alone , with awful sway , To rule mankind , and make the world obey , " or preserve our strength and create a framework for global cooperation in which America acts as a mediator and responsible actor rather than instigator .
To be sure , America still boasts a powerful military and massive nuclear arsenal , and even under the most dire economic predictions , it is still a key player in global commerce .
But if Roman history is any lesson , America must humble itself to its new position and work as a global partner instead of seeking to once again control the world in the palm of its hands .
Hopefully America possesses the self - awareness that Rome did not , and will work to advance an agenda driven less by Machievelli than by self - interested cooperation .
WASHINGTON — President - elect Barack Obama made a pointed effort Friday to describe Leon Panetta , his choice as director of the CIA , as an adviser who will have “ my complete trust and substantial clout . ”
Responding to skeptics who question Panetta ’s lack of intelligence experience , Obama praised the longtime Northern California political leader as “ one of the finest public servants of our time . ”
Panetta , 70 , represented the Monterey area in Congress for 16 years and earned generally high marks as former President Bill Clinton ’s budget director and chief of staff in the 1990s .
He had no direct responsibility for intelligence or counterterrorism , except for overseeing the budgets of all federal agencies .
In brief remarks , Panetta praised the CIA as “ the first line of our defense at a dangerous time . ”
He turned toward Obama and said a primary task “ is to provide the most accurate and objective intelligence you need to lead the nation . ”
Obama has said that he wants some changes in the intelligence community : clear guidelines against abusive interrogations and nonpolitical analysis of intelligence data to avoid the failures that led to the Iraq war .
“ We know that to be truly secure , we must adhere to our values as vigilantly as we protect our safety — with no exceptions , ” Obama said .
Several senators , including Dianne Feinstein , said early in the week that they favored a CIA director with a professional background in intelligence .
Feinstein , a California Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee , also complained that Obama and his team did not consult her on the choice .
‘ Sound judgment ’
But Obama said Panetta , as a top White House official , “ handled intelligence daily at the very highest levels , and time and again he has demonstrated sound judgment , grace under fire and complete integrity . ”
After a conversation with Panetta , Feinstein said she was supportive , describing him as a “ man of conscience , a man of talent , and I believe he will surround himself with top - notch staff from the intelligence community . ”
Other members of Obama ’s intelligence team may assuage some potential critics .
Dennis Blair , a retired admiral with broad experience , was named director of national intelligence , supervising all 16 intelligence agencies , including the CIA .
John Brennan , with a background in counterterrorism , will be Obama ’s homeland security adviser .
Peter Earnest , a CIA operative for 36 years , said those appointments , along with keeping some top people in the agency , “ will reassure members of the clandestine service . ”
Panetta ’s experience overseeing the CIA budget , his good reputation on Capitol Hill and the fact that he has the president ’s ear also are pluses , Earnest said , who focused on Obama ’s pledge that Panetta will have “ complete trust . ”
“ The agency could not ask for anything more , ” said Earnest , who now is executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington .
Several analysts pointed out that whether a CIA director is an insider or outsider in the secretive , insular culture of the agency , his success often depends on access to the president .
Critics ’ concerns
Other former agency officials were more pessimistic about Panetta , noting that Michael Hayden , the current director , was a retired Air Force general with extensive intelligence experience who protected the agency .
Michael Scheuer , a 22 - year CIA analyst , told CNN that “ it was not apparent ( Panetta ) has any talent pertinent to the job ” and would have to learn quickly in the new position .
Sen. Christopher Bond , R - Mo. , and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said “ intelligence experience should be a prerequisite for the job . ”
But former Rep. Tim Roemer , an Obama ally who served on the House Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission , said Panetta has “ the right mix of insider skills in Washington with an outsider ’s perspective who will bring change to the agency . ”
In articles last year , Panetta was adamant that torture should never be used , and he criticized President Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
Panetta also served in the Iraq Study Group , where he reviewed intelligence failures and clashed with Bush administration officials over policies and intelligence .
“ From Guantánamo to interrogation and wiretapping , we need some changes , and Leon is a very capable manager and consensus - builder who can help make that happen , ” Roemer said .
Earnest said that after carefully listening to Obama , he thinks the new president will make changes without dwelling on past policies that he opposed .
“ I think his tone is , ‘ Let ’s move on , ’ ” Earnest said .
Feinstein said she also expects Obama and Panetta to follow through on changes she wants to see .
“ The president - elect has clearly stated that he wishes to close Guantánamo and end the use of torture in interrogations , ” said Feinstein , who introduced a bill to do that .
“ I look forward to working with the new president to achieve these goals . ”

LOS ANGELES 
As plot twists go , this one is a doozy : after an eight - year legal battle over the lease of a movie theater , the former owners of a multiplex in Aspen , Colo. , now own the rights to Ingmar Bergman ’s entire film library .
Or do they ?
In late December an amateurish - looking Web site popped up offering for sale on DVD dozens of classic Swedish films , including those of Bergman , the film legend responsible for classics like “ The Seventh Seal ” and “ Cries and Whispers . ”
The site , SwedishClassicFilms.com , also offered to sell exhibition rights .
The offer , so unusual as to be unbelievable , was not extended by Svensk Filmindustri , the giant Swedish company that has long held the rights to Mr. Bergman ’s work and to the other Swedish art house classics on the Web site ’s list , including Bo Widerberg ’s “ Elvira Madigan ” and Lasse Hallstrom ’s “ My Life as a Dog . ” Instead , the offer came from the former owners of the Isis Theater in downtown Aspen .
In July a Colorado judge transferred all of Svensk ’s film rights to Isis Litigation L.L.C. after Svensk refused to pay damages resulting from a renovation of the Isis Theater in the late 1990s .
Now , having finished recording its bounty with the United States Copyright Office  and with the documents to prove it 
Isis has set out to make some money .
In order to explain and defend the economic approach to human behavior one must justify the assumption that individuals are rational , that they tend to take the actions that best achieve their objectives .
One argument I have long made is that , while rational behavior is not a complete description of how humans act , it describes the predictable part of their action .
In most situations there is one correct way of acting to achieve an objective and lots of incorrect ways someone could act .
Unless one has a theory of what particular mistake someone is going to make , the best approach is to treat the mistakes as random error , to predict his behavior on the assumption he is rational while realizing that the prediction will sometimes be wrong .
So far as I know , neither Cass Sunstein nor Richard Thaler ever read either of the books in which I made that argument .
But their recent book Nudges offers a rebuttal .
Using evidence from behavioral economics , they argue that irrational action is not merely random error .
There are patterns to it , predictable ways in which individuals act that are inconsistent with the economist 's assumption of rationality .
Thaler and Sunstein propose that those setting up alternatives for someone else to choose among — " choice architects " in their terminology — can and should take advantage of those patterns to nudge the chooser into making the choice they think he ought to make , the choice he would make if he were fully rational .
This is the approach that I described in an earlier post as " soft paternalism " and that has been described elsewhere as " libertarian paternalism . "
It is paternalism because it is getting people to act as someone else thinks they ought , libertarian because it leaves the individual free to act in a different way if he wants to — a nudge , not a compulsion .
The argument as stated is persuasive and interesting .
As the authors point out , any time you are offering someone else choices — whether " you " are a government agency , an employer , or a firm selling something — you are necessarily deciding in what form to make the offer , hence engaging in choice architecture .
If you are going to do it , you ought to know what you are doing and do it in a way designed to produce the result you want to produce — in their case , choices that result in the chooser better achieving his own goals .
The libertarian part of the proposal depends on leaving the individual free , at no significant cost , to make the choice you do n't want him to make .
But if you do n't want him to make that choice , it will be tempting to make it more and more difficult — to require him to fill out forms , file them in the right place , perhaps even to neglect to tell him that forms exist to be filled out , that the alternatives you do n't want him to choose are available .
There is thus a serious slippery slope problem , making it possible for libertarian paternalism to be used as the justification for government actions that end up as paternalism , or compulsion for other purposes , that is far from libertarian .
The point occurred to me when I read the book .
It was reinforced by a real world experience at about the same time .
It was the beginning of my daughter 's first year at college and the college sent us a bill , a list of charges and a total we were to pay .
One of the items in the list , included without explanation , was ten dollars for the " Green Edge Fund . "
Being curious , I did an online search to find out what it was .
It turned out that it was a fund to subsidize environmental projects by students .
It had been voted in the previous year — as an optional ten dollar per pupil payment .
" Optional " means that you do n't have to pay .
We sent in our check minus the ten dollars and I sent an email to the president of the College , pointing out that he was billing parents for money they did not owe .
I received back an apologetic email from an administrator , explaining that the program was a new one and they had not yet gotten everything set up properly .
A month or so later I received a bill from the College for ten dollars .
I wrote back to the office that sent the bill , pointing out that they had billed me , and all other parents , for ten dollars we did n't owe , that rather than my owing them money they owed money to all of the parents who had paid the ten dollars .
I also sent an email to the administrator .
A few weeks later , I received second bill for ten dollars — shortly followed by an email from the administrator telling me that the matter had been taken care of and I could ignore the bill .
Recently we got our bill for the second semester .
It included a form for our daughter to sign and hand in during the first two weeks of the semester requesting a waiver of the charge for the Green Edge fund .
The form contained a description of the fund — put in terms of how the money would be used , not how they hoped it would be used — that I suspect most students and faculty at the college would regard as fraudulent advertising if it were the product of , say , the phone company .
The bill did not include any mention of the fact that the College had , in the previous semester , charged parents for some tens of thousands of dollars that they did not owe , nor any offer of a refund to any parent who wanted it .
As it happened , my wife went to the same college thirty - some years earlier — and had had a similar experience .
In her day it was a one dollar per student charge to support one of Ralph Nader 's PIRGs .
A student could get out of it by going to the right office on the right day and telling them he did n't want to pay it .
On further enquiry , we discovered that the one dollar per student " donation " was still there , although there did not seem to be any effort to inform parents or students that they had the option of not paying it .
An optional charge where the default choice is to pay it is the sort of thing Sunstein and Thaler propose , a nudge in the direction of doing what those responsible believe , possibly correctly , that most of those nudged would want to do if they took the time to think about it .
But the people constructing the choice architecture know what result they want to get , they believe they are doing good and so not constrained by what they themselves would consider proper principles of morality and honesty in a commercial context , so it is very easy to make the " wrong " choice more and more difficult and obscure until what is optional in theory becomes mandatory in practice .
Neo -Nazis plan to build Fourth Reich on back of economic crisis claims far - right defector
Neo -Nazis are on the rise in Germany and are planning to exploit the economic crisis to build a Fourth Reich , a defector from their ranks warned yesterday .
Uwe Luthardt painted a chilling picture of the far - Right trying to recruit the record number of young Germans facing a bleak future as the country 's economy contracts and unemployment mounts .
Experts fear that the worsening conditions are worryingly similar to those of the late 1920s and early 1930s which propelled Hitler 's Nazi regime - the Third Reich - to power .
German neo -Nazis idolise Adolf Hitler , seen here addressing supporters at Nuremberg in 1933
Mr Luthardt was a senior member of Germany 's neo -Nazi National Democratic Party - the NPD - but resigned to inform on the group which Germany tried unsuccessfully to ban several years ago .
German unemployment has climbed by 63,000 this month to 3,552,000 , or 8.5 per cent .
Its economy - the world 's third largest - is predicted to shrink by 5 per cent this year .
A sign of resurgent extreme Right came earlier this month in Dresden where nearly 7,000 neo -Nazis turned up to ' honour German patriots ' on the anniversary of the Allied bombing in 1945 which killed 25,000 residents .
A young neo -Nazi in Leipzig , Germany : Far - right groups continue to be a huge problem for the authorities who have tried to ban many of them
It was nearly double the turnout of last year .
Far - Right attacks on immigrants , anti-Nazi activists and Jewish sites are growing .
Youngsters have always been recruiting fodder for the party , but now German intelligence officials worry that , as young people or their parents lose their jobs , they will drift into the politics of the extreme Right with increasing enthusiasm .
Mr Luthardt described an organisation that preys on the gullible and the weak who seek , as he did , to restore some mythical glory to Germany while finding scapegoats for the economic misery .
Rampant inflation meant Germans needed huge amounts of money simply to buy a loaf of bread during the Weimar Republic : Parallels have been made with today 's economy
He told of weapons stores , how members greet each other with Heil Hitler !
salutes , sing the banned songs of the Third Reich , relish the idea of a new Holocaust against the Jews and plot to bring hard - core Nazism back with a vengeance .
Luthardt was in the NPD for only four months , but quickly rose to become a member of the ruling board .
He told Der Spiegel magazine that old Nazis living in South America donate to the party via shell companies .
Other funds come from the staging of skinhead - music concerts .
He went on : ' The simple aim is the restoration of the Reich in which a new stormtrooper organisation takes revenge on anyone who disagrees with them .
' In Jena in East Germany in the NPD HQ there are a load of SS pictures in the cellar .
And there 's a room with weapons .
' The basic concept the NPD talks about is , " Let 's kick out all the foreigners , then the Germans will have jobs again " .
' The dream is of the German Reich .
They 're totally convinced that they 'll win an election one day and that things will really get going .
Everyone can imagine what would happen then . '
Guess what the SC 34 committee , the ISO / IEC committee responsible for OOXML , is up to now ?
I call it a takeover attempt of ODF , according to my reading of the published notes of the most recent meeting held yesterday , October 1st , and starring a document titled " Request to JTC 1 for alignment of OASIS and JTC 1 Maintenance Procedures . "
Uh oh .
That sounds polite , but it is what it is .
An attempted coup .
They have already sent a " Liaison Statement " to OASIS .
Surrender or else , what ?
SC 34 asks JTC 1 " to establish with OASIS a synchronised mechanism for maintenance of ISO / IEC 26300 and to inform SC 34 of the outcome . "
I gather they think they can do a better job of maintaining ODF than OASIS .
What will JTC 1 do , do you think ?
You doubt they will hop on to this wonderful plan ?
I gather the hope is , if the takeover were to succeed , that SC 34 would get to maintain ODF as well as Microsoft 's competing parody " standard , " OOXML .
How totally smooth and shark - like .
Under the guise of " synchronised maintenance " , without which they claim SC 34 can't fulfill its responsibilities , they get control of everything .
So utterly Microsoft .
Microsoft yearns for interoperability , it seems .
More like yearning for ODF 's air supply to be ... well , you know .
Microsoft never seems to change , does it ?
Yoo hoo !
EU Commission !
Are you watching ?
You can read all the public resolutions of the ISO / IEC JTC 1/SC 34 Plenary Meeting , 2008 - 10 - 01 , held in Jeju , Republic of Korea .
It will either make you laugh or throw up .
I did both .
Sequentially .
Actually , you can only read part of the resolutions passed by this stacked committee .
As usual , there are deep secrets that the public can't access .
That 's just one part of what 's wrong with those people and why ODF must never fall into their secretive clutches .
If it does , I have little doubt that ODF will end up brain dead , on life support , turning blue for lack of oxygen , and then suddenly , sadly , we 'll find it dead as a doornail .
Why do I say Microsoft , when this is SC 34 ?
Look at this , will you ?
It has a list of participants in the July meeting in Japan of the SC 34 committee .
The committee membership is so tilted by Microsoft employees and such , if it were a boat , it would capsize .
In fact , I 'd say it already has .
Of the 19 attendees , 8 are outright Microsoft employees or consultants , and 2 of them are Ecma TC45 members .
So 10 out of 19 are directly controlled by Microsoft / Ecma .
Any questions ?
And here 's yesterday 's Resolution 6 : Resolution 6 : Liaison Statement to OASIS SC 34 approves the liaison statement contained in SC 34 N 1095 and instructs its Secretariat to forward it to OASIS together with the defect report on ISO / IEC 26300 : 2006 contained in SC 34 N 1078 .
Unanimous Resolution 6 : Request to JTC 1 for alignment of OASIS and JTC 1 Maintenance Procedures SC 34 approves SC 34 N 1098 for submittal to the JTC 1 Plenary meeting to be held in Nara , Japan in November 2008 .
Unanimous
The liaison statement forwarded to OASIS is not being made public .
Neither is the SC 34 N 1098 document " for submittal to the JTC 1 Plenary meeting " being planned for next month .
Here 's the meat of the sooper seekrit document 1098 , however , so you can see the scheme in all its glory : Request to JTC 1 for alignment of OASIS and JTC 1 Maintenance Procedures SC 34 is anxious to fulfil its obligations for maintenance of standards assigned to SC 34 by JTC 1 .
These standards now include both ISO / IEC 26300:2006 and the shortly - to - be- published ISO / IEC 29500:2008 .
SC 34 and Ecma International have spent considerable time over the past two years discussing and agreeing maintenance arrangements for ISO / IEC 29500 , and we believe that we now have agreed an arrangement that meets the goals of timely maintenance of an ISO / IEC standard in accordance with the procedures of both ISO / IEC and Ecma International .
SC 34 would like to have had a similar discussion with OASIS concerning the maintenance of ISO / IEC 26300 .
The strong support that has recently been shown for SC 34 to produce a Technical Report on translation between ISO / IEC 26300 and ISO / IEC 29500 , supported by 18 Members , demonstrates that SC 34 is the centre for standardization of editable document formats within JTC 1 .
To fulfil this role , SC 34 needs to be closely involved in the maintenance and revision of the standards for which it has responsibility .
OASIS and JTC 1 do not have a synchronised mechanism for maintenance of standards .
The maintenance arrangement agreed between OASIS and JTC 1 fails to establish such a mechanism , so that SC 34 is unable to maintain ISO / IEC 26300 in accordance with the JTC 1 Directives and in fulfilment of SC 34s responsibilities .
SC 34 therefore requests JTC 1 to establish with OASIS a synchronised mechanism for maintenance of ISO / IEC 26300 and to inform SC 34 of the outcome .
They imagine that they are better equipped to handle ODF than OASIS , I gather .
Well , they are a day late and a dollar short , methinks .
As it happens , there already is a technical committee set up to handle ODF issues , the just - announced OASIS ODF Interoperability and Conformance Technical Committee .
Here 's a comical touch , how the SC 34 committee at the July meeting suggested handling defect reports regarding OOXML : 4.5 Defect Handling - [ Note : ISO / IEC JTC 1 SC 34 Ad Hoc Group 2 is developing a web application for collecting defect report comments for 29500 . ]
- WG 4 should adopt the web application of AHG 2 , but it shall be for the use of NBs only for the submission of defect report comments .
JTC 1 Directives require the submission of defect reports through recognised bodies .
- [ Note : Form G5 may still be used for comment submission by NBs . ] -
The above does not prevent other , informal mechanisms existing outside the process for comment collection from non-NB contributors .
We encourage the establishment of such mechanisms , so that public comments are properly routed through NBs to WG 4 . - SC 34 may wish to encourage NBs to engage with the broader community and submit defect reports .
They may .
But I doubt they will .
Should be a blast if they do , but really , why would anyone bother to submit a defect report , considering how many were totally ignored at the BRM and thereafter , even to today ?
Unless they decide to engage with us unwashed masses , you 'll note that the formal process is for " member bodies " only .
Us hoi polloi can just wait for " informal mechanisms " to be set up someday , if they decide to do so .
That should keep the finger - pointing at mistakes down to the loyal few .
I suggest they start there at the BRM , though , if they want to find defects to fix .
X marks the spot .
Include the issues from the NBs whose microphones were turned off when they tried to speak , will you ?
That seems a logical place to get going fixing the unfixable OOXML .
Then tackle the appeals next , I 'd think .
Considering that ODF is already in use around the world , and OOXML is still being pulled together into a workable shape , why would ODF leave OASIS and go to the home of a " standard " that is n't done yet , my logical brain asks ?
Riddle me that , Batman .
Send OOXML to OASIS , by all means , if synchronization is desired .
I know .
I 'm just saying , if they were sincere , it would reach the purported goal faster and more reliably , if the folks that actually were able to produce a workable standard took over OOXML instead of the other way around .
Here 's the latest adoption news , by the way , Brazil 's announcement that it is using ODF .
Seen any announcements lately about OOXML ?
Ever ?
Perchance because OOXML is an unfinished mess ?
And ODF is already working just fine , despite all the effort this committee has put forth to make ODF look bad .
Here .
Take a look .
This is what the SC 34 folks came up with for defects in ODF .
That 's it .
I 'm sure they 'll keep looking , here 's the level of defects put on their list :
What does " the current chapter " mean ?
No kidding .
I could n't make that up .
It 's Defect Report JPT2 - 5 , " Request for clarification " .
I have a suggestion .
I suggest they could more profitably use their time fixing OOXML 's rather significant defects .
Alex Brown tells us , in his blog account of the recent meeting , that the UK had 600 changes mandated at the BRM that it will now need to check to make sure they were implemented correctly .
It seems at least one from Japan was not :
The afternoon was devoted to OOXML matters .
Evidently , the sudden appearance of the final text of ISO / IEC 29500:2008 has come as something of a surprise for many ; and the appearance of the first defect report ( from Japan ) shortly thereafter was a shock .
Suddenly its all real ; the clock is ticking and the Project Editor is obliged to respond to Japans report in eight weeks .
Murata Makoto ( the convenor of WG 1 ) carefully explained the details of the maintenance regime and took us through an example of one of the Japanese defects , which centred on a BRM - mandated change ( from Finland ) that had not been properly implemented in the final OOXML text .
No doubt other NBs , as a priority , will now scour OOXML to make sure their changes have been implemented , and submit defect reports accordingly where they have not .
The UK , with its 600 or so accepted changes , has a lot of checking to do Obviously , these folks have their hands full .
Let them get cracking on the task at hand , I say .

One can't help but notice this from Brown 's blog : Day 0 had been concluded with a tasty Korean meal ( washed down with possibly a tad too much Korean vodka ) and it was very interesting to hear some of the views from NB members on how they thought the office formats future will play out ( and no , there were no Microsoft , IBM or Ecma people at the table ) .
One view was that ODF had served its purpose ( to get MS formats out into the open ) and should now declare victory before fading away gracefully ; another was that OOXML would surely become the default format of the OpenOffice.org suite , and that this would crystallize the real option users had : to use FOSS or commercially - licensed Office packages .
I 'm not sure I 'd go with either of these but still , it was refreshing to get some new perspectives rather than the stale repetitions that have too often characterised the exchanges of the past months .
It will be interesting to see what really happens ... personally I think ODF is more likely to emerge as a kind of ' default choice ' than OOXML ( not perhaps , that most users care ) ....
Oh , we care .
Speaking for myself , I 'd like to hear from Sun and OpenOffice.org on these thoughts that Brown has run up the flagpole to see if anyone salutes , as they used to say in the enterprise .
In short , they hope , if I 've understood his words from his alternate universe , that ODF will gracefully accept being euthanized by them and slip away into nothingness , having forced Microsoft to become more open .
Mr. Durusau , Mr. Brown , and all you guys , listen up , please .
That is n't the goal .
Microsoft being " more open " is n't the appropriate end goal .
If it 's your goal , you have utterly failed .
The goal is a standard that anyone can use equally , a truly open standard , available to both proprietary folks and FOSS .
Microsoft being " more open " but not really fully interoperable and always a little bit ahead of everyone else in its ability to use a " standard " is by no means enough .
We 've lived in that kind of Microsoft world a long time now .
We do n't need " standards " that replicate it .
Have you ever watched an idea ?
Truly watched it from birth to wherever it happens to wander ?
They start so innocently , conceived from a conglomerate of other ideas , other experiences , clusters and clusters of idea families forming long lines to the point where they come together and create something new , something wholly different , with bits of its parents coloring it as clearly as kittens born from a litter with multiple fathers .
Given enough vectors , each idea will spread , growing , changing , assimilating and moving on to " infect " the minds of others as easily as any virus .
It 's the basis of advertising , the raw idea behind viral marketing .
Like any other mutation , each new idea is thrown to the wolves , swept up in the natural flow of the system , and either proves itself as a successful adaptation of the collective consciousness and survives to reproduce with other thoughts to create new forms of the original idea ( The computer and everything that came after ) or fails and sinks beneath the waves like so much smell - o- vision .
But unlike biological adaptations , ideas are immortal , or nearly so .
As long as they are remembered by someone , or retained in some form of external memory storage , they live on , and like bacterium locked away in ancient tombs , can still prove viable in the right habitat .
Ideas , like life , find a way .
Since the dawn of time , most religious philosophies have taught that the soul is immortal , that while the flesh may fail and decay to its basest elements , the true essence of the person lives on in some form or another , that the idea , the part that truly made them human , and not just a sack of meat and organs , continues to exist and persist in a life of its own .
Other philosophies have spoken also of transcendence , the ascension of the spirit despite the shackles of the mortal frame to a " beyond " or " god- state " in a sort of non-violent sacrifice of self akin to death or perhaps graceful , spiritually - achieved and sanctioned suicide .
Transhumanism is an idea that takes it all a step further , focusing on the idea of the spiritual essence itself , its ability to transcend the flesh , and the avenues of thought and ideas that go with these assumptions , bringing forth an almost dichotomic combination of the straining , passionate need to survive and evolve posed against the Nihilistic thought pattern of " nothing really matters . "
What does this all mean ?
In simple terms , Transhumanism is a fourth - dimensional , non-lateral mode of thinking about ourselves , the world around us , and what it means to be human .
It combines all the elements of faith and need and the things that make us truly human with the fact , logic , and theory of the scientific world of data and possibility we 've spawned as a species .
It looks at the material world as an experience , the flesh as a vehicle ( an inefficient one , but better than none at all ) , and puts the emphasis of survival and reproduction into the idea as opposed to the body and the world with which it interacts .
Transhumanism is the response to the growing pains felt by a species whose intellectual evolution and adaptation far exceeds its penchant for physical change , and opens a new frontier of possibilities that emphasize both quality and quantity of thought alongside the synthetic evolution of a steadily more efficient human form , whether it be of flesh or something entirely different .
It is that straining need for something more , something greater , the need to harness the potential to change within ourselves and reach a higher intellectual plane while still staying rooted by some means or another in the material world we know from sight , sound , taste , smell and touch .
What is the next stage of humanity , this " post - human " form that Transhumanists strain so hard toward ?
Only time may tell for sure .
As the ever - evolving complexities of the mind and the realm of thought and idea continue to adapt and change and dominate , using culture and technology as a vector and playing a steadily larger role in our lives to the point of eventually overshadowing the crude industry of the flesh entirely , thought modes and philosophies will change and grow and present us with as many options as dead ends , thousands fold what we 've run across as a fledgling species barely getting to know ourselves and the vast world around us .
The next step is an idea , one that 's growing , spreading , and ripening steadily as information and the essence of humanity become more important and mingle more easily in the collective mediums of the electronic .
Already , we use our bodies and our computers to interface our minds with the primitive collective network of the internet , a system far more complex than the foundation constructions of written language and printed materials , and yet a grand step below direct neural interface and the sharing of thoughts with others in a vast sea of data , unimpeded by the inefficient machinations of the physical .
It 's coming , this next step in our development as a species , and the idea of a steadily more globally collective consciousness is really only a short step away , itself standing as just another step in bringing ideas and thought together to ensure easier survival and faster change .
But no matter what form the human body of the future takes , whether it be the same body of flesh and bone or merely a digital personality stored within the realm of the electric , there will always be contemporaries of the Transhumanists straining toward the next step , and perhaps that is just one of the things that really makes us human .
It ’s a simple rule :
If you want a job done right , choose the right tool for the job .
Carpenters know it well ; so do plumbers , masons and car mechanics , to name a few trades .
And capuchin monkeys , apparently .
Researchers have found that bearded capuchin monkeys in the wild will select the most effective stone for use in cracking nuts , rejecting those that are too light or crumbly .
They make the right choice by looking at the stones but also by lifting or tapping them if necessary .
Image A capuchin monkey after choosing the heavier stone for his work .
Elisabetta Visalberghi of the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the National Research Council in Rome and colleagues studied a group of the monkeys in Brazil that was discovered in 2003 to use stones as hammers to open palm nuts , which are difficult to crack .
Until then there had been only a few anecdotal reports of tool use by these primates .
Cleveland firefighters fear they might trigger a collapse of the Inner Belt Bridge if they park multiple fire engines on it to handle a big traffic accident .
They are concerned enough that the firefighters union wants the Ohio Department of Transportation to mark the bridge to indicate which zones are safe for firefighters to park their heavy equipment in and how far away the trucks must be kept from one another without putting the bridge at risk of collapse .
Firetrucks and other emergency vehicles go on the bridge for accidents and medical emergencies , despite a ban that has been imposed on trucks and buses since October because the bridge cannot support a full load .
ODOT made an exception for the emergency vehicles to use the bridge .
ODOT was supposed to install markings on the bridge showing firefighters where to park but has not done that .
Chester Ashton , president of Cleveland Firefighters Union Local 93 , said firefighters need to know how to properly space equipment on the bridge .
" Our equipment is no different than the semis going across the road , " Ashton said .
" I have a concern . "
Cleveland Safety Director Martin
Flask is not concerned about having multiple firetrucks on the bridge and said ODOT is committed to installing the markings .
" ODOT has assured us that the bridge is safe , " Flask said .
Faye Callahan , an ODOT spokeswoman , said the agency has the markers and they will be installed as soon as the weather allows .
Thirty - four of the bridge 's corroded plates have been reinforced since the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed on Aug. 1 , 2007 , killing 13 people and injuring 145 .
ODOT reduced the number of lanes on the Interstate 90 bridge from four to two in each direction on Oct. 1 after inspections showed three steel connectors could not support a fully loaded bridge .
The state also banned heavy vehicles .
The ban on trucks and buses , which requires them to detour on Interstates 490 and 77 , is indefinite .
The state reopened a third lane in each direction last month after determining that about 98 percent of trucks are obeying the order to stay off the 49 - year - old bridge .
ODOT engineers have maintained the bridge is safe as long as the weight is reduced .
Ashton does n't believe that state officials can guarantee safety if multiple firetrucks were on the bridge for an accident or other emergency and traffic backed up .
Firefighters would never refuse a call on the bridge , he said .
But if a major accident occurred , it would be a priority to get as many cars off the bridge to alleviate weight , he said .
" If they call us , we 're going to go , " Ashton said .
Cleveland is prepared if the bridge collapsed , Flask said .
The city teamed with federal , state and county agencies to finalize a response plan and studied how Minneapolis handled its bridge collapse .
The preparation is standard , no different from drilling about what to do if Cleveland were hit with a terrorist attack or other disaster , Flask said .
" We do n't anticipate or expect a catastrophic bridge failure , but we have to prepare for that scenario , " Flask said .
We all know and love Thanksgiving , our happy way to celebrate the subjugation and destruction of a race of indigenous peoples via eating turkey and mashed potatoes .

Our foolish Western Thanksgiving has nothing on Sankranthi and never will until the day we stop eating the turkeys and start dressing them up like stereotypically flamboyant homosexuals .
That 's what Indians do with cows during this festival that celebrates the beginning of their harvest season .
In order to celebrate the new growing season in an " Out with the old , In with the new " attitude , womenfolk cook up a pantload of sugary goodies while every piece of old shit you own is tossed on a fire to teach it a lesson for getting old and useless .
So if you value sugar cookies more than all of your material possessions and grandparents , you might have a new favorite holiday in Sankranthi .
You also have some pretty profound mental issues that should probably be dealt with .

To further demonstrate their boundless awesomeness , once the sun goes down bonfires are lit and the cows are forced to jump over them .

A major mystery about the origins of life has been resolved .
According to a study published in the journal Nature , two Université de Montréal scientists have proposed a new theory for how a universal molecular machine , the ribosome , managed to self - assemble as a critical step in the genesis of all life on Earth .
" While the ribosome is a complex structure it features a clear hierarchy that emerged based on basic chemical principles , " says Sergey Steinberg , a Université de Montréal biochemistry professor who made his discovery with student Konstantin Bokov .
" In the absence of such explanations , some people could imagine unseen forces at work when such complex structures emerge in nature . "
What is a ribosome ?
The ribosome is an enormous molecule responsible for translating the messages carried in the genetic code of all organisms into the workhorse molecules of the cell – proteins – that carry out all functions , including replicating the genome itself .
As the world celebrates the bicentennial anniversary of the Father of Evolution , Charles Darwin , Prof .
Steinberg 's theory brings the scientific community even deeper into the study of the origins of life .
By examining the molecular self - organizing processes that preceded the living cell , the point where time begins for biologists , Prof .
Steinberg goes further than Darwin and the many evolutionary biologists who followed could have imagined
By the standards of biological molecules , ribosomes are immense .
Though visible only through lenses of the most powerful microscopes , comparing most other biological molecules to this behemoth is like comparing a tricycle to a jumbo jet .
Having spent years gazing at the detailed structure of the ribosome , Prof .
Steinberg pondered how such an immense and complex structure could have assembled itself from smaller building blocks that existed on the early Earth .
From the simple to the complex
The key breakthrough came when he realized that the ribosome is organized by a set of simple structural rules and that it had to be assembled from basic building blocks in a very specific order ; otherwise it would have fallen apart .
He then showed with mathematical rigor that the construction of the ribosome likely followed an ordered series of steps to form the structure found in the first living cell .
To this day , that structure exists almost unchanged in our own cells .
Chemists have been able to observe many examples of self - organizing behavior with simple molecules , yet explaining the complex self - assembly of biomolecules had not been so obvious .
" Thanks to the research of Sergey Steinberg and Konstantin Bokov , scientists now have a glimpse of one key event that emerged spontaneously out of the primordial chemical soup of the early Earth , " explains Stephen Michnick , a Université de Montréal biochemistry professor and Canada Research Chair in Integrative Genomics .
" Perhaps in the near future we may look forward to more discoveries that will take us beyond the world of Darwin into an understanding of the basic chemical principles that drove the emergence of life on our planet and perhaps beyond . "
Professor Steinberg 's research is supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research and by the National Science and Engineering Research Council .

Now for the profoundly boring part : let it sit .
I reccomend letting it sit for at least an hour , so that the entire wick is completely soaked with oil .
If you do n't wait long enough , and it 's not completely soaked , the wick will burn off and the lamp will go out .
The wick should last you a good long time , but if you ever need to , you can pull more through the cap or easily replace it with more cotton scrap .
The lamp may take a few seconds to light , as oil does n't light easily , but once it is lit it should stay that way until you either blow it out or run out of oil .
It is easily blown out , and the light is bright enough to read by .
Never leave a lit oil lamp unattended .
As I mentioned earlier , if it were to spill - maybe a cat or dog knocks it over - the results could be very , very bad .
Even with the cap screwed on tightly , fires spread very easily and more quickly than you may realize .
I take no responsibility for anyone who burns their house down with one of these things !
The role played by Israel as the catalyst for war in the Middle East was dramatically underscored the other day , when David Sanger of the New York Times reported Israel had requested access to “ bunker - buster ” bombs developed by the US , and also clearance for flying over Iraqi airspace to get at Iran .
Both requests were denied .
Tensions within the “ special relationship ” have been escalating ever since .
The first public eruption occurred over the UN Gaza resolution , when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the world how he had yanked the President of the United States “ off the podium ” and demanded the US abstain from the Security Council vote .
The United States is n’t exactly calling Olmert a liar , but , then again , in the course of denying it , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack went out of his way to issue a stinging rebuke .
Olmert ’s comments , he averred , “ are wholly inaccurate as to describing the situation , just 100 - percent , totally , completely not true . ”
He tartly advised the Israeli government to correct the record .
Is the US - Israel “ special relationship ” fraying around the edges ?
After all , this is hardly the sort of talk one hears between the two : Mr. and Mrs. Perfect Couple are usually careful to conduct their occasional spats behind closed doors .
That this repartee is being exchanged on the international stage is extraordinary behavior indeed .
It suggests a fundamental shift in US policy , in part dictated by objective circumstances , and propelled , as well , by increased Israeli assertiveness , which has widened the fault - lines that have always existed between Washington and Tel Aviv .
Over at the Center for American Progress blog , Matt Yglesias disapproves of Olmert ’s boorishness : “ It seems both telling and unseemly that Olmert is going around bragging about this . ”
Unseemliness has never stopped the Israelis from pressing their demands , but Yglesias is right : it is telling .
It tells us who is used to giving orders , and who is accustomed to obedience .
Yet those power relations , in force throughout the first and much of the second Bush term , started undergoing a radical shift in the latter days of the Bush era .
After the neoconservatives had left the administration , in disgrace , the divergence of US and Israeli interests began to come out in the open : most of these were little noted , such as the end of the visa arrangements between the US and Israel that had given Israelis practically unlimited rights to travel and stay in the US .
Another and not so subtle signal : the arrest of two top officials of AIPAC , Israel ’s powerful lobbying organization , The duo were accused of stealing classified information , via Larry Franklin , a veteran of Douglas Feith ’s shadowy “ Office of Special Plans , ” and a neoconservative of the Ledeen school .
Franklin pled guilty to charges of espionage , and was given a 12 year sentence , a hefty fine  and a chance to work off some or all of that time by testifying at the trial of the two ringleaders , Steve Rosen ( formerly AIPAC ’s chief lobbyist ) and Keith Weissman ( their Iran expert ) , whose arrest was prefigured by two FBI raids on AIPAC ’s Washington headquarters .
On the public stage , all has been hunky - dory for the US and Israel , and yet when it comes to the murky world of spycraft , the US has lately been on the warpath .
Look , for example , at the case of Ben Ami Kadish .
Here ’s a guy close to eighty and barely able to get to meetings of the Jewish War Veterans anymore , being hauled into court and accused of being part of the same Israeli spy ring that recruited Jonathan Pollard .
Pollard , by the way , is a hero in Israel , and I believe there is some sort of monument dedicated to him , or perhaps it ’s only a street named after him : in any case , the campaign to release him from jail continues : this is a demand that every Israeli government always makes , so far to no avail .
You ’ll notice , however , that Bush did pardon  posthumously  another revered Israeli hero , one Charles Winters , an American citizen , who was convicted in 1948 of violating the Neutrality Act by shipping weapons from the US to Palestine , where the Irgun and Haganah forces were battling both the British and the Arabs .
That , however , is hardly enough to appease Tel Aviv .
Iran is the issue that has divided the US and Israel , and the gulf is only going to widen : that ’s because the objective interests of the US and Israel are increasingly in conflict .
That was the post - cold war trend , one that was ultimately exacerbated by the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Initially , of course , the idea was that “ We are all Israelis now , ” as Marty Peretz exulted .
This coziness did not and could not have lasted , because the US relationship with the Muslim world , and specifically with the Arab countries of the Middle East , from that moment on took center stage .
In effect , the Israelis were upstaged : we vowed to defeat and destroy al - Qaeda , but could n’t do it without significant Arab support .
In taking the battle to bin Laden , we elevated the importance of our Arab and Muslim allies , to Israel ’s detriment .
While on the surface the US appears to be in lockstep with Israel , their divergent paths are increasingly apparent .
The breakdown between the Bush White House and the Israelis has been magnified by the uncertainty augured by the incoming administration , where the outcome of a power struggle between Likudniks and realists is uncertain .
The Gaza offensive has caught the US off - guard , and brought simmering US - Israeli tensions to a boil .
What Gaza signals is a new turn for the Israelis , a clean break , if you will , with their status as an American puppet in the Middle East .
They are clearly going off on their own , intent on waging a war of unmitigated aggression against all their neighbors .
Their expansionist tendencies have lately taken on pretty grandiose dimensions , as Seymour Hersh reported in his exposé of their activities in Kurdistan .
That this little adventure was leaked to Hersh by sources in and around the US intelligence community and government circles was doubtless another contributing factor to the growing US - Israeli split .
Events are rapidly reaching a dramatic climax , and Gaza is just the start .
Even as Israel makes the case that it represents the West , and deserves our support , it becomes less Western , and more like a typical Middle Eastern despotism garbed in the somewhat soiled raiment of “ democracy . ”
The banning of the Arab parties , and the rise of Avigdor Lieberman , a racist and a theocrat , as a leading Israeli politician , augur ill for the future of Israel as a liberal democracy .
As the Israelis hurl themselves into a furious campaign to push outward and establish the old dream of a “ Greater Israel , ” the claim that they are the region ’s only democracy becomes an ever more hollow boast .
Roughly one year ago , MySpace came to an agreement with all 50 of the state Attorneys General , one in which it promised to do more to protect its younger users from various dangers thought to be lurking online .
Although the agreement included a variety of specific steps to be taken by the social networking site , it also included a clause that directed MySpace to set up a task force to examine the issue of the online safety of children more generally .
That task force has now completed its work and issued a final report , but at least one Attorney General is already arguing that the report understates the dangers .
The analysis was organized by Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society , and the task force included relevant academics and advocates , as well as members from major players in the online world , including Google , Microsoft , Yahoo , various ISPs , social networking sites , and a number of security companies .
Its members performed a literature review , examined security technology from a number of sources , and consulted with a variety of authorities from the relevant fields .
The entire report has been made available online .
Overall , the report generally concludes that the general public may have an impression that the Internet is awash in predatory pedophiles , but that picture is simply unsupported by the research that 's available .
Those risks that do exist do n't appear to be specific to the online world , as the report suggests , " the risks minors face online are complex and multifaceted and are in most cases not significantly different than those they face offline . "
As one of the participants stated , " the truth is that there is no ' Internet safety , ' there is simply ' safety . ' "
So , for example , when it comes to pornography and nudity , the majority of the exposure occurs offline , through traditional media such as TV and movies .
A number of younger individuals do get exposed to images they find disturbing online , but the majority of those who view porn online are older adolescent boys who have actively sought it out .
In a significant number of these cases , the images that disturb adolescents the most are the ones produced by their fellow adolescents ; as the report notes , " there are also concerns about other content , including child pornography and the violent , pornographic , and other problematic content that youth themselves generate . "
The task force also examined bullying and harassment online , but came to the same conclusion as other recent studies : it happens , but it 's generally happening as an extension of the child 's offline social world , rather than as a distinct Internet phenomenon .
Strangers with ' Net candy
When it comes to sexual solicitation , the fraction of individuals targeted by adult strangers is quite small .
Most of the youth targeted are older adolescents , and a large majority of those solicitations come from someone under 25 ; in many cases , they involve other adolescents .
Many of those on the receiving end do n't view the solicitations they 've received as inappropriate , and somewhere in the area of 98 percent of those targeted in this manner brush off the suggestions without giving it much further thought .
Far from being innocent victims , the youth who choose to act on these solicitations generally know exactly what they 're doing , and their choice is often symptomatic of larger problems .
" The psychosocial makeup of and family dynamics surrounding particular minors , " the report notes , " are better predictors of risk than the use of specific media or technologies . "
The report also looks at whether we could be doing more to protect youth from themselves and their peers through software .
Its authors were impressed by a variety of the solutions that they saw , but noted that most of these were focused on specific sites or protocols , rather than being a general solution to online risks , and that many were still in the formative stages .
In any case , they were somewhat skeptical of " one size fits all " solutions , given that they represent a single point of failure , security wise , and anything that protects individuals based on age carries the risk of enabling the identification of young users .
The report does stress that there are significant gaps in our knowledge , as most of the studies in the literature were performed before the rise of social networking sites .
They argue that there is a need to fund more up - to - date research .
The need for more resources — for research , for law enforcement , and for parents and kids themselves — was the consistent theme of the recommendations .
Although it was n't stated explicitly by the authors , actually providing those resources would be a stark contrast to how the matter is typically handled .
The inherent horror of crimes perpetrated against children makes it easy to spur the public to outrage and demands for change , but it 's another matter entirely to convince the public that they need to spend the money to actually identify and institute appropriate changes in the longer term .
At least one of the Attorneys General that helped arrange for this report would apparently prefer the focus stay on the horror .
Connecticut AG Richard Blumenthal , who is specifically singled out for thanks by the report 's authors , is quoted by The New York Times as saying its focus on available statistics " downplayed the predator threat . "
Just received that photo and the one below this post from Jeff Hogan , executive director of Killer Whale Tales , who was more closely involved than most people with the sightings we reported yesterday ( anyone seen them today ?
we think we MAY have seen them in the distance , south of the Fauntleroy ferry dock , within the past hour , but our binoculars leave much to be desired ) .
Jeff e-mailed :
I just wanted to let my new West Seattle neighbors know that we have members of the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale Community in the area .
Yesterday they spent most of the day off Alki Point and were easily visible for the better part of the afternoon .
I am including two photos I took from the beach , one is picture of 13 year old J30 and the other has J8 , a 75 year old female in the foreground and L7 a 47 year old female in the background .
I spent most of the day on the water with a group of NOAA scientists , collecting fecal samples , ( yes , poop ) as well as scale samples from their prey .
If anyone sees them on the water please give me a call at 206.660.0835 or call the Orca Network hotline at 1.866.672.2638 .
Here ’s the photo of J30 :

Buchanan meltdown : Pundit rails against black ' illegitimacy ' and ' gang rapes ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday February 21 , 2009
Print This Email This When Eric Holder , Obama 's Attorney General , called America a nation of " cowards " when it comes to matters of race , Patrick J. Buchanan must have taken it as a challenge .
To the man who once called Adolph Hitler " an individual of great courage , " Holder 's comment seemingly set a time - bomb ticking in his head .
On a Thursday MSNBC broadcast , it exploded .
Seething about about crime rates among African American communities , Buchanan gave conflicting figures of black " illegitimacy " and railed about black " gang rapes . "
The entire episode seemed to evoke the underlying reasons why Buchanan 's writing so often ends up cross-posted on ex-Klansman David Duke 's Web site .
Speaking to Eric Michael Dyson , professor of sociology at Georgetown University , Buchanan asked for a moment to " tell some truths . "
" White folks in America are not responsible for the 70 percent illegitimacy rate in the black community , " he said .
" We are not responsible for the fact that African - Americans commit crimes at seven times the rate of whites .
We are not responsible for the fact that many more children in the African - American community , 75 percent , are born out of wedlock , as I 've said . "
Michael Lind , author of " Up From Conservatism : Why the Right is Wrong for America , " took issue with this very assertion ( p. 170 ) .
" There is no illegitimacy epidemic , " wrote Lind .
" Poor black people are having babies out of wedlock at only slightly more the rate they did in the early twentieth century , when there were no federal welfare programs , when the media were heavily censored , and when , in addition , black Americans were persecuted in a police - state regime of racial segregation . "
" All of these things are the responsibility of the African - American community and its leaders should address the problems in their own community and stop believing ... " trailed Buchanan as Dyson moved to cut him off .
" First of all , " he began .
" First of all , Jessie Jackson has been responding to that issue for the last 40 years .
Many people have been having a vibrant , vital , consistent conversation about the necessity for self - responsibility .
What I did n't hear you say is that black people are not responsible for Oscar Grant , when he goes out in Oakland and gets viciously assaulted by policemen .
" We are not responsible for chimpanzee cartoons put forward by the New York Post that draw an implicit relationship between the president and ... "
Mid-sentence , Dyson 's image froze .
The host backtracked and apologized for technical difficulties in the video stream .
" Go ahead , Pat , " he said , even as Buchanan had already re-launched .
" In the statistics on group crime against individuals , gang rape and grang , ah , gang assaults , the numbers are almost 100 to one , " he said .
" Fourty - five percent of African American crime is committed against whites .
Whites commit three percent of their crimes against African Americans .
All crimes should be condemned , but it seems to me , in the African American community , you 're [ inaudible ] your own responsibilities instead of your faults . "
Of course , Buchanan did not mention that , according to the Violence Prevention Institute , the majority -- 52 percent -- of the " 24,950 juveniles ages 12 - 17 who were murdered annually between 1980 - 2000 " were African American .
Dyson , shaking his head , had already begun his retort .
" First of all , people commit ...
See , you 're trying to ... " he said as Buchanan concluded .
" What you 've done ...
You 're trying to derail ...
Saying responsibility ...
According to you , the entire problem of racial fascism in this country rests upon the backs of black people .
You have not owned up to , at one point in this conversation ... "
Buchanan was already several words into a rebuttal .
" ... Owning up to anything , fella , " he said .
" ... The reality that the dominant American culture has fed and fueled the viciousness , " said Dyson .
He was cut off again .
This time , Buchanan was yelling .
" Stop blamin ' everybody else , " he said .
" You continue to blame ... Look , the African American community is far more law abiding ... "
Then Dyson returned the favor , injecting himself back into the conversation .
" I 'm not blaming anybody , " he said .
" When black people talk about honest feelings , it 's called blaming .
When white people talk about it , it 's being called held responsible . "
The line caused Buchanan to pause and chuckle before defending his position yet again .
By this point , the conversation had devolved into both commentators simply speaking at the same time : Dyson agreeing with Attorney General Holder 's assessment of America 's racial cowardice and Buchanan making a muted reference to segregation .
Saying the African American community of 1948 was " far less criminal than it is today , " Buchanan was concievably evoking a report issued in 1948 on " Segregation in Washington [ D.C. ] , " a city which was not desegregated until the mid-50s .
" ... If we can't be honest about that , " said Dyson .
" Many black people are used to hearing negative things about them every day in the press .
Many white people are not .
It 's time that we shared the burden and redistribute the pain and all of us engage in a convincing , open , cogent explanation about why we are where we are racially .
Eric Holder has done that with his brilliant comments . "

Much to the chagrin of those who wish to prevent students from learning about science that challenges neo-Darwinism , academic freedom bills have been submitted to the legislatures of five states so far this year .
The arguments from critics against these bills are utterly predictable — but they unwittingly demonstrate the need for academic freedom legislation .
Before the Oklahoma Academic Freedom Bill died in committee last week , two Oklahoma Darwinists created a scare - FAQ to lobby Oklahoma legislators , stating : “ This bill is designed to cast doubt on science as a valid way of understanding the world and to promote ideas based on religious faith . …
This is a ‘ Trojan horse ’ bill intended to open the door for the teaching of religious concepts in school science classes . ”
Similar arguments were made by Iowa Darwinists , who signed a petition stating that “ ‘ academic freedom ’ for alternative theories is simply a mechanism to introduce religious or non-scientific doctrines into our science curriculum . ”
These arguments are difficult to take seriously , because the actual text of the Oklahoma bill , for example , says precisely the opposite :
This act only protects the teaching of scientific information , and this act shall not be construed to promote any religious or non-religious doctrine , promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or non-beliefs , or promote discrimination for or against religion or non-religion .
On the contrary , the intent is to create an environment in which both the teacher and students can openly and objectively discuss the facts and observations of science , and the assumptions that underlie their interpretation .
Plainly , the teaching of religion will NOT be protected by this bill ; it only protects the teaching of science .
What these Darwinists really do n’t like about the bill , of course , is that it protects the rights of teachers to discuss scientific weaknesses in evolution .
By falsely equating such discussions with religion , which is illegal to advocate in public school science classrooms , these Darwinists are creating the very climate of fear and intimidation that this bill is designed to alleviate .
Thus , whether they realize or not , theses fear - mongering Darwinists have unwittingly provided an elegant justification for the bill .
The Oklahoma Darwinists further argued that “ weaknesses ” in evolution cannot be taught because …
Promoting the notion that there is some scientific controversy is just plain dishonest … .
That fact that evolution has occurred is accepted by virtually all scientists around the world and is as well established as the fact that the Earth is round .
There really are no scientific ‘ weaknesses . ’
If one looks at the sources of these alleged weaknesses , we find they are phony fabrications , invented and promoted by people who do n’t like evolution .
Likewise , the Iowa Darwinists assert that “ there is no real dissent within the scientific community . ”
We ’ve heard this before ( see “ Who in Texas Is Afraid of a Little Critical Analysis of Evolution ? “ ) .
More troubling , however , is the type of climate created in the classroom when you tell teachers and students that it ’s “ dishonest ” to discuss scientific doubts about evolution because there is “ no real dissent , ” or that there are “ no scientific ‘ weaknesses ' ” in evolution — only “ phony fabrications . ”
The effect of these Darwinist arguments , ironically , is to chill academic freedom through scare - tactics where teachers fear they will be subject to ridicule , intimidation , or worse if they raise these scientific controversies with students .
Again , this is precisely why academic freedom legislation is needed .
Falsehoods and More Fear - Mongering
The Oklahoma Darwinists promoted the patently false claim that the Louisiana Academic Freedom bill has cost taxpayers in that state money : “ In Louisiana school districts have faced serious problems implementing the law and costly lawsuits filed over its constitutionality . ”
The problem with that claim is that not one single lawsuit has been filed in Louisiana over their academic freedom law .
Their statement is a falsehood , pure and simple .
Similar fear - mongering is found in the Iowa Darwinist petition , which states , “ Similar efforts to undermine the teaching of evolution in schools repeatedly have been found to be unconstitutional , something witnessed most recently in Kitzmiller v. Dover ( 2005 ) in Pennsylvania . ”
But the policy in Dover is in no way “ similar ” to an academic freedom bill for a variety of reasons :
First ,
Dover ’s policy required the teaching of intelligent design , whereas academic freedom legislation compels teachers to do nothing differently , it only protects the rights of teachers to choose to teach scientific controversies in an objective manner without having to fear for their jobs .
Second , these academic freedom bills do not bring intelligent design into the curriculum because they do not try to settle the dispute over whether intelligent design is science .
All the bills do protect is teaching science , and they expressly do not protect teaching religion .
Who could object to that ?
Finally , academic freedom legislation does not “ undermine the teaching of evolution . ”
In fact , the bills protect the teaching of the “ scientific strengths ” of evolution as much as they protect the teaching of weaknesses .
Eugenie Scott and other Darwinists are constantly complaining ( and rightly so ) that many teachers feel intimidated from teaching a pro-evolution curriculum .
These bills protect those teachers ’ rights just as much as they protect teachers that want to also discuss scientific challenges to evolution .
These bills are true academic freedom bills : they protect the teaching of legitimate science surrounding evolution and other controversial scientific theories , whether for or against .
Projecting Charges of Censorship
Finally , the Oklahoma Darwinist engages in projection , stating : “ this approach teaches our children that it is acceptable to simply ignore the parts of science they do n’t happen to like . ”
This allegation turns the intent of the bill on its head .
This bill does n’t remove evolution from the classroom !
This bill allows teachers to ignore no part of the required curriculum , and last time I checked , Oklahoma teachers are still required to teach evolution .
In fact , as noted , the bill protects the rights of teachers discuss the “ strengths ” of evolution as much as its “ weaknesses . ”
Thus , this bill is not about taking science out of the classroom , but allowing more science into the classroom .
By denying that there are any scientific weaknesses in evolution , it ’s these Darwinists who wish to “ ignore the parts of science they do n’t happen to like . ”
What ’s Really Going On Here ?
The difference between proponents of academic freedom and these Darwinists is that supporters of this bill have no objections to teaching the pro-evolution scientific evidence .
The bills ’ supporters simply want teachers to have the freedom to give students access to more science on controversial scientific topics .
These Darwinists are the ones who want to censor viewpoints by using intimidation tactics to convince teachers that if they discuss scientific weaknesses in evolution , then religion and “ dishonesty ” will come into the classroom .
Such rhetoric creates a climate that intimidates teachers from feeling free to teach controversial scientific theories in an objective manner that discusses both majority and dissenting scientific viewpoints .
This is harmful to education , freedom of inquiry , and the pursuit of scientific truth .
The anti-freedom behavior of these Darwinists shows precisely why legislation like this is needed .
Richard Feynman physics video lectures
Feynman video interviews
Feynman audios
Richard Phillips Feynman at The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures
Video lecture description :
Chosen by the New Scientist - best on - line videos of 2007 .
A set of four priceless archival video recordings from the University of Auckland ( New Zealand ) of the outstanding Nobel prize - winning physicist Richard Feynmann - arguably the greatest science lecturer ever .
Although the recording is of modest technical quality the exceptional personal style and unique delivery shine through .
Feynman gives us not just a lesson in basic physics but also a deep insight into the scientific mind of a 20th century genius analyzing the approach of the 17th century genius Newton .
The lectures are in the same style as his famous " Feynman Lectures on Physics " which he taught at Caltech .
Quantumelectrodynamics ( QED ) was the subject of " QED - The Strange Theory of Light and Matter , " the popular book by Richard Feynman which was first published by Princeton University Press in 1985 .
Feynman makes passing references to the fact that the book is based on a series of general lectures on QED which were first delivered in New Zealand .
Feynman had doubts about the accessibility of the lectures on QED to a general audience , and chose not to initially deliver these lectures at his native Caltech .
Rather he chose remote New Zealand as his testing ground and in the process , gave the New Zealand physics community the dubious honor of being the guinea - pigs for his QED lectures .
At Auckland University , these lectures were delivered in 1979 , as the Sir Douglas Robb Lectures .
Although the published version of " QED - The Strange Theory of Light and Matter " is an excellent self - contained description of the subject , watching an unedited Feynman delivering the lectures reveals his style and enthusiasm for his subject in a way which is impossible in a printed medium .
Direct quotations from the lectures provide fascinating additional insight both into the material of QED itself and into Feynman 's character .

The Pleasure of Finding Things Out ( 1981 )
Video description :
This is an interview with Richard Feynman from 1981 .
As it is said , it 's fifty minutes of pure Feynman !
It will delight and inspire anyone who would like to share something of the joys of scientific discovery .
Feynman is a master storyteller , and his tales - about childhood , Los Alamos , or how he won a Nobel Prize - are a vivid and entertaining insight into the mind of a great scientist at work and play .
Feynman talks about his childhood , his first encounter with calculus reading " Calculus for the Practical Man " at age thirteen , how they build the Bomb in Los Alamos , how they threw a party while Hiroshima was burning , how a seemingly simple problem of rotating bodies led to to quantum electrodynamics .
Here 's Feynman commenting on the Nobel prize he received : " I do n't like honours .
I appreciate it for the work that I did and for people who appreciate it and I notice when other phycicists use my work .
I do n't need anything else .
I do n't think there 's any sense to anything else .
I do n't see that it makes any point , that someone in the Swedish academy decides that this work is nobel enough to receive a prize .
I 've already got the price !
The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out , the kick in the discovery , the observation of the people who use it .
Those are the real things !
The honours are unreal to me .
I do n't believe in honours . "
Richard Feynman , The Last Journey Of A Genius : The Quest for Tannu Tuva
Video description :
Richard Feynman was not only an iconoclastic and influential theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate but also an explorer at heart .
Feynman through video recordings and comments from his friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton tell the extraordinary story of their enchantment with Tuva , a strange and distant land in the centre of Asia .
While few Westerners knew about Tuva , Feynman discovered its existence from the unique postage stamps issued there in the early 20th century .
He was intrigued by the unusual name of its capital , Kyzyl , and resolved to travel to the remote , mountainous land .
However , the Soviets , who controlled access , were mistrustful , unconvinced that he was interested only in the scenery .
They obstructed his plans throughout 13 years .
The majority of the scenes are extended narratives by Feynman .
There is included a delightful extended discussion and demonstration of Feyman 's bongo playing .
Feynman explains how he used a phrase book of the Tuva language to write and express an interest in visiting there .
The proposed trip took years to arrange .
The programme never does get to show Feyman in Tuva ; he died of abdominal cancer a few days after the recorded interview , at age 69 in February 1988 .
The story is interspersed with earlier recorded conversations by Feynman that add his perspectives on the nature of physics .
So , this is not a travel documentary at all ; rather it is another fascinating insight into the exciting personality of Richard Feynman .
Take The World From Another Point Of View with Richard Feynman
Video description :
In this video Feynman invites the viewers to think about the world from a different angle .
He starts with an interesting question , " Why do we do things we do ? " and then asks if there is a good reason to do these things .
He proceeds with explaining that there is absolutely zero value in knowing the names of things .
The only value is in knowing what they are and now how they are called .
The video continues with Feynman explaining how physics is done and what it means .
The Best Mind Since Einstein : Richard Feynman
Video overview :
The Best Mind Since Einstein video discovers why Feynman was an unrivaled storyteller and explainer of science .
Hear Feynman talk - not only about the meaning of existence and the impact of the atom bomb , but also flying saucers , anti-gravity machines , and why uncooked spaghetti always breaks in three pieces .
The Feynman video relives the moments when Feynman revealed the cause of the Challenger disaster by dropping a rubber ring into a glass of ice water .
It was a piece of showmanship that brought him more attention than anything else in his career .
But Feynman insisted that awards and honors meant little .
The real prize , he claimed was " the pleasure of finding things out . "
Remembering Richard Feynman
Video description :
Nobel - Prize - winning physicist Richard Feynman lived an extraordinary life and inspired people in many disciplines .
His daughter Michelle Feynman joined Nathan Myhrvold , co-founded Intellectual Ventures , George Dyson , author and historian , and UW Physicist Steve Ellis , who knew Feynman and worked in his field of particle physics , to talk about his life and read from his newly released book of letters , ' Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track ' .
This event was presented with Elliott Bay Books as part the Seattle Science Lectures at Town Hall .
Murry Gell - Mann Talks About Feynman
Video description :
Murry Gell - Mann also received the Nobel Prize .
He says Feynman and him collaborated , and Richard invited him to Cal - Tech .
Murry says Richard helped him with some physics , particularly renormalization groups , which he ( Richard ) had never seen before .
They worked together for a few years .
Murray says he got annoyed by Feynman because Feynman spent too much time generating anecdotes about himself .
As Murray says , Feynman always wanted to be different , he even did n't brush or floss his teeth !
Feynman kept saying that brushing and flossing teeth and washing hands after toilet was superstition .

Feynman Compares Doing Physics to Figuring out Rules of the Chess Game
Video description :
This video is a fragment from " The Pleasure of Finding Things Out " above .
Richard P. Feynman comes up with a fun analogy of how physicists are trying to understand the Nature .
Imagine that Gods are playing a chess game and you do n't know the rules , but you are allowed to see the game from time to time .
From this game you have to figure out the rules of chess , that is analogous to discovering physical laws !
Feynman at Challenger Disaster Investigation Committee
Video description :
Richard Feynman states that the O-ring material has no resilience at 32 F or 0C which was the temperature at Challenger 's launch .
This allowed the liquid oxygen leak from the main booster tank .
Feynman Does n't Like Nobel Prize
Video description :
This video is a fragment from " The Pleasure of Finding Things Out " above .
In this fragment Richard Feynmen is very critical of the Nobel Prize .
He says he does not like honours , and he does not need it and there is no point in this prize .
Feynman says that the pleasure of finding things out is everything that needs !
Rich Feynman Explains the Feeling of Confusion
Video description :
When you are thinking about something you do n't understand you have a terrible , uncomfortable feeling called " confusion . "
It 's a very difficult and unhappy business .
Most of the time you are rather unhappy with this confusion , you can't penetrate this thing .
The confusion is because we are some kind of apes , we are kind of stupid , trying to figure out how to put two sticks together to get banana .
Feynman says he gets this feeling all the time , that he is a stupid ape trying to put two sticks together .
Once in a while , however , the sticks go together and you reach banana !

Feynman on the Universe in Glass of Wine
Audio description :
A poet once said , " The Whole Universe is in a Glass of Wine " .
Feynman argues that it is true !
If you look closely , there is the Universe in wine .
There is all the physics - twisting liquid , reflections and glass , our imagination adds atoms , it evaporates depending on wind and weather .
Feynman on Symmetry in Physical Law
Audio description (+ slides ) :
Richard Feynman , towards the end of a Caltech lecture to undergraduates on symmetry in physical laws , discusses Nature 's near - symmetry ( as in parity non-conservation ) and the Yomeimon in Nikko , Japan .

Cascadia CEO 's Cleantech Forecasts for 2009
December 31st , 2008 by Jennifer Kho
It ’s been quite a year for the cleantech industry , with roller - coaster oil and stock prices , multiyear federal tax credits finally passed after more than a year of narrowly failed attempts , the beginning of a recession and the election of a new president .
“ It feels like it ’s been three years in one just with all the emotions , ” said Michael Butler , CEO of investment bank Cascadia Capital .
“ A lot of people thought they were having a really good year , then they were hit with the negative economic environment . …
So many people are saying ‘ let ’s just shut down until the end of the year . ' ”
As the bumpy year ends , industry insiders such as Butler are trying to predict what the next year will bring .
It ’s a difficult task in an environment where most investors seem to be waiting , keeping their money in their pockets , to see what happens .
Tim Teich , vice president for sales and marketing at Global Solar , says it feels like everyone ’s holding their breath .
“ Everyone ’s constricted , ” he said .
“ It might be a sucking in of the breath before letting it out , but most people are holding it right now , which is creating this pause . ”
Butler , at least , is optimistic .
He says the economic climate has been partly mitigated by president - elect Barack Obama .
“ You ’ve got people giddy right now ; there ’s a lot of excitement [ about that ] , ” he said .
“ It ’s offsetting some of the malaise . ”
Butler said he thinks next year will the “ an OK year ” for cleantech , bolstered by support from the Obama administration , that will set the market up for a big market in 2010 and 2011 .
He expects that sectors such as software , green IT and green building sectors fare well .
“ Less capital - intensive sectors will do well ; more capital - intensive sectors will struggle , ” he predicts .
Still , in spite of its reliance on capital , he thinks solar will continue to thrive .
“ Solar seems to have reached a tipping point because there ’s so much momentum , ” he said .
“ I think [ solar ] valuations are coming down – some of the valuations got ahead of themselves – but some of those companies are great long - term plays .
Some are maybe not worth $ 1 billion , maybe they ’re worth $ 400 million , but [ solar ] is real . ”

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
WASHINGTON - When she graduates from Columbia University next year with a master 's degree in public health , Erin Wheeler is hoping to get a job in international reproductive health .
The 26 - year - old Washington , D.C. , native has always wanted to work in public service .
She spent two years in the Peace Corps in Senegal and plans to spend next summer working on an early childhood development project in South Africa .
But public service does n't pay much , and her two - year program at Columbia costs about $ 50,000 a year with living expenses .
She has a scholarship from Columbia that covers just $ 4,000 year and has taken out subsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford Loans and a graduate PLUS loan to pay for the rest .
All three loans are federally insured .
" $ 100,000 is not realistic for someone coming out making $ 40,000 or $ 50,000 a year , " she said while waiting for a latte at a local cafe .
She worries that she will spend years paying back her student loans and not have money left over to put away in an IRA or 401 ( k ) .
" You spend your whole life paying back thousands of dollars , " she said .
Wheeler is wondering what she can do to ease the pain of being in debt postgraduation .
Would she qualify for a public service loan forgiveness program ?
Is there anything else she can do to handle the debt ?
The good news is that in 2007 , Congress recognized that there were so many students in Wheeler 's position that it passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act .
There were two programs established by this act that Wheeler should look into , two advisers said .
The first is the income - based repayment plan , which allows lower - income graduates with a lot of debt to reduce their monthly payments .
Depending on a graduate 's income and level of debt , the program , which goes into effect July 1 , could limit his or her annual educational loan debt repayment to 15 percent of discretionary income , said Peter Mazareas , vice chairman of the College Savings Foundation , a Washington - based advocacy association .
The second is the public service loan forgiveness plan , in which the federal government will forgive the remaining debt of borrowers who make 120 loan payments while working full time in public - service jobs .
The graduate must have a Federal Direct Stafford , PLUS , graduate PLUS , or Federal Direct Consolidation loan .
Depending on the level of debt
Wheeler ends up with and how much she repays over 10 years , Mazareas said she could end up with about $ 75,000 of her debt forgiven .
" Typically , it is projected that a borrower who performs public service under this program will repay only about one - fourth to one - half as much money as a borrower who does not , " he said .
He also pointed out that public service is broadly defined and includes any government and nonprofit organization job .
A public health job would qualify , he and other advisers said .
But there is one caveat :
The amount forgiven will probably be treated as taxable income , which could lead to a whopping federal income tax bill after 10 years .
Presumably , though , the savings will outweigh the tax liability .
Congress could end up excluding such loan forgiveness from taxable income by the time it becomes an issue , the advisers said .
Scott Prince , a student loan specialist who runs Boston - based Prince Consulting Services , also advised Wheeler and other students in her position to look beyond these two programs .
Some states , such as Massachusetts , offer loan forgiveness programs , so be sure to contact your state higher education organization .
Also check with your school and employer about programs they have available , he said .
In addition , graduates in certain professions , such as teaching and child care , could qualify for other federal student loan forgiveness , Prince said .

Hardly anyone actually shoots themselves in the foot or literally gets egg on their face , so it was a real pleasure last week , in so many ways , to witness Jacqui Smith being hoist with her own petard .
A petard was , in the original French , an explosion of intestinal gas which , in turn , gave its name to a small bomb , such as the one that erupted across the papers last week , when the neighbours of her sister 's house in Peckham , south London , came forward and told the press that she was only there a couple of days a week .
Because , in the small matter of whether she was right to pocket £ 116,000 of additional expenses by claiming that the back bedroom she rents off sister is her " main home " , as opposed to the house she owns in her constituency in Redditch where her husband and children happen to live , this turns out to be critical testimony .
Standards Commissioner John Lyon twice turned down requests to investigate the matter .
It was only when some neighbours , Dominic and Jessica Taplin , wrote to him and repeated the claims they made to a newspaper , that she is there rather less than the four nights a week that she claims , that he agreed to open an inquiry .
It 's this that 's the real beauty of the story .
Residents on the online East Dulwich forum ( East Dulwich being what you call Peckham if you happen to live there ) declared themselves outraged at the behaviour of the neighbours , with words like " snitch " , " curtain - twitchers " , " grassers " and " narks " being bandied about ( apparently " Dominic and Jessica Taplin represent all that 's worst about the new smug arriviste elements of East Dulwich " ) .
This is the world that Jacqui Smith has created .
The only shame is that they did n't capture her on CCTV .
If you want to rat out your neighbours , allow the home secretary to enumerate the ways .
Do you know someone who claims more from the state than they 're entitled to ?
Who is " picking the pockets of law - abiding taxpayers " ?
Not politicians over - egging their allowances , obviously , but " benefit thieves " .
If so , call 0800 854 440 now .
" We 're closing in with hidden cameras .
We 're closing in with every means at our disposal . "
Do they own more than one mobile phone ?
Then call 0800 789 321 .
" Terrorists need communication .
They often collect and use many pay - as - you - go mobile phones , as well as swapping Sim cards and handsets . "
No mobile phones ?
What about if they 're " hanging around " ?
Or , as the Home Office - funded radio advertisement puts it : " How can you tell if they 're a normal everyday person or a terrorist ?
The answer is that you do n't have to .
If you call the confidential Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321 , the specialist officers you speak to will analyse the information .
They 'll decide if and how to follow it up .
You do n't have to be sure .
If you suspect it , report it . "
It 's such a lovely turn of phrase , that .
If you suspect it , report it .
Do n't wait for evidence .
Or question your own prejudices .
If someone 's not a " normal everyday person " exactly like you , then they could well be a member of al - Qaida .
What flawless logic that is .
We 're already described as " a surveillance state " by Privacy International , one in five of all CCTV cameras ever made are currently in Britain , and Smith is drawing up plans to intercept every phone call we make and every email we send .
The Taplins were n't snitches - they were perfect citizens in her New Model Army .
And while her critics invoke the analogy of the Stasi , a more accurate comparison would be with a suburb in Connecticut , circa 1961 .
Because for all its period atmosphere with Kate Winslet in a little pill - box hat , Revolutionary Road , the film for which she may or may not win an Oscar tonight , feels a curiously contemporary affair .
Not just for its critique of capitalism , the profound sense of emptiness that afflicts the characters despite , or maybe because of , their material comforts , but because of the hermetic vision of suburbia it offers : a conformity of living , of beliefs , aspirations and behaviour that is rigorously policed by family , friends and neighbours .
If you suspect it , report it .
And if you live by the sword , Jacqui , you must be prepared to die by it too .

that many stately homes where us garden - deprived city folk tend to gather , ie in cities .
Britain is a small country , with a shortage of land , but it 's not as small as the Czech Republic , where almost every family has a " chata " , or summer house .
Most of them are no bigger or more fancy than a garden shed , located in colonies in forests and woods .
Even during the dark days of communism , it gave the tower block dwellers somewhere to grow things , gather things and pickle things .
Here , a second home is where one shows off one 's enormous wealth and interior decorating skills .
Which is why it 's truly great news that Garrington , the property - finding firm owned by " property expert " Phil Spencer , went into administration last week .
Not for Phil , obviously , or the people who lost their jobs , but if it means that C4 axes Location , Location , Location , the most zeitgeistless programme on the telly , then so be it .
But back to me .
I 'm delighted to report that I 'm 871 on my council 's allotment list .
In 2008 , 18 plots came up , so it 's just a matter of sitting out the next 48 years .
It 's good to have something to look forward to and , as long as I do n't do something premature , like die , I 'm sure that taking up heavy digging in my 80s will be most rewarding .
What shall I buy - a sandwich or an engagement ring ?
To those who have long suspected that the " credit crunch " is to the marketing departments of 2009 what " environmentally friendly " was to those of 2008 - ie the death of all imagination and an expedient way to get rid of any old rubbish - comes the Marks & Spencer £ 18 engagement and wedding ring set .
These are no ordinary wedding rings .
They 're Marks & Spencer wedding rings , " diamante encrusted " , platinum - plated and made of that well - known precious metal , " tin alloy " .
In place of a hallmark , " the M&S logo features on the inside of the bands " .
Now there are those who say diamonds are not forever , they 're for demonstrating you 're happy to wear an object that has been mined by poorly paid African labourers employed by a vast , multinational company famous for its monopolistic practices .
But even so .
The idea that this is a " credit crunch " wedding ring , as opposed to an opportunistic press release attached to a cheapo bit of tat found lying around the stockroom floor , is the equivalent of those signs about not washing the towels in hotel bathrooms for the sake of the environment : ie a lie .
And a pointless one at that .
Because , to paraphrase Blackadder , not even a niggard who used to be professor of niggardliness at Oxford University would buy an engagement ring for little more than the price of an M&S prawn sandwich : a comestible - to - jewellery price comparison , which those with longer memories may recall was what sank poor old Gerald Ratner .
So here , for Sir Stuart Rose , M&S chairman and the overseer of its worst Christmas trading for a decade , is the rest of Gerald Ratner 's fateful quote : " We also do cutglass sherry decanters complete with six glasses on a silver - plated tray that your butler can serve you drinks on , all for £ 4.95 .
People say , ' How can you sell this for such a low price ? '
I say because it 's total crap . "
My Ickle pony
For want of £ 20,000 , South Ayrshire Council has decided that Pets Corner animal sanctuary must go .
Farewell then , Barnie the donkey and Ickle the Welsh pony , who " will probably be forced to go to a market , where most horses are sold for meat " .
Yes , well , after press like this , I doubt Ickle will become the latest victim of the credit crunch .

Barack Obama 's chances of making a fresh start in US relations with the Muslim world , and the Middle East in particular , appear to diminish with each new wave of Israeli attacks on Palestinian targets in Gaza .
That seems hardly fair , given the president - elect does not take office until January 20 .
But foreign wars do n't wait for Washington inaugurations .
Obama has remained wholly silent during the Gaza crisis .
His aides say he is following established protocol that the US has only one president at a time .
Hillary Clinton , his designated secretary of state , and Joe Biden , the vice - president - elect and foreign policy expert , have also been uncharacteristically taciturn on the subject .
But evidence is mounting that Obama is already losing ground among key Arab and Muslim audiences that cannot understand why , given his promise of change , he has not spoken out .
Arab commentators and editorialists say there is growing disappointment at Obama 's detachment - and that his failure to distance himself from George Bush 's strongly pro-Israeli stance is encouraging the belief that he either shares Bush 's bias or simply does not care .
The Al - Jazeera satellite television station recently broadcast footage of Obama on holiday in Hawaii , wearing shorts and playing golf , juxtaposed with scenes of bloodshed and mayhem in Gaza .
Its report criticising " the deafening silence from the Obama team " suggested Obama is losing a battle of perceptions among Muslims that he may not realise has even begun .
" People recall his campaign slogan of change and hoped that it would apply to the Palestinian situation , " Jordanian analyst Labib Kamhawi told Liz Sly of the Chicago Tribune .
" So they look at his silence as a negative sign .
They think he is condoning what happened in Gaza because he 's not expressing any opinion . "
Regional critics claim Obama is happy to break his pre-inauguration " no comment " rule on international issues when it suits him .
They note his swift condemnation of November 's terrorist attacks in Mumbai .
Obama has also made frequent policy statements on mitigating the impact of the global credit crunch .
Obama 's absence from the fray is also allowing hostile voices to exploit the vacuum .
" It would appear that the president - elect has no intention of getting involved in the Gaza crisis , " Iran 's Resalat newspaper commented sourly .
" His stances and viewpoints suggest he will follow the path taken by previous American presidents ...
Obama , too , will pursue policies that support the Zionist aggressions . "
Whether Obama , when he does eventually engage , can successfully elucidate an Israel - Palestine policy that is substantively different from that of Bush - Cheney is wholly uncertain at present .
To maintain the hardline US posture of placing the blame for all current troubles squarely on Hamas , to the extent of repeatedly blocking limited UN security council ceasefire moves , would be to end all realistic hopes of winning back Arab opinion - and could have negative , knock - on consequences for US interests in Iraq , Afghanistan and the Gulf .
Yet if Obama were to take a tougher ( some would say more balanced ) line with Israel , for example by demanding a permanent end to its blockade of Gaza , or by opening a path to talks with Hamas , he risks provoking a rightwing backlash in Israel , giving encouragement to Israel 's enemies , and losing support at home for little political advantage .
A recent Pew Research Centre survey , for example , showed how different are US perspectives to those of Europe and the Middle East .
Americans placed " finding a solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict " at the bottom of a 12 - issue list of foreign policy concerns , the poll found .
And foreign policy is in any case of scant consequence to a large majority of US voters primarily worried about the economy , jobs and savings .
On the campaign trail , Obama ( like Clinton ) was broadly supportive of Israel and specifically condemnatory of Hamas .
But at the same time , he held out the prospect of radical change in western relations with Muslims everywhere , promising to make a definitive policy speech in a " major Islamic forum " within 100 days of taking office .
" I will make clear that we are not at war with Islam , that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future , and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence , " he said .
As the Gaza casualty headcount goes up and Obama keeps his head down , those sentiments are beginning to sound a little hollow .
The danger is that when he finally peers over the parapet on January 21 , the battle of perceptions may already be half - lost .
Can it be true ?
Are the other " major powers " in the world finally moving towards a position where their contempt for the assertion of US power is actually being embodied in action ?
For the fourth year running the United Nations has voted for the motion condemning the US embargo of Cuba , this time by 137 votes ( including Great Britain ! ) to three .
The countries against the motion were the US , Israel and Uzbekistan .
The European Union is taking the US to the World Trade Organisation panel , arguing that the Helms / Burton bill is illegal .
Fourteen out of 15 members of the security council ( including Great Britain ! ) voted against the US veto of Boutros Boutros - Ghali .
The US was on its own .
How can any country stand out against such a consensus ?
How can any country , in the light of such blanket condemnation of its policies and actions , not pause to take a little thought , not subject itself to even the mildest and most tentative critical scrutiny ?
The answer is quite simple .
If you believe you still call all the shots you just do n't give a shit .
You say , without beating about the bush :
Yes , sure , I am biased and arrogant and in many respects ignorant , but so what ?
I possess the economic and military might to back me up to the hilt and I do n't care who knows it .
And when I say that I also occupy the moral high ground you 'd better believe it .
The US is without doubt the greatest show on the road .
Brutal , indifferent , scornful and ruthless it may be , but it 's also very smart .
As a salesman it 's out on its own .
And its most saleable commodity is self - love .
It 's a winner .
The US has actually educated itself to be in love with itself .
Listen to President Clinton – and before him , Bush and before him , Reagan and before him all the others – say on television the words : " The American People " as in the sentence , " I say to the American People it is time to pray and to defend the rights of the American People and I ask the American People to trust their President in the action he is about to take on behalf of the American People . "
A nation weeps .
It 's a pretty brilliant stratagem .
Language is actually employed to keep thought at bay .
The words The American People provide a truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance .
You do n't need to think .
Just lie back on the cushion .
The cushion may be suffocating your intelligence and your critical faculties but you do n't know that .
Nobody tells you .
So the status quo remains where it is and Father Christmas remains American and America remains the Land of the Brave and the Home of the Free .
Except of course for the 1.5 million people in prison , the 50 million living under the poverty line , the adolescents and mentally deficient about to be gassed or injected or electrocuted in the 38 out of 52 states which carry the death penalty .
They do n't feel quite the same about this cushion of reassurance , but nobody listens to them anyway .
As they are mostly poor and black they are essentially subversive .
They are subversive because where they are resentful and critical and degraded and angry they threaten the stability of the state .
The one thing they can have is God .
If they want him .
God belongs to every American .
Successive American presidents have made this quite clear .
Sometimes you look back into recent history and you ask : did all that really happen ?
Were half a million " communists " massacred in Indonesia in 1965 ( the rivers clogged with corpses ) ?
Were 200,000 people killed in East Timor in 1975 by the Indonesian invaders ?
Have 300,000 people died in Central America since 1960 ?
Has the persecution of the Kurdish people in Turkey reached levels which approach genocide ?
Are countless lraqi children dying every month for lack of food and medicine brought about by UN sanctions ?
Did the military coups in Argentina , Uruguay , Brazil and Chile result in levels of repression and depth of suffering comparable to Nazi Germany , Stalinist Russia and the Khmer Rouge ?
And has the US to one degree or another inspired , engendered , subsidised and sustained all these states of affairs ?
The answer is yes .
It has and it does .
But you would n't know it .
It never happened .
Nothing ever happened .
Even while it was happening it was n't happening .
It did n't matter .
It was of no interest .
The crimes of the US throughout the world have been systematic , constant , clinical , remorseless and fully documented but nobody talks about them .
Nobody ever has .
It 's probably more than a newspaper or TV channel 's life is worth to do so .
And it must be said that as the absolute necessity of economic control is at the bottom of all this , any innocent bystander who raises his head must be kicked in the teeth .
This is entirely logical .
The market must and will overcome .
Perhaps the story that really takes the biscuit or beats the band or finally makes the cat laugh is the story of Haiti , a story virtually ignored by the world for decades .
Haiti suffered under the grisly Duvalier dictatorships and their paramilitary force , the Tontons Macoutes , for 29 years .
By 1986 popular feeling was so powerful that the Duvalier regime collapsed .
Other military dictatorships followed but in 1990 the first democratic election in Haiti took place .
President Aristide was elected with 67 per cent of the vote .
His platform : " To bring the Haitian people from misery to dignity . "
Eight months later there was a coup d'etat .
For three years the military again ruled .
During this period 5,000 people were killed .
The US was finally forced to act .
It led a UN force to the island , to " restore democracy " .
What it actually did was to restore the status quo , to give the generals various modes of asylum and protection and to effectively emasculate Aristide .
His economic policies , for which the people had elected him , were discarded .
The IMF and the World Bank moved in .
They insisted on the application of a structural adjustment policy which threatens all hope of equitable development and progress in the country .
People in Haiti refer to this plan as the " Death Plan " .
It will destroy the country 's peasant economy .
As a rider , the US army took from the Haitian army headquarters 160,000 pages of documents .
The US government refuses to return these documents .
Why ?
Guess .
The documents show the extent of CIA involvement in the coup which overthrew Aristide in 1991 .
Lastly , an elegy .
Curtains are drawn , lights go out .
It 's as if it never happened .
In Nicaragua in 1979 , the Sandinistas triumphed in a remarkable popular revolution against the Somoza dictatorship .
They went on to address their poverty - stricken country with unprecedented vigour and sense of purpose .
They introduced a literacy campaign and health provision for all citizens which were unheard of in the region , if not throughout the whole continent .
The Sandinistas had plenty of faults but they were thoughtful , intelligent , decent and without malice .
They created an active , spontaneous , pluralistic society .
The US destroyed , through all means at its disposal and at the cost of 30,000 dead , the whole damn thing .
And they 're proud of it .
The general thrust these days is : " Oh come on , it 's all in the past , nobody 's interested any more , it did n't work , that 's all , everyone knows what the Americans are like , but stop being naive , this is the world , there 's nothing to be done about it and anyway , fuck it , who cares ? "
Sure , as they say , sure .
But let me put it this way – the dead are still looking at us , steadily , waiting for us to acknowledge our part in their murder .

Peter Schiff Rebuttal - A Response to My Critics
My popularity on television and the internet has led a very small money manager to use his popular financial blog to promote his fledgling business by attacking the recent poor performance of my long - term investment strategy .
The post is causing quite a stir and compels me to provide some badly needed context .
To achieve his ends , this individual has distorted much of what I have been saying and writing , and has twisted the facts to support his own preconceived conclusion .
In essence , his piece is nothing more than an overt advertisement ( and a highly deceptive one at that ) to use my popularity to advance his career .
In so doing he has given my critics , particularly some who have been embarrassed by their roles in the " Peter Schiff was Right " video , their moments of retribution .
In addition , some members of the press who have never been among my greatest fans are seizing the opportunity to discredit me as well .
The crux of the blogger 's arguments are that my beliefs in " decoupling , hyperinflation , and that the dollar is going to zero " have been completely discredited by the events of 2008 , and that the resulting investment losses suffered by my clients last year confirms the fatal flaws in my approach .
In addition to mischaracterizing many of my beliefs , he also is confusing short - term market fluctuations with long - term economic trends .
First of all , the hyper inflation issue is a straw man at best .
While I often talk about the possibility of hyper inflation , I have always said that it would be a worse - case scenario that would play out over many years .
The fact that it did not appear in the first year of the economic crash ( 2008 ) does not invalidate my position .
I have always maintained that this worst - case scenario will likely be avoided by what will ultimately be a dramatic shift in policy once our leaders come to their senses .
However , until then the dollar will likely lose a substantial portion of its value .
Second , I never said that the dollar would go to zero , either in 2008 or any year thereafter .
I have said that in the event of hyper inflation the dollar 's value would approach zero .
My actual forecast in my book " Crash Proof " was that the Dollar Index would fall to 40 ( currently about 85 ) , with a realistic worst case scenario , assuming very high but not hyper inflation , of 20 or lower .
Third , the blogger points out that because the decoupling theory ( foreign economies improving while the U.S. falters ) that I wrote about in " Crash Proof " has yet to occur , that the theory itself was ridiculous .
In my book I wrote that this process would not occur overnight , that initially our creditors would come to our aid , and in so doing our problems would become manifest abroad .
I wrote that it would take time for the world to realize that what had been decoupled from the economic train was not the engine but the caboose .
In fact , that is precisely the way it is playing out .
Chapter Ten of " Crash Proof " is specifically focused on the need to keep funds liquid to take advantage of the buying opportunity that would initially develop once our stock market began its collapse .
I specifically mentioned that when U.S. stocks began to fall , we could expect sympathetic declines overseas .
While I did not know the precise timing of those events , I advised readers to prepare .
I did not expect the huge dollar rally of 2008 .
But to discredit my long - term view of the dollar based on an eight month move is absurd .
So while I believed that a weak dollar would cushion the temporary decline I expected in foreign stocks , a strong dollar ended up exacerbating it .
In the meantime , I believed that the high dividends these stocks were paying would make it easier to ride out any correction .
The problem was that the dollar fell so far leading up to the crisis ( in 2005 - 2007 ) that by the time the crisis finally erupted the dollar was poised for a bounce .
Central to the argument that my investment thesis is wrong is the belief that the crisis is over or that the recent trends will continue until it is .
But the crisis is just beginning and the movements thus far in the dollar , commodities , and foreign stocks , are mere head fakes .
Once the speculators have been flushed from the markets , the underlying long - term trends I have been following should return in earnest .
To illustrate the flaws in my investment strategy the blogger has posted a client 's statement that shows a loss in excess of 60 % .
In addition , he claims to know of other Euro Pacific clients who have experienced similar losses .
The inference of course is that most , or all , of my clients must have suffered similar losses , and the existence of such losses proves that I am wrong .
In fact , some have gone a step further , claiming that such losses prove that I am a fraud .
First let 's deal with the one client 's account .
I have been following several key investment themes for the past ten years .
The basis for my strategy is that recent U.S. prosperity has been false , and that the consequences of the bursting of our bubble economy would ultimately play out in a substantial decline in the value of the U.S. dollar , higher commodity prices , the re-monetization of gold , and foreign equities substantially outperforming U.S. markets .
From an investment perspective , those themes played out extremely well in the eight years from 2000 - 2007 .
Recently we have seen a sharp , and I believe temporary , reversal of these trends .
Those that came late to the party ( at least based on where we are today ) now have to ride out a particularly difficult correction .
For example , the account in question belongs to the son of a long - standing Euro Pacific client , who is still adding funds to his accounts .
Without specially commenting on the performance of the father 's account , it must have been compelling enough to finally persuade the son to come on board himself in early 2008 .
However , as is often the case , by the time he came on board , foreign stocks and commodities were about to sell off , and the dollar was about to begin its unexpected rally .
Following such a sharp correction , the son now regrets his decision and must blame me for my part in helping him make it .
Perhaps as a stockbroker I should have persuaded the son to wait for a correction .
However , while this clearly would have been the right call with the full benefit of hind - sight , it was certainly not as clear given the information I had at the time .
However , I never held myself out to be a market timer .
My advice was always geared to long - term investors .
Given the thousands of clients that I have , and the large number who joined near the recent dollar peak and market tops , it 's no wonder that a few have contacted this blogger to complain ; especially since he has actively sought them out .
Of course , the fact that the overwhelming majority of my clients are not complaining , to him or anyone else for that matter , says a lot more about what is really going on .
To the extent that the long - term trends I have been following continue , I am confident that even those whose short - term timing was bad will still do well in time .
This is especially true if they take advantage of this pull back by adding to their accounts , either with new funds or by re-investing their dividends .
However , to examine the effectiveness of my investment strategy immediately following a major correction by looking only at those accounts who adopted the strategy at the previous peak is unfair and distortive .
Since I have been advising investors to follow these trends for ten years , I will leave it to the public to draw their own conclusions as to how long - term followers of my strategy have fared .
However , for those who only recently adopted my approach in 2007 or 2008 , the road has been a lot bumpier than they or I thought it would be when they climbed on board .
Yet if these long - term trends re-emerge , though the journey may be different than planned , the ultimate destination will remain the same .
The blogger in question implies that all of my clients are down by levels similar to the account he cites .
He has asked me to refute his allegations by providing broader performance figures for more clients .
But , since Euro Pacific Capital is a brokerage firm and not a Registered Investment Advisor , I am prohibited by regulators from providing any details on the investment performance achieved by my clients .
The blogger in question makes his challenge knowing full well that I am legally prevented from accepting it .
He then uses my failure to refute his false claim as validating its accuracy .
In addition , consider that 70 % of the account in question happens to be invested in mining and energy stocks .
These were the two sectors that got hit the hardest in the recent downturn .
This is a very aggressive exposure to those sectors and not typical of Euro Pacific clients .
While it is true that many of my clients are interested in these two sectors and specifically seek portfolios heavily weighted in these areas , most take a more balanced approach , with mining and energy typically representing 20 % to 30 % of their portfolios .
I also have clients with minimal or no exposure to these sectors .
All Euro Pacific client accounts are different reflecting the individual objectives of each client .
In general the goals of my clients are to get out of the dollar and hedge against inflation .
However the way each client chooses to pursue these goals varies .
Some choose a relatively conservative approach , consisting mainly of utilities , property trusts and bonds , others choice a more balanced approach , adding exposure to infrastructure , agriculture , energy trusts , and transportation , while some are more aggressive with heavy exposure to resources , junior mining companies , and oil and gas exploration companies .
Some clients specifically seek to gain or avoid exposure to certain regions , sectors or currencies .
Some are focused more on long - term preservation of purchasing power , while others look to maximize long - term appreciation .
Most of my accounts are yield oriented , but many of my clients specially request more aggressive growth oriented portfolios .
In a down market to evaluate my investment strategy based solely on the performance of the most aggressive accounts is completely unfair .
Doing so ignores the better performance of less aggressive accounts that were not hit nearly as hard .
In addition , to look only at the performance of foreign stocks , while ignoring other aspects of my investment strategy only tells part of the story .
What about gold , foreign bonds , short positions in financials , home builders and subprime mortgages ( or merely avoiding long exposure to those sectors ) , or other investments people have made , either at Euro Pacific or elsewhere based on my insights ?
What about dividends earned , or gains realized on closed positions ?
Mainstream economists , journalists , and investment professionals have never liked my message and have never resisted the temptation to shoot the messenger .
When my investment strategies were performing well , I got little credit for it .
Instead , all the attention was focused on the apparent failure of my dire economic predictions to materialize .
Now that the economy is collapsing along the lines that I correctly forecast , criticism is being focused on the recent poor performance of my investment strategy ( a fact that I have never tried to hide ) .
Of course by the time my investment strategy is once again in step with my economic forecasts , an event that I believe will occur sooner than most people think , it will likely be too late for most people to do adopt it .
My critics have often referred to me as a stopped clock .
I believe that the accusation is best leveled at the accusers .
Having been wrong for so long , they are now enjoying their brief moment in the sun .
They should enjoy it while it lasts .
For now , they are creating fodder for some future " Peter Schiff was Right " piece where those who now criticize my investment performance will look just as foolish as those who once criticized my economic forecasts .

Do not waste too much of your precious energy
Dear Peter , YOU will always have detractors - just for plainly speaking out .
Sense the bile , and may be you may realize their arguments are only a factual disguise for slander .
It will always hurt though - this is the price you pay for being independent and likeable .
You can not be part of main stream - concentrate on your crowd - and try to ignore them - do it for your sympathisers all over the world - like me .

The fact is , Peter Schiff 's investments began decreasing last January ( 2008 ) .
My husband and I put our 401 ( k ) s with his firm in July , purchasing things recommended by his brokers .
Our 401 ( k ) s promptly lost 1/3 of their values , each , until we withdrew our money from EuroPacific in October .
Commissions on his trades are also relatively high compared to other firms - 2 to 3 % .
There were several problems , and I have several complaints against Peter Schiff .
Schiff was WRONG because he believed that when the crash occurred , the foreign markets would do well while the U.S. declined .
That was WRONG , WRONG , WRONG .
I wish we had just kept our money in a stable account , we 'd still have all of it today .
We contacted the brokers at EuroPacific many times ; they did n't advise us to pull our money out or make any changes in our portfolios .
There was no oversight of our portfolio on our behalf , and when we asked for advice , all we got was to ride it out .
( Glad we did n't wait longer than we did to pull our money out . )
Also , when we first brought our money to EuroPacific in July , ethical brokers should have told us to wait to purchase anything at that time , since everything was in a downward trend and the bottom was n't in sight .
But no , they got their commissions as we purchased around 12 or more funds in Asia on their recommendations - recommendations based on Peter Schiff 's hypothesis that everything would be ok except in the U.S. Another way Schiff was wrong is that the US Dollar did not decline as much as other currencies and markets .
Schiff was right about the crash , but he was wrong about what would happen to the USD and global markets in relation to the U.S.
That has been shown without a doubt now , and I do n't see how he can try to refute the facts .
I know of others who are down over 60 % because of Schiff 's mishandling of their money .
I wish we'd never heard of Peter Schiff - we are way behind where we were before we put our money with him , and I have nothing good to say about him .
On the contrary , I think people should be warned to stay away from his firm .

Good work Peter , yes these people that rush out with the mob at the last minute and then complain when they lose there money .
Investment is about the long term .
I know the people with you for more than 2 years are more than happy with their initial returns .
Do n't listen to the flack if you can .

The future of the world - next big boom
Hi , you may laugh about me but while others are betting on asia and europe , I am confident that Canada will be the most prosperous country in 2020 .
Canada has all resources ( water , gas , oil , gold , silver , uranium , etc ... ) is politically stable and has great people that love their lives more than fast money .
All we have to do is sell our commodities at high prices to the chinese .
Americans will be broke by then .
They may knock on our doors to ask for water supplies though since they have wasted all their natural resources on their everlasting thirst for $ $ $ more $ $$ fast $ $$ and talking , talking , talking , marketing , zero commitment to Kyoto and fastfood .
By 2030 the americans will be old and frustrated .
Mothers will have babies to support with hard work as substitute for their vanished retirement plan .
Once this workers class is back , innovation will return , hard work and an honest and sustainable growth .
Peter has gutts - he has helped me understand what is going on .
I am certain we will see banana republic in US as soon as the chinese sell their useless bonds to invest in commodities as hedge against inflation .
It is already starting .

Righteous indignation is an emotion one feels when one becomes angry over perceived mistreatment , insult , or malice .
It is okay to be able to change your plans as the facts change .
In this case Peter , it looks like you have been schooled by Mish .
The right thing to do now is to learn from your mistakes and make some improvements .
That said , as of today I am up 21 % for the year .
I do not listen to either Peter , or Mish .

What part of long term investment does n't the lady above understand ?
I do n't have specific knowledge of Mr. Schiff 's precise advice , but I see the lady above got in after the downturn started and when it worsened , she pulled out barely four months later .
This is not how you do investments .
Anybody would know not to buy into a downturn until the bottom was clearly signaled , and once in , to ride out any short term downturns if the advice is predicated on longer term reversals or continuation of longer term trends , which clearly Schiff 's article says his advice is .
She has only herself to blame for her misfortune , not Mr. Schiff , from what I can see of her own account .
For the gentlemen who asked about Canada , would you think I was smart if I asked if Mars was a good place to invest ?
You do n't invest in places , you invest in markets , companies , industries , and the like .

04 Feb 09 , 10:49 Yeah , well ...
... Now that the economy is collapsing along the lines that I correctly forecast , criticism is being focused on the recent poor performance of my investment strategy ...
The first part of this sentence is a lie , and the second part proves it .
Sure there is a crisis , but it is nothing like the crisis that Mr. Schiff predicted .
That 's why his investment strategy has done so poorly .
Describing Mish as " a very small money manager " is ridiculous .
" Rising superstar " would be more accurate .

ah , mrs.7 - 11 , have you ever heard of nafta ?
that means our corporations will get your resources , and strip mine your country just like the oil - sand pits .
btw , those oil - sand pits are a real enironmentally - friendly operation .
and how are the chicoms going to sell those bonds w/o taking a bath themselves .
so just relize when the us goes down we 're gonna take all you wimps down with us

You just repeated what I stated in my comment - what was wrong with Peter Schiff 's firm .
We gave him our money - we were n't the experts .
We were n't aware of what was going on at the time we gave him our money , but HIS BROKERS WERE .
They should have advised us to keep our money in a stable moneymarket account because the bottom was n't in yet .
This is what I said .
His brokers took advantage of our ignorance and recommended several positions , which we took on their " expert " advice .
How you can say we have only ourselves to blame , when we put ourselves in the hands of Peter Schiff 's " experts " is beyond me .
When we drew our money out , we were going to put it into another firm but were advised to wait before buying .
This is what Peter Schiff 's firm should have done , but did n't .
We did n't know when we gave Schiff our money that his investment picks had been declining since January , BUT HE DID !!
We were just given bad investment advice , plain and simple , which is what you just said - except the fault is on Schiff , who knew better , not us , the trusting customers !

Why not reveal the 12 funds you were first buying , and then jumped out of ?
Then we all can see in a few years who did the right / wrong thing ....

Keanu Reeves is going intergalactic again .
He of the comforting monotone has hitched his wagon to 20th Century Fox 's big - screen adaptation of the acclaimed Japanese anime series Cowboy Bebop , which is set in 2071 , 50 years after a massive lunar explosion decimated Earth 's population and necessitated the colonization of the entire solar system .
Thanks to greater than usual logistical issues , an elite team of Old West - style bounty hunters , or cowboys , is needed to keep the peace .
Per the Hollywood Reporter , Reeves is attached to play Spike Siegel , a reformed criminal turned space cowboy and copilot of the Bebop , who , like a character from the actor 's past , is well - versed in kung fu and other combat skills but is toting around quite a few personal demons .
No word yet on who 's in line to play Spike 's copilot , Jet Black , a onetime Inter - Solar System cop with a mechanical arm , but so far we 're liking the whole Firefly - Battlestar Galactica - Bill & Ted vibe .
Feb. 4 , 2009  --
In 1977 an Illinois court found Michael Evans guilty of unspeakable crimes , including murder , kidnapping , rape , deviant sexual assault and indecent liberties with a child .
He was sentenced to 400 years in prison .
The conviction was based largely on a lone eyewitness identification of Evans as the perpetrator .
But DNA testing subsequently proved that Evans was n't the culprit .
He was released in 2003 after serving 26 years in prison for a crime he did n't commit .
The witness later told investigators she was n't all that certain of her identification , but was reassured when she was told there was a confession .
That 's according to a remarkable organization called the Innocence Project , which has used DNA evidence to help clear 232 people who were erroneously convicted of crimes they never committed .
Are these troubling cases rare ?
They may be only the tip of the iceberg , because DNA evidence that has proved so conclusive in cases pursued by the Innocence Project is rarely available .
And false confessions , it turns out , are n't all that rare , either .
They figure in at least 25 percent of the cases that have been cleared by evidence collected by the project .
Now , new research shows that a confession , even if false , can have an " astonishing " effect on witnesses who were quite sure they had picked the right criminal in a lineup .
The research is part of two experiments conducted at several universities showing that false confessions can contaminate an entire court proceeding , and witnesses who are interrogated immediately after seeing a crime become more -- not less -- susceptible to later misinformation .
The research adds to a growing body of scientific literature revealing that we often do n't see what we think we 've seen , and even credible witnesses are vulnerabile to false testimony and harsh interrogations .
It is particularly timely with the approaching trials of suspected terrorists now housed in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , because there will likely be many confessions in connection with those cases , and some of them will almost certainly be false .
Why Confess If You 're Not Guilty ?
The Innocence Project cites many reasons why people sometimes confess to crimes they have n't committed , like coercion , diminished capacity , fear of violence , harmful or harsh treatment , and we must now add torture to that list .
That 's why any confession from someone who has been grilled behind closed doors should be treated with a great deal of suspicion .
In the first of the new studies , authored by psychologists Lisa E. Hasel of Iowa State University and Saul M. Kassin of John Jay College of Criminal Justice and published in the current issue of Psychological Science , 206 witnesses , divided into groups of two to five persons , revealed just how convincing a confession can be , even if it is untrue .
It should be noted that this was a " make believe " situation involving college students , not a real courtroom drama with lives at stake , but the researchers insist the results are consistent with other studies of actual cases .
As the participants sat in a room , a man came in , picked up a laptop computer , and walked out .
He was seen by the participants for about 30 seconds .
The instructor returned a few minutes later , told the students they had just witnessed a mock crime as part of an inquiry into perception .
Each participant returned two days later and was asked to pick the person from a six - person photographic lineup who had " stolen " the laptop .
Of the 206 participants , 173 fingered the " thief " with varying degrees of certainty .
But the person who had picked up the laptop -- the " real thief " -- was n't even in the lineup .
That 173 people thought they had picked the real culprit is pretty startling , but the researchers called the following result " astonishing . "
When the participants were told that someone had confessed to committing the " crime , " a whopping 61 percent changed their identification , " in each and every case identifying the confessor " as the perpetrator .
The researchers contend that the false confession left the entire process " contaminated , " because it " corrupted the evidence itself , " namely the testimony of witnesses .
Memories Can Be Altered
In the second study , by psychologists Jason Chan of Iowa State University , Ayanna Thomas of Tufts University and John Bulevich of Rhode Island College , participants both young and old produced a counterintuitive finding .
It would seem that sitting down with someone else and recalling an incident immediately after it happened would cement that memory , making it less likely to be altered by subsequent information .
That turned out not to be the case in this study .
In separate experiments 84 undergraduate students and 60 older adults ( average age 72.5 ) revealed a " surprising pattern , " as the researchers put it .
They showed " dramatically heightened susceptibility to misinformation " later if they had been interrogated immediately after the event .
" Our results provide a first look into how immediate recall affects later eyewitness suggestibility , " the researchers conclude .
" Contrary to the expectation that immediate recall would enhance retention of details of a witnessed event and thus reduce an eyewitness 's susceptibility to misinformation , we found that immediate recall actually intensifies the misinformation effect ( for both younger and older adults ) . "
It 's not certain why that should be the case , but the researchers suggest several possibilities .
It may be , for example , that subsequent information -- even if false -- causes the witness to re-examine that first interrogation and tweak the details .
" These results confirm the notion that recall not only indicates what one knows , but also changes what one knows , and sometimes these changes can have far - reaching , and perhaps negative , consequences , " the researchers conclude .
As a high level federal official noted in a press conference a couple of years ago , there are things we know , and things we do n't know , and things we know we do n't know , and things we do n't know we do n't know .
And on too many days , what we do n't know sends the wrong person to prison .
Since the age of 11 , Jill Price , a woman who " ca n't forget , " has kept a written account of her life .
Now MRI scans may explain the rare way in which her brain works .

Daily life for Jill Price " is like a split - screen , " she says .
Though living in the present , " a dozen or more times a day , I 'll be cued back to detailed memories of the past . "

• Watercooler - worthy bits A Southern California man employed in the entertainment business is the fourth person verified by scientists to have an ultra-rare memory gift :
He recalls in detail most days of his life , as well as the day and date of key public events , says Larry Cahill , who co-leads a project on people with super - memory .
The name of the latest " bona fide " wo n't be released by scientists because he 's a research subject , but he is free to identify himself .
Meanwhile , MRI scans on Jill Price , 43 , the Los Angeles religious school administrator who in 2006 was the first person confirmed to have such an ability , reveal two abnormally large areas in her brain .
That discovery could lead to breakthroughs on how memories are formed and kept , says Cahill , a neuroscientist at the University of California - Irvine .
Price went public last year with the publication of her book , The Woman Who Can't Forget .
LOOKING BACK : Decades of details flood woman 's memory
The two magnified areas in Price 's brain are the caudate nuclei — typically used for memory when forming automatic habits — and a part of the temporal lobe that stores facts , dates and events , Cahill told USA TODAY .
These two areas of the brain may be working together , in a way unknown before , to make detailed recall of every day as automatic as remembering to brush your teeth in the morning or put on a seat belt , the research team speculates .
When Price first met the team eight years ago , " it seemed more of a scientific curiosity , " Cahill says .
" Now what we 're looking at is a new chapter in the book on memories and the brain . "
Hundreds of potential subjects have contacted the researchers , offering to be screened , he says .
" Two or three look like the real McCoy " based on phone tests .
In addition to Price and the latest subject , the team also has verified the gift in Brad Williams of La Crosse , Wis. , and Rick Baron of suburban Cleveland .
Unlike Price , the three men are left - handed , and they 're not troubled by their rare ability , Cahill says .
Price feels tormented by her onslaught of memories .
She sees daily life in a kind of " split - screen , " with present - day events , songs , smells , even TV programs cuing her back to detailed memories that she can't squelch .
Gender differences in the brain could account for the differences , Cahill believes .
The larger areas in Price 's brain almost certainly explain her rare gift , which was probably present at birth , says Brian Levine , a memory expert with Rotman Research Institute - Baycrest Centre at the University of Toronto .
Scientists now need to find out how the two large brain areas are connected so they can work together .
" This may be a key piece of the puzzle as to how memory works , and that can be used in future research to help people with memory disorders , " Levine says .

I have a number of friends who are cops , good friends and even family members .
I respect the police mostly .
I respect how hard their job is and that they sacrifice a great deal to serve and protect the public .
But there are always bad apples out there and I was extremely disappointed to read comments in a police officer internet forum today on the Oscar Grant shooting .
Here are some choice posts :
“ Any number of reasons that he may have shot ….. you can see from the video that there is a struggle before the shot is fired ( even before the officer pulls his weapon ) ….. the suspect may have reached underneath him , leading the shooter to believe that he was attempting to retrieve a weapon …..
There isnt enough info to call it a bad shoot ……. not by a long shot ….. btw….saying ‘ liberal media ’ is redundant …….esp. in SF area ……. ” by Forum Member LA DEP who says he ’s an officer for the Los Angeles Sheriff ’s Department .
Forum member Brenden then adds :
“ I do n’t know why people worry themselves with such things .
The people that get shot are the people who put lives at risk .
That cop probably saved the taxpayers over 200K in Courtfee ’s and other convictions anyways .
Maybe he even saved someone from getting killed . ”
jb5722 , who describes himself as a sworn police officer from North Carolina writes : “ I would say that I ’m sure the officer had his reasons for firing his weapon , ” after adding earlier that if a reporter ’s mouth is open they are lying .
Tex4720 , who describes himself as 23 year veteran patrol sergeant from Texas , speculates that : “ the guy may have repeatedly told the officers he was going to shoot them and then reached under his body .
Or a million different things that would prove in the end that this was a righteous shoot . ”
One member , scratched 13 , who describes himself as a police officer from the South goes so far as to suggest that the video of the incident may have been faked .
People wonder why some people hate the police .
They wonder why people do n’t respect the police .
They wonder why protesters around the Bay Area have been protesting with chants of “ F*** the police , ” for the past week .
All I can say is that asinine cops making comments like the ones above in a public forum are as big a part of the problem as anything .
How a cop behaves in online forums and the words they choose can be amplified and magnified .
As much as many of these comments made by cops are offensive , just the overall tone of a forum like this troubles me .
Referring to shootings as “ righteous , ” claiming that taxpayers are saved court fees when someone is killed , even the signatures that many of these cops choose to use as their taglines ( Fear not the night .
Fear that which walks the night .
And * I * am that which walks the night . ) just goes to show me that much of the hatred towards the police is due at least in part to the attitudes that comes from the cops themselves .
You can read more comments in this thread but the overall tone is that the news media and reporters ( especially in the Bay Area ) suck and mostly people trying to somehow defend the actions of Johannes Mehserle , the cop who shot Oscar Grant ( and the cop who was arrested for the murder of Oscar Grant yesterday ) .
Interesting to read what this shooting looks like from a police perspective .
By the way , this same police forum has been discussing my recent stop by the Long Beach Harbor Patrol while shooting last month here .
It ’s unfortunate for me to read comments like this one : “ Point is , if they ask you to move , then move .
Why do people have to be so annoying about minor stuff .
I am sure there are tons of other things you can take pictures of .
If they say it ’s against the law , then say ok and move along . ”
Update :
It seems that forums .
officer.com has now deleted in it ’s entirety the post about my recent run in with the Long Beach Harbor Patrol .
Why does it not surprise me that a site like this one would so easily censor the threads in their forums ?
The Plan
Record the X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor when it is clicked on a web page .
Save those coordinates to a database
When called , display a “ clickmap ” on top of the web page visually displaying the locations of those clicks .
Because it ’s a cool proof of concept .
Should you use this in production and base major design decisions off it ?
Maybe not , but I could see it being used as a tool in examining user behavior in some situations .

The Technologies
The website will be built using PHP .
We need PHP for a couple of reasons .
Most importantly we need a server side language to deal with saving and retrieving from the database .
Also , we ’ll be abstracting that database interaction into a separate file to keep our code clean .
PHP enables us to post variables back and forth between these files .
We ’ll be using JavaScript of the jQuery variety to track the mouse clicks and post that click data to the PHP file doing the database saving .
jQuery will also help us display the overlay and place the little graphics we ’ll use to display the click locations .
Build the Database
Our code wo n’t be automatically creating the tables necessary for you , you ’ll have to create a database and the structure on your own .
Here is the SQL :
CREATE TABLE `clickmap` ( `id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , `x` smallint ( 4 ) unsigned NOT NULL , `y` smallint ( 4 ) unsigned NOT NULL , `location` varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) , KEY `location` ( `location` ) )
We are keeping things as simple as we can for the demo .
If you wanted to extend the idea , you may also want to add extra info to this table like IP address and date / time so you have more detailed info for each click .
The Markup ( page being tracked )
Just some structure for us to work with here .
We ’ll link to a CSS file , load up jQuery , link to a JavaScript file of our own devising as well as set up a place to write JavaScript right here , and put some content in the page .
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content= " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " /> < title > Click Map Demo</ title > < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " style.css " /> < script src="//www.google.com/jsapi " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" js/jquery.js " > < script type =" text / javascript " src="js/clickmap.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { // do stuff } ) ; </ script > </head > < body > < img src=" images/baywatch.jpg " alt = " baywatch " /> < p class=" button displayClicks " >< a href= " #demo " >
Display Click Map</a></p> </ body > </html >
Not much content there , just a picture of the Baywatch crew and a simple button .
The jQuery JavaScript
The JavaScript is going to do two major things for us : saving clicks and displaying clicks .
Saving Clicks
For efficiencies sake , we ’ll abstract into a couple of different functions that we can call anytime .
One to start saving clicks and one to stop saving clicks .
( function ( $ ) { $.fn.saveClicks = function ( ) { $ ( this ) .bind ('mousedown.clickmap ' , function ( evt ) { $ .post ('/ examples/ClickMap/clickmap.php ' , { x:evt.pageX , y:evt.pageY , l:escape(document.location.pathname ) } ) ; } ) ; } ; $.fn.stopSaveClicks = function ( ) { $ ( this ).unbind ('mousedown.clickmap ' ) ; } ; } ) ( jQuery ) ;
We are binding the mousedown event to the element it gets called on ( it will be the whole document ) and then using jQuery ’s post function to send some data ( the coordinates ) to a special file ( clickmap. php ) .
Pretty neat really , the people will never know it , but each of those clicks is sending data back to the server .
Displaying Clicks
Again , two functions .
One is in charge of creating the overlay and displaying the click graphics ( the PHP sends all the data but the jQuery does the appending ) .
The other removes everything .
We make use of the jQuery get function .
$ .displayClicks = function ( settings ) { $ ( '< div id=" clickmap-overlay " ></div >') .appendTo( ' body ' ) ; $ ( '< div id=" clickmap - loading " ></div>').appendTo( ' body ' ) ; $.get ('/ examples/ClickMap/clickmap.php ' , { l:escape ( document.location.pathname ) } , function ( htmlContentFromServer ) { $ ( htmlContentFromServer).appendTo( ' body ' ) ; $ ('#clickmap - loading ' ) .remove( ) ; } ) ; } ; $.removeClicks = function ( ) { $ ( ' #clickmap-overlay ' ) .remove ( ) ; $ ('#clickmap-container ' ) .remove( ) ; } ;
Firing it all off
We ’ll include some JavaScript right on the page to fire everything off .
< script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ ( document ) .saveClicks ( ) ; $ ( '.displayClicks ').click ( function ( ) { $.displayClicks ( ) ; $('#clickmap-overlay ').click ( function ( ) { $.removeClicks ( ) ; $ ( document ) .saveClicks ( ) ; } ) ; $ ( document ) .stopSaveClicks ( ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ; </script >
The PHP
So now we ’ve seen code that boths POSTS and GETS from a PHP file that we have n’t seen yet .
That magic happens in a file we ’ll call clickmap.php .
In either case , we need to connect to the database and then close that connection .
The rest of it is defendant on if we are POSTing or GETting .
<? php $ DB = mysql_connect ( " localhost " , " db_user " , " db_password " ) ; mysql_select_db ( " db_name " , $ DB ) ; if ( isset ( $ _POST [ 'l ' ] ) ) { $ query = sprintf ( " INSERT INTO clickmap SET x = ' %s ' , y = ' %s ' , location = ' %s ' " , $ _POST [ 'x ' ] , $ _POST [ 'y ' ] , $ _POST [ 'l ' ] ) ; $ result = mysql_query ( $ query ) ; } ; if ( isset ( $ _GET [ 'l ' ] ) ) { $ query = sprintf ( " SELECT x , y FROM clickmap WHERE location = ' %s ' ORDER BY id DESC limit 200 " , $ _GET [ 'l ' ] ) ; $ results = mysql_query ( $ query ) ; $ html = ' < div id =" clickmap - container " > ' ; while ( $row = mysql_fetch_array ( $ results ) ) { $ html .= sprintf ( '< div style = " left : %spx;top : %spx " ></div > ' , $ row [ 'x ' ] - 10 , $ row ['y ' ] - 10 ) ; } $ html .= '</div > ' ; echo $ html ; } ; mysql_close ( $ DB ) ; ?>
Fairly straightforward … when POSTing , save the data to the database .
When GETting , retrieve it .
In this demo we only grab the last 200 clicks , but you can alter or remove that restriction as needed .
Here you can see how the each of the click graphics positions itself when the overlay comes up .
The exact coordinate data that was saved when the click was produced is used to set CSS “ top ” and “ left ” values .
The CSS
The actual clickmap stuff does n’t need a heck of a lot in terms of styling .
Just the overlay itself , a loading area ( in case it takes a while to get all the click data ) , and the little graphics for the clicks themselves .
# clickmap - overlay { position : fixed ; top:0 ; left:0 ; width :100 % ; height :100 % ; background - color : #000 ; filter : alpha( opacity=70 ) ; opacity : 0.7 ; } #clickmap - loading { position : fixed ; top:0 ; left:0 ; width :100 % ; height :100 % ; background : transparent url( images/loading.gif ) no -repeat center center ; } #clickmap - container div { position : absolute ; width : 20 px ; height :20 px ; background : transparent url( images / click.png ) no-repeat center center ; }
All Together
I know sometimes reading through all the code samples can be kind of mind bending and confusing .

The world ’s largest private army is getting a makeover .
Blackwater Worldwide is dumping its name in favor of Xe , after its original name became a liability .
Blackwater guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians in 2007 , and the company has become well known through its alleged disdain and abuse employees hand out to the people they are suppose to be protecting .
Blackwater Lodge and Training Center , the subsidiary that conducts much of the company ’s overseas operations and domestic training , has been renamed U.S. Training Center Inc according to the NY Times .
The new name is pronounced Zee ….as in Na-zi .
Ironic or purposely picked ? :-)
Tool use was once thought to distinguish humans from animal — until , that is , so many animals proved able to use them .
Granted , the fine folks at Leatherman are n't about to be undercut by cheap chimpanzee - manufactured multitools .
But it 's hard not to feel a species - level déjà vu when seeing a gorilla using a walking stick or capuchin monkey thoughtfully selecting an ideal nut - cracking stone .
Below is a compilation of some of the most interesting animal tool use yet observed .
Much more likely remains to be found : until Jane Goodall watched chimpanzees fishing for termites with sticks , scientists had been reluctant to credit animals with such sophisticated behavior — perhaps because , as Charles Darwin noted , “ Animals , whom we have made our slaves , we do not like to consider our equal . ”
Darwin himself was quite intrigued by animal tool use , suggesting that it allowed them to overcome biological shortcomings .
In On the Origin of Species , he noted that elephants snap off tree branches to swat away flies ; in honor of Darwin 's interest , elephants are the first on our list of animal tool use .
Elephant canteens .
Cute YouTube videos of elephant painters show their amazing dexterity , but even more impressive is this peculiar habit : after digging a water hole , elephants will strip bark from a tree , chew it into a ball , then use it to fill the hole .
Once the top has been covered with sand , the elephant has an evaporation - resistant canteen .

Mole rat masks .
The naked mole rat 's powerful , protruding teeth are great for burrowing — but digging with their mouths makes it easy to inhale dirt .
To keep their lungs clear , the mole rats have been observed placing wood shavings behind the teeth but in front of their lips — a simple face mask .
( As an aside , the naked mole rat 's better - known cousin has been taught to use a raking device in captivity .
A word to raking rat trainers : keep an eye on them !
New York City is bad enough without tool - using rodents . )

Egyptian vulture hammers .
Some say that seagulls who crack open shellfish by dropping them onto rocks are using tools , but that 's generally dismissed on a technicality :
The seagulls are n't actually manipulating their environment .
No such ambiguity surrounds Egyptian vultures , who use rocks to break open ostrich eggs .

Burrowing owl bait .
In order to attract its favorite beetle prey , burrowing owls collect mammal dung , then spread it around the entrance to their homes .
As with many animal tool behaviors , it 's not clear whether the owls are acting out an instinctive sequence of actions , or consciously deciding to collect the dung .
Either way , though , those dung balls are tools .

“ It ’s hard to get inside their heads because their brains are constructed differently and it ’s very hard to analyze their language , but they do seem very intelligent , ” said Georgetown
University marine biologist Janet Mann to the Times .
Let 's just hope dolphins do n't develop opposable thumbs .

It has always been easy to beat up on Microsoft 's Zune , but when the company announced last week that sales of the media player plummeted 54 percent year - over - year during the holiday shopping season , the entire internet piled on .
The Zune - bashing reached epic proportions , as pundit after pundit called for Microsoft to axe the entire Zune division .
Given its poor sales numbers , we can safely say that most of Zune 's critics have never used the device , and even fewer of them have really spent any serious time with Zune 's online music store .
But we have used it , and , what 's more , we like it .
iTunes Music
Store could learn a thing or two from Zune Marketplace , and if Microsoft does end up dropping Zune then the digital music ecosystem will be worse off for it .
We reviewed the original Zune in 2006 , the Zune Flash in 2007 , and the 3G Zune released last September , and in this review , we 'll take a look at the software side of the Zune experience .
By the end of the review , we hope you 'll agree that there 's more at stake in the survival of Zune than just another Microsoft vs. Apple platform war .
A unique approach
In undergoing its own major changes over the last couple of years , the Zune Marketplace has evolved away from the model exemplified by the market - dominating iTunes Store into a unique approach to both media software design and media consumption .
As Microsoft has improved upon the Zune devices , the Marketplace has gained TV shows , a completely redesigned UI that looks and works nothing like its competition ( or even Microsoft 's other software ) , and new social features that do their part to shed some of the punchline taint from Microsoft's " the social " catchphrase .
Microsoft 's recent addition of a " keep 10 " component to its Zune Pass monthly subscription service ups the ante in the company 's battle to give the iTunes Store some worthwhile competition .
Where most subscription services have dried up , Microsoft managed to innovate in November of last year , allowing customers of its $ 14.99 per month all - you - can - eat option to keep 10 songs every month , regardless of whether their subscription is canceled .
But is the keep 10 deal a game - changer for subscription models and the Zune ?
Little .
Boxy .
Different
One of the worst complaints about the original Zune is that the first version of Microsoft 's software barely wanted to install .
Microsoft has long since solved these issues and the Zune software install is now as painless as they come .
The installer also prepares users for what is to come in the Zune software , as it is branded with the distinct UI that Microsoft uses throughout its software and store .
And distinct it is .
We have asked this question before , but it bears repeating : Microsoft made this ?
From the wide layout that focuses on album art ( beating Apple to the punch by nearly a year ) to the subtle UI animations conservatively sprinkled throughout , the Zune software is neither a copy of iTunes nor a direct descendent of Windows Media Player .
It is something altogether different , and while this review will focus on the Zune Marketplace , some exploration of Zune software fundamentals is warranted .
It was a little jarring to get used to at first , but the Zune software employs a very text - based , seemingly button - less UI set in a square , white creamy window .
Naturally , Microsoft provides a variety of backgrounds for the Zune software window , so I used a variety of them across my screenshots .
At the top of the window is a master navigation bar with words for " collection , " " marketplace , " and " social , " all set in the disarmingly lowercase letters of the pleasant Zegoe font .
The collection is the default area that Zune software presents on first run , and it immediately begins sniffing for existing media under various directories in the user folder , like Music , Pictures , Videos , and Public .
These directories can be customized via settings to include or exclude any directories you like .
This flexibility is a wonderful antithesis to the comparatively dumb file management features ( or lack thereof ) in iTunes .
Underneath this top - level navigation is another row of text - based buttons for music , videos , pictures , podcasts , and channels , again all set in lowercase Zegoe .
A third level of media - specific navigation is set one line lower and justified to the right side of the Zune window .
Since music is the default Zune media area , third - tier buttons to switch between artists , genres , albums , songs , and playlists offer different ways to visualize one 's music .
The default artists view presents a simple A - to - Z list of artists on the left , a reorderable list of album covers in the middle , and a master list of songs on the right .
The genre view mixes things up by listing genres on the right and album covers in the middle get arranged by artist name , while the albums view trims down to two columns to give album covers more of the spotlight .
These third - tier controls also appear in the video section of the Zune collection in order to separate tv shows from music videos , movies , and " other " types of videos , but nowhere else .
Pictures and podcasts get their own respective , static views that work well , and we 'll get to channels in a minute .
Despite this unique UI Microsoft built for its exclusive Zune platform , the Zune software is n't without its drawbacks .
Some are arguably nitpicky , while others glare a little brighter when considering the fact that the Zune software has hit its virtual stride at version 3.x .
For example , the Zune software 's bizarre keyboard shortcuts do n't allow for using the space bar to pause and play content ; you 'll need to use CTRL - P for that .
The UI for managing and syncing playlists also seems very obtuse , as there is no way to display one 's collection and playlists alongside each other for quickly shuffling tracks into the latter .
But again , I want focus on the store , so let 's go shopping .
Like most programmers who ’ve done Rails development , I ’ve become very familiar with the Prototype library for JavaScript .
Even apart from being built into Rails , Prototype was a natural choice for me .
I knew JavaScript pretty well before I started working with Prototype , and was very pleased by how the library filled in some of the weak spots in the language .
Additionally , having already been a Ruby programmer for a few years , Prototype ’s philosophy seemed very natural ; it clearly draws inspiration from Ruby .
Along the way , though , I ’ve been hearing an increasingly strong chorus in favor of jQuery .
I had taken a cursory look at jQuery and was impressed , but did n’t see anything compelling enough to make me switch .
But increasingly the voices favoring jQuery have included people I really respect , including ( over the past few months ) several of my colleagues here at Relevance .
I ’ve now spent serious time working on two different projects with jQuery .
I ’ve worked alongside some experienced jQuery users , and really increased my knowledge and level of comfort with jQuery .
The work has included a reasonable variety of JavaScript tasks , from simple to complex , so I ’ve had a chance to enjoy jQuery ’s sweet spot and also to see how it stretches .
And here ’s the capsule summary : jQuery is a very nice piece of work , and makes some common tasks easier than their Prototype equivalents .
Where it ’s good , it ’s very good indeed .
But its design is uneven , and its scope is limited .
For me , at least , Prototype is still the tool of choice .
I think it ’s a richer , more thorough , and overall better designed library .
I do n’t intend this to be an anti-jQuery screed ( although I will rant a little about a couple of things that seem particularly poorly designed ) .
Neither is it an exhaustive comparison of Prototype and jQuery .
Simply put : praise has been lopsided in favor of jQuery of late , and I feel like singing the praises of my personal favorite .
Note : in this post I ’ll be showing code examples using both Prototype and jQuery .
To keep things straight , I ’ll color - code the listings .
Prototype samples will have a green background :
// This is Prototype ! $ ( ' form ' ) . hide ( ) ;
Samples using jQuery will have a yellow background :
// This is jQuery !
$ ( ' # form ' ) . hide ( ) ;
The occasional sample that shows the “ Plain ol ' JavaScript ” way to do things will have a grey background :
// This is ordinary JavaScript !
document .
getElementById ( ' form ' ) . style .
display = ' none ' ;
Where jQuery Comes Out on Top
j Query clearly has a core focus and philosophy that unifies its design .
The idea seems to be that , since most of what you want to do with JavaScript is to find HTML elements and manipulate them , the design should be optimized in favor of that common use case .
And jQuery certainly excels in that case .
The jQuery documentation emphasizes the ability of many jQuery methods to be “ chained ” ( because they return the jQuery object ) .
I 'm personally more impressed with the implicit iteration : when jQuery is used to find a set of elements , modifications are automatically made to all of those elements .
I would describe the “ three pillars ” of jQuery this way :
searching for elements using CSS selectors
operations implicitly applied to all found elements
ability to chain operations
Each of those are powerful features , but more importantly , they work beautifully together .
They allow jQuery programmers to express complex manipulations of the DOM in very concise ways , without losing clarity .
This section is n't very long , so someone skimming this post might get the idea that I do n't think jQuery has a lot going for it .
But I really admire this aspect of jQuery .
The coding style that arises from these features shapes the way you do everything in jQuery .
Furthermore , the fact that three such simple ideas can have such enormous positive effects on code written using the library speaks volumes for the power of good design .
It 's just a shame that the rest of jQuery is not as well designed .
In some ways , it 's harder to make the case for Prototype , because that case depends on numerous small details , some of which are strengths of Prototype , and some of which are weaknesses of jQuery .
However , I have to say that , while jQuery wins in this area , it does n't win by as much as some would have you believe .
Most of the comparisons I 've found on the web are rather ridiculous , because they compare jQuery against very poor examples of Prototype usage .
Take this example :
// Good jQuery $ ( ' blah blah ' ) . addClass ( ' foo ' ) ;
compared with
// Prototype ( explicit iteration ) $ $ ( ' blah blah ' ) . each ( function ( element ) { element .
addClassName ( ' foo ' ) ; } ) ;
There ’s a much better way to do that in Prototype :
// Prototype ( implicit iteration ) $ $ ( ' blah blah ' ) . invoke ( ' addClassName ' , ' foo ' ) ;
The invoke method in Prototype will apply a named method to each element of a collection .
Prototype 's DOM methods are also chainable , even when using invoke .
Where It ’s a Wash
Critics of Prototype have tended to focus on three issues : code size , performance , and namespace pollution .
These days , Prototype and jQuery have about the same code size .
Prototype is a little larger , especially since it does n’t ship with a minimized version .
But if you care about code size , that ’s easily remedied .
It ’s not hard to run a JS minimizer .
It ’s also worth pointing out that the very small code size gap is not gratuitous ; Prototype has more functionality .
( In looking at this issue , I ’ve compared core Prototype against core jQuery , and also Prototype + Scriptaculous against jQuery+jQuery.ui. )
Although Prototype ’s performance has not always been good , it has improved a great deal , in many cases by learning lessons from how jQuery has done things ( and in some cases , the patches were even submitted by the jQuery developers ) .
Today , Prototype ’s performance is close to that of jQuery , and the very poor performance Prototype used to have for some situations ( and in some browsers ) has been eliminated .
The other issue is namespace pollution .
Prototype adds several top - level names to the JavaScript global namespace , and adds numerous new methods to built - in JavaScript classes .
There is a potential for namespace collision , either with other JavaScript libraries or with new JavaScript features .
( And it ’s more than just potential ; real collisions of both kinds have occurred . )
jQuery , on the other hand , takes care to limit its use of existing JavaScript namespaces , and can be configured to use only one global name ( jQuery ) .
I fully understand the dangers of Prototype ’s approach , but after living with both it and jQuery for some time , I ’ve come to appreciate that it also has important benefits .
JavaScript is a language that is extremely dynamic and open , and also deeply flawed .
Prototype ’s developers have chosen to take advantage of that openness to try to fix ( or at least smooth over ) many of JavaScript ’s biggest weaknesses .
The fact that Prototype ’s facilities feel well integrated into the language is a huge win for me , and it seems to be worth the cost .
I do n’t expect this argument to convince anyone ; this is the kind of thing that boils down to taste and priorities .
But for me , Prototype ’s and jQuery ’s approaches to namespace management have complementary costs and benefits , and I do n’t think this is a good reason to choose one library over the other .
Where Prototype Wins
Now I ’ll describe where I think Prototype has the advantage , touching on three different areas : a more polished API , some issues with the way jQuery uses this , and a broader , more versatile array of programming facilities .
API Polish
I ’ve already mentioned how beautifully designed jQuery ’s core is .
The problem is that the parts of jQuery outside that core are often poorly designed , in ways that really frustrate me .
I ’ll describe four .
When using the each method for iteration , the arguments to the iteration function are in the wrong order .
( I know , I know … if you program the “ jQuery way ” you wo n’t actually use those arguments .
I ’ll address that later . )
Here ’s an example :
// jQuery ( non-idiomatic ) $ . each ( collection , function ( index , item ) { item .
whatever ( ) ; } ) ;
When iterating over a collection , you nearly always want to work with the element of the collection , and you rarely need to actually refer to the index .
The arguments should be the other way around , so that you could omit the index argument in the vast majority of cases where you do n’t need it .
Here ’s the equivalent in Prototype :
// Prototype collection .
each ( function ( item ) { item .
whatever ( ) ; } ) ;
Prototype ’s each does pass an index argument to the iteration function , but it ’s the second argument , so it can be omitted if not used — which is nearly always .
But jQuery can’t even be consistent about this .
Here ’s how jQuery ’s map works :
// jQuery var result = $ . map ( collection , function ( item ) { item .
whatever ( ) ; } ) ;
The argument order for map is item , index — just what you want , but it ’s sad that it ’s inconsistent with each .
And jQuery ’s map is broken in other ways as well … the traditional definition is that the result array has the same number of elements as the original , but with jQuery ’s version that ’s not true .
( What I refer to as “ the traditional definition ” of map is the one used by Common Lisp , Scheme , Haskell , OCaml , Erlang , Ruby , Python , Perl , Scala , and more . )
I wo n’t dwell on the details of how jQuery ’s map is broken , but one consequence is that it ’s impossible to use it to produce an array of arrays , because any arrays returned from the mapping function will be flattened into the result array .
j Query has a unique method .
It returns all the unique elements from an array ; that is , it eliminates the duplicates .
Very handy .
But for some reason , it only works on arrays of DOM elements .
It silently fails ( by returning a copy of the original array ) if you pass it an array of anything else .
This is a known problem , but the bug was “ fixed ” by just updating the documentation to make the behavior clearer .
How difficult would it have been to make it work correctly ?
( Answer : not very , because the bug report came with a patch and tests . )
Prototype ’s uniq method works in both cases .
Finally : jQuery also has an inArray method .
You can call it like this :
// jQuery $ . inArray ( value , array )
But what does it return ?
Well , “ in array ” is a question that has a yes or no answer , so I ’m guessing a boolean .
Let ’s see what the docs say :
Determine the index of the first parameter in the Array …
Ah , it returns the index .
But that ’s OK … JavaScript supports the notion of “ truthiness ” , meaning that objects other than true and false can be used where a boolean is expected .
Truthiness is useful , because it means boolean results can actually be useful outside of strictly boolean contexts , and returning the actual index in this case is a great example of that .
So as long as inArray returns false , null , or undefined if the value is not in the array , we ’re in good shape .
But I left out part of that documentation above .
The rest of it is :
… ( - 1 if not found ) .
Gack !
How useless is that ?
The name of the method implies that it ’s a boolean query , but the result value is not useful in a boolean context .
And if you just try using it that way , making an assumption based on the name , you ’ll have fun debugging it , because there wo n’t be an error ; it ’ll just always be true .
For fifty years , programming languages have been using two common names for the job that inArray does : index and position .
Having a method called inArray that works like this is just sloppy library design .
Leave this Alone !
When complaining about iterator arguments to jQuery ’s each , above , I mentioned that the “ jQuery way ” is not to use the arguments to the iterator function at all .
That ’s because when jQuery ’s each calls your iterator function , it does so in such a way that the variable this is bound to the current item .
So the idiomatic way of using each in jQuery is :
// jQuery $ . each ( collection , function ( ) { this .
whatever ( ) ; } ) ;
That ’s the kind of decision that makes really simple cases very easy , but only at the expense of a lot of confusion when things are a bit more complicated .
That ’s because this is already an important variable in JavaScript , and the callback often needs to refer to the value of this from the scope in which it was defined .
Functions in JavaScript are closures , and programmers often need to exploit the ability to refer to variables in the surrounding scope .
Here ’s an example .
I have an object ( called chart ) , and in a method on that object I need to iterate over an array ( stored in the property columns ) , generating a header for each item using buildHeader , which is another method on chart .
Within methods of chart , of course , chart is referred to as this .
The basic JavaScript way of doing that is :
// Ordinary JavaScript , in a method body .
for ( var i = 0 ; i & lt ; this .
columns .
length ; i ++ ) { this .
buildHeader ( this .
columns [ i ] ) ; }
But that manual iteration sure feels clumsy ; it would be nice to be able to do that with each .
Let ’s do that with jQuery :
// jQuery ( incorrect example ) $ . each ( this .
columns , function ( i , item ) { this .
buildHeader ( item ) ; } ) ;
But that does n’t work ; this within the iterator function has been rebound to the current item .
The this variable from the surrounding scope has been shadowed by a different this that refers to the current iteration item .
But unlike i and item , this has been shadowed implicitly , by jQuery ’s implementation of each .
The preferred jQuery way to write the example is to provide an alias for this that does n’t get shadowed by each :
// jQuery ( correct example ) var me = this ; // provide alias for this $ . each ( this .
columns , function ( ) { me .
buildHeader ( this ) ; } ) ;
But notice that this in the iteration function is a different this than in the immediately preceding line , even though conventional JavaScript closure semantics would lead you to believe they were the same .
When building a complicated class , jQuery ’s ( ab) use of this can make things very confusing .
Here ’s how to do the same thing in Prototype :
// Prototype $ A ( this .
columns ) . each ( function ( item ) { this .
buildHeader ( item ) ; } , this ) ;
Messing with this implicitly is a terrible design decision .
It breaks the conventional semantics of JavaScript , rendering the resulting code unclear , and presenting barriers when you need to exploit the usual semantics .
I understand the desire to have an implicit iteration variable ; good names might be it or item .
Unfortunately , JavaScript does n’t provide a mechanism for jQuery to set those variables from outside the function ; it can only manipulate this .
But that ’s not enough justification for the design choice jQuery makes .
If jQuery ’s each were properly designed , one could write the basic iteration idiom this way :
// jQuery ( with hypothetical fixed ' each ' method ) $ . each ( collection , function ( it ) { it .
whatever ( ) ; } ) ;
Would that be so bad ?
No ; in fact , it would be a huge improvement .
This style is just as easy in the simple case , and far less troublesome in more complex cases .
Broader Scope
I mentioned earlier that jQuery has a core of functionality built around querying and manipulating DOM elements .
It also has mature support for Ajax operations .
Beyond that , though , jQuery does n’t aim for very extensive facilities .
( Of course there are numerous plugins and add - ons that do all kinds of things , as there are for Prototype . )
Prototype , even in the core library , has broader goals .
It also has good facilities for DOM searching and manipulation , and for Ajax operations .
To a greater degree than jQuery , though , Prototype attempts to raise the level of JavaScript programming across the board .
To me , the result is a big win for Prototype .
For example : Prototype includes a nice , simple class - based inheritance facility for JavaScript .
That might seem a bit heretical for a prototype - oriented language like JavaScript ( and especially for a library called Prototype ) .
But the strength of the prototype - oriented style of OO is that it gives you freedom to move beyond the class - based mechanisms .
That does n’t mean that classes are useless ; actually , they ’re the most appropriate way of organizing your code a lot of the time .
Prototype also adds useful new basic types ( such as ObjectRange , Template , and a true Hash ) and adds a wealth of supplementary methods to most of the built - in JavaScript types , greatly increasing the ease of basic programming in the language .
For advanced JavaScript programming , Prototype ’s new Function methods are worth the price of admission all by themselves .
j Query makes working with the DOM very easy , but is sparing in its assistance related to other JavaScript objects .
Prototype , on the other hand , helps across the board .
So while jQuery might be easier to get started with , Prototype grows with you better .
Most web developers get started with JavaScript by doing relatively simple DOM manipulation , and jQuery really excels there .
But as you get more comfortable and begin trying to do more , you may find that jQuery does n’t help you as much .
Prototype makes JavaScript programming lots of fun even in circumstances where jQuery feels constraining .
Conclusion
I do n’t think this makes a slam - dunk case for Prototype over jQuery .
And certainly jQuery could improve ; its design is not fundamentally limited .
( For that matter , many of what I consider the missing pieces in jQuery are available as plugins . )
It ’s unfortunate that some of jQuery ’s API flaws ca n’t be fixed without breaking compatibility , but in a future version even that may be an option .
At a minimum , though , Prototype can hold its own .
For me and many others , it ’s still the JavaScript library of choice .

WASHINGTON , Feb 15 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama will soon issue an executive order lifting an eight - year ban embryonic stem cell research imposed by his predecessor , President George W. Bush , a senior adviser said on Sunday .
“ We ’re going to be doing something on that soon , I think .
The president is considering that right now , ” Obama adviser David Axelrod said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
In 2001 , Bush limited federal funding for stem cell research only to human embryonic stem cell lines that already existed .
It was a gesture to his conservative Christian supporters who regard embryonic stem cell research as destroying potential life , because the cells must be extracted from human embryos .
Embryonic stem cells are the most basic human cells which can develop into any type of cell in the body .
Scientists believe the research could eventually produce cures for a variety of diseases , including Parkinson ’s disease , diabetes , heart disease and spinal cord injuries .
Obama vowed to reverse Bush ’s ban during his presidential campaign and in his inaugural address last month promised to return science to its proper place in the United States .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month cleared the way for the first trial to see if human embryonic stem cells could treat people safely .
The trial will try to use stem cells from already existing lines to regrow nerve tissue in patients with crushed spinal cords .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , giving rise to all the tissues , organs and blood .
Embryonic stem cells are considered the most powerful kinds of stem cells , as they have the potential to give rise to any type of tissue .

Over the past few days Tel Aviv residents have been collecting food and clothing items , as well as toys and hygiene products for the benefit of Gaza 's residents , many of whom have been left without the most basic supplies following Israel 's three - week military offensive in the coastal enclave .
" Our goal is to help the residents of Gaza who are living under unbearable conditions , " said Daphna Levy , one of the drive 's organizers .
" The situation we have left them in does not seem reasonable to us .
" The issue is purely humanitarian , not political , " she added , " our volunteers come from a wide range of political affiliations . "
The imminent transfer of the supplies to Gaza was made possible following negotiations between the " Ner Leshalom ( Candle for Peace ) " association and IDF officials .
Ido , a volunteer , said " we have all seen on TV what the price of war is ; we know what it 's like to be bombed . "
According to him , some Israelis feel as though it is their duty to " compensate " the Palestinians in Gaza : " It 's very simple – there 's a war , there are victims and people are volunteering to help . "
Last week I wrote about the challenges that Milton Friedman predicted would lead to an eventual break up of the Euro Zone .
Friedman based his comments on his belief that when push comes to shove , regional interests will force local politicians to abandon the principles of the European Union in order to save their political skins at home .
Recently , France released 6.5 billion euros ( $ 8.5 billion USD ) to provide emergency assistance for French auto manufacturers .
In return , the automakers promised to keep plants open in France – and while not stated in so many words – the implication was that if job cuts were necessary , they would be made at plants in other countries before reducing positions in France .
The Czech Republic – home to a massive Peugeot / Citroen plant that opened in 2005 – naturally cried foul .
Despite this , French President Nicolas Sarkozy went one step further suggesting that French automakers should even close plants in the Czech Republic to ensure that plants in France can avoid any layoffs whatsoever .
In response , Czech Prime Minister Mirel Topolanek has called for a meeting to discuss how EU countries can Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ coordinateÃ¢â‚
¬
Â  their response to the economic crisis and the European Commission has asked France to clarify its position on its auto sector funding .
Ultimately , any pressure Sarkozy receives from the EU will be nothing compared to the pressure he is feeling at home .
And with three years left in his mandate , Sarkozy has a lot of work to do if he expects to win a second election .
After several years of declining unemployment in France , the trend has reversed and unemployment is now at 7.7 percent and will most assuredly continue to climb .
Economic growth is flat and consumer spending is on the decline – demonstrations and anti-government rallies are growing .
This really serves to underscore the problem facing any government in the current economic climate .
How can you be seen as being protective of your countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s economy without being labelled a protectionist ?
How can you use taxpayer dollars to support an industry in an attempt to save thousands of jobs and still be responsible by ensuring the money is used to help companies within your jurisdiction ?
John Taylor Gatto has this list of the fourteen differences between your average public school and the elite private schools .
One of the differences he lists is that at public school , sports are option , whereas at elite private schools they are mandatory .
Gatto claims the reason for this is that playing sports is the fastest way to achieve grace .
" Energetic physical sports are n't a luxury or a way to blow off steam , but they 're absolutely the only way to confer grace on the human presence .
And that grace translates into power and money later on . "
Gatto is actually talking here about physical grace -- the idea that physical activities confer a commanding presence on those who can do those things well .
Certainly true , but I 'd take it a step further .
That is , I 'd argue that sports are the fastest way to achieve spiritual grace as well .
Now , since we 're talking elite private schools , we 're essentially talking about rowing .
The average rowing team is thirty kids , eight of whom will make the first 8 +.
Every day of high school was a constant struggle trying to figure out how I could become faster than the other guys on my team .
After all , I wanted to be in the first boat .
The problem is that even if you 're in the first boat , it does n't mean your boat is any good .
The only way to win in competition is to help make the other guys as fast as possible .
Which of course makes it vastly more likely that you yourself will lose your seat in the boat .
That , I think , is where the spiritual grace comes in .
It 's one thing to help others when you have nothing to gain .
It 's a whole other thing to help others when it actively hurts you .
Learning to do this without feeling conflicted , in fact without even thinking about it ...
If that 's not a working definition , I do n't know what is .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Congress will soon debate what kind of economic stimulus package should be passed , but some economists are increasingly wondering whether it's a good idea to approve any stimulus at all .
President - elect Obama again called for quick action Thursday on a yet - unspecified economic stimulus plan that could cost as much $ 800 billion .
Yet , some argue that the economy is already poised to rebound on its own .
They point to steep rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and trillions of dollars in loans and assistance approved by the government in the past year as enough stimulus to get the economy back on track .
In addition , some stimulus skeptics believe that increased government spending will cause more problems than they solve .
Brian Wesbury , chief economist at First Trust Portfolios , said the current economic downturn is due to the financial panic that occurred in September after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
That caused a crisis in financial markets and led to the controversial bailout of Wall Street firms and banks and many new programs by the Fed .
Wesbury said consumers and businesses were more reluctant to spend after the collapse of Lehman led to concerns about how other banks would be in danger if a bailout was not passed .
He said he now fears that similar talk about how bad the economy could get if there is n't a stimulus package could cause further declines in spending .
" In the middle of trying to sell a humongous new stimulus package , we 'll be creating new panic , " he said .
Wesbury acknowledges his view is a minority one , but he 's hardly alone .
He and Bob Brusca of FAO Economics said they both see signs that the economy might be ready to turn around already , including an unusually large drop in initial jobless claims this week , and a slight increase in the Conference Board 's December reading on business activity in the service sector .
Lower taxes now = more taxes later
Other economists expressed concerns about the longer - term damage that could be done to the economy by spending so heavily to fix short - term problems .
Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , an investment firm specializing in overseas investments , wrote in a research note the stimulus debate has not done enough to focus on the cost to taxpayers that will come from the programs .
" The truth is that the only way out of this mess is less government , more savings , and increased production , " Schiff wrote .
" Obama 's plan is a recipe for economic ruin . "
Wesbury said he is pleased by various tax cut proposals being discussed as part of the plan , but he is worried that taxpayers will still have to eventually foot the bill for all the new government spending .
He said the only way to pay for stimulus is by taxing those who are productive , joking that the plan is more like a Ponzi scheme than any creation of wealth .
" Every time we bail somebody out , we have to get that money from somebody else .
It 's like [ Bernard ] Madoff , " he quipped , referring to the financier accused in a $ 50 billion securities fraud case .
Other economists added that many of the steps taken so far have not yet had a chance to work .
Those efforts may prove to be sufficient enough to stimulate the economy without additional spending .
Ca n't afford to ' wait and see '
But since there is so much uncertainty about the economy , some think the government can't afford to wait to see what happens next , especially since this recession is much different in nature than previous ones .
" We have an unprecedented financial crisis being met by an unprecedented policy response , " said David Kelly , the chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds .
" The problem is , forecasters work off precedent . "
Kelly said he 's particularly worried that the economic stimulus plans being discussed , such as construction projects , will take too long to make an impact .
Even sending out tax rebate checks , as was done last year , wo n't necessarily spur spending if people are nervous about the economy .
Kelly said he would prefer cash incentives from the government specifically designed for people to go out and buy a car or a house as a way to jump - start those two battered sectors .
He said the incentive program could be set up so that the amount of money available could drop the longer people take to make the purchase .
That way , people willing to spend sooner rather than later would be rewarded and the economy could rebound more quickly .
" The big problem here is we 've got a wait - and - see economy , " said Kelly .
" ' Wait and see ' are the three most dangerous words in economics . "
Brusca agreed that there are major risks of the economy continuing to weaken further .
He said that even though " there 's a case for not doing anything more , " Congress can't afford to wait to act .
" It is gambling on something you can't afford to lose , " he said .
" You run the risk , if you are being patient , of becoming the patient . "
Finally , there are some who believe that the actions taken so far by Congress and the Bush administration , like the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , for banks and Wall Street firms , have done little to help consumers and businesses so far .
" You need something to start the engine , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
" Just having a full tank of gas does n't get you anywhere .
TARP is just a full tank of gas . "
Sustainable farming across the world relies on cultivating a diversity of crops and livestock to maximise internal input , and this is in marked contrast to the high external input monoculture of industrial farming , which is proving unsustainable in many respects .
Indirect support for the sustainability of agricultural diversity is coming from an unexpected quarter .
Academic ecologists are discovering that biodiverse systems are more productive .
by Dr. Mae -Wan Ho : Geneticist , Biophysicist and Director of the not - for - profit Institute of Science in Society .
For over three decades , academic ecologists have debated whether complex , species - rich ecosystems are more stable than ones with fewer species .
Unfortunately , there are many definitions of complexity , and even more of stability ; and so the debate continues .
The question most relevant to agriculture , and also most easily answered , is whether biodiverse systems are more productive .
There is growing evidence that biodiverse systems are indeed more productive , although ecologists still disagree as to how that could be explained , and on the number of species needed to sustain an ecosystem , which has large implications also for conservation .
One hypothesis is that there is “ niche complementarity ” among particular combinations of species , in other words , they have mutually complementary relationships so the more species there are , the greater the chance occurrence of such complementarity .
This would be due to both differences in resource requirements over space and time , and positive , symbiotic interactions between the species .
Alternatively , the greater productivity associated with diversity may be due to short - lived or transient effects , caused solely by the presence of some species with high growth rate .
Or the effects could simply be experimental artefacts .
The species compared may happen to include some with very low - viability , or else with very high , competitive growth rates .
These ‘ sampling effects ’ result from the greater chance of such species being present at higher diversity , and from dynamics that cause a single species to dominate and determine how the ecosystem evolves .
Fortunately , David Tilman and his colleagues in the University of Minnesota , St. Paul , and University of Nebraska , Lincoln , can now address these questions from the results of an experiment they started in May , 1994 and continued to this day [ 1 ] .
Plots measuring 9 m by 9 m were seeded with a different number of species .
The number of replicate plots with 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 species were 39 , 35 , 29 , 30 and 35 respectively .
The species composition of each plot was chosen at random from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four C4 ( warm - season ) grasses , four C3 ( cool - season ) grasses , four legumes , four non-legume forbs ( broad - leaf flowering herbs ) , and two woody species .
All species occurred in monoculture , and all but three were in at least two monoculture plots , allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to higher - diversity combinations of these same species .
The aboveground living biomass , because it is all produced within a growing season , is an index of primary productivity .
In contrast , total biomass ( both above and below ground ) measures carbon accumulated in living tissues , ie , carbon sequestered from the atmosphere , and hence relevant to reducing CO2 and global warming , although the authors did not mention it as such .
Both aboveground and total biomass were found to increase highly significantly with species number in every year .
The ‘ functional group composition ’ , ie , whether grasses , legumes , forbs or woody species , also had significant influence , especially in the early years .
But species number had highly significant positive effects on both above ground and total biomass by 1999 and 2000 .
In the early years , there was an increase in aboveground and total biomass with species number that reached a plateau between 4 and 8 species .
But , by 2000 , there was a sharp jump between 1 and 2 species , and thereafter , a less steep but nonetheless linear increase with species number up to the maximum , 16 .
In 2000 , the 16 - species plots had 22 % greater aboveground biomass and 27 greater total biomass than 8 - species plots .
The dependence of biomass on species number and functional group composition became progressively stronger , accounting for one - third of the variation ( variance ) in 1997 and two - thirds in 2000 .
The strengthening of the effect of diversity and the increasingly steep and linear trends in successive years do not support the hypothesis that effects of diversity are short - lived transients .
Comparable and significant dependence of total and aboveground biomass on diversity and functional group composition were observed whether one looks at the actual number of planted species in each plot , or the ‘ Shannon diversity index ’ , a measure which includes the relative abundance of the species present .
To test the sampling hypothesis that low - viability species were included in the pool , five species that had the least total biomass in monoculture in 2000 were identified , and all plots containing them were excluded from the analysis .
Total biomass was still significantly dependent on species number and functional group composition in the remaining 131 plots .
Similar results were obtained when plots containing any combinations of the five species with least aboveground biomass in monoculture were excluded .
Significant results were also obtained when 30 plots with the lowest total biomass or 31 plots with the lowest aboveground biomass were excluded .
Thus the increase in productivity with diversity cannot be due just to sampling effects from low - viability species being included in the pool .
What about the hypothesis that the most competitive species determined the effects of diversity ?
This was examined by retaining in the analyses of year 2000 only plots containing at least one of the nine species with the highest monoculture total biomass in 2000 .
Total biomass remained significantly dependent on species number and functional group composition in these 145 plots , and in the subset of 95 plots that contained at least 2 of the nine species .
Similar results were obtained for aboveground biomass in 2000 .
In 1999 and 2000 , many high - diversity plots had greater aboveground and total biomass than the best - performing monoculture .
The percentage of such plots increased with species number , and about half of the 16 - species plots had greater aboveground or total biomass than the best monocultures .
Thus , sampling effects from competitive species cannot fully explain the increase in productivity with diversity .
The strong contributions to productivity are species number and complementary relations between the plants .
Did complementarity occur among most species ?
In other words , did most species contribute to increasing community biomass or is there a smaller set of species with complementary interactions , with this set being increasingly likely to co-occur at higher diversity ?
Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) – a routine , accepted statistical technique – was used to determine the simultaneous effects of the presence or absence of each species on aboveground or total biomass .
Three or four species had significant positive effects in most years .
Among legumes , Lupinus perennis had significant effects in all nine tests , Lespedeza capitat in six test , and Petalostemum in two tests .
Schizachyrium scoparium and Sorghastrum mutans , both C4 grasses were significant in five tests each .
These are five of the six most abundant species in mixtures .
A rarer forb also had a significant effect .
Similarly , when plots were characterized by the presence or absence of functional groups in ANOVAs , in 2000 , there were significant positive effects of legumes , forbs and C4 grasses on aboveground biomass , and significant positive effects of legumes and C4 grasses on total biomass .
For above ground biomass , the legume x C4 grass interaction was significantly positive ( meaning plots that had both of them did better than those with only one ) , also marginally significantly positive for total biomass .
However , even after controlling for the presence or absence of all functional groups , there were positive effects of species number on both aboveground and total biomass in 2000 , indicating that biomass also depended on species number rather than on just functional groups .
In summary , diversity effects on productivity were neither transients nor explained in the long - term solely by sampling effects or by presence of legumes on a low - N soil .
Rather discernible complementary relationships among specific species and functional groups contributed significantly as well as species number .
Compared with the average of the single best species in monoculture , the 16 species plots had 39 % greater aboveground biomass and 42 % greater total biomass on average for 1999 and 2000 .
Moreover , 16 - species plots in 1999 and 2000 had 2.7 to 2.9 times greater aboveground and total biomass than the average for all species in monoculture .
The positive effects of diversity on productivity strengthen through time .
This is the most comprehensive evidence that biodiverse ecosystems are more productive .
As the observed productivity showed no sign of levelling at the highest species number , we do not yet know whether even higher productivity may be reached with further increase in species diversity .
And , by the way , I thought to ask Prof .
Tilman whether the plots were organically maintained .
He answered ,
“ They are recently , but were not at the start .
We have never used fertilizer of any kind , but did use selective herbicides in some plots the first few years to allow faster and better establishment of the prairie plant species , especially in monocultures .
Our high diversity plots are fairly immune to the invasion and growth of weedy species , but the monocultures and low diversity plots are difficult to maintain in that state . ”
So , there you have it , biodiverse systems also are less prone to weeds .

CHANDIGARH :
There can be few people who have braved the kind of tragedy Karambir Singh Kang has .
In the recent Mumbai attacks , the Taj general manager went on to help others out of certain death even as his wife and children could n't come away alive from their suite in the hotel .
Here in his farmhouse at Kandala , Mohali , with the ashes of his wife and two children , Kang , still traumatized and looking frail , spoke to TOI on Wednesday and said , between sobs , where he got the strength to do what he did .
It was , he said , his mother 's words of courage that prodded him to fight back after watching his world blow into smithereens in front of his eyes .
" I got a call from Karambir and his voice was shaking , '' his mother Kanwaljeet Kaur said , tears rolling down .
" He told me that terrorists have entered the hotel and his family is stuck on the 6th floor and that he can't save them .
I just said , �� �You are a brave boy , go save the others��� . ''
The equally brave mother , who doted on her grandchildren , added , " Our family is in great shock and there are no words that can express the pain we are going through .
The incident has broken us and we just need blessings .
We just want everyone to pray for our family .
Nobody should ever face the phase we are going through . ''
A grieving Kang said it will take a " long , long time ' ' for the bereaved family to come to terms with the personal tragedy .
" I am here with the family , my mother and father , to overcome this grief , '' he said , his voice choking .
Crying at the very mention of his wife and children , Kang said he will muster the courage to go back to Mumbai and his job with the help of those around him now .
" Their memory will remain with me all my life .
But after what happened , I want some peace of mind , '' he said .
Asked what now , he simply replied , " Blaming someone wo n't help make up for the irreparable loss that the family has suffered .
Much has already been said and written about terrorism and the ( Mumbai ) incident and now all that we want is everybody 's support and prayers . ''
Google has added claims to its Google Checkout Merchant homepage that having Google Checkout as part of your AdWords ads will lead to higher conversions and a better click through rate .
Google specifically writes that conversions will increase by 40 % and the click - through - rate on your ads will increase by 10 % .
Here is a screen capture from the page :
I spotted this via Google Blogoscoped , which has also documented the various Google checkout badges Google has used throughout the years .
As you can see , having the Google Checkout badge makes the ad stand out from the other ads .
So I am not surprised by the 10 % claim .
The 40 % claim does seem a bit high , but who knows how they came to those numbers .
Google first changed to a larger badge set about two years ago and then added a more colorful option in August .
Postscript : Google has sent Google Blogoscoped a statement on these claims .
Let me share it with you because it makes a big difference :
Google is n’t actually saying that there is 10 % gain in CTR .
It ’s saying there is a 10 % gain in CTR for “ Google Checkout users ” .

I thought this was going to be a disappointing week for DVDs , but then I dug a little deeper and found much more than I was expecting .
I have to start off with Girls Gone Wild : Horny Schoolgirls – All Girl Sleep Over and Girls Gone Wild : Horny Schoolgirls – Orgy Party .
Everyone knows about Girls gone Wild , it ’s that video your roommate in college kept in his bedroom for months on end , OK , so I should n’t have brought that up .
According to the Amazon Description of “ All Girl Sleepover ” :
“ There ’s nothing hotter than being invited to an all - girl sleepover .
Especially with a bunch of hot young bad girls .
It ’s Samantha ’s 18th birthday and we got her what she really wanted a Rabbit sex toy .
Our present is getting to watch her break it in . ”
And then there ’s the “ Orgy Party ” Description :
“ Go behind the scenes of the hottest college parties you can imagine .
Watch hot , barely legal coeds get naked and crazy in dorm rooms , clubs and the GGW bus .
Texas is full of hot young bad girls and Ashley is no exception .
She strips out of her fishnet top and tiny miniskirt to show off her unbelievably tight , tan body . ”
They go on from there , of course .
You know want them .
Next up there ’s Death Race .
Death Race is a remake of the Roger Cormac classic Death Race 2000 .
According to Amazon :
“ Mayhem rules in Death Race , a head - over - heels remake of the Roger Corman cult classic Death Race 2000 , in which cars become lethal weapons .
The strength of this new version is its total single - mindedness about vehicular homicide ; it has the virtue of no cluttering subplots or simpering sentimentality .
And banish all memory of the original ’s wild satirical comedy : Death Race is as grim as a dinner tray to the face ( a reference that will be explained in a key sequence ) .
In a slightly futuristic maximum - security prison , cons take part in brutal races around the island prison , their violent deaths watched live by millions of viewers .
Jason Statham , possibly cast because of his driving dexterity in the Transporter movies , plays a man wrongly imprisoned for murder . ”
You know you love action , and vehicular homicide , so check out Death Race .
Next up is Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog .
OK , so yes this is a love story and also a musical , but do n’t let that drive you away .
Earlier this year , during the writer ’s strike , a lot of writers were sitting around with nothing to do , including a writer named Joss Whedon .
Writers Guild members could n’t write for TV , Movies or Radio , so some decided to write for new media .
Whedon released Dr. Horrible streaming for free on the internet in July , and then released it on iTunes , now it ’s coming out on DVD .
Dr. Horrible ( Neil Patrick Harris ) is as a misguided super villian who ’s in love with Penny ( Felicia Day ) , a girl he met at the laundromat .
He seems to be doing well with Penny until Captain Hammer ( Nathan Fillion ) shows up .
Check it out to see if Dr. Horrible gets the girl .
I ’m going a little crazy this week , featuring 5 ( well 6 really ) movies , and next we have The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor .
It ’s basically the classic Mummy premise , but this time , Brenday Fraser ’s in China , and the Mummy is played by Jet Li .
It ’s not quite as good as the earlier films in this franchise , but it ’s has some fantastic martial arts and special effects .
It ’s an action / adventure movie through and through , and if you liked the earlier Mummy movies , you ’ll also enjoy this one .
You might be confused if you read this earlier , but this week ’s DVD Pick of the Week is Burn After Reading .
Somehow I missed this one earlier , I do n’t know how , because I ’m a huge fan of the Coen Brothers .
Burn After Reading is a crazy ride , in the classic Coen Brothers style reminiscent of The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona .
I ’m going to let Amazon explain the Plot :
“ After the dark brilliance of No Country for Old Men , Burn After Reading may seem like a trifle , but few filmmakers elevate the trivial to art quite like Joel and Ethan Coen .
Inspired by Stansfield Turner ’s Burn Before Reading , the comically convoluted plot clicks into gear when the CIA gives analyst Osborne Cox ( John Malkovich ) the boot .
Little does
Cox know his wife , Katie ( Tilda Swinton , riffing on her Michael Clayton character ) , is seeing married federal marshal Harry ( George Clooney , Swinton ’s Clayton co-star , playing off his Syriana role ) .
To get back at the Agency , Cox works on his memoirs .
Through a twist of fate , fitness club workers Linda ( Frances McDormand ) and Chad ( Brad Pitt in a pompadour that recalls Johnny Suede ) find the disc and try to wrangle a “ Samaratin tax ” out of the surly alcoholic .
An avid Internet dater , Linda plans to use the money for plastic surgery , oblivious that her manager , Ted ( The Visitor ’s Richard Jenkins ) , likes her just the way she is . ”
It ’s quirky , it ’s convoluted , and that ’s why we love it .

MARSHES , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Miles of reed stalks and baked mud are all that can be seen of much of Iraq ’s ancient marshes this year , as a lack of water threatens to turn one of the world ’s most important wetlands to wasteland .
Thought to be the biblical Garden of Eden , Iraq ’s marshes have for years been more known locally as a haven for smugglers , bandits and kidnappers .
Police say recent security gains could be reversed if their inhabitants do not get help .
Dusty boats lie abandoned on caked earth , where water once teemed with fish , and forests of tall reeds gave shelter to migratory birds .
Reed stumps now stretch into the horizon , and water buffalo crowd the small remaining pools .
“ The water went and now look at us , ” said Marsh Arab Zuhair al - Haideri .
“ Our situation is terrible .
We are of this water , the fish , the birds , the reeds and buffalo .
Now the marsh is dried .
Where ’s the help ? ”
A combination of a lack of rainfall last year , damming of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and increased agriculture as the country becomes calmer after years of war are putting growing demand on Iraq ’s scant water resources .
Whereas Saddam Hussein , who accused the Marsh Arabs of treachery during the 1980 - 88 war with Iran , dammed and drained the marshes to flush out rebels hiding in the reeds , now there are concerns that neighboring countries may be choking supply .
According to a United Nations Environment Program report , about 70 percent of the water entering Iraq comes from river flow controlled by Turkey , Iran , and Syria .
Turkey is embarking on a program of dam building , and Iran is also building a new dam .
Marsh water coverage fell to about 43 percent by mid January from about 71 percent a year ago , an Iraqi official working to restore the marshes said , but Marsh Arabs say the problem is more severe than the figure suggests .
Haideri ’s school - age daughter sat near him washing clothes in a rivulet of water only inches deep , under an overcast but rainless sky .
Her father ’s skin was dry and cracked with salt now concentrated in the water .

DROUGHT TO DRUGS
Many of the people living in the marshes now have only just returned .
After Saddam ’s downfall in 2003 , locals wrecked many of the dams to let water rush back in , and foreign environmental agencies stepped in to help breath life back into the marshes .
Everything was going well until a year ago , when the waters receded again , said Marsh Arabs of the Al - Hammar marsh , one of Iraq ’s three main marsh areas .
“ This is our life as you see it .
We have no water and no livelihood , ” said Muthaq Shibab outside his reed home .
Traditional lattice - work huts , or chibayish , that were once built on islands in the marshes , now dot the dry plains .
The marshes covered 9,000 square km ( 3,475 square miles ) in the 1970s , but had shrunk to just 760 square km by 2002 .
By September 2005 some 40 percent of the original area was regained , and Iraq aims to recover a total of 6,000 square km .
Vast , remote and bordering Iran , the marshes are an excellent route for drugs and arms smuggling , receiving stolen goods and keeping hostages for ransom .
The area is now safer after Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ordered a military crackdown last year , winning him huge support in Iraq ’s recent local polls .
None of the intense campaigning was evident in the marshes , however .

If the security gains are to hold , the wetlands can no longer be ignored , a regional security official said .
“ If the relevant authorities do not turn their attention to the marshes ... then of course anyone who does n’t have food or work will turn to other means to earn a living , ” he said , asking not to be identified .
OUTCASTS
Rainfall in Iraq ’s catchment area last year was less than a third of previous years , and there has been little rain so far this year , with only a few months left till summer .
“ Global warming is my analysis .
I know some experts say ... it ’s part of the meteorological cycle , ” Iraqi Minister of Water Resources Latif Rashid told Reuters .
Abdulkadhum Yassir , of the Center for Restoration of Iraqi Marshlands , said the country is fighting back .
In December Iraq started to build dams around the marshes -- this time to keep water in , not out .
“ In 2009 and 2010 , we hope to achieve maximum water coverage with minimal resources .
In the wet years we get a lot of water , but it is not properly harnessed , ” Yassir said .
The Marsh Arabs have lived in the wetlands for millennia , but are on the fringes of Iraqi society .
The United Nations says a study put the number of Marsh Arabs at 400,000 in the 1950s , but hundreds of thousands have since fled Saddam ’s repression or become economic migrants .
Estimates of how many have returned vary wildly .
Many Marsh Arabs are illiterate and have had little luck finding work outside the marshes , where they are seen as backward .
“ Where do we go now if this situation continues ?
Before we went to the provinces , but now they ’ve seen the misery we bring , they wo n’t let us come .
We have our animals .
How can we take them ? ” said marsh dweller Sughair Iyad .
He wants schools and clinics to be built for his children , and government help to bring water back to the marshes .
His mud- and dust - covered children ran around a cluster of huts , and a toddler played next to a water buffalo lying on the ground , the little girl dwarfed by the huge beast .
The Alderman laughed , and winked ; for he was a merry fellow , Alderman Cute .
Oh , and a sly fellow too !
The little un takes after my side , now : she 's twice as ' cute as Tom .
For some years Wilson had been privately at work on a whimsical almanac , for his amusement -- a calendar , with a little dab of ostensible philosophy , usually in ironical form , appended to each date ; and the judge thought that these quips and fancies of Wilson 's were neatly turned and cute ; so he carried a handful of them around one day , and read them to some of the chief citizens .
Then he began to get real cute , and held out his wee hands to me and I began to get fond of him .
She says it looked cute , all right all right , but it made her sick .
' He will be a ' cute man yet , ' resumed the locksmith .
Cunning old dog is Pearson , as cute and as greedy as a Rio shark .
But where 's the use o' talking ?-- you ca n't think what goes on in a ' cute man 's inside . "
And then , these exchanges , they do n't answer when you have ' cute jockeys to deal with .
" An ' you 'd be surprised ter find how cute it works , ma'am , too , " maintained Nancy , with almost the eagerness of Pollyanna herself .
" Nay , I do n't know , " said Adam ; " the squire 's ' cute enough but it takes something else besides ' cuteness to make folks see what 'll be their interest in the long run .
Now I watch other brilliant commentators on our nation .
I watch The Daily Show and The Colbert Report .
I like Stephen …he ’s an up - and - coming young man , to whom I wish all the success in the world .
But what gets me is that every once in a while , Stephen and his writers look like they ’re reading me–AND NOT SENDING ME A CHECK !
It happened many times during HAIL DUBYUS !
but I overlooked it–after all , he is young .
Great minds do think alike and what occurred to me could have easily occurred to him or his writers .
And the young are wont to do brash and foolish things .
But imagine the look on my face when I saw last night ’s Colbert Report and saw the juxtaposition of these two clips which followed back to back on each other , the first about Congressmen twittering during the Obama speech the other night , and the second about adopting the “ Swedish ” economic plan and going Viking :
Now look at yesterday ’s cartoon about congressmen twittering :
and this one from January 27 , just one month ago , where I suggest to the ICELANDIC Nation that they take up a - Viking Again to solve their economic woes !
Nation … it is true that great minds think alike .
And Stephen has a mind that is almost as sharp and quick as my own .
But this is beyond coincidence .
I own the copyright on Vikings !
Stephen , if you ’re going to use my material , you should PAY for it .
Stephen Colbert , you have earned yourself a wag of my finger !
YOU HEAR THAT COLBERT–I WANT YOU TO USE THAT DONATION BOX OVER ON THE RIGHT .
Yeah , that one . — — — –>
Until then , you ’re on notice , mister !
And that ’s the word

Note :
Three days after the publication of this story , Share This informed us that its staff made an error in the data that it shared with us .
While the January 2009 percentages were correct , Share This analysts seemingly misplaced a decimal point while calculating the change in usage in some of the services since August 2008 .
In actuality , Digg ’s drop in widget - based sharing was only 0.92 percent , rather than 9.18 percent , and Twitter ’s gain was actually 0.04 percent rather than 0.40 percent , as initially reported .
Additionally , AIM ’s gain was 0.03 percent as opposed to 0.28 percent .
We apologize for having passed the incorrect information on to you .
The story , in its original form , follows .
Digg is seeing a significant drop in shared content when it comes to submissions made via a popular third - party platform .
ShareThis , the Web publishing utility that lets users submit pages to multiple social bookmarking sites from a single interface , is planning to release some new metrics next week .
The measurements show which sharing services are most frequently used by surfers .
Here are the results for January of 2009 :
Digg , you ’ll notice , is now down to a tiny sliver — just 2.10 percent of all the Share This submissions for this past January .
That ’s a drop of just over 9 percent from half a year earlier .
E-mail sharing , while still by far the largest chunk of the pie , has dropped about 7 percent since August .
MySpace , StumbleUpon , and Technorati saw small decreases as well .
When it comes to increases , Facebook is seeing the biggest gains within ShareThis , jumping up nearly 13 percent to a total of 21.20 percent of all the platform ’s submissions .
Twitter and AIM also saw minor increases .
It was just last month , you may remember , that data from Hitwise indicated Twitter had overtaken Digg in overall traffic for the first time .
The new measurements from ShareThis may contribute to the argument of a broad shift slowly taking place in social bookmarking preferences .
They may also , of course , simply indicate that more Digg users are sharing content directly via digg.com rather than through a publisher ’s sharing platform .
About 80,000 online publishers have the ShareThis platform installed on their sites .

Pterosaur Fossil With 10 Inch Wingspan Discovered
With a wingspan of only 10 inches , this weird fossil is one of the world ’s smallest species of flying Pterosaurs .
It was recently discovered in the western part of China ’s Liaoning Province , which is believed to have been a forested area during the early Cretaceous Period some 120 million years ago .
This pterosaur was equivalent to the size of a modern blackbird .
â€ œThe fossil is very well preserved and it has long sharp bill .
It was toothless and its skull was just over 4 cm ( more than 1 - inch ) long.â€ said Wang Xiaolin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
Despite its small stature and wingspan , this small toothless reptile may well be the ancestor of gigantic Pterodactyls whose wing tips stretched 20 - feet from wingtip to wingtip .
This new species has been christened Nemicolopterus crypticus , meaning â€œhidden flying forest dwellerâ€ .
The slight shiver that might be crawling up your back is a reminder that in its own way that this fossil is a connection to all living things , humans included .

Following up on his earlier support for federal bailouts for financial institutions , in a new interview in the Financial Times , former Federal Reserve System Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated the following in his backing of bank nationalizations in the U.S. :
It may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring .
I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do .
And as reported by Bloomberg , in a February 17th interview and presentation before the Economic Club of New York , Greenspan states that in response to Obama ’s $ 787 billion “ economic stimulus package ” plus the $ 315 billion remaining from the bailout of the financial industry :
The amount of money in both these pots may not be enough to solve the problem .
. . .
What we are currently going through is a once - in - a - century type of event .
It will pass . . . .
Given the Japanese experience of the 1990s , we need to assure that the repair of the financial system precedes the onset of any major fiscal stimulus .
. . .
To stabilize the banking system and restore normal lending , additional TARP funds will be required .
. . .
Banks are not going to increase their lending until they feel comfortable with the amount of capital they hold .
That ’s not going to happen for a while .
. . .
Until we can stabilize the asset side of bank balance sheets , this crisis will not come to a close .
. . .
The regulatory structures , especially internationally , were way behind the curve .
. . .
There is a general belief that somehow we can regulate very complex organizations , and we can ’t .
What we ’ve got to do is to try to make them more efficient , to put far more capital into these organizations .
Long lauded in major media , business , and government circles , Greenspan is directly culpable for expansionary federal policies that created the financial bubble and the current economic meltdown ( see here and here ) .
And for a detailed examination of how U.S. government policies directly caused the sub - prime mortgage crisis , see Research Fellow Stan Liebowitz ‘s Independent Policy Report , Anatomy of a Train Wreck : Causes of the Mortgage Meltdown .
Hence , we should not be surprised that in two earlier comments in The Independent Review , Alan Reynolds described Greenspan as a “ mainstream Keynesian , ” and Paul Craig Roberts similarly noted that in keeping with Keynesian views , Greenspan opposed restrictive monetary policy for being “ inflationary . ”
In addition , the Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard similarly described Greenspan as follows :
He is , like most other long - time Republican economists , a conservative Keynesian , which in these days is almost indistinguishable from the liberal Keynesians in the Democratic camp .
In fact , his views are virtually the same as Paul Volcker , also a conservative Keynesian .
Which means that he wants moderate deficits and tax increases , and will loudly worry about inflation as he pours on increases in the money supply .
. . .
Thus , Greenspan is only in favor of the gold standard if all conditions are right : if the budget is balanced , trade is free , inflation is licked , everyone has the right philosophy , etc .
In the same way , he might say he only favors free trade if all conditions are right : if the budget is balanced , unions are weak , we have a gold standard , the right philosophy , etc .
In short , never are one ’s “ high philosophical principles ” applied to one ’s actions .
. . .
Over the years , Greenspan has , for example , supported President Ford ’s imbecilic Whip Inflation Now buttons when he was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
Much worse is the fact that this “ high philosophic ” adherent of laissez - faire saved the racketeering Social Security program in 1982 , just when the general public began to realize that the program was bankrupt and there was a good chance of finally slaughtering this great sacred cow of American politics .
Greenspan stepped in as head of a “ bipartisan ” ( i.e. conservative and liberal centrists ) Social Security Commission , and “ saved ” the system from bankruptcy by slapping on higher Social Security taxes .
Time ‘s Justin
Fox earlier applauded Greenspan ’s policies in “ Alan Greenspan , Keynesian ” .
And Keynesian bulldog Paul Krugman has described Greenspan as a “ vulgar Keynesian ” :
[ P]utting Greenspan ( or his successor ) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy .
Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run , we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years .
To accomplish this , the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other .
And so all the paradoxes of thrift , widow ’s curses , and so on become irrelevant .
In particular , an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all , because the Fed will make sure that it does .
Why must we endure now the recommendations of Greenspan and others directly responsible for the financial crisis ?
The answer is that opinion among most of the American “ political elite ” still clings faithfully to a series of collectivist / statist economic myths that they strongly resist giving up , even when the evidence indicates the exact opposite to be true ( see Senior Fellow Robert Higgs ‘s award - winning book , Depression , War , and Cold War ) .
Obama supporters are exhibit A in this “ irrational exuberance ” ( to use Greenspan ’s own words ) in worshiping government power , and since Greenspan ’s continuing faith in Keynesian economics and now bank bailouts and nationalizations reflects neither moral principle nor economic wisdom , perhaps this speaks more about what it takes to remain a worthy member of this “ elite . ”
For those of you looking to purchase any item from the plethora of hardware announced at yesterday 's keynote a Unibody 17 " MacBook Pro , but do n't want to get stuck with an old version of iLife , have no fear : Apple 's iLife '09 iLife Up - to - Date Program has you covered .
If you purchased a new Mac on January 6th , or plan to in the coming days , Apple will update your software for the low , low price of $ 9.95 plus tax .
Before you get upset about the fact that you just dropped almost $ 3,000 on a machine and now you have to spend an additional $ 9.99 on the software Apple announced before it was even ready , let 's think about their costs for a moment .
Surely the cost of a blank DVD , a DVD sheath , a shipping envelope , and postage cost the company at least $ 1.50 .
Plus the cost of putting the Web page together , hosting it , and paying people to put the DVD into sheaths and envelopes might add another 15 ¢ per unit .
So after your $ 3,000 purchase it stands to reason that Apple needs to charge you $ 9.99 to pay for their $ 1.50 in costs .
Apple has n't yet made it clear who your check should be sent to , but they do let us know that if you check the website again on the 12th you can obtain more information .
Hey , at least they are n't making you pay full price ?
The Manhattan housing market , that bulletproof bellwether of residential real estate , is finally taking its lumps , according to new reports that show sales are down , listings are up , and sellers are getting frustrated .
After years of being insulated from the rest of the country ’s housing woes , Manhattan properties are feeling the pinch as skittish buyers and cautious lenders are making owners wait longer to sell their co-ops and condos .
Even the luxury market – where properties generally sell faster – is taking a beating , according to an analysis of fourth - quarter sales by real - estate company Prudential Douglas Elliman .
Upper -tier homes sold between October and the end of December went for nearly 4 percent less than during the same period the year before – and stayed on the market an average of 52 days longer .
“ They did n’t think Manhattan would ever get hit , ” said Howard Epstein , a broker with Hercules Realty Group .
“ But it has . ”
Prudential Douglas ’ Manhattan Market Overview includes several fourth - quarter findings :
* The number of co-op sales in Manhattan fell 23.4 percent , from 1,286 units to 985 units , compared to the same period last year .
* Co-op listings increased 52.2 percent .
* Properties stayed on the market four weeks longer .
* Resale median sales prices fell 3.6 percent , from $ 760,000 to $ 732,500 .
Kerry Fitzgerald , 36 , an Upper West Side owner , did n’t need a market overview to know how bad things are .
She and her husband have been trying since July to sell their two - bedroom , two - bathroom West End Avenue co-op so they and their baby daughter can move to the suburbs .
Fitzgerald said they had to drop the original asking price of $ 1.27 million to $ 1.15 million .
She said there had been plenty of interest , but still no takers .
“ We had seven to 10 extremely interested people , and no offers ever came , ” said Fitzgerald .
Corcoran Group CEO Pam Liebman said the Manhattan market started changing around the end of September .
“ We were n’t affected by the subprime mortgage crisis like other states , but because of the loss of jobs , contraction of bonuses and fears of job security , the market has taken a hit , ” Liebman said .

Queen 's Speech : Firms free to favour female and black job applicants
Companies will be free to discriminate in favour of women and black job candidates under proposed ‘ equality ’ laws .
The move allows employers to give preferential treatment as long as applicants are equally qualified .
It is designed to boost the proportion of female and ethnic staff , as well as thrusting more of them into senior posts .
Purple patch : Gordon Brown , who is enjoying a bounce in popularity , and his wife Sarah both opted to wear the colour that denotes good form yesterday .
He wore a purple tie , while she opted for a matching beret ( £ 7 , New Look ) and purple purse
Ministers insist that businesses will not be compelled to favour the woman or the black candidate , but the law will be changed to ensure they cannot be sued for turning down a white man .
Equalities minister Harriet Harman says ‘ positive action ’ is vital so that the workforce more accurately represents the proportion of the population as a whole .
Positive discrimination , where a lesser qualified candidate is given the job just because he or she is from a minority , will remain illegal .
There is only one High Court judge from an ethnic minority , while only 11 per cent of directors in the UK ’s top 100 companies are female , and not a single MP is an Asian woman .
The Government suggested that one example where the new legislation could be used was if a primary school wanted to increase the number of male teachers who act as role models to young boy pupils .
The CBI , Trades Union Congress and the Equality and Human Rights Commission support positive action .
But the Equality Bill , which brings together nine major laws and 100 other regulations , will inevitably lead to charges that women are more equal then men .
Miss Harman , whose earnest feminism has earned her the nickname Harriet Harperson , said yesterday that the economic downturn would not hold back the ‘ tough ’ new measures , claiming ‘ fairness does n’t cost anything ’ .
Other proposals in the Bill include moves to tackle the gender pay gap and powers to ban discrimination against older people in the provision of goods and services .
There will also be measures to ensure more Government contracts , worth a total of £ 175 billion , are awarded to firms which have good records on equality .
And public bodies will for the first time have to ensure that they do not discriminate on grounds of ‘ sexual orientation , gender reassignment , age and religion or belief ’ .
In reality , this would mean councils are banned from installing heavy wheelie bins and complicated parking meters which confuse many elderly people .
The Bill replaces the Equal Pay Act , Sex Discrimination Act , Race Relations Act , Disability Discrimination Act and other pieces of legislation dating back 40 years .
So - called ‘ secrecy clauses ’ will be banned so workers can compare their wages and challenge employers who pay them less than their colleagues .
Public bodies will have to report on any pay inequalities and the Equality and Human Rights Commission will conduct a series of inquiries into pay .
Ministers will also press ahead with a consultation on whether firms should be forced to reveal the salary gap between their male and female staff to highlight how women have slipped behind .
The Government estimates that the gender pay gap is 21 per cent when the wages of full and part - time women workers are compared with men .
The move to ban businesses and public services from discrimination on age grounds was described as a ‘ huge step ’ towards treating older people as equals .
Campaigners warned that one in five of those aged 75 or over has been refused travel insurance or had health restrictions imposed on policies .
Ban on buy one get one free drink deals
Supermarket drink promotions enjoyed by millions of responsible customers are to be banned .
Wine and beer will be hardest hit by the end of bulk discount offers such as ‘ buy one get one free ’ .
Ministers say they want to reduce any incentive for customers to save money by buying excessive amounts of alcohol .
They claim this will help to reduce the harmful effects of binge drinking , such as ill - health and violent crime .
But opponents warned that the ‘ perverse ’ Government crackdown will lead to sharp increases in the weekly shopping bill of hardworking families who drink in an entirely responsible manner .
Currently , more than half of all alcohol purchased from supermarkets is sold on promotion .
Ending these discounts will be considered particularly cruel as recession bites .
Police said that if the Government wanted to stop binge drinking it would have been better served by scrapping 24 - hour opening , introduced by Labour in 2005 despite widespread protest .
British Retail Consortium director general Stephen Robertson said : ‘ Controls on price and promotions will not tackle alcohol abuse .
' They just penalise millions of customers who drink perfectly responsibly . ’
The ban on alcohol promotions in shops and supermarkets will become law next year .
Traders must agree to conform to a new mandatory code on responsible selling , or face huge fines .
Paul McKeever , chairman of the Police Federation , said the government had ‘ only put a sticking plaster on a growing wound ’ .
He added : ‘ The advent of 24/7 licensing has encouraged people to drink to excess and we have seen greater numbers of youngsters spilling out on to the streets at all hours , often resulting in increased violence and anti-social behaviour .
‘ The Government needs to bite the bullet , recognise that 24/7 licensing was a mistake and give the public an early Christmas present by reversing that decision . ’
The wider crackdown on irresponsible drinking will be part of a Policing and Crime Reduction Bill , unveiled in yesterday ’s Queen ’s Speech .
It could be passed in time to affect discounts next Christmas .
As the Daily Mail predicted earlier this week , so - called happy - hour promotions escaped an outright ban in the crackdown .
Any decision would be left to local authorities .
Instead , Ministers will outlaw offers such as ‘ all you can drink for £ 10 ’ and promotions targeted at certain groups , such as women only .
Under the new mandatory code , all staff selling alcohol must be properly trained , and signs displaying how much alcohol a drink contains must be displayed by the bar .
Bars and pubs will also have to offer small glasses of wine , rather than large measures only .
Some £ 4.5 million will be spent on a new police enforcement campaign .
Plans to ban shops from displaying cigarettes and to outlaw cigarette vending machines have been put on hold amid fears that they would hit small retailers .
Lie detectors to root out benefit cheats
Lie detectors will be used to root out benefit cheats .
Council staff will use the machines to identify anyone lying about their circumstances to pocket taxpayers ’ cash .
State - of - the - art ‘ voice - risk analysis software ’ will be rolled out to councils and job centres nationwide to help cut the £ 800 million stolen by benefits thieves last year .
The tough measures are included in a Welfare Reform Bill which aims to get one million Incapacity Benefit claimants into jobs .
Disabled people claiming incapacity benefit will be forced to undergo compulsory skills checks to decide what work they can do .
Meanwhile , 300,000 single parents and a million over - 60s will be given work - focused interviews to try to get them into jobs .
Battered women who kill could escape murder charges
Battered women who kill abusive partners in cold blood because they fear more violence will escape a murder conviction .
Instead their crime - even if premeditated - will be reduced to manslaughter , sparing them a mandatory life sentence .
Under the Coroners and Justice Bill , victims of domestic violence will be able to claim they were provoked into killing by their tormentors after enduring months or years of abuse .
But the shake - up of the homicide laws would scrap the ‘ partial defence ’ of provocation where a husband claims he killed in a fit of sexual jealousy after discovering his wife was having an affair .
The new partial defence clause for ‘ killers in fear ’ could also be used by those who strike out after bitter disputes with neighbours , or victims of a serious crime who are taunted at a later date by the attacker .
Suicide websites to be outlawed
Justice Minister Jack Straw is determined to outlaw websites which encourage suicide following their links to a string of young deaths .
But there are fears that the Coroners and Justice Bill could be used as a vehicle to scrap laws which prevent helping a terminally - ill person to die .
Pro-euthanasia campaigners could table amendments to the Bill when it goes before Parliament which would permit terminally - ill adults to choose to end their lives .
Under the 1961 Suicide
Act it is illegal to urge someone to take his own life , but no website operator has been prosecuted under the laws .
Because the law is so old , it has been mistakenly assumed that a person can be prosecuted only for encouraging someone to commit suicide in a face - to - face meeting .
The Bill will make it clear that the ban on assisting suicide does apply on line .
Lapdancing club curb
Councils will be given greater powers to turn down new lapdancing clubs under a drive to crack down on crime and disorder .
The clubs - currently in the same licensing category as pubs and cafes -- are expected to be licensed in the same way as sex shops .
Under Labour ’s Licensing Act 2003 , lapdancing clubs outside London need only an alcohol licence .
The new Bill will make it illegal to use prostitutes who have been trafficked into the country or who work for pimps .
It will become an offence to buy sex from anyone ‘ controlled for another person ’s gain ’ .
Flexible working law goes ahead
No help :
The controversial law will go ahead despite Lord Mandelson , above , saying he would consider delaying it
Ministers are to press ahead with controversial plans to allow millions of parents with older children the right to request flexible working .
From April , the move will allow all parents with children under 16 to ask for changes to their working day to fit in with family life .
Currently , only those with children aged six or under or with a disabled child have the right to ask their employer for a change in their working patterns .
Under the law , employers must seriously consider any application for flexible working and they can reject it only if there are good business reasons .
The measure was not mentioned in the Queen ’s Speech as it does not require a new Bill and can be implemented under existing flexible working regulations .
It has dismayed business leaders , who have warned that the decision will damage firms during the recession .
In October , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said he was considering plans to delay the law to help companies struggling in an economic downturn .
But ministers yesterday confirmed they were pressing ahead following pressure from union leaders and Labour backbenchers .
John Wright , chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses , said : ‘ Small businesses do not object to flexible working .
But now is not the time to burden employers with the need to spend time on meetings and formally agreeing new contracts and conditions , when much of this takes place informally anyway . ’
New business tax
Millions of businesses will be hit with a new tax in the next 18 months .
Firms with a rateable value of more than £ 50,000 will be forced to pay business rate supplements .
The tax will be levied by all local authorities , excluding district councils , which will use the money to promote ‘ economic development in the area ’ .
The supplements will be charged at up to 2 p for every £ 1 of the firm ’s rateable value .
Each local authority will have the right to set the amount it charges but will be forced to consult businesses before introducing the tax .
The British Retail Consortium accused the Government of ‘ saddling retailers with new tax costs when they can least afford them . ’
Director general Stephen Robertson said : ‘ It gives local authorities the power to clobber businesses with a hefty new stealth tax . ’
Immigrants must ' earn ' passports
Immigrants must ‘ earn ’
British passports by carrying out voluntary work , paying taxes and learning to speak English .
Those who make a greater effort to integrate by , for instance , helping out at youth clubs or taking OAPs shopping could be ‘ fast - tracked ’ .
But economic migrants who commit crimes or do not find work will be sent home .
Under the Borders , Immigration and Citizenship Bill , applicants must have lived in the UK for at least six years before being granted ‘ earned citizenship ’ .
Currently , foreigners who come to Britain to work are allowed to stay after five years but there is no obligation to become citizens .
This will be replaced by five years ’ temporary residence followed by a period of between one and five years of ‘ probationary ’ citizenship .
U - turn on plans to give MPs final say on going to war
Flagship plans to give
MPs the final say on international treaties and going to war were effectively dumped .
The Constitutional Renewal Bill , which also includes moves to enshrine in law civil service impartiality , will be introduced only ‘ when time allows ’ in the next Parliamentary session .
It is an embarrassing U - turn for Gordon Brown , who trumpeted the proposals when he took over as Prime Minister last year .
He used them to strengthen the role of Parliament as a way of distancing himself from Tony Blair ’s ‘ sofa style ’ of Government .
Hulu has quietly dropped its uniform georetardation polices following our post highlighting the absurdity of their position October 6 .
Until now , all clips on Hulu have been uniformly unavailable outside of the United States .
For the first time this is n’t the case , with clips from Saturday Night Live now available to anyone visiting the sites , or watching them embedded elsewhere .
The clips do have a small bug : the 30 second pre-rolls do n’t play , and instead users have to sit through 30 seconds of nothing , but it ’s at least a start .
While we welcome the move by Hulu to start making available content outside of the United States where it is freely and legally available elsewhere , the gesture seems a little shallow given they ’ve only lifted the block on Saturday Night Live clips .
Clips freely available from other shows , including Colbert , John Stewart , and a range of clips from the Presidential Debates are still blocked .
They ’ve even got all the shows from The Onion blocked ( which are freely available in full EVERYWHERE ) so it ’s not as if they ’re dealing with big media companies alone with this issue .
Lets make it easy for Hulu with a general rule : clips from shows , including big networks , are usually available everywhere online , full shows are n’t , because the rights issue comes into play with full shows sold in overseas territories , not 2 or 3 minute clips .
This even applies for made for television shows : for example , I was a big fan of Jericho , and I regularly watched clips on the CBS site , including 5 minutes of the next episode teasers .
The only thing I was ever blocked on was the ability to watch the whole show , because rights to the show had been sold to stations outside the United States , and those networks usually get the rights to online viewing as well , within each country .
Slightly less an EPIC FAIL , more now a throw the dog a bone and think he wont notice the rest FAIL .
There is nothing funnier than watching a major corporation pander to the geeks , especially when they do n't have a frakkin ' clue what they 're talking about .
Perfect example : I present the BSG Kentucky Fried Chicken ad .
Advertisement
First , a special thanks to Topless Robot for their tireless reporting of KFC 's hilarious attempt to incorporate Battlestar Galactica fans into their marketing .
While their idea to capitalize on the minds of BSG fanatics was smart , the execution was disastrous but hilarious to watch .
First KFC busted out a " Frak Pak " add for their chicken in a bucket .
Which , as you all know , means Fuck Pak .
Who wants a Fuck Pak of chicken ?
I know I do .
Our noble leader even suggested calling it a Fuck Bucket , which is even more clever .
Advertisement
The Frak Pak is a prize pack that included BSG DVDs , autographed scripts and a YEAR'S WORTH OF KFC , which would kill you , I 'm sure .
So after what I 'm assuming was a battery of emails from hungry - for - chicken BSG fans , the good folks over at KFC put it together that Frak= Fuck , and changed their ad to :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
So the Fuck Pak has been changed to the Fuck Sweepstakes , which I 'm way more interested in .
Thank you Topless Robot for finding this , and thank you KFC for the new sexy sweepstakes .
Obama Warns his Supporters not to Expect too Much From Him
It started even before the election was over , it started with this article .
What am I talking about ?
The tamping down of the unrealistic expectations that President - elect Obama has created with his supporters .
The article talks about how once Obama assumes the presidency there will be no real change .
despite Obama ’s often repeated call for “ change ” during the campaign , many of the writers and political experts who spoke said Obama would pursue familiar paths as president .
There is really no “ change ” in any of President - elect Obama ’s plans , they have all been proposed before .
James Matthews , a management consultant based in New York , said that on domestic issues such as education , nearly all of Obama ’s policies have been seen before .
He predicted that many young college students who were among his strongest supporters would feel severely let down after the election .
This appears to me to be a warning to Obama ’s supporters not to expect too much to get done and not to expect a whole hell of allot of change .
Barack Obama himself tried to slow down the enthusiasm of unrealistic expectation to his audience during his victory speech last night .
President - elect Obama , during his speech said :
The road ahead will be long .
Our climb will be steep .
We may not get there in one year or even in one term .
But , America , I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there .
There will be setbacks and false starts .
In that first statement he is either warning voters that he can’t possibly give everything to everyone , as he promised , or he is already starting his re-election bid .
Everyone knows that Barack Obama ca n’t deliver on everything that he promised , well everyone but the people who voted for him .
And with the article that appeared before the election and Obama himself during his victory speech he is trying to slow down the expectations of the voters who supported him .
Now that he has won the election he is trying to be slightly more honest with the American people .
Not fully honest , he ca n’t admit that he said whatever it took to become the president - elect , but he is trying to let them down slowly .
The UK 's first development of Ikea houses has fallen flat with buyers .
The flat pack development in Gateshead was conceived two years ago as the answer to the UK 's housing shortage .
It was hoped that a terrace of Ikea - designed BoKlok houses and flats would provide affordable and ecological properties .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the plans were hit by credit drying up and the collapse of the housing market .
Twenty of the 36 apartments that have already been built in St James Village , in Felling , Gateshead , remain unoccupied .
And while six of the terraced homes , costing between £ 132,500 and £ 149,500 , have been reserved , the company behind the development , Live Smart Home , have turned to a range of incentives , worth up to £ 5,000 , to encourage would - be home owners to commit .
People who reserve their new home by January 25 , and complete the sale by the end of March will be able to claim a package of incentives including new bikes , garden accessories and free travel on the Newcastle Metro system .
And those who buy the first 13 apartments will also receive a year 's gym membership for two people , a family holiday and their legal fees will be paid .
The company admitted the package was designed to " entice " buyers in light of the credit crunch .
John Hanson , Live Smart Home 's operations director , said : " We acknowledge the credit crunch has made it difficult for our target market to obtain a mortgage .
" With interest rates falling further and with the incentives we are offering , we are hopeful that all the houses will be sold fairly quickly . "
In total , five apartments have been sold at the St James Village development , seven are being rented and four people are on Live Smart Home 's Try Before You Buy scheme .
The scheme was introduced in November to try to boost sagging sales figures .
It allowed potential buyers to rent a home for up to six months , and then get their rent payments back to use as a deposit on buying the house , to try to boost sagging sales figures .
BoKlok homes were designed in Sweden in the mid-1990s to address the need for affordable properties , and to provide people with high - quality properties at a low price .
The BoKlok concept is to provide space - saving , functional homes offering good quality at a price which puts them within reach of households earning between £ 12,500 and £ 30,000 a year .

In a separate pan , brown the oxtail well on both sides ; this should take about four minutes per side .
Remove the oxtail from the pan and deglaze with the vinegar , removing the bits from the bottom of the pan .
Add the oxtail to the veg along with the sherry vinegar .
Add the tomatoes and water , a pinch of salt and a little freshly ground pepper , stir well and place a lid on the pan .
Turn the heat to its lowest setting and cook for three hours , stirring every now and then .
Add the cloves 20 minutes from the end .
The meat is ready when it falls from the bone .
Turn off the heat and allow the dish to cool to room temperature .
It will taste all the better for this .
Twenty minutes before eating , reheat the dish over a low heat and serve piping hot .

Spam , especially junk e-mails with malicious links or attachments , continues to be a huge IT headache .
Spammers are also getting more creative in their attempts to find victims , utilizing popular sites such as Facebook and Twitter , according to a report from UK - based security firm Sophos this week .
The consultancy published its latest spam trend report and said new figures reveal that spam is still causing problems for computer users .
In the fourth quarter of 2008 , Sophos research found one in every 256 e-mails contained a dangerous attachment in October .
In November , that figure improved to one in 384 .
December saw a huge decline : Just one in every 2000 e-mails contained a spam .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , said it is possible the drop - off may be related to the shut down of the McColo Corp. , a Web - hosting firm that security experts believe was responsible for three - quarters of the world 's spam .
" It 's hard to say exactly what can be causing this , " said Cluley .
" Certainly that is possible . "
Numbers for January have not been assessed yet and Cluley said it is too early to determine if the drop off in spam levels has continued , or if spam is now back at levels seen in earlier months .
What is clear , said Cluley , is that more spam is malicious in nature now and often designed to infect users ' computers via sophisticated malware attachments or a link to malicious or infected websites , in order to steal sensitive information .
Cluley also said social networking venues , such as Facebook and Twitter , are now the hot targets for spammers .
" Spammers really took to using sites like Facebook and Twitter as a vehicle for their spam antics during the last three months of 2008 , " he said .
" Cybercriminals have cottoned onto the fact that social networking users can be more easily fooled into clicking on a link that appears to have come from a trusted Facebook friend , than if it arrived as an unsolicited email in their inbox .
The notorious Nigerian 419 scammers have even evolved , masquerading as Facebook friends in order to trick unwary users into parting with valuable sensitive and financial information .
Ultimately , while users are still falling for these scams , the fraudsters will continue .
And while the authorities are making great progress , everyone must take steps to ensure they do n't fall victim . "
Death to Spam ?
The report also referenced a 2004 prediction by Bill Gates that spam would be a thing of the past in 2 years .
" The rumors of spam 's death have been greatly exaggerated over the years the threat remains alive and kicking despite increased legal action against spammers , the occasional takedown of Internet companies which assist the cybercriminals , and constantly improving anti-spam software , " said Cluley .
" Many IT professionals cast doubt on Bill Gates ' assertion back in 2004 , deeming the timeframe of his pledge to be unrealistic .
Although the latest stats show that the proportion of spam relayed per country may have decreased year - on - year , spammers have turned to more creative , not to mention devious , methods to ensure their messages reach as many unsuspecting computer users as possible . "
And the Spam King Crown Goes to ...
Between October and December 2008 , the United States was responsible for most of the world 's spam , according to Sophos .
China was in the second spot and Russia was third .
Sophos officials pointed to Canada , Japan and France as countries that have made progress in spam prevention .
All three , considered " serial offenders " five years ago , are no longer present in the list of spam reprobates .
" Although there 's no denying that some countries have significantly reduced their contribution to the spam epidemic over the past five years , the United States still holds the crown , " said Cluley .
" Though its spam contribution has significantly decreased since Bill Gates ' proclamation , falling from almost half of all spam relayed at the end of 2004 , to 21.3 percent by the end of 2007 , and now resting at 19.8 percent , this shows there 's certainly no quick fix . "

The lake ’s beauty has such an impact that some people believe fairies come to visit it in the full moon .
The Grand Canyon , United States
A steep gorge by the Colorado River , the Grand Canyon has some truly enjoyable scenery .
It is 277 miles long , varies from four to 18 miles wide in places , and reaches to about a mile deep .
Scientists believe that the canyon was created by the Colorado River over a six million year period .
Native Americans built settlements in the caves within the canyon before the emigration of Europeans .
It was also considered to be a site of pilgrimage by the Pueblo people .
The first recorded visit to the Grand Canyon by Europeans was in 1869 .
Although it is not the deepest canyon in the world , it is known for its extremely large size and beautifully intricate landscape .
The Grand Canyon National Park is one of the earliest national parks in the United States , and it attracts more than five million visitors each year .
Weather conditions in the Grand Canyon vary greatly between seasons as well as at different elevations .
While winter snow is experienced by the higher forested rims , the inner gorge has more of a desert temperature because of its low elevation .
The Great Barrier Reef , Australia
One of the natural wonders of the world , the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Australia is the world ’s largest coral reef .
It has the distinction of being placed in the World Heritage as well as the National Heritage list .
With more than 600 islands and coral cays , the Great Barrier Reef covers more than 300,000 sq. km .
Corals make up the reefs and cays and are responsible for a huge variety of sea life in the area .
That includes green turtles , several varieties of whales and dolphins , the dugong , aroud 4000 types of mollusks , 1500 different species of fish , as well as at least 200 species of beautifully - colored birds .
The Great Reef Marine Park is a huge tourist attraction with millions of tourists visiting each year .

Cape Town , South Africa
Cape Town is aptly called “ Heaven on earth . ”
This beautiful town at the tip of the African continent , with small roads surrounded by huge mountains , makes a person feel small .
It shows just how marvelous and dominating nature can be .
The Cape Dutch style buildings depict the architectural heritage of the place .
Beauty abounds in the black clouds that seem to pay homage to Table Mountain at all times .
Cape Point , Signal Hill , Chapman ’s Peak Drive , Victoria & Alfred Waterfront , Robben Island , Rhodes Memorial , and the beaches are just some of the famous tourist attractions .
Located on the shore of Table Bay , Cape Town is famous for its floral displays as well as its harbor .
This town is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South Africa with its wine tasting day trips , whale watching , and dolphin watching .
Taj Mahal , India
The Taj Mahal in India is one of the wonders of the world and is one of the most beautiful mausoleums ever created .
It was constructed by the Mughal emperor , Shah Jahan , in memory of his favorite queen , Mumtaz Mahal .
Located in Agra , white marble was used in the construction of this symbol of love , and the Taj Mahal is considered to be the pinnacle of Mughal architecture .
As the story goes , the emperor was grief - stricken when he lost his beloved third wife , Mumtaz Mahal .
It took thousands of craftsmen and artisans , and about twenty years to construct this structure in her honor .
The masons , stone cutters , carvers , inlayers , calligraphers , painters , and others were brought from throughout the entire empire as well as from Iran and Central Asia .
Semi-precious stones were used for inlays and ornamentation .
It later became the mausoleum of Shah Jahan too .
This is a huge tourist attraction with one to two million tourists visiting it every year .
Canadian Rockies , Canada
The majestic Canadian Rockies are the Canadian segment of the North American Rocky Mountains .
They are a visitor ’s winter wonderland and Western Canada ’s playground .
They are older than the American Rockies and were formed as a result of over - thrusting .
The Canadian Rockies house five national parks , and four of those national parks ( along with other provincial parks ) combine to form a single UNESCO World Heritage Site that consists of beautiful mountain landscapes , lakes , canyons , waterfalls , glaciers , peaks , limestone caves , and fossils .
Mount Robson is the highest peak of the Canadian Rockies and climbing it is considered a challenge .
These beautiful mountains are a haven for hikers and walkers alike .
Machu Picchu , Peru
Machu Picchu in Peru , which means “ Old Peak , ” is one of the most beautiful ancient sites in the world .
According to legend , Machu Picchu was long ago considered to be a sacred place .
The Inca people are credited with its creation .
They erected many stone structures and turned the place into a work of art .
Two thousand feet above the Urubamba river , the ruins of Machu Picchu consist of baths , temples , palaces , and around 150 houses , all very well preserved .
These gray granite structures , some of which weigh more than 50 tons , are so perfectly sculpted that they are nothing less than architectural masterpieces .
The ruins of Machu Picchu were rediscovered by a Yale archaeologist in 1911 .
The ethereal beauty , workmanship , and history of the place attracts millions of tourists each year .
The Pyramids , Egypt
The Egyptian pyramids are massive monuments with a square base and four triangular sides rising up to a point .
There is still a lot of curiosity ( and many theories ) as to how the pyramids were actually built — with people crediting everyone from slave laborers to alien visitors .
It is generally believed that the Egyptians began constructing the pyramids after 2700 B.C. and that they were built as tombs for the pharaohs .
The most well - known ( and the largest ) pyramids found in Egypt are the Pyramids at Giza which are said to be the largest ever built .
It ’s said that the Great Pyramid of Giza alone took 23 years to complete , using a work force of around 30,000 people .
About 118 pyramids have been identified , and they are popular and intriguing to tourists and researchers alike .
Described by UNESCO as “ one of the most precious cultural properties of man ’s cultural heritage , ” Petra is an archaeological site on the slope of Mount Hor .
It is one of the new wonders of the world and is famous for its rock - cut architecture .
This site was kept hidden until 1812 when it was discovered by a Swiss explorer .
It was said by some to have been prepared by God for the Jewish people .
Petra once flourished under the Roman empire but it rapidly declined with Arabian trade being taken elsewhere .
Then an earthquake caused a great deal of destruction .
Tourists frequent the place to get a glimpse of the ruins of this beautiful city , although they ’re doing more harm than good , with tourism becoming a threat to the preservation of Petra .
Great Wall of China , China
One of the seven wonders of the world , the Great Wall of China is a man-made structure that was constructed over two thousand years ago .
It is estimated to have taken around 100 years to complete .
You can truly witness man ’s potential when you take in the beauty and vastness of the Great Wall .
The construction on the Great Wall of China started in the 5th Century B.C.
It is actually not a single wall , but rather many walls put together .
Combined , they stretch over 4,000 miles .
This collection of walls was constructed to protect the Chinese empire from the Xiongnu people in the north .
The wall was initially built of stone , grass , earth , and wood , but bricks were used also after production began .
It is believed that around two to three million Chinese died during the construction of this wonder .
The Iguazu Waterfalls , Argentina - Brazil Border
Heralded by many as the most beautiful waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Waterfalls are a true wonder of nature .
They are located on the border of Argentina , Brazil , and Paraguay .
While the Argentinean side allows visitors to walk right around the water or explore the National Park , the Brazilian side is known for its panoramic views and splendor .
Former First Lady of the United States , Eleanor Roosevelt , is believed to have exclaimed upon seeing these falls , “ Poor Niagara ! ”
The area surrounding the falls provides ample opportunities for rock climbing as well as water sports .
Iguazu has the greatest annual flow of water of all of the waterfalls in the world .
With all of these , and many more , beautiful places that exist in our world we are surrounded by choices .
Which of the most beautiful places in the world will you visit ?

Patrick McGoohan , the Emmy award - winning actor who created and starred in 1960s TV show The Prisoner , has died at the age of 80 .
The actor 's son-in - law , film producer Cleve Landsberg , said today that McGoohan had died yesterday in Los Angeles after a short illness .
McGoohan was best known as the title character Number Six in surreal drama The Prisoner , which aired on ITV in the UK .
He played a former spy who is held captive in a small village and constantly tries to escape .
He also won two Emmys for detective drama Columbo , playing different characters , with the first coming in 1974 and the other 16 years later .
More recently , McGoohan appeared as King Edward Longshanks in the 1995 Mel Gibson film Braveheart .
McGoohan , who was born in New York but raised in England and Ireland , came to screen prominence in ITV 's early 1960s drama series Danger Man , in which he played a secret agent .
He was also considered for the lead role in the first James Bond movie , Dr No , before Sean Connery was cast .
However , it was The Prisoner , which aired originally on ITV between 1967 and 1968 , with which he was chiefly associated , writing some of the episodes himself under a different name .
His character , Number Six , spent the entire time attempting to escape from a prison – which was disguised as a holiday camp – and trying to find out the identity of his captor , the elusive Number One .
He repeatedly declared : " I am not a number - I am a free man ! "
In 2000 , McGoohan reprised his most famous role in an episode of The Simpsons .
His last acting job came in 2002 , voicing a character in animation Treasure Planet .
ITV is currently remaking The Prisoner in conjunction with American cable channel AMC .
It is due to air later this year .
McGoohan 's other film acting credits include Ice Station Zebra , Escape from Alcatraz , Scanners and A Time to Kill .

A credit score is a number that typically ranges from 300 – 850 and is used by financial institutions to evaluate a credit applicants ability and willingness to pay back the funds they ’re requesting to borrow .
Credit scores can also reflect how responsible an individual is when applying for a job , how likely they are to pay for their rental property on time or to access risk when applying for insurance .
The most common types of financial institutions include commercial banks , investment banks , brokerage firms , insurance companies , and asset management funds .
Other types include the financial departments of “ buy here , pay here ” auto dealerships and furniture rental stores , credit unions , and finance firms .
Types of credit scores
Typically there are two types of credit scores :
FICO ® VantageScore
However , you may also find industry specific scores .
What is a good FICO score ?
Fico is one of the most common types of credit scores , which were originated by the Fair Isaac Corporation .
Fico scores range between 300 and 850 .
Therefore , a fico score that is above 680 is known as an average , good Fico score .
A fico score above 780 is excellent .
Here are the different Fico score ranges :
Credit Score Chart and Range
FICO scores and the percentage of the population
4.7 % have credit scores between 300 and 499
15.3 % have scores that fall between 500 and 599
23.2 % come in between 600 and 699
36.1 % of credit reports show between 700 and 799
20.7 % have scores of 800 and 850 and typically have a long - established credit history .
What is a Good VantageScore ?
Just like Fico scores , VantageScores are also used by lenders .
These credit scores were developed by the following three credit bureaus :
Experian Equifax TransUnion
VantageScore and the percentage of the population
5 % have credit scores between 300 and 499
21 % have scores that fall between 500 and 599
13 % come in between 600 and 699
38 % of credit reports show between 700 and 799
23 % have scores of 800 and 850 and typically have a long - established credit history .
Purpose of credit scores
Lenders use credit scores as a great decision - making tool as it helps them in analyzing whether you will be able to repay your loan at the specified time or not .
These scores are also known as risk scores as they help the lenders in determining the risk of giving you a loan and whether you will repay the debt on time .
Therefore , having a good credit score is important as it will help you get your loan approved by the lender .
These credit scores are like your report cards .
They help in determining whether you qualify for the credit or not .
However , it is crucial to note that your credit score alone does not help in making the lender decide if you qualify for the loan or not .
There is other information mentioned on your credit report such as the following which helps in getting your loan approved :
The total amount of debt
Types of credit
The time that is taken to pay off debts
Help determine your total monthly expenses
The ratio of monthly expenses against your income .
Factors affecting credit scores
There are certain factors in your credit report that may affect your overall credit score .
These factors are mentioned below :
Your payment history that includes loan and credit cards information Your credit card utilization rate
The total amount of debt due
If there is any public record against you , such as a bankruptcy .
If any inquiry took place against your credit report Amount of credit accounts you have .
How can you improve your credit scores ?
Many times people go over their credit information and come to the conclusion that their credit score is not where it should be to get approved for credit .
When you know what kind of activities can affect your credit score , you can improve it by simply not getting yourself indulged in those activities .
Get familiar with your credit report and find out the pattern that caused the downfall of your credit score .
Once you are sure what caused it , try to avoid those activities .
Doing this will have a great impact on your credit score altogether .
Things to know about credit scores
It is essential to know that your credit score is not mentioned in your credit report , nor are they mentioned in your credit history .
Your credit score is only calculated when you request it .
Based on your credit history , the credit score can keep on changing over time , so there is nothing to worry about if you have a poor credit score .
There are certain reasons why you may not have a credit score .
One of those reasons is that you may not have adequate credit history to have a credit score .
However , you can still get a credit score if you are under 21 .
You need to have a cosigner who can guarantee that you will pay back any credit that is due .
Feb. 26 , 2009  -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates has lifted the Pentagon 's ban on media coverage of the flag - draped caskets of America 's war dead returning to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware , leaving it up to each family to decide whether it wants media coverage .
If family members agree to grant media access , the military will suggest guidelines for how much coverage to allow .
This will be similar to the policy in place at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia regarding media coverage .
" We should not presume to make the decision for the families ; we should actually let them make it , " Gates told Pentagon reporters today .
Gates said the details of what options would be made available to families would be worked out soon .
The new policy reverses a ban put into effect in 1991 by President George H.W. Bush .
But a few exceptions to the policy were made in the years prior to the administration of George W. Bush .
For example , the return to Dover of the flag - draped caskets of the sailors killed in the 2000 attack on the USS Cole was open to media coverage .
VOTE : Should Caskets of Returning War Dead be Photographed ?
Share Your Opinion with ABCNews.com
But criticism of the ban mounted as the number of casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continued to mount , and some contended the Bush administration was trying to hide the human cost of war .
Saying he was " never comfortable " with the ban , Gates launched a review of the ban last summer but left it in place after he was advised that families might feel uncomfortable with media coverage or feel pressure to attend ceremonies at Dover .
Gates said he initiated the latest review after hearing President Obama express concerns about that policy during his first news conference two weeks ago .
Gates acknowledged there was a difference of opinion within the Pentagon about whether a change in the policy was warranted .
" I 'll be perfectly honest about it .
There was a division in the building ... and I sided with those who thought that the issue ought to be up to the families . "
But , he said , whatever differences existed were motivated by a desire " to do what was right by the families of our fallen . "
Families ' Wishes Held Sway
Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , also said the families were a priority in his support of the decision .
" We 've seen so many families go through so much and meeting their needs , their requests in the most dignified , respectful focused way we can was very much a driver for me in supporting this change . "
Gates said the input he received from family members and veterans groups was instrumental in his decision .
" I would say that the reaction we got from the organizations associated with the families strongly reinforced the decision of where I was headed , " he said .
The first images of flag draped coffins from the war in Iraq were published in April 2004 by the Seattle Times , which printed a photograph taken by a military contractor inside of a military aircraft transporting several flag - draped caskets back to the United States .
In 2005 , following a Freedom of Information request , the Pentagon publicly released hundreds more internal photographs of flag - draped coffins being transported aboard military aircraft .

Bottles , lighters shoes and coins were among the objects thrown by the crowd , who were protesting against Israel ’s invasion of Gaza .

It was a like a hunting scene , they wanted to hurt us . ”
Tapiro then spoke to someone from the Israeli embassy : “ They told us that we should leave the country as soon as possible . ”
The team 's ordeal was n't over yet , however , as there was a bomb warning outside the sports arena and a suitcase in a car was blown up - although it turned out to be a false alarm .

A stampede at a football stadium in the Ivory Coast has left 22 people dead .

Former NAACP leader Rev. Joseph Lowery delivered delivered the inaugural ceremony 's benediction for Obama , and used a rather witty poem that had the audience laughing heartily .
He rhymed :
“ We ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked
to give back , when brown can stick around , when yellow will be mellow ,
when the red man can get ahead , man , and when white will embrace what
is right . ”
Our favorite Right Wing screecher Michelle Malkin , no doubt sick to her stomach over Obama 's election , could not resist injecting her venom into the inaugural events .
On her blog she wrote :

.... the benediction ’s
eloquence
was marred by glib racialism .
The “ white would embrace the right ? ”
Who wrote that line ?
Jeremiah Wright ?
And what would Obama ’s grandparents and mother have to say ?
Like I said last night : Feel the post- racialism !
I 'm not sure how anyone could read Lowery 's poem as being racist towards white people given his funny descriptions of Native Americans ( Red Man ) and Asians ( Yellow ) .
We must also remember that Lowery has spent a life time fighting the deep racism in American society , and has done much to help the ' White Man ' embrace what is right ( something he has n't always done on his own accord ) .
Racial divisions still permeate American society , and to pretend otherwise would be foolish .
But then again , we are talking about Michelle Malkin , a Filipino woman who wrote a book arguing the merits of locking up Asians during WW2 .
If you are under 13 years old and protected by a loving family , anything can be fun , even taking refuge from Israeli bombardment in the hell that is the Gaza Strip .
Reem al - Naraib , who is six months ' pregnant , and her husband Sabah fled with their three children , aged 12 , eight and six , from their home near Beit Hanoun , northern Gaza , two - and - a - half miles from the Israeli border , where they had been directly in the line of fire .
Yesterday , they were in a three - room flat on the fourth floor of a tower block near the centre of Gaza City , without water , electricity , light , or any means of communication except a crackling landline .
When The Independent spoke to Mrs al - Naraib , there was constant noise in the background – not made by bombs but by excited children .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" My children , thank God , are not so afraid , " she said .
" When we were living at home , the sound of bombing was a regular thing for us , so they are used to it .
" They run around chasing each other , and they jump on the furniture .
Then my husband tells them stories – good stories , not frightening stories about Jews , children 's stories .
" We sleep in the mornings , and we stay awake at night because the Israelis double their bombing targets at night , and we use the telephone for news of friends and neighbours .
And that 's our life now .
" We hear the bombing , we hear the ambulances , we look out of the window and we see smoke , but we do n't know where it is .
We want to hear about the news , but there is no news .
Even the neighbours have no news .
Each has closed his door .
It 's a war – really a war .
We do n't know what is happening . "
Gaza has been used to shortages since the start of the Israeli blockade , but from the sporadic accounts coming out of the Strip since Israeli tanks moved in after nightfall on Saturday their existence is now a scrabble to find food and basic necessities , amid constant anxiety .
Adding to the physical hardship , there is the stress of knowing so little about what is going on .
In Tel Aviv , volunteers from Physicians for Human Rights were on the telephone all day , trying to learn what they could about conditions in the hospitals .
" Many of the phone lines are down , and those that are working are crackly , " said their director , Hadas Ziv .
" Everyone is indoors .
Each can tell you what is happening in their immediate vicinity , but only that . "
Yesterday , Mrs al - Nuraib went looking for a loaf of bread in the market , but there was none .
Fortunately , there was rice in the cupboard , which she heated over a gas cooker .
But the gas is running low .
The family have not seen a television that works since Friday , and have no radio .
" All Gaza City is without electricity , " said Fikr Shalltoot , programme co-ordinator for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians .

" That means there is no water .
Inside my house this is the fourth day without water .
We can buy a little bit of water to wash ourselves , but we can't have a shower . "
But if conditions are bad for the Gazans trying to live in what passes for normality , they are worse for the injured and bereaved in the understaffed and overcrowded hospitals .
" There were 2,050 hospital beds in Gaza before the air strikes , and the number of injured already exceeds that , " Mr Shalltoot said .
" The injured coming in have been hit by F15 bombs or missiles , not bullets , so you can imagine the injuries they have .
There are thousands of people moving inside the hospitals – medical teams , and people coming to find out about missing relatives , coming in off the street , and some of the injured are lying on the floor .
Some are women or children .
Some have lost limbs .
" There are not enough stretchers , " he said .
" The hospitals are short of sheets , blankets , and surgical gowns .
There is no gauze , so they are using cotton , which sticks to wounds .
They can't sterilise clothes for the operating theatre .
They are using the wrong - size syringes . "
Mr Shalltoot added : " I have seen remains lying outside the mortuaries , because the mortuaries can't cope with the number who have been killed .
Neighbours come directly to the mortuaries to find out if the missing have been killed .
If they do n't find them at the mortuaries they look in the beds and the corridors of the hospitals .
If the remains are recognised by friends or relatives , they are taken away . "
Dr Mads Gilbert , a Norwegian doctor working at Gaza 's Al - Shifa hospital , said : " We are doing surgery around the clock .
The hospital is completely overcrowded and we 're seeing injuries that you do n't want to see in this world .
A child just came in and we had to amputate both arms and legs .
It 's like hell here now . "
Mark Pilgrim :
SMIL is a W3C standard ; the most recent revision , SMIL 3.0 , was just published in December 2008 .
If you printed out the SMIL 3.0 specification on US - Letter - sized paper , it would weigh in at 395 pages .
So do n’t do that .
An earlier draft of The Stimulus would have given the government the right to claw back any 2008 TARP - firm bonus larger than $ 100,000 and limit all future bonuses to $ 400,000 .
This would have been quite a jolt .
The new version of The Stimulus , which is now law , is not as punitive .
It also offers an easy workaround .
The law now limits bonuses of TOP execs ( 25 at most , not ALL ) to 1/3rd of their total annual compensation .
In other words , if you make a $ 1 million salary , you can get a bonus of $ 500,000 .
This will obviously eliminate the $ 25 million paydays that have become the norm in recent years ( including last year at Merrill Lynch ) .
By focusing on " bonuses " instead of total compensation , however , the government has of course opened a loophole wide enough to fly a 747 through .
What will happen to 2009 compensation at TARP banks ?
Salaries will rise and bonuses will shrink as a percentage of total compensation .
Some movement in this direction might actually be healthy .
Shifting total comp away from bonuses toward salaris will encourage less risk - taking .
It will also probably make the firm 's less profitable in fat years than the would otherwise be .
But if this means the firms will also survive the next financial cataclysm , it 's probably not a bad thing .
And , of course , if / when TARP banks do manage to pay off government aid , bonuses can go through the roof again .
More detail on the bonus limits here >
Next week , Americans are being invited to take part in what could become the largest act of civil disobedience against global warming in the country 's history .
People are protesting at the coal - fired power plant that powers legislators on Capitol Hill in Washington DC .
Cynics may say it 's about time Americans joined the action .
The fact is that too many Americans have been bamboozled for too long by a campaign of disinformation about the science of climate change .
Many still think the whole question of mankind 's role in global warming is disputed in scientific circles ( I expect the comments beneath this blog will soon demonstrate this point ) .
Hopefully , that science battle is slowly being won .
But now the big greenwash is coming from another direction .
Now , we have a technology battle .
The people who told us for years how climate change was a myth now say it is all true – but something called " clean coal " can fix it .
It 's hard to keep track of the differing organisations behind this .
First there was Americans for Balanced Energy Choices .
Last year that merged with the Center for Energy and Economic Development to create the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity ( ACCCE ) .
That body is now headlining as something called America 's Power .
The one thing they have got is money .
Money to try and persuade us that coal is good , coal is green and coal is the solution to America 's energy needs .
The ACCCE spent $ 38 m last year buying TV , newspaper and magazine space to persuade Americans that coal can be clean and carbon - free .
The money mostly came from its members in the coal mining , transportation and burning industries .
You do n't see much coal in these ads , though in December its website did feature some singing lumps of coal called the " clean coal carollers " .
Sadly they went shy about that and the carollers now seem to be on indeterminate holiday leave .
The money does n't all go into airtime and column inches , of course .
According to SourceWatch , almost $ 1 m goes to pay the salary of its president and chief executive officer Stephen L Miller .
But the big PR question , the one that must earn Miller his remuneration , is how to rationalise this oxymoron " clean coal " .
How to square this carefully created image with inconvenient facts about the fuel 's huge carbon footprint – greater than other fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas .
The genius is that they do n't really try .
Blink and you might miss it .
That word " clean " is highly flexible .
It can mean what you want it to mean .
So for instance , ACCCE claims that modern coal power plants are " 70 % cleaner " .
It sounds good .
It sounds like coal really is cleaning up .
Perhaps the greenies are behind the times .
Call off the demo .
But check more closely and you 'll notice that the ACCCE does n't mention which gases are covered by this claim .
In fact , the industry has cut emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides under acid-rain legislation enacted years ago .
That 's what the 70 % refers to .
But it has not cut planet - warming carbon dioxide emissions .
Its other key strategy is to promote carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) .
That is , the idea of catching carbon dioxide before it goes up the stack of a power plant , and burying it out of harm 's way underground – forever .
It promotes the idea and not the technology , because there is currently no such technology .
But ACCCE has faith .
It does n't argue that CCS can solve coal 's environment problems .
If it did , it might have to defend its case .
Instead , it says " we believe that American can continue to make great progress in improving environmental quality while at the same time enjoying the benefits from using domestic energy sources like coal …
In a word : we believe in technology . "
Good for them , but technologists generally rely on more than faith .
As I have reported here before , this technology is scientifically conjectural , especially at the storage end .
And even on an optimistic view of its feasibility , it is at least two decades and several tens of billions of research and development dollars away from actual commercial operation on any scale .
Do n't take my word for it .
Check out the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's study on the matter .
Or this study by the International Energy Agency .
Bear in mind these reports were written before the US government last year pulled out of FutureGen , its only large - scale R&D programme for carbon - capture technology .
An industry confident of the technology 's future might have been expected to plug the funding gap and keep right on going .
But not so far .
An analysis of ACCCE 's members in December by the Center for American Progress found that their total investment in R&D for carbon capture and storage in recent years added up to a total of $ 3.5 bn , compared with profits for one year of $ 57bn .
Sorry , but belief is n't enough .
Put up or shut up .
They should be laughed out of court .
But what is most worrying is the political traction the clean - coal story is gaining .
Sadly , President Obama may be part of the faith brigade .
During the election campaign last year , he was quoted telling the people of Michigan that " you ca n't tell me we can't figure out how to burn coal that we mine right here in the USA and make it work . "
It 's not a great quote , but it 's the best the ACCCE could come up with , and they have run ads with it .
The trouble with CCS right now is that it is being sold as an imminent fix when it is very far from that .
And it is being sold as a reason to carry on supporting the coal industry .
After all , the argument runs , if we pull the plug on new coal - fired power plants now , then how will they fund the R&D that could deliver clean coal one day ?
That is a very dangerous argument indeed .
It is the reason why Nasa climate scientist James Hansen is supporting the demonstration in DC , and insists that no new coal - fired power stations should be built unless and until all their carbon dioxide can be captured and buried forever .
Sadly , for too many policy - makers , the idea that we can have coal and tackle climate change at the same time is too good to miss .
Sadly , it is too good to be true .
• How many more green scams , cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there ?

Intense diplomatic efforts between the US , EU and Arab countries to reach agreement on an international response to the crisis in Gaza appeared to be deadlocked last night , with no sign of unanimity over the appropriate way forward .
Despite the urgency of events on the ground , with the death toll approaching 700 in 12 days of fighting , dozens of Israeli tanks reported to be on the move in the Gaza Strip and air strikes continuing , the international community was unable to break the stalemate .
Two separate proposals were on the table at the UN in New York last night , with neither able to garner the necessary support .
The first , a draft UN resolution proposed by Libya , demanded an immediate , permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and expressed " grave concern at the crisis faced by the Palestinian people " .
It has widespread backing from Arab nations , but would certainly be vetoed by the US as Israel 's leading ally .
The second proposal was a draft UN statement largely written by the UK , with US and French cooperation , also expressing " grave concern at the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza " and calling for both the Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations to be protected .
The second document has US backing , but has been opposed by a minority of Arab countries , who see it as a weak compromise and who want to hold out for a full UN security council resolution .
The failure to reach agreement is becoming increasingly embarrassing for the UN , which needs to be able to show resolute and unanimous action if it is to have any real influence on the conflict .
Efforts are likely to be redoubled today , with the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , the foreign secretary , David Miliband , and other diplomats remaining in New York in the hope of breaking the stalemate .
Egypt 's foreign minister , Ahmed Abul Gheit , revealed that a high - level Israeli delegation would arrive in Cairo today for technical discussions on the details of a possible ceasefire plan .
Earlier speculation that talks would ensue between Israel and Hamas in Cairo were discounted .
Israel and Hamas yesterday both " welcomed " - but neither accepted - an earlier Egyptian - French initiative to end the fighting in the Gaza Strip .
For the first time the US urged Israel to say yes to the ceasefire call , with Rice pressing the Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , by phone .
US attention seemed to boost the chances of progress .
" Our goal must be the stabilisation and normalisation of life in Gaza , " said Rice .
But any ceasefire " has to be a solution that does not allow the rearmament of Hamas " .
Barack Obama , the president - elect , broke his silence on the Gaza fighting to pledge that he would " engage immediately " with the Middle East when he takes office on 20 January .
Earlier , Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , was forced to retract a claim that Israel and the Palestinians were both ready to sign up to the initiative .
Israeli officials said that Egypt 's president , Hosni Mubarak , was seeking an initial 48 - hour ceasefire , during which the finishing touches would be put to the plan .
Israel said it accepted the " principles " of the plan but opposed a preliminary truce and wanted all the details of an agreement completed first .
Khaled Meshaal , the Islamist movement 's Damascus - based political leader , told a Russian envoy that Hamas rejected " capitulatory " conditions .
Ahmed Yusuf , a Hamas spokesman in Gaza , said in an article for the Guardian 's Comment is Free website : " Hamas welcomes the Egyptian - French initiative .
We recognise that it contains many positive elements but also elements that need more careful consideration . "
For the moment the only Israeli concession has been to allow the delivery of aid for Palestinians - beginning yesterday - with a three - hour halt to bombing .
Fighting resumed soon afterwards .
Agreeing humanitarian access and a truce is the first stage .
But the second and far more complex element of any deal will be agreement to police Gaza 's southern border to prevent Hamas smuggling in weapons once the fighting is over .
Diplomats following the negotiating process warned last night that the first part cannot work without the second for any length of time because a truce and humanitarian access do not address any of the fundamental concerns that led Israel to launch its Operation Cast Lead offensive on 27 December .
Israel insists the key to ending the crisis is permanent measures to monitor and destroy tunnels under the Egypt - Gaza border .
Elements of the Egyptian - French plan and the continuing discussions at the UN in New York include calls for an international presence on the Egyptian side of the border , the so - called " Philadelphi corridor " .
Various sources have reported that there would also be a naval presence to patrol the Gaza shoreline , perhaps commanded by the French .
A small naval force was part of the arrangements for a ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah .
Western officials say any border security arrangement would require US technical aid to Egypt as well as changes to the Israeli - Egyptian peace treaty of 1979 to change military dispositions in Sinai .
Crucially , missing from the plan so far is an agreed mechanism for Israel to lift the Gaza blockade , Hamas 's principal demand , though it does mention reopening border crossings .
Diplomats said there was hard bargaining over whether the UN statement should use the phrase " full and permanent " with respect to the crossings .
Peace plan proposals
• Forty - eight - hour ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza .
Israel is opposed to this .
• International presence on Egyptian side of border .
This could include US combat engineers , Turkish troops and EU technical assistance .
Possibly naval presence to patrol Gaza shoreline , perhaps commanded by the French .
• US technical aid to Egypt as well as changes to Israeli - Egyptian peace treaty of 1979 to alter military dispositions in Sinai .
• Missing from any plan so far is any agreed mechanism for Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza , Hamas 's key demand .
If I play video games they 're usually pretty low tech ones .
One of the few games I miss from the old days is Duke Nukem , and I 'm talking about the Duke before he went 3D .
If you have an old DOS game that you 'd like to run , or for that matter any old DOS program , check out DOSBox .
Even if you do n't have any DOS programs that you 'd like to run , you might want to try downloading some of the old DOS games that are now available free online .
DOSBox is a DOS emulator that runs under Linux as well as OS X and Windows .
To quote from the website :
DOSBox is a DOS - emulator that uses the SDL - library which makes DOSBox very easy to port to different platforms .
DOSBox has already been ported to many different platforms , such as Windows , BeOS , Linux , MacOS X ... DOSBox also emulates CPU:286/386 realmode / protected mode , Directory FileSystem / XMS / EMS , Tandy / Hercules / CGA /EGA/VGA/VESA graphics , a SoundBlaster / Gravis Ultra Sound card for excellent sound compatibility with older games ...
DOSBox is fairly easy to use , if it 's not included in your distro's repo ( openSuSE has it ) , download it here .
Once it 's installed just type dosbox .
When the DOSBox window appears the first thing you have to do is mount the directory that contains your DOS program as a DOS drive .
You do this by typing a mount command in the DOSBox window , for example I did :
mount c ~/ bindirs / dukenukem / DUKE
To start your DOS program change to the drive that you just mounted and type the name of the program :
c : dn1.exe
And now you 're playing Duke Nukem , or possibly doing something useful .
If you do n't have a copy of Duke Nukem you can download it here .
I already had a copy that I had saved years ago but I did download a copy of Duke Nukem 2 .
This required a few installation steps before I was able to run .
Under Linux :
$ cd ~/bindirs / dukenukem $ mkdir DUKE2 $ cd DUKE2 $ unzip ~/tar/d/dnukem2.zip $ dosbox
Then in the DOSBox window :
mount c ~/ bindirs / dukenukem / DUKE2 c : install.bat nukem2.exe
Note that this actually ended up installing it in ~/ bindirs / dukenukem / DUKE2 / DUKE2 but this is easy enough to move around from Linux to eliminate the extra DUKE2 from the path .
Running on a Quad Core Phenom , DOSBox 's performance was good : I encountered no performance problems with video or sound .
I also noticed that while running it did n't appear to require any more CPU than any other program I tend to use so I suspect performance should be good on most modern systems .
A Very Ramones Christmas

It ’s a little late in the day , but it is still Christmas .
And it ’s not like there ’s ever a bad time for the Ramones …
Football is bad for your health .
I 'm not talking about those of us who will watch the Superbowl with one hand in a bag of chips and the other clutching a beer .
I mean the people we 'll be watching , many of whose bodies will sustain the equivalent of a car wreck this coming Sunday -- on top of the many concussions and breaks they 've already experienced this season .
This is nothing new , of course , but results from a recently released ( and not coincidentally timed ) study from the Boston University School of Medicine indicate that the damage may be worse than previously thought .
Examining the brains of dead , relatively young former NFL players , scientists discovered damage similar to " what might be found in the brain of an 80 - year - old with dementia . "
Football is bad for your health , but it is good for the bottom line , which might explain why the National Football League 's response to this latest study is reminiscent of the best work from tobacco company flaks in their heyday :
" Hundreds of thousands of people have played football and other sports without experiencing any problem of this type and there continues to be considerable debate within the medical community on the precise long - term effects of concussions and how they relate to other risk factors . "
True to tobacco company form , the NFL even has its own internally conducted " studies , " completed by real live bought - and - paid - for doctors , to indicate that multiple concussions really are n't that harmful .
Why the stonewalling ?
" The league is well - known in legal circles for tenaciously fighting even minor disability claims , " wrote ESPN 's Peter Keating about similar obfuscation after an autopsy of former player Andre Waters , who killed himself in 2007 , showed he had the brain of an 85 - year - old , " and the last thing it wants to face is a flood of lawsuits by athletes who suffered head injuries and kept playing . "
A New York Times article weeks after Waters ' suicide suggested that the NFL not only keeps tight lips about injuries , it expects players to do the same .
I suppose that 's to be understood , given the legal risk .
Never mind that refusing to acknowledge the problem is only likely to contribute to future injuries and death .
Look , kid , do ya wanna play in the big leagues or do n't ya ?
Is there a solution ?
How about ginormous padding and helmets , akin to those faux Sumo wrestler outfits ?
Perhaps making players wear weights in their shoes so they do n't have as much velocity when they tackle one another ?
Ironically , maybe the best solution is to eliminate helmets and pads altogether .
As Edward Tenner noted in Why Things Bite Back , helmets have had the unintended consequence of producing more serious injuries on the field , because when players know they are protected , they can brutalize one another with abandon .
Which is why , let 's be honest , a good many of us like to watch .
But perhaps as the physical consequences of on - field brutality become more apparent , the NFL will begin to hear a voice it 's actually willing to listen to -- that of the fans .
The man , who did not wish to be named , said groups of protesters had been split up by the police in an attempt to divert them as they tried to march to the Israeli Embassy .
He said : " Both sides were getting rowdy and somebody smashed the windows of a Starbucks down past The Ritz but I 'm not sure which side it was . "
NBC News officially announced on Sunday morning that David Gregory , its longtime correspondent , would become the permanent moderator of “ Meet the Press , ” the network ’s Sunday political discussion program .
It had been expected that Mr. Gregory would replace Tim Russert , who died of a heart attack in June .
The network used the appearance by President - Elect Barack Obama on Sunday to name Mr. Gregory , who will start next week .
The interim moderator , Tom Brokaw , formally introduced the 38 - year - old Mr. Gregory at the end of his interview with Mr. Obama .

Mr. Brokaw announced that this Sunday would be his last as what he called “ the temporary moderator ” filling in for his longtime friend , Mr. Russert , and identified Mr. Gregory as both another great journalist and personal friend .
Some science fiction novels can't be translated into films , but others are perfect for big screen enjoyment .
Here are our nominations for the next big scifi movies , ripped from the pages of your favorite books .

Unfortunately , there are a number of adaptations that do n't meet or really fail expectations .
Alan Moore 's comic books come to mind .
But the news that Roland Emmerich might be directing Isaac Asimov 's Foundation Trilogy , and that Scott Derrickson is set to direct an adaptation of Hyperion is n't exactly promising either .
So here 's our antidote : A short list of books that would likely make good films ( and television series ) that would succeed in theaters , and be fun to watch .
Mars , Ben Bova
Ben Bova is a solid name in the SF genre , and Mars is a book that can easily be translated to the big screen .
The premise is fairly simple and straightforward : 25 astronauts from Earth go to Mars , land , and begin exploring .
There 's the usual drama and excitement present here , but what this book really conveys is the sheer beauty and majesty of the Red Planet , something that really has n't been done with films such as Red Planet and Mission to Mars , to name a couple recent ones .

Kindred , Octavia Butler
This is a time travel story by the late Octavia Butler , one that would be a good candidate for adaptation .
The story revolves around an African - American woman in 1976 Los Angeles who is pulled back in time by her white ancestor , and has to reconcile the two eras , while working to ensure her own survival .
Fast - paced and topical , this is the type of book that could do extremely well as a smart action - adventure movie .

Soon , I Will Be Invincible , Austin Grossman
This book has been optioned for a film , and reading through it in a day , I can see why :
It 's exciting , it 's easy to get into and read and it's got a neat and tidy plot .
There are archetypal villains , superhero teams with plenty of backstory material for tie-ins and years of comics and a fun storyline .
But there is also a realistic approach to the world of superheroes , something that Hancock proved was marketable .
I suspect that whoever holds the movie rights to this book will be watching Watchmen 's performance at the box office .

Probability Moon , Nancy Kress
This book is essentially what Stargate SG - 1 should have been .
The novel is set amidst an interplanetary war between humanity and the Fallers , an aggressive alien race .
The main action occurs on World , where a human team discovers an artificial moon made from an ancient alien tech ( which also allows for interplanetary travel ) that might hold the key to humanity 's survival .
The plot is nothing new as far as movies go , but it is straightforward , interesting and a solid read .
Visually , this could be stunning , with exploration on a planet and in space .
There are also two sequels , Probability Sun and Probability Space , which could become sequels if the first movie does well .

Altered Carbon , Richard K. Morgan
Richard Morgan 's first book is one that would be difficult to translate to the screen , but if done right , it would be a fantastic film .
Set five hundred years into the future , the story revolves around Takeshi Kovacs , a former soldier , in a world where people can download their consciousness into other bodies .
Kovacs is set to investigate a wealthy man 's supposed suicide , and he uncovers a conspiracy that has wide - ranging impact .
It 's a hardboiled cyberpunk - ish crime noir novel with enough action and violence to keep viewers excited .
The book has been optioned as a film with James McTeigue attached as director - if this happens it 's good news because he worked on Attack of the Clones , The Matrix trilogy , Dark City and directed V for Vendetta .

Ringworld , Larry Niven
Ringworld , the tale of a dying halo world around a distant sun , is an absolute classic in the SF genre .
The story is one of epic proportions , of exploration , romance , destiny and space opera – all good elements for a science fiction film .
There is a lot of potential here , and a lot of possibilities for tone and content , with a direct and exciting storyline that covers high tech space travel to abandoned cities , feudal tribes , fantastic aliens , but also bigger themes of one 's place in the world and similar notions .
Plus , there would be some of the best visuals that you 're likely to ever see on the big screen .
Rumors of a film have existed since it was announced by the Niven in 2001 , with the SciFi Channel announcing in 2004 that there would be a miniseries based on the book , but there has been little news since then .

City of Pearl , Karen Traviss
Karen Traviss burst onto the SF scene with her first novel , City of Pearl , which takes place in the near future with an expedition to Cavanagh 's Star to reconnect with a colony for political and economic purposes .
While there , the main characters are launched into a situation that involves first contact , interplanetary warfare and scientific discovery .
This first book in the series is the most standalone , and could easily be made into a film , with the possibility of sequels .
There is action , potentially cool CGI scenes and intelligent storytelling here that could work well on the screen , visually and storywise .

Coyote , Allen M. Steele
Coyote is a book that could take up several films without breaking a sweat .
Steele tells a sweeping tale of political intrigue , planetary science and the building of a new society over the course of several sections , each a fairly self - contained entry in a larger story .
The first section sees a future America ( The United Republic of America ) , a pseudo - Fascist society that has sunk a good part of the economy into a mission that would colonize another world - Coyote .
This first section alone could make a fantastic film , as could the next several stories as the new colonists take control of the ship and mission and build a new world .
Not all of the stories could really be adapted , but there are enough there to make a very good franchise of films .
Steele has already jumped the gun by posting a short ‘ trailer ' for a movie on his website .

The Icarus Hunt , Timothy Zahn
Timothy Zahn is arguably best known for his Heir to the Empire trilogy that essentially started off the Star Wars expanded universe ( which would easily make for the next trilogy of Star Wars films that would no doubt top the prequel trilogy ) , but his non -SW books are also good reads .
His standalone novel , The Icarus Hunt , follows the crew of a ship hired to transport a secret cargo across the galaxy , while a large corporation is set on eliminating them , hoping to force them out of business .
Corporate crimes in space ?
We want to see this movie .

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell , Susanna Clarke
Where some books are fairly simple and easy to adapt , this book just is n't .
It 's complicated , daunting and deliberate , but it contains one of the most fantastic stories that I have had yet to read .
It would take quite a bit of work to really get the essence of the book , but it could be edited creatively to capture some of the major plots - or made into a BBC miniseries .
Set in an alternative 19th century England during the Napoleonic wars , this book features magicians fighting for their country , sorcerers who feud in drawing rooms , and the return of magic to England .
The Lord of the Rings proved that what was thought to be an unfilmable tome could be turned into a fantastic set of films , while The Prestige has shown that late 19th century tales of magic can be both melancholy and fantastical .
In 2004 , the book was optioned , but the project seems to have fallen by the wayside .
Whether ODF will wither or weather
depends on us as we work together .
The question is where we should go : whither ?
The answer is clear at once .
The question of “ whither ” is not so dense ,
and is easy to answer when we start with “ whence ? ” .
Of the topic today
I will no longer delay nor dither to say
whether we will whither or weather
but will now give you my 2 - cents .
It turns out the Left 4 Dead demo contains more surprises than slathering zombie hordes .
Astute players of the Left 4 Dead demo have uncovered an intriguing Team Fortress 2
Easter egg included in the game that hints at several awesome possibilities coming down the pike .
Is Valve 's sneakiness a practical joke or something more ?
Located within the first apartment in the Left 4 Dead demo 's initial campaign , a box of " Chocobites " cereal offers some potentially revealing information .
Like all wholesome , sugary brands of breakfast cereal , the box purports to include a prize .
In this case , it 's an 8 - inch toy action figure bearing the likeness of one of the nine character classes in Team Fortress 2 .
Curiously , the box suggests we " collect all 10 " - a difficult task when there 's currently only nine classes in the game .
Regular TF2 updates have slowed down , while some members of the development team lent a hand to get Left 4 Dead out the door .
New character upgrades are coming in 2009 , and the possibility of entirely new classes to follow is not a far stretch of the imagination .
Could this Easter egg be a teaser for a yet - to - be announced 10th class ?
Quite possibly .
Alternately , it could signify plans for TF2 action figures to launch in the future .
Either case is plausible .
We 'll just have to wait for Valve to make its next official move .
An American prison inmate has sued Intel for $ 5 billion , insisting the chip maker 's Core 2 Duo chip and its virtualization technology are based on trade secrets pilfered from him by way of Apple supremo Steve Jobs .
In court papers recently filed with an Oregon - based US District Court , 43 - year - old Matthew Robert Young claims that he shared these trade secrets with His Steveness in 2003 and that Jobs quickly spilled the beans to the world 's largest chip maker .
Young - currently a prisoner at the Snake River Correctional Institution in Ontario , Oregon - demands a jury trial and an " extrodinary hearing " [ sic ] , where he will prove by " factual demonstration " that he is " the only person in the world at present who knows how to make both the Core - 2 Duo micro processor and [ its ] Virtual Technology work . "
In March or April of 2003 , court papers say , Young sent Steve Jobs designs and schematics for a " Hacker proof , Virus proof Computer with Multiphase Microprocessors " that he liked to call Lancelot .
He was hoping Jobs would help develop and market the designs - or buy them outright for $ 250 million .
Apparently , Jobs never replied .
But later that year , according to the filing , the Apple cult leader shared Young 's plans with Chipzilla .
" The exact nature and extent of the Agreement between Mr. Jobs , and Intel Corporation is not known , " the filing reads .
" It remains however a fact that Mr. Steve Jobs , Defrauded Intel Corporation , by not totally Disclosing to , and Informing Intel Corporation just where exactly he got it , and from whom he actually did get the Designs and Schematics for the Dual - Core / Core - 2 Duo Microprocessor , and Virtual Technology . "
In June 2006 , the filing continues , Intel senior veep Pat Gelsinger appeared in The Oregonian holding a motherboard , and Young says he can prove this motherboard was manufactured from his stolen intellectual property .
After learning that Intel made an awful lot of money from microchips in 2006 , Young says , he sent his Lancelot designs to Gelsinger and company - along with the following missive :
Dear Intel Corporation : Does this look familiar ?
Well it should .
It is the Hacker Proof , Virus Proof Computer , that I invented , which I Call [ LANCELOT ] .
I showed it to Steve Jobs , at Apple Computer , and asked him for Two Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars , he took it to you at Intel , and you built it but you do not know how to turn it on .
So here is what you are going to do .
You are going to Agree to pay me Seventy Percent ( 70 % ) every thing that You Gross Profit , and then I will tell you how to turn
It on and make it do what I Designed it to do .
You have 30 days to Respond , on Bonded paper , with your Signature written in Blue ink , or I am going to send copies
Of my schematics to AMD ( Advance Micro Devices ) and Tell them how it works for next to nothing .
Young says Intel " responded exactly in the manner [ he ] DEMANDED ... meeting the required conditions , and obligations placed . "
As proof , he supplies a letter printed on bonded paper and signed by an Intel employee :
We have received the materials you provided to us in connection with the above referenced matter .
After consideration and review of the submitted documents , Intel has determined not to pursue this matter .
Thank you for your interest in Intel Corporation and for bringing this opportunity to our attention .
Young acknowledges , however , that Intel did not agree to that 70 per cent profit cut .
But he points out that with its letter - and later correspondence - the company never denied that or even challenged that he was the original creator of the company 's dual core processor .
And so , with his court filing , Matthew Robert Young " prays that the United States District Court will Issue a Judgment Awarding " him $ 5 billion .
Yes , $ 5 billion - the same sum Dylan Stephen Jayne demanded from Google for " crimes against humanity . "
To prove Intel 's liability , Young cites Romans Chapter 3 , verses 19 and 20 of " the supreme law of the LORD GOD OF HOST " :
v. 19 Now we know that what things so ever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God. v. 20
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
" So it follows , " Young says , " that liability is upon to those who are under the Law and who have knowledge of it . " ®

In 1962 Sean Connery stars in Dr. No and the spy genre takes over the world of entertainment .
Within ten short years several more Bond films follows and a host of second rates clones follow — from TV shows like The Saint to comedy films like Matt Helm .
In the swinging 60s the two things that make the spy genre special are guns and go go girls :
Bond has a license to kill and the spy genre would n’t be what it was without the sex and violence .
During this era Patrick McGoohan was a successful actor as the star of Danger Man which ran as Secret Agent Man in the United States .
But after a few years McGoohan grew tired of the show and was offered the chance to do something new by Lew Grade of ITC Entertainment .
So McGoohan gave his pitch — and it was pure genius :
First we start off with a secret agent character who does n’t carry a gun and never gets the girl .
Instead of a spy at the top of his game cavorting around the world — you have a man who is a mere captive .
And the driving plot is n’t a black - and - white Spy vs .
Spy cartoon with good vs. evil — instead you have an ambiguous distrust of all authority .
And then the final touch : Instead of a clear cut ending , but you have an abstract crescendo which will keep people talking for years .
In short with his concept for the Prisoner Patrick McGoohan turns James Bond on his head , and in the process makes what could be argued to be one of the best television shows of the 20th Century .
In fact one could argue that unless you watched this show you could never fully understand the Cold War itself .
Although like any good drama McGoohan touches on so much more than that — episodes of the show delve into every topic from the mechanisms of a democratic state to Marshall McLuhan ’s theories on the global village .
And even on a superficial level what other series could get away with ending the show with the Beatles tune Love is All You Need ?
It ’s for this reason that we ’ll miss Patrick McGoohan — and while I wish there were more like him , we ’re all very luck that he left us such an amazing work of art .
Be seeing you …
[ Haskell - cafe ] Retrospective on 2008 ?
I 've been kicking the idea around of a 2008 retrospective .
How did we do this year ?
After all , it has been a dramatic growth period ( we 're close to 600 people a day in #haskell now , for example , and many new faces ! )
Some ideas : * 10 best new libraries * 10 best new apps * 10 most influential blog posts * best new library by category Determing this is an interesting task .
To start with , I scanned hackage .
Some stats : * Hackage currently holds 914 applications and libraries .
* 601 of them were released on Hackage this year : http://galois.com/~dons/tmp/new-releases-2008.txt
Which is rather impressive , I have to say .
We 're getting better at the production of new libraries and apps ( I imagine all the releases are feeding into new apps and libs in new areas not easily reachable before ) .
The last couple of months , we 're averaging around 10 uploads a day , in fact .
You can see the upload growth here , http://galois.com/~dons/images/hackage-daily-graph.png
We 've fundamentally transformed the suitability of Haskell and GHC in a range of domains through the production of these apps and libraries .
Well done everyone !
Now , as for determining which new things make the top 10 , a chance to apply some heuristics ?
( Most voted on ?
Most downloaded ?
Most depended upon by other things ? ) .
Any thoughts ?
Anyone have their own top 10 list ?
Or other key events of the year ?

When we launched the Obameter a week ago , we said we would periodically revisit our rulings on President Obama 's campaign promises to see if an item needed to be updated .
We figured that occasionally we 'd even have to change a Promise Kept to a Compromise or a Promise Broken because of new information .
That 's what we 're doing today .
On his first full day in office , Obama signed an executive order that toughened rules for former lobbyists , requiring them to wait two years before serving in an agency which they lobbied .
That seemed like a slam dunk on his promise , and we quickly rated it Promise Kept .
But we 've already had cause to revisit the issue .
The order includes a waiver clause and the Obama administration has indicated it wants to give a waiver to a lobbyist for a big defense contractor who has been nominated as deputy secretary of defense .
For now , we find the waiver clause is enough for us to move the Obameter from Promise Kept to Compromise , and we 'll be watching to see if it merits additonal action later .
Read our entire item on Obama 's Campaign Promise No. 240 , " Tougher rules against revolving door for lobbyists and former officials . "
The bond markets seem to be betting that emergency action by central banks will take a very long time to work , if it works at all .
By cutting to zero , the Fed has come close to shutting down the US ' repo ' market that plays a crucial role in providing liquidity .
It has caused havoc to the $ 3.5 trillion money markets - as the Bank of Japan , burned by experienced , had warned .
It has become even harder for banks to raise money .
Some argue that extreme monetary policy is already doing more harm than good .
So .
In JavaScript , an “ object ” is a set of “ properties ” : associations from strings to values .
A method is just a property whose value is a function .
Functions are called like “ foo( ) ” , properties are accessed like “ bar.foo ” , and methods are called like “ bar.foo ( ) ” .
Looks straightforward enough , right ?
Now , how does a method access the state of its object ?
Without inheritance , you could just have the method functions of a given object all close over some variables ; but JavaScript does have prototype inheritance , so the necessary access is provided by binding the variable “ this ” , in the method body , to the object the method was invoked on .
And when does this happen ?
When you use the method call syntax . bar.foo( ) is not the same as
var m = bar.foo ; m( ) ;
( It is the same as m.call ( bar ) — call is a method on function objects which invokes them with this bound — but that 's beside the point . )
So , the syntax is non-compositional .
Employers , who as recently as October said they were barely modifying their salary budgets for 2009 , have changed their tune in December , this time bringing some workers ' projected annual pay raises to a low not seen in three decades .
Overall , workers are now projected to receive average annual merit increases of 3 % next year , according to a new survey from Lincolnshire , Ill. - based Hewitt Associates Inc .
When polled in October , employers said they had already lowered their budgets to 3.6 % from 3.8 % in July .

Two University of Toronto quantum physicists , Jeff Lundeen and Aephraim Steinberg , say they have shown that Hardy 's paradox , a proposal that has confounded physicists and science journalists trying to explain it since the 1990s , can be both confirmed and resolved .
So take one more quantum problem out of the realm of ' impossible .
'
Hardy 's Paradox explained ( poorly ) is that when a positron , antiparticle of an electron , and an electron go through the interferometers ( see image below ) simultaneusly , the two particles should meet in an " annihilation area " and destroy one another , but Hardy showed something else : quantum theory predicts that both particle and antiparticle could disturb , yet fail to annihilate , each other in the overlapping arms .
Why ?
Because in the quantum world they can be both in and not in the overlapping arms .
" For nearly a century , the widespread interpretation of quantum mechanics suggests that everything is uncertain until it is observed , and that observation inevitably alters reality , " says Professor Steinberg .
" However , in the 1990s , a technique known as ' interaction - free measurement ' seemed to promise the ability to ' see without looking , ' as a Scientific American article put it at the time .
But when Lucien Hardy proposed that one could never reliably make inferences about past events which had n't been directly observed , a paradox emerged which suggested that whenever one attempted to reason about the past in this way they would be led into error .
"
Over the course of nearly two years of work , Steinberg and then - student Jeff Lundeen , now a research associate at the National Research Council of Canada , built a complicated quantum optical experiment and developed new theoretical tools .
Thanks to the multiple existences of particles , they can simultaneously be in and yet not in the overlapping arms .
Quantum theory allows an improbable yet entirely possible outcome that makes no sense .
This is Hardy 's paradox .
In essence , they combined Hardy 's Paradox with a new theory known as weak measurement proposed by Tel Aviv University physicist Yakir Aharonov , showing that in one sense , one can indeed talk about the past , resolving the paradox .
Weak measurement is a tool whereby the presence of a detector is less than the level of uncertainty around what is being measured , so that there is an imperceptible impact on the experiment .
"
We found that all of the seemingly paradoxical conclusions in Hardy 's Paradox can , in fact , be experimentally verified , " says Steinberg , " but that the use of weak measurement removes the contradiction . "
" Until recently , it seemed impossible to carry out Hardy 's proposal in practice , let alone to confirm or resolve the paradox , " he says .
" We have finally been able to do so , and to apply Aharonov 's methods to the problem , showing that there is a way , even in quantum mechanics , in which one can quite consistently discuss past events even after they are over and done .
Weak measurement finds what is there without disturbing it .

The Grand Canyon , United States
A steep gorge by the Colorado River , Arizona in United States , this has the most enjoyable scenery .
It is 277 miles in length , 4 to 18 miles in width and about a mile in depth .
Scientists are of the opinion that the canyon has been created by the Colorado River over a six million year period .
Native Americans built settlements in the caves within the canyon before the emigration of Europeans .
It was also considered to be a site of pilgrimage by the Pueblo people .
The first recorded visit to the Grand Canyon by the Europeans was in 1869 .
Although , it is not the deepest canyon in the world , it is known for its extremely huge size and beautifully intricate landscape .
The Grand Canyon National Park is said to be one of the first National Parks in the United States and attracts more than five million visitors a year .
Weather conditions in the Grand Canyon vary a great deal between seasons as well as elevation .
While winter snow is experienced by the higher elevated forested rims , the inner gorge has a desert temperature because of the low elevation .
The Great Barrier Reef , Australia
One of the natural wonders of the world , the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Australia is the world ’s largest coral reef .
It has the distinction of being placed in the World Heritage as well as the National Heritage lists .
With more than 600 islands and coral cays , the reef covers more than 300,000 sq. km .
Corals make up the several reefs and cays and are responsible for a huge variety of sea life in the reef ; including green turtles , several varieties of whales and dolphins , dugong , about 4000 types of mollusk , 1500 different species of fish as well as a beautiful colored bird life with 200 species .
The Great Reef Marine Park is a huge tourist attraction with more than a couple of million tourists visiting the area each year .
Sporting includes activities such as reef sailing , scuba diving and snorkeling amongst several others .
Cape Town , South Africa
Aptly called “ heaven on earth , ” this beautiful town at the tip of the African continent , with small roads surrounded by huge mountains , makes a person feel small ; showing how marvelous and dominating nature can actually be .
Former Danity Kane member Aubrey O�d Day has dropped her clothes for Playboy and its a pretty nice spread if you ask me .

“ I do n’t know how you can weather this if you ca n’t roll . ”
Much of the history of the American West is based on stories of booms and the almost inevitable bust that follows .
The land is dotted with decaying remnants of towns that once seemed to be drenched in fortune but then strangled by the drought of bust .
Using wi-fi routers , malware could spread very quickly .
Wireless access points could be used by hi-tech criminals to spread viruses and worms , warn US researchers .
Security holes and the popularity of the devices in cities make them ideal for spreading malware , they found .
Using modelling methods from real diseases the team showed how a worm could gradually infect all access points in urban areas .
They found that the majority of vulnerable access points would be hit in the first 24 hours of an outbreak .
Password cracking
The simulation work showed that within two weeks of an outbreak occurring 55 % of wi-fi access points would be compromised .
In urban areas this could mean tens of thousands of people were at risk , said the researchers .
Before now malicious attacks carried out via wi- fi routers have been limited in scope .
Most revolve around the creation of fake access points that steal login and other details from those using them to get online .
The work by Hao Hu , Steven Myers , Vittoria Colizza , and Alessandro Vespignani from Indiana University shows how the ubiquitous access points could be used in a much more ambitious attack .
The theoretical attack modelled by the team involved attempts to subvert the firmware inside a wi-fi access point or router which keeps the device running .
Hi -tech criminals keen to subvert wi-fi access points could rely on the fact that few people take basic steps to stop unauthorised access to the device , said the researchers .
Surveys of consumer use of wi-fi routers suggest that a maximum of 40 % of the machines use encryption to limit who can use them .
In addition , most people do not change the default password the device ships with making it easy for attackers to get access .
Also , noted the researchers , few routers have lock out mechanisms that stop endless attempts to guess passwords that have been changed .
The researchers modelled attacks in seven areas including Manhattan in New York and Chicago .
The numbers of wi-fi routers in each location were taken from public lists of access points .
In the New York simulation about 18,000 access points were infected over a two - week period .
" We note that there is a real concern about the wireless spread of wi- fi - based malware , " wrote the researchers in their paper which appeared in PNAS .
They added : " Action needs to be taken to detect and prevent such outbreaks , and more thoughtful planning for the security of future wireless devices needs to occur , so that such scenarios do not occur or worsen with future technology . "
The team recommended that people be forced to change default passwords and encouraged to use encryption - both of which can limit the ability of wireless - borne malware to spread .

Drunk of the Week Extra
OKTOBERFEST
Somewhere between 7,000 to 4,000 B.C. , in Mesopotamia , in the Kingdom of Sumeria , women invented beer .
Early agriculture in the " fertile crescent " was centered around grains .
Those grains , pregnant with possibility , became bread and , eventually , beer .
Sumerian women were both the first brewers and the first gods of beer .
By adding a trace amount of my vaginal yeast to regular brewer 's yeast , my " Original Pussy Beer " pays homage to beer 's ancient creators from " the cradle of civilization . "
Woman is literally reunited with the beer .
Yeast , because it has been used for millennia , carries a great amount of symbolic weight .
As a key ingredient to basic sustenance like bread and beer , yeast is an age - old , familiar and very powerful medium to work with .
Food , and our complex relationship with it , is mythical ; when we eat and drink , human happiness and sorrow , love and hate , heaven and hell are simultaneously displayed and represented .
If beer is food , and food is life itself , then beer too is life itself .
Experimentation with these historic staple foods , in combination with my own body , helps to build a new artistic dimension : understanding through taste .
To experience an art piece through taste is a two - pronged experience .
The viewer has to make a simple decision - to ingest it or not .
From this primal question new questions quickly arise :
Is it socially acceptable to drink beer that includes even a trace amount of vaginal yeast ?
Is it natural ?
Is it kinky ?
Can a man drinking this beer still be macho ?
Why does it make such a difference when it comes to the human body ?
It is these questions about society 's ever - increasing disconnect with the human body that I try to expose and learn about by feeding the viewer .
By sharing my art in this way , I share my body and mind , inviting the viewer to have a conversation on a genuinely intimate level .
Essence meets essence .
The participants begin to understand me and I them .
Humanity was built on beer and conversation .
Please enjoy both .

In his career , Senator Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) has worn a variety of hats .
He started out as a major league baseball player , where he pitched for the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies and was good enough to end up in the Hall of Fame .
He then went into politics in his home state of Kentucky , serving in the state legislature before being elected to congress and then , in 1998 , winning a senate seat that he successfully defended in 2004 .
And now , it appears , he ’s a cancer specialist .
During a wide - ranging 30 - minute speech on Saturday [ Feb. 21 ] at the Hardin County Republican Party ’s Lincoln Day Dinner , Bunning said he supports conservative judges “ and that ’s going to be in place very shortly because Ruth Bader Ginsburg … has cancer . ”
“ Bad cancer .
The kind that you do n’t get better from , ” he told a crowd of about 100 at the old State Theater .
“ Even though she was operated on , usually , nine months is the longest that anybody would live after ( being diagnosed ) with pancreatic cancer , ” he said .
Evidently , Bunning ’s service in the senate alongside Bill Frist has given the Kentucky senator the same ability to make long - distance medical evaluations as Frist displayed during the Terri Schiavo affair .
Frist , it should be recalled , admitted that he had diagnosed Schiavo “ based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office . ”
He concluded that Schiavo , despite her persistent vegetative state and extensive brain damage , “ certainly seems to respond to visual stimuli . ”
It ’s not clear that the same can be said for Bunning .
Kentucky ’s junior senator has been known to exhibit inexplicably bizarre behavior during his time in office .
In his 2004 reelection campaign , he said that his Democratic opponent , Dan Mongiardo , the son of Italian immigrants , “ looked like one of Saddam Hussein ’s sons . ”
Bunning also confessed that he was n’t much of a news junkie : “ Let me explain something : I do n’t watch the national news , and I do n’t read the paper .
I have n’t done that for the last six weeks .
I watch Fox News to get my information . ”
That led to charges that Bunning was “ out of touch , ” which prompted a Nixonian denial : “ That ’s unfair .
You know it is .
Of course I ’m not out of touch . ”
Note to aspiring politicians : when you have to assure voters that , really , you ’re not all that out of touch , you ’re doing something wrong .
Bunning also managed to inject his own personal brand of crazy into the senate debate that year .
After agreeing to a single debate with Mongiardo in Lexington , Bunning , at the last minute , decided to appear via satellite from Washington , D.C. , where he said that he was staying because he needed to cast votes in the senate .
Given that congress was n’t in session at the time , that was a fairly surprising statement for Bunning to make , but it was forgotten in the uproar created when Bunning admitted to reading his opening and closing statements off a TelePrompTer , contrary to the debate ’s rules .
The broad path of bizarre that Bunning blazed through the Bluegrass State in 2004 nearly cost him the election , which he eventually won by only a little more than a percentage point , far behind George W. Bush , who carried the state by twenty points in the presidential election .
Now , with another election looming in 2010 , Bunning is resisting calls for his retirement and has issued a dire warning to the GOP that he plans to run again .
Mitch McConnell , Kentucky ’s senior senator and the senate minority leader , apparently dreads that prospect , and has been making moves to call up a conservative and , presumably , non-insane challenger from the bullpen to run against Bunning in next year ’s senate primary .
Bunning , in typical fashion , has threatened to sue the National Republican Senatorial Committee if it supports a primary challenge and dismissed reassurances from the NRSC ’s chairman , senator John Cornyn of Texas .
Stated Bunning : “ I do n’t believe anything Cornyn says . ”
Bunning has since issued an “ unpology ” for his remarks about Ginsburg .
Meanwhile , questions remain about Bunning ’s health .
He had a bout of pneumonia in November which led him to spend more time attending to family affairs and even less time to the senate , which , on balance , is probably a good thing for the citizens of Kentucky in particular and the nation in general .
At 77 , Bunning does n’t have too many innings left to pitch .
And frankly , he does n’t look well .
No , not well at all .
So , as a matter of public interest , the Jim Bunning Death Watch will continue to monitor the situation and keep everyone informed of the state of senator Bunning ’s health .
Stay tuned for future updates .
Jim Bunning ’s current status is : Feisty .

Enlarge File photo , AP An iceberg melts off Ammassalik Island in Eastern Greenland in 2007 .
More than 2 trillion tons of land ice in Greenland , Antarctica and Alaska have melted since 2003 , according to new NASA data .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
More than 2 trillion tons of land ice in Greenland , Antarctica and Alaska have melted since 2003 , according to new NASA satellite data that show the latest signs of what scientists say is global warming .
More than half of the loss of landlocked ice in the past five years has occurred in Greenland , based on measurements of ice weight by NASA 's GRACE satellite , said NASA geophysicist Scott Luthcke .
The water melting from Greenland in the past five years would fill up about 11 Chesapeake Bays , he said , and the Greenland melt seems to be accelerating .
NASA scientists planned to present their findings Thursday at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco .
Luthcke said Greenland figures for the summer of 2008 are n't complete yet , but this year 's ice loss , while still significant , wo n't be as severe as 2007 .
The news was better for Alaska .
After a precipitous drop in 2005 , land ice increased slightly in 2008 because of large winter snowfalls , Luthcke said .
Since 2003 , when the NASA satellite started taking measurements , Alaska has lost 400 billion tons of land ice .
In assessing climate change , scientists generally look at several years to determine the overall trend .
Melting of land ice , unlike sea ice , increases sea levels very slightly .
In the 1990s , Greenland did n't add to world sea level rise ; now that island is adding about half a millimeter of sea level rise a year , NASA ice scientist Jay Zwally said in a telephone interview from the conference .
Between Greenland , Antarctica and Alaska , melting land ice has raised global sea levels about one - fifth of an inch in the past five years , Luthcke said .
Sea levels also rise from water expanding as it warms .
Other research , being presented this week at the geophysical meeting point to more melting concerns from global warming , especially with sea ice .
" It 's not getting better ; it 's continuing to show strong signs of warming and amplification , " Zwally said .
" There 's no reversal taking place . "
Scientists studying sea ice will announce that parts of the Arctic north of Alaska were 9 to 10 degrees warmer this past fall , a strong early indication of what researchers call the Arctic amplification effect .
That 's when the Arctic warms faster than predicted , and warming there is accelerating faster than elsewhere on the globe .
As sea ice melts , the Arctic waters absorb more heat in the summer , having lost the reflective powers of vast packs of white ice .
That absorbed heat is released into the air in the fall .
That has led to autumn temperatures in the last several years that are six to 10 degrees warmer than they were in the 1980s , said research scientist Julienne Stroeve at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo .
That 's a strong and early impact of global warming , she said .
" The pace of change is starting to outstrip our ability to keep up with it , in terms of our understanding of it , " said Mark Serreze , senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a co-author of the Arctic amplification study .
Two other studies coming out at the conference assess how Arctic thawing is releasing methane — the second most potent greenhouse gas .
One study shows that the loss of sea ice warms the water , which warms the permafrost on nearby land in Alaska , thus producing methane , Stroeve says .
A second study suggests even larger amounts of frozen methane are trapped in lakebeds and sea bottoms around Siberia and they are starting to bubble to the surface in some spots in alarming amounts , said Igor Semiletov , a professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks .
In late summer , Semiletov found methane bubbling up from parts of the East Siberian Sea and Laptev Sea at levels that were 10 times higher than they were in the mid-1990s , he said based on a study this summer .
The amounts of methane in the region could dramatically increase global warming if they get released , he said .
That , Semiletov said , " should alarm people . "

It happens in gaming circles .
Depending on how much importance is placed on the game compared to other aspects of life by the GM and players , it may even happen frequently .
Sometimes , some players just ca n’t make a gaming session .
Perhaps a girlfriend or boyfriend wants to go on a date , and it ’s the only night that works , sometimes there ’s a giant school project or exam to prepare for , and some nights a player just knows they ’ll drag the group down because they are n’t really up for gaming .
In my groups , players make it for most sessions , but it ’s still quite common for at least one player to be missing .
So there needs to be a way to let the game go on with those who are missing .
Here are some ideas , some of which might be common , others might be less so .
1 ) Press on with the current plotline without the missing player .
Write the character out of the plot somehow , or have the GM or a trusted player play the missing character .
This is the one I like to use most often .
It keeps the game going , and everyone gets to see what will happen next rather than have to wait for next session , myself included .
I prefer to write missing characters out of the current plotline , rather than have significant things possibly happen to a character who ’s player is not there .
This has the advantage of keeping the campaign moving right along even when people are missing .
Also , it ’s generally a simple matter to write a character out of plot or have someone else pick up and play the character for a session .
The disadvantages are that it ca n’t be used when a plot is centered on the missing character , and , though it ’s usually not a big deal , the missing player misses out on experiencing part of a plot when this method is used .
Also , it can break the suspension of disbelief for some people when a superficial reason takes a character away from the group or someone else does n’t get a character ’s personality just right .
2 ) Pick up a sidequest .
Your players do give you advance notice when they are n’t attending , even if it is just half a day or so , right ?
I should hope so .
With this information , you know to prepare a possible sidequest or two ahead of time , giving the group something else to do while the character of the missing player attends to other issues .
This is a lot like number one when the character gets written out of the story for a bit , but this has the advantage that the main quest is n’t continuing , so a missing character is a lot easier to explain away .
As a disadvantage though , everyone has to wait another session to advance the plot , which can be frustrating when you really want to know what happens next .
In my experience though , as long as the sidequest is interesting enough , most players will be quite happy with this arrangement .
3 ) Do a flashback session .
Have everyone play through a session of something that happened before the story even started .
Use this to expand on the backstory of the characters and allow everyone to become more familiar with it , or to expand on the history of the world .
If no one likes the idea of playing level 1 characters again , and having them be level 15 back in the past feels like breaking continuity too much , make it non-canon , or provide historical characters of equivalent power to their current characters for them to play through a historical flashback .
What they do in the past might even show up in a future gaming session , which can be a cool feeling if incorporated well .
If everyone is cool with playing level 1 characters for a session , or is willing to handwave continuity issues , perhaps playing through a quest in which the group banded together once to aid a local village or help the army defend their country would make an interesting session .
This does n’t even have to be when they became an adventuring group , it could simply be the first time they met , and fate brought them together again later in life for the current adventure they ’re on .
As an alternative , perhaps they could play through a historical event involving the paladin king , sorceress queen , and court jester ( a bard ) before they rose to power in order to see how they came to power , and what deeds they performed before their rise to power .
This could even be a great chance for players to try out different characters in a long - running game , just for the experience of playing a character focused in a different area then the normal character .
There are many other options for flashbacks of course , these are just a couple ideas .
Doing a canon session of the past might be difficult to integrate into the main campaign again , but if it ’s done well , it can be immensely rewarding both for the GM and the players .
4 ) Do a session of a possible future .
Make sure everyone knows this may not be a canon session , since it could be quite difficult to direct the players to this point in the story once the campaign starts from its normal location again .
Then let them level up a few times , or in a system like World of Darkness or Shadowrun give them a few sessions worth of XP to spend on new abilities for this single session only .
Then put them in a situation that might come up sometime in the future .
This has two cool aspects .
First , it allows the players to play around with higher level powers that it might take awhile for them to actually get .
Next , if the players like the way events turn out in this future , they can work to make it happen , otherwise they can work to make a different future happen when they begin playing the normal campaign again .
It also spreads more information about the plot around .
Of course , in some games , this may not be desirable , but if it ’s a useful device for the story , it could be a lot of fun .
I ’ve never tried this one , and do n’t know anyone who has , but it sounds like a lot of fun .
Perhaps I ’ll get the chance next time I ’m running a campaign .
So that ’s it for ideas of how to deal with missing players for a session .
Hopefully you ’ll find some of them useful in planning for a session not everyone can attend .
Be sure to share any other ideas , or how these methods have worked for you , in the comments so we can see how other groups handle running sessions without everyone present !
Felipe Calderon says cross -border operations with the US are working Mexican President Felipe Calderon has rejected US concern that his country could become a failed state because of a growing wave of drug violence .
Mr Calderon , in an interview with the Associated Press , said the cartels did not control any part of his country .
He said that he intended to withdraw the army from the fight before he leaves office in 2012 .
Last month , the US military singled out Mexico and Pakistan as two countries most at risk of sudden collapse .
More than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed in Mexico so far this year as gangs battle over lucrative drug routes into the US .
But President Calderon said that Mexico 's territorial integrity , unlike Colombia 's , was still intact .
" To say that Mexico is a failed state is absolutely false .
I have not lost any part , any single point , of the Mexican territory , " he said .
" Colombia lost [ territory ] during several decades and even today huge parts of its territory [ are ] in the hands of the criminals , or the guerrillas , or some combination of drug traffickers and guerrillas .
" But in Mexico , all the territory is in the hands of the Mexican authorities . "
US demand Mr Calderon said that smuggling could not be totally eradicated as long as Americans continued to use drugs .
But he said he hoped that by 2012 the cartels would be worn down to a point where the army and federal police could withdraw and leave the problem in the hands of local police .
A report published in January by the United States Joint Forces Command called Mexico and Pakistan " two large and important states [ which ] bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse " .
Mr Calderon sent troops and federal police into drug strongholds on his first day in office in December 2006 .
But violence has increased , with more than 5,000 people killed in drug - related incidents in 2008 .
US police have closed many smuggling routes , but others appear Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora , in a separate interview with AP , said that 90 % of those killed were involved in the drugs trade , while only 4 % were innocent bystanders .
The rest , he said , were police officers and soldiers .
Mr Calderon called on Washington to do more , by stopping the flow of drugs cash and powerful US assault weapons into Mexico .
He applauded cross -border operations that US officials said culminated this week with the arrests of 755 Sinaloa cartel members and the seizure of $ 59 m ( £ 41 m ) in the US .
But he acknowledged that Mexico could not be President Barack Obama 's top priority , saying the US would help Mexico most by fixing its own economic crisis .
He said Latin American leaders had high hopes for President Obama 's first trip to the region at the Summit of the Americas in April .
" President Barack Obama has a tremendous opportunity to recover the leadership of the United States , " he said .

The CRTC's net neutrality hearing submissions have generated several comments that link net neutrality with copyright .
As noted yesterday , CIRPA believes that content blocking of P2P sites should be considered .
Quebecor , which owns Videotron , a leading Quebec ISP , goes even further .
While ISPs in countries such as New Zealand are pushing back against " graduated response " policies that would create a three strikes and you 're out policy terminating subscribers based on unproven allegations of copyright infringement , Quebecor argues that CRTC network management policies should account for the possibility of a Canadian three strikes model .
The Quebecor submission [ zip ] includes the following :
Certains participants à la présente instance ont déjà fait état de situations où le contrôle de contenus peut être bénéfique non seulement pour les utilisateurs de services Internet mais pour la société en général .
On peut penser au contrôle des pourriels et des virus , ou à la pornographie infantile .
À cette liste pourrait éventuellement s’ajouter des mesures de protection du droit d’auteur pouvant possiblement s’inspirer des modèles de riposte graduée déjà adoptés dans d’autres pays occidentaux .
Translated , Quebecor argues in favour of certain instances of ISPs controlling content , including anti-spam or child pornography blocking .
Moreover , it suggests that copyright policies that build upon the graduated response policies in other countries should be added to the list of content controls that benefit society .
The Quebecor submission achieves a remarkable combination – arguing against net neutrality and for a three strikes approach that would terminate its own subscribers .
That any ISP could demonstrate such hostility toward its own customers provides a clear indicator of the utter lack of broadband competition in Canada and serves as a warning that the New Zealand fight could eventually make its way here .
DNA evidence has gone untested in more than 800 rape and sexual assault cases even though detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department and other smaller agencies have no suspects in those crimes , authorities acknowledged Tuesday .
The number is far larger than officials had anticipated and revealed a breakdown in the way the Sheriff ’s Department went about testing genetic evidence until recent reforms were enacted .
For months , sheriff ’s officials sought to downplay concerns over a massive backlog of untested DNA evidence by suggesting that the crimes had been resolved by other means .
Compounding the problem was the revelation that in 51 of the 815 cases tallied so far , the genetic evidence has sat untested in county storage freezers for more than a decade -- so long that state laws now prohibit officials from arresting anyone even if belated genetic testing were to definitively identify a suspect .
“ You ’ve got a bunch of evidence sitting there that is potentially a smoking gun , ” said L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky to a contrite Cmdr. Earl M. Shields , who oversees the department ’s Technical Services division .
“ It could be the silver bullet to getting a suspect in a sexual assault case , and it ’s just sitting there . ”
Shields reported the troubling figures as part of a presentation to county supervisors on the sheriff ’s ongoing attempt to work through a backlog of untested samples of semen , saliva , blood and other genetic evidence collected from victims after an alleged sexual attack .
Currently 4,738 of the so - called sexual assault kits in county storage facilities remain untested -- about 20 % of them from other police agencies in the county that rely on the sheriff ’s crime laboratory for DNA analysis .
Sheriff ’s officials have managed to gather information on only about two - thirds of the backlogged cases so far , meaning that the number of investigations without any suspects or those that have fallen out of statute is likely to rise .
Until late last year , the Sheriff ’s Department had followed a policy of testing DNA evidence only when investigators in the case requested it .
After coming under pressure from advocacy groups and the Board of Supervisors about the growing backlog , Sheriff Lee Baca announced in November that the department ’s lab would test DNA evidence in all cases regardless of whether the analysis was requested .
At the time , the Sheriff ’s Department -- as well as the Los Angeles Police Department , which came under similar scrutiny -- tried to minimize the significance of the size of the backlog .
Both agencies indicated that the vast majority of untested kits were from cases in which investigators had determined the genetic evidence was not needed .
In November , Shields told supervisors that he expected an inventory of the sheriff ’s backlog would uncover very few , if any , examples in which investigators had no leads on suspects and had not asked for DNA testing .
“ There should not be any [ such ] cases , ” he said .
“ We ’re hoping that that number will be zero . ”
On Tuesday he conceded under questioning from Yaroslavsky that “ we were hoping the number would be much smaller . ”
Without detailed information on each investigation , Shields was at a loss to explain why so many investigators had not asked for the evidence to be tested .
He speculated they might have decided they “ did n’t have a valid , prosecutable case ” because the accuser recanted or other fundamental problems arose .
“ It was a judgment call on the part of the investigator , ” he said .
Sarah Tofte , a researcher with Human Rights Watch who has been pressing local law enforcement agencies around the country to address backlogs , questioned that logic .
“ Investigators may think that a victim ’s account lacks some veracity , ” she said , “ but when someone reports to police that she ’s been raped , the default should always be , ‘ Let ’s test this kit and see what we find . ’ ”
Unexamined evidence kits hold potentially crucial information .
Through a complex scientific process , DNA analysts can extract a person ’s genetic code from the collected samples and compare it to those of known felons that are kept in federal and state databases .
When the DNA sample collected at a crime scene or from a victim ’s body matches a DNA profile of someone in the database , it can offer prosecutors nearly irrefutable proof of the person ’s guilt .
The evidence can also be used to confirm that someone has not falsely confessed to a crime or link someone to other unsolved cases .
LAPD Deputy Chief Charlie
Beck declined to reveal how many cases for which LAPD detectives have no suspects and have not pursued DNA testing .
A recent inventory of the LAPD ’s untested kits has been completed , but the results are not yet final , he said .
Like the LAPD , the Sheriff ’s Department has struggled to devise a financially feasible plan to eliminate its DNA backlog .
Both agencies are currently increasing the number of in - house lab analysts to handle the constant influx of new cases , while also plotting out ways to outsource the backlogged cases to private labs .
Each kit costs about $ 1,000 to process .
Shields told L.A. County supervisors that he would soon present Baca with a proposed plan and said it would take “ years ” to clear the backlog .
In an interview , he declined to provide specifics .
Time is a major factor :
More than 100 sheriff ’s cases are within six months of reaching the state ’s 10 - year statute of limitations , Shields reported .

Limbaugh 's desire for Obama to ' fail ' is ' arguably treasonous ' : Stewart David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Friday January 23 , 2009
Print This Email This After only a few days , Fox News does its " duty , " and , of course , all the while , remaining " fair and balanced , " finds reasons Americans should fear the Obama administration .
As Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart shows , the attacks on Obama - some that even the Fox hosts themselves considered ridiculous but still decided to air to sound off on - began in the first twenty - four hours of his presidency .
" Holy shit !
Fox News is really scared about what might happen , oblivious to what already has , " exclaimed Stewart , sounding as " shocked " as Claude Rains pretended to be about gambling in Casablanca .
After playing an old clip of Fox 's Bill O'Reilly sounding off on the " anti-Bush liberals " ( " But this hate stuff , this rooting for the administration to fail in Iraq and other areas is un-American , unbecoming , and unacceptable .
Like him or not , Mr. Bush is the elected leader of this country ... " said O'Reilly in March of 2007 ) , Stewart showed conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh talking about how he wants Obama to " fail , " during an appearance on FOX News ' Hannity on Wednesday .
" I am hearing many Republicans say that  well , we want him to succeed and prominent Republicans , " Limbaugh had said .
" Yes , we wanted  they have laid down .
They have totally  they 're drinking the Kool - Aid , too . "
" So I shamelessly say , no , I want him to fail , " Limbaugh said later in the interview with Hannity .
Not really joking , Comedy Central 's Stewart asked , " Does Bill O'Reilly think Rush Limbaugh hates America ? "
Stewart posited that Limbaugh 's words could be considered " arguably treasonous . "

Democracy Is Not Freedom
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
 man is not free unless government is limited .
There ’s a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics :
As government expands , liberty contracts . 
~ Ronald Reagan
We ’ve all heard the words democracy and freedom used countless times , especially in the context of our invasion of Iraq .
They are used interchangeably in modern political discourse , yet their true meanings are very different .
George Orwell wrote about meaningless words  that are endlessly repeated in the political arena . *
Words like  freedom ,  democracy ,  and justice ,  Orwell explained , have been abused so long that their original meanings have been eviscerated .
In Orwell ’s view , political words were  Often used in a consciously dishonest way .
Without precise meanings behind words , politicians and elites can obscure reality and condition people to reflexively associate certain words with positive or negative perceptions .
In other words , unpleasant facts can be hidden behind purposely meaningless language .
As a result , Americans have been conditioned to accept the word democracy  as a synonym for freedom , and thus to believe that democracy is unquestionably good .
The problem is that democracy is not freedom .
Democracy is simply majoritarianism , which is inherently incompatible with real freedom .
Our founding fathers clearly understood this , as evidenced not only by our republican constitutional system , but also by their writings in the Federalist Papers and elsewhere .
James Madison cautioned that under a democratic government ,  There is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual .
John Adams argued that democracies merely grant revocable rights to citizens depending on the whims of the masses , while a republic exists to secure and protect pre-existing rights .
Yet how many Americans know that the word democracy  is found neither in the Constitution nor the Declaration of Independence , our very founding documents ?
A truly democratic election in Iraq , without U.S. interference and U.S. puppet candidates , almost certainly would result in the creation of a Shiite theocracy .
Shiite majority rule in Iraq might well mean the complete political , economic , and social subjugation of the minority Kurd and Sunni Arab populations .
Such an outcome would be democratic , but would it be free ?
Would the Kurds and Sunnis consider themselves free ?
The administration talks about democracy in Iraq , but is it prepared to accept a democratically - elected Iraqi government no matter what its attitude toward the U.S. occupation ?
Hardly .
For all our talk about freedom and democracy , the truth is we have no idea whether Iraqis will be free in the future .
They ’re certainly not free while a foreign army occupies their country .
The real test is not whether Iraq adopts a democratic , pro-western government , but rather whether ordinary Iraqis can lead their personal , religious , social , and business lives without interference from government .
Simply put , freedom is the absence of government coercion .
Our Founding Fathers understood this , and created the least coercive government in the history of the world .
The Constitution established a very limited , decentralized government to provide national defense and little else .
States , not the federal government , were charged with protecting individuals against criminal force and fraud .
For the first time , a government was created solely to protect the rights , liberties , and property of its citizens .
Any government coercion beyond that necessary to secure those rights was forbidden , both through the Bill of Rights and the doctrine of strictly enumerated powers .
This reflected the founders ’ belief that democratic government could be as tyrannical as any King .
Few Americans understand that all government action is inherently coercive .
If nothing else , government action requires taxes .
If taxes were freely paid , they would n’t be called taxes , they ’d be called donations .
If we intend to use the word freedom in an honest way , we should have the simple integrity to give it real meaning : Freedom is living without government coercion .
So when a politician talks about freedom for this group or that , ask yourself whether he is advocating more government action or less .
The political left equates freedom with liberation from material wants , always via a large and benevolent government that exists to create equality on earth .
To modern liberals , men are free only when the laws of economics and scarcity are suspended , the landlord is rebuffed , the doctor presents no bill , and groceries are given away .
But philosopher Ayn Rand ( and many others before her ) demolished this argument by explaining how such freedom for some is possible only when government takes freedoms away from others .
In other words , government claims on the lives and property of those who are expected to provide housing , medical care , food , etc. for others are coercive — and thus incompatible with freedom .
 Liberalism ,  which once stood for civil , political , and economic liberties , has become a synonym for omnipotent coercive government .
The political right equates freedom with national greatness brought about through military strength .
Like the left , modern conservatives favor an all - powerful central state — but for militarism , corporatism , and faith - based welfarism .
Unlike the Taft - Goldwater conservatives of yesteryear , today ’s Republicans are eager to expand government spending , increase the federal police apparatus , and intervene militarily around the world .
The last tenuous links between conservatives and support for smaller government have been severed .
 Conservatism ,  which once meant respect for tradition and distrust of active government , has transformed into big - government utopian grandiosity .
Orwell certainly was right about the use of meaningless words in politics .
If we hope to remain free , we must cut through the fog and attach concrete meanings to the words politicians use to deceive us .
We must reassert that America is a republic , not a democracy , and remind ourselves that the Constitution places limits on government that no majority can overrule .
We must resist any use of the word freedom to describe state action .
We must reject the current meaningless designations of liberals  and conservatives ,  in favor of an accurate term for both : statists .
Every politician on earth claims to support freedom .
The problem is so few of them understand the simple meaning of the word .

Obama will end ' do n't ask ' policy , aide says

President Obama will end the 15 - year - old " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that has prevented homosexual and bisexual men and women from serving openly within the U.S. military , a spokesman for the president - elect said .
Obama said during the campaign that he opposed the policy , but since his election in November he has made statements that have been interpreted as backpedaling .
On Friday , however , Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs , responding on the transition team 's Web site to a Michigan resident who asked if the new administration planned to get rid of the policy , said :
" You do n't hear politicians give a one - word answer much .
But it 's ' Yes . ' "
The little - noticed response , made in a video posted on change.gov , made barely a ripple outside blogs focused on the gay community , but that 's not surprising , said those who have been pushing to overturn the ban .
Not only was Obama 's position expected , they said , but support for reviewing or repealing the policy has grown markedly in recent years , including some from unexpected quarters .
The end of " do n't ask , do n't tell " might not happen immediately , several critics of the policy said .
Although they appreciate clarity from Obama on the issue , they anticipate that the demands of the economy and two wars are likely to trump a speedy policy reversal .
" The question is n't if we do it , and the question is n't when we do it , it 's how we do it , " said Rep. Ellen Tauscher , D - Walnut Creek , whose 2006 bill to repeal the ban earned broad support among Democrats in Congress but did not move forward in the face of a near - certain veto by President Bush .
" I 'm going to reintroduce the bill in the next few weeks , " Tauscher said .
" We 've got the American people behind us . "
Changing attitudes
An ABC poll in July found that three - quarters of Americans supported allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military compared to 44 percent of Americans who expressed the same support in 1993 , when President Bill Clinton approved " do n't ask , do n't tell " as what he called an " honorable compromise " that nevertheless bitterly disappointed his supporters in the gay community .
Colin Powell , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Sen. Sam Nunn , D - Ga. , both of whom backed the 1993 policy , recently called for it to be re-evaluated .
John Shalikashvili , who followed Powell as chairman , has called for its repeal , as has former Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr , an opponent of gay rights and legal protections for gays .
In an op - ed piece in the Wall Street Journal , Barr disparaged the policy as wasting money and talent .
The current leaders of the military , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Adm.
Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , have neither supported nor opposed ending the policy in recent comments , saying pointedly that Congress and the president make the laws ; the military follows them .
Recently , the main active support for " do n't ask , do n't tell " has come from the nonprofit Center for Military Readiness , whose founder , Elaine Donnelly , and other officers did not respond to requests for comment .
Donnelly has argued that ending the ban on gays serving openly in the military would devastate unit cohesion and morale by ordering heterosexual troops into " forced cohabitation " with openly gay and lesbian troops .
But critics of the policy say society has changed since " do n't ask , do n't tell " was implemented to address similar concerns .
" We had a decade in the 1990s where people came out , and people came to know that their sisters and their mothers and their colleagues and their children and their friends were gay , " said Nathaniel Frank , a senior research fellow with the Palm Center at UC Santa Barbara , which conducts research on sexual minorities in the military .
" Familiarity breeds tolerance and even acceptance . "
More recent years have seen high - profile discharges of gay Arabic linguists and other troops whose military jobs were deemed essential in Iraq , Afghanistan and the " war on terror " - dismissals that struck many people as inexplicable , said sociologist Melissa Embser - Herbert , author of " The U.S. Military 's ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' Policy : A Reference Handbook . "
" We know of gay , lesbian , bisexual veterans who have served in combat theater , and I think that 's also a big piece of it , " she said .
" It 's a much harder sell to the general public that that person who died or lost a leg did n't deserve to be serving their country . "
The military also has experienced a shift in attitudes , according to a number of studies .
A 2006 Zogby International poll found military members who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan to be split on the issue , with about a quarter saying gays should be able to serve openly and a bit more than a third saying they should not .
But about a quarter of respondents said they knew a gay person already serving in the military , and a large majority of those - about two - thirds - said the presence of a gay person in their unit made no impact on their personal or their unit 's morale .
Three - quarters said they would have joined the military even if gays were permitted to serve openly .
A more recent , if unscientific , readership survey by the Military Times group of newspapers reported that about 58 percent of active - duty respondents opposed repealing the ban , a number that was cited in some media accounts as reflecting broad military opposition to a change .
But the newspapers that conducted the poll warned that their readers were not a perfect mirror of the military - they were more likely to be older , male , careerists , officers and politically conservative .
In that context , sociologist Embser - Herbert said , it is remarkable that the level of opposition was not higher , because it is the younger , enlisted troops who are more likely to favor allowing gays to serve openly .
' Will and Grace ' generation
" It 's the ' Will and Grace ' generation , " she said .
" They 've grown up seeing gay people on TV and having friends in 10th - grade come out . "
In the 1980s , when John Caldera was a Navy hospital corpsman , " do n't ask , do n't tell " was not yet policy , but was practice .
Caldera , a gay man now a member of the San Francisco Veterans Commission , recalled how any sailor whose medical problem was diagnosed as HIV would be sequestered in a ward to await the inevitable investigation of presumed homosexuality and likely discharge .
" The policy ... should have never been created , " he said .
" With this new administration , I look for the light at the end of the tunnel . "
Today , Caldera is one of several gay veterans in American Legion District 8 in San Francisco whose commander , Michael Gerold , a veteran injured in a firefight in Afghanistan , appointed an openly gay veteran as district finance officer without hesitation .
" He 's an Iraq - Afghanistan veteran .
It 's just not an issue .
Core competencies and leadership , that 's what I need , " he said .
" I do n't give a darn about the rest . "
Another legion officer , Matt Shea , chief of staff of American Legion Post 911 , recalled deploying to Iraq with a friend and fellow squad leader who later came out to him .
" It 's about competence , about being able to do your job .
He was a better leader than most , took care of his guys better than most I 'd seen , " said Shea .
" Who ... cares ?
Seriously . "
On the 36th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion , a man smashed his SUV into the entrance of the Planned Parenthood office in St. Paul this morning .
Although staff members have gotten used to protests , particularly on the anniversary of the ruling , " we certainly do n't expect this sort of thing , " said Sarah Stoesz , the president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota , North Dakota and South Dakota .
" " It 's never happened before and we do n't expect it to happen again . "
The 32 - year - old man was arrested and is expected to be charged Friday on suspicion of aggravated assault , said police spokesman Peter Panos .
" We think it 's intentional because of Roe vs. Wade , " Panos said .
" He 's not saying much .
He was praying or chanting when the officers arrived . "
Panos also said the incident was unusual .
" Usually we have some demonstrations there on this day , but someone doing actual damage is very , very rare , " he said .
Several employees were in the building at the time , said Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Kathi Di Nicola .
She said the SUV hit the front door of the clinic two or three times , damaging the clinic 's front door and surrounding stonework .
When Di Nicola arrived at the clinic , she said the man had gotten out of the SUV and was pacing around it , holding a crucifix and chanting .
" He was agitated and he was saying , ' shut down this Auschwitz , ' " she said .
About 7:40 a.m. , the man drove his truck onto the sidewalk in front of the office and rammed into the front door of the office on Ford Parkway , Panos said .
" The damage ended up being minor and things were cleaned up while we diverted patients to another entrance , " Stoesz said .
" It shook people up a little bit , but the staff responded in a very calm way . "
Ever since the 1966 Hollywood movie " Fantastic Voyage " , written by Harry Kleiner ( with what is actually a pretty good novelization by Isaac Asimov afterward ) and starring Raquel Welch as the most convincing portrayal of a scientist ever , doctors have sought a day when they could have access to the real thing – a medical vehicle shrunk small enough to " submarine " in and fix faulty cells in the body .
According to new research by Tel Aviv University scientists , that may be only three years away .
The blueprints for the submarine and a map of its proposed maiden voyage were published earlier this year in Science by Dr. Dan Peer , who now leads the Tel Aviv University team at the Department of Cell Research and Immunology .
The team will build and test - run the actual " machine " in human bodies .
Dr. Peer originally developed the scenario at Harvard University .
All scientists look like this .
Made from biological materials , the real - life medical submarine 's Fantastic Voyage will be a nano - sized structure lacking tiny people but still big enough to deliver the payload : effective drugs to kill cancer cells and eradicate faulty proteins .
" Our lab is creating biological nano - machines , " says Peer .
" These machines can target specific cells .
In fact , we can target any protein that might be causing disease or disorder in the human body .
This new invention treats the source , not the symptoms .
" A nanoparticle decorated with targeting agents that guide it to a specific cell type , leaving healthy cells untouched .
Peer 's recent paper reported on the device 's ability to target leukocytes ( immune cells ) in the guts of mice with ulcerative colitis .
Calling his new invention a submarine , Dr. Peer has developed a nano - sized carrier which operates like a GPS system to locate and target cells .
In the case of Crohn 's disease , for example , it will target overactive immune system cells in the gut .
In other diseases such as cancer , the submarine can aim for and deliver material to specific cancer cells , leaving the surrounding healthy cells intact .
While other researchers are working in the area of nano - medicine and drug delivery , Dr. Peer 's submarines are among the first to combine a drug candidate with a drug delivery system .
As the submarines float through the body , they latch onto the target cell and deliver their payload , a drug based on RNAi .
This new kind of drug can affect faulty RNA machinery and reprogram cells to operate in normal ways .
In essence , RNAi can essentially restore health to diseased cells or cause cells to die ( like in the case of cancer cells ) .
Large pharmaceutical companies have already expressed interest in this research and in the area of RNAi in general .
Currently , the Tel Aviv University lab is pairing its medical submarine with different RNAi compounds to target different pathologies , such as cancer , inflammation , and neurodegenerative diseases .
" We have tapped into the same ancient system the human body uses to protect itself from viruses , " says Dr. Peer , who is also investigating a number of topical applications for his medical subs .
" And the beauty of it is the basic material of our nano - carriers is natural , " he says .
The Tel Aviv University team plans to launch their medical submarines , following FDA regulations , within three to five years .
Their immediate focus is on blood , pancreatic , breast and brain cancers .
The researchers are currently collaborating with a number of teams around the world .
In the area of breast cancer , they are working with researchers from Harvard University and MIT .
In blood cancers , collaboration with the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School is already progressing towards clinical trials .
Welcome to the new Ars Technica !
Come on in , take off your coat , and check out the fantastic improvements we 've made to the Ars Technica experience .
Ars 5.0 , as we 've come to call it , is our most ambitious and effective redesign to date .
We hope you 'll agree .
Why , oh why , change something in a universe that never changes ( / sarcasm ) ?
Were the drapes tattered , was the paint peeling ?
Here are the highlights :
A lighter , faster experience
In the past year , the number of monthly visitors to Ars has doubled , and many of those visitors are coming 3 - 8 times / day .
Our servers were finally starting to sweat , get sluggish , and sometimes even crash .
Unacceptable !
Job # 1 was to boost performance .
We 've left behind Mubble , our custom CMS of 4 + years , and moved in with the fine folks at Movable Type .
Extensible , fast and easy to use -- we were ready for the move and MT was ready for us in a way that was not feasible in ' 04 or even ' 07 .
There has been a tremendous amount of work on the backend to make this possible .
Of course , this change meant that we would also need to revisit our aging hardware setup .
Who does n't like new hardware ?
We sat down with ServerCentral and reinvented our server cluster , with a focus on redundancy and speed rather than cutthroat cost efficiency .
Located near our Chicago HQ , ServerCentral has very reliable , very robust bandwidth , as we 've learned over our four years with them .
We 're going to be writing about this in more detail in the coming weeks , but we settled on three Dell PE2950s , each with dual 5410 quad core Xeons , 8 GB of RAM , and RAID 5 6x73 GB storage arrays .
Each physical server is running VMWare , which are currently split out into four instances : two lighttpd front ends , a database server -- MySQL , and the Movable Type application server ( which also hosts Civis , our new login system ) .
We 're currently making plans to double this amount soon as we launch additional dynamic service for our readers .
For an OS , we 're using Debian all around , with load balancing courtesy of a pair of Barracudas , and kept tidy by a Fortigate firewall .
We continue to rock on with CacheFly , our CDN .
We also knew that we needed to slim our pages down quite a bit .
Our old design was image heavy thanks to all the rounded corners and polish .
With the new site , the preponderance of images we do serve will be associated with stories , and not the design .
And thanks to increased CPU overhead again , we can gzip our content before serving it to you .
All in all , Ars is lighter and faster than before .
You can't appreciate the full effects just yet , because we have tweaking to do now that the site is live , but hopefully you can already tell the difference .
Another factor adding into the increased speed is that we 've actually eliminated 33 percent of our ad placements .
At a time when other sites are cramming more and more ads on their pages , we went in the opposite direction .
We now have two major display ad positions instead of three , and I hope you appreciate our efforts to keep things reasonable .
None of you work for free , and we can't either .
But we do n't want to follow other sites and explode advertising everywhere just because of an economic downturn .
Better navigation , better organization
Keeping up with us has been a challenge .
We know because many of you told us this in our last user survey .
So we studied the site and came to a realization : our content was scattered across the site like a shotgun blast .
Let 's give an example from the area of gaming .
A review of a hot new release would be in our Reviews section , but a minireview would be listed on Opposable Thumbs .
Breaking news about a development in the console world would be on the front page news section , while an article about cleaning your PS2 would be in our Technical Articles section .
Horrible !
And when write - ups covered multiple topics , such as a review of an iPhone game , we did n't know how best to place it .
Gaming ?
Reviews ?
Apple ?
And the same was true for Open Source , Science , Business IT , Tech Policy , Microsoft , and so on .
We 've now fixed that .
Our top stories will still be listed on the front page of Ars , and culled from all over the site .
But beyond the front page , all content is being regrouped by topic .
For instance , someone who reads Infinite Loop will now see listings for all Apple - related content there : reviews , shorter " blog " posts , original reports , guides , and more .
And should hell freeze over and Apple build an Xbox 360 into the side of a Mac Pro , you 'll see pointers to that story in both the Microsoft and Gaming sections .
This marks a significant change for us , but it 's one that we know we must make .
The navigation bar bears the marks of this change .
In the top row are the sections , generically described , and in the second row we break out the genre , e.g. , News , Features , Reviews , and Guides .
This means you are never more than one click away from any major section , and no more than two clicks away from any major subsection .
We wanted this navigation to be easy , because our old " Journals box " simply could n't be modified to suit everyone 's need .
The headlines were too small , many of you told us you did n't realize it was there for months , etc .
Now thanks to improved navigation and / or RSS , you can find our content more easily than ever .
Stiffing Taxpayers with Bad Mortgages
Debating whether taxpayers should pay for bad mortgages , with CNBC's Rick Santelli & Steve Liesman
From the desk of George Phillies :
LNC was given facts in advance showing that their substitution lawsuit is invalid .
It ’s in the following email , which was leaked to me some time ago by a number of LNC members disgusted with ongoing proceedings .
The core issue is that the LNC lawsuit affects to advance the claim that the LPNH State Committee can replace candidates , when in fact the State Convention reserved that right to itself .
And note the LPNH did stage that second convention , and no effort was made to replace their then current nominee .
Here is the key part of the email message :
*** As it turns out , we have been dealt a lucky break : the LPNH is FORCED to hold a second nominating convention .
The LPNH nominated Bea Francoeur , a sitting Republican state representative , to run for Governor .
After the convention , she declined their nomination .
She was flattered though and gave it great
consideration .
She joined the LPNH as a life member and started a monthly pledge .
In addition she wanted to run for U.S. Congress as a Libertarian ; however , the LPNH had already nominated candidates for both congressional districts .
The LPNH has no power to fill vacancies ; therefore , they MUST hold a second nominating convention to nominate a new Governor candidate .
That nominating convention requires 60 days notice ( I may have my numbers wrong there ) .
Until a new Governor
candidate is nominated , the LPNH will not be petitioning – because then they would have to petition more in the end since they can stack candidates and the requirement is the same for Governor as President .
The most likely scenario is that they will arrange for the second nominating convention to coincide with their annual convention in October .

Subject : [ Lnc- discuss ] LPNH board meeting
Message -ID : <46539F07.40906@*******.org >
Fellow LNC members ,
Due to the ongoing controversy with New Hampshire nominating George Phillies before the national convention , I attended the May 13th ( Mother ’s Day ) board meeting of the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire
The following ( somewhat long ) email relates what I determined .
I ’m very sorry it has taken me so long to compose this email .
I was camping without computer access until Thursday , then had to catch up on a number of other matters .
I ’m too busy this week to provide a shortened bullet point summary .
I arrived at the meeting place at 6 PM .
There were roughly 15 people in attendance , which I thought was a fantastic turnout for a board meeting .
Apparently for them it was below average .
Daniel Imperato was giving a 10 minute talk pitching his candidacy .
Early on the agenda was discussion of the George Phillies nomination .
They wanted to get input from me on the LNC ’s attitude towards the situation .
Before this meeting there had been a telephone conference call on the subject of possible disaffiliation , recalling the regional rep , and a new party name should disaffilition occur .
That conference call was scheduled by the Chair Brendan Kelly at the urging of party activist Jim
Perry .
Jim Perry is the LPNH Secretary , acts as a de-facto unpaid executive director , and is a volunteer for the George Phillies campaign .
I have had numerous conversations with Jim Perry about the LPNH situation , as have Shane Cory and Bill Redpath .
As it turned out , the Chair canceled the conference call because he perceived there was no interest in it .
Neither Brendan Kelly or Jim Perry attended the conference call .
Brendan assumed no one was
interested because no one RSVPed ; however , several board members were not aware they were expected to RSVP , did not receive notification that the call was canceled , and held the conference call anyway .
Apparently nothing substantive occurred on that call .
The Chair Brendan Kelly as
well as several other board members had email problems with their ISPs interpreting emails from lpnh.org as spam , which caused some communications difficulties .
When I approached the meeting I let them know that I could either answer some questions so everyone would be on the same page or just sit back and observe the meeting for the LNC .
They chose to ask me questions .
I made it very clear that I was not authorized to speak for the LNC , but
could only relay my own opinions and perspectives .
I relayed the LNC ’s frustration with the George Phillies nomination and pointed out 1 ) that this is very unusual , 2 ) that a petition after the national convention is doable and the national LP is willing to provide significant help , and 3 ) that nominating someone different from national could have severe consequences if the LNC chooses to act .
I made clear that the LNC has not reached a consensus on its response , but that one possible response was disaffiliation taking effect when a different candidate from the one nominated by national was put on the ballot .
In the course of discussion I learned several things :
1 ) I was lead to believe by Jim Perry that the LPNH had disaffiliation on the agenda every board meeting and every board meeting it failed by one vote .
The board told me that was not true : they have never discussed or voted on disaffiliation as a board .
Later Jim
Perry told me what he meant was disaffiliation was always put on the agenda , but people always voted to not consider that agenda item .
He also claimed several board members discuss it regularly outside of board meetings .
I
am skeptical of these claims .
2 ) I was lead to believe by Jim Perry that the LPNH would be fielding a full slate of candidates ( defined as at least one candidate from each district – there are many multi- member state representative districts ) .
In fact only 12 candidates had been recruited so far , with 3 additional candidates recruited at the meeting .
Although even that is impressive so far in advance of the 2008 election , the board was very skeptical of being able to field anywhere near a full slate .
3 ) I was lead to believe by Jim Perry that during the earlier nominating convention a pitch was going to be made for NOTA in which the ramifications of nominating a candidate before the national convention were clearly stated .
The LPNH board told me this did not happen .
Several of them were surprised that Regional Representative Hardy Macia did n’t stand up and make that case .
They assumed that there was nothing wrong with the nomination .
I ’m sure Hardy was not aware that he was allowed to speak for NOTA or that this would be advisable .
Hardy did speak to many ( perhaps all ) of the delegates individually before the vote .
4 ) The entire board believes they are in a lose / lose situation .
They do not believe it is realistically possible to get a candidate on the ballot if petitioning is not began until after the national convention
( Memorial Day 2008 ) .
5 ) John Babiarz claimed several things about petitioning : a ) in 2004 the petitioners sent in by the national LP petitioned simultaneously for Michael Badnarik and Ralph Nader , which rendered all their signatures worthless ; b) George Phillies would need to sign the candidate authorization before petitions are circulated , not to turn in the petitions at the end ; c ) if George Phillies were to withdraw his candidacy after the national convention , the state of New Hampshire would fine him $ 10,000 ; d ) the LPNH has failed to get on the ballot petitioning late several elections in a row , and to continue to do so would certainly result in no candidates making it onto the ballot ; e ) due to a fluke in the election law , even the Republicans and Democrats regularly have several candidates labeled as Republicans and Democrats on the general election ballot for President … therefore supposedly it
would not be at all unusual or inappropriate for the Libertarian Party to have multiple candidates on the general election ballot – because of this they perceived George Phillies + the national convention nominee being on the ballot together ( both listed as Libertarian Party ) as no big deal .
I spent several minutes clarifying this last point to make sure I was absolutely clear on it and they were n’t confusing it with the primary ballot .
They were all quite adamant .
6 ) The board pointed out that candidates can be stacked on the candidate petition , so 3,000 signatures is likely to get many , many candidates on .
A party petition would be substantially more signatures ( 16,000 ) and only make sense if they fielded far more candidates than are likely .
They also claimed with candidate petitions the candidates themselves would circulate them ; whereas with a party petition the candidates would be much less helpful .
In addition , signers can be persuaded to sign a candidate petition much more easily than a party petition – especially by the candidates themselves .
7 ) The board pointed out candidates get ignored by the media until they are on the ballot .
Therefore , the LPNH wants to finish petitioning , file the paperwork , and get its candidates on the ballot as early as possible .
They see waiting until June of 2008 as political suicide .
8 ) The board complained about the severe lateness of the national convention .
They favor a national convention held in or before February .
The suggestion was made to hold presidential nominating
conventions on President ’s Day weekend .
They also would favor conventions far earlier than that , such as summer 2007 .
Another concern of theirs was the inadvisability of holding national conventions during patriotic holiday weekends when Libertarians ( especially candidates ) should be out doing outreach at parades , etc .
They were adamant about my relaying these things to the LNC .
They said one reason they nominated a candidate early was to send a clear message to the national
LP and other states about their frustration with a very late convention .
I suggested a much better course of action would be for the LPNH to pass a resolution criticizing the timing of the national convention and send that resolution to all LNC members and state LPs through registered mail .
In addition I suggested getting more involved in the national process by sending a questionnaire about future convention dates to LNC candidates and by running a slate of people for the LNC in Denver .
9 ) Several board members expressed concerns about the meeting between several LNC members and George Phillies .
These were generally the people who are also volunteering for the Phillies campaign .
They were also very shocked by the idea that the LNC would consider revoking his membership .
I tried to clear some things up , including the lack of consensus or a vote of the LNC at this point .
At the end of the discussion , it was quite clear that most of the board considered any action between the LNC and George Phillies none of their concern .
As a board they were concerned mainly about possible disaffiliation and slightly about national petitioning without coordinating .
10 ) Seth Cohn ( a George Phillies volunteer ) claimed the national LP bylaws specify a strict procedure for disaffiliation and any motion contingent upon future action would not be in accordance with that
procedure .
He also claimed disaffiliation was prohibited within 6 months of a national convention .
And he insisted revoking George Phillies ’ membership would violate a bylaws prohibition of the LNC
interfering with the presidential nomination process .
I have not researched any of this myself to verify or debunk what he claimed .
11 ) LPNH board members were very frustrated with several aspects of the national staff .
They felt Shane Cory overstated his authority when he was discussing this situation with them .
In addition ( somewhat tangentially ) they were very critical of the frequency and content of national LP fundraising letters ( and asked me to relay that concern to the LNC ) .
12 ) There was some discussion of the trademark issue should disaffiliation occur .
This was totally academic for them because they have no plans to disaffiliate .
They claim to have a state trademark on “ Libertarian Party ” that pre-dates our federal trademark .
I explained to them that our federal trademark trumps their state trademark and may be uncontestable .
13 ) Several LPNH board members plan to attend the LNC meeting in Pittsburgh to speak with the LNC and individual LNC members directly .
14 ) MOST IMPORTANTLY :
It is possible to de-nominate George Phillies , but that process was to be extraordinarily difficult .
It would require holding a second nominating convention .
That takes unanimous approval of the LPNH board or a petition by 4/5 of LPNH members .
After the convention is called , a motion to denominate George would have to be proposed on the floor and passed by 2/3 ( I may have some of these numbers wrong … it is from memory ) .
The main difficulty was in getting
the second nominating convention called .
*** As it turns out , we have been dealt a lucky break : the LPNH is FORCED to hold a second nominating convention .
The LPNH nominated Bea Francoeur , a sitting Republican state representative , to run for Governor .
After the convention , she declined their nomination .
She was flattered though and gave it great
consideration .
She joined the LPNH as a life member and started a monthly pledge .
In addition she wanted to run for U.S. Congress as a Libertarian ; however , the LPNH had already nominated candidates for both congressional districts .
The LPNH has no power to fill vacancies ; therefore , they MUST hold a second nominating convention to nominate a new Governor candidate .
That nominating convention requires 60 days notice ( I may have my numbers wrong there ) .
Until a new Governor
candidate is nominated , the LPNH will not be petitioning – because then they would have to petition more in the end since they can stack candidates and the requirement is the same for Governor as President .
The most likely scenario is that they will arrange for the second nominating convention to coincide with their annual convention in October .
*** There are two huge benefits : 1 ) no petitioning is occurring for several months , which gives us a reprieve and some breathing room ; and 2 ) there will be an opportunity to make a motion to de-nominate George Phillies during this mandatory second nominating convention .
From the meeting it was clear that the LPNH has zero confidence in the ability of themselves or of the national LP to get the presidential candidate on the ballot by petitioning after the national convention .
A few of the board members suggested they would nominate George Phillies , the national LP could petition on its own , and they will have an “ I told you so ” ready when national fails .
Rich Tomasso , the editor of LibLines ( the LPNH ’s newsletter ) approached me after the meeting and offered to publish a column from me or another national official giving our perspective about the George Phillies nomination to be disseminated to LPNH members .
The deadline for such a column would have been a week after the meeting .
I declined to write a column myself , but relayed the opportunity to Bill Redpath and Shane Cory .
To my knowledge they declined to write an article due to time constraints , but may still approach Rich about submitting a column for a later issue if that would be possible .
The LPNH was very pleased that I attended the meeting and felt everyone gained more perspective on the issues involved .
The day after the LPNH meeting I had several phone calls with Shane Cory , Bill Redpath , and Richard Winger discussing the contents of the meeting .
Shane Cory had spoken with the New Hampshire Secretary of State ’s office and believed much of the information the LPNH had given me about petitioning was untrue .
He said there is no withdrawal fine or fee .
Per the declaration of intent that all presidential candidates are required to file , it cannot be withdrawn – though they might make exceptions for death and severe personal circumstances .
Here is the link to the declaration of intent .
Bill Redpath admitted it was possible petitioners from national collected signatures for both Ralph Nader and Michael Badnarik , but said the petition coordinator in LPNH and the petitioners themselves did not make him aware of that or he would have done something about it .
Bill insisted collecting 3,000 signatures in LPNH after the national convention is very possible , and indeed quite easy relative to the much more onerous petitioning requirements in many other states .
Richard Winger was very surprised by several of the assertions John Babiarz had made about petitioning .
Richard said he believed them that George Phillies would need to sign the candidate authorization before petitions are circulated ; however , most of the rest of what was claimed
was ludicrous .
Richard had never heard of a withdraw fine , and certainly not a $ 10,000 fine .
He wanted to see proof of this .
He had never heard of Democrats or Republicans having multiple presidential candidates on the general election ballot , and he had looked at many New
Hampshire ballots over the years .
Again , Richard wanted to see proof of this and thought it was very likely they were confusing the general election ballot with the primary ballot .
In addition , Richard pointed out that there are several huge benefits to a party petition .
Candidate petitions are regulated by a large multi-page section of the election code with many prohibitions .
Party petitions are regulated by a small paragraph , half - page section of the election code with very few prohibitions .
This means there is no law preventing a party on the ballot by party petition from cross endorsing candidates .
Also there is no law disqualifying people from signing multiple party petitions .
Richard pointed out that the Working Families Party will be circulating a party petition in New Hampshire , and it may be cost effective for the Libertarian Party to team up with them paying
petitioners to circulate both party petitions together .
Richard wants to see evidence to back up some of John Babiarz ’s assertions about petitioning ( which were shared by the entire LPNH board ) .
I convinced him to call Chair Brendan Kelly on the phone and
either find the evidence or make sure the LPNH is better informed about petitioning realities .
I ’m glad Richard uncovered these discrepancies because I was focused far more on diffusing any possible disaffiliation controversy than with petitioning details .
Another thing Richard pointed out was that Karen Kwiatkowski , the Vice - Presidential candidate nominated by the LPNH , did not want to be in this controversy and would decline the LPNH nomination if it was counter to the will of the national LP .
He put up a story on ballot - access.org
about that .
In reaction to the article , Seth Cohn of the LPNH exchanged several emails with Karen to convince her to accept the LPNH nomination and ignore the LNC .
I am unclear on the status of Karen Kwiatkowski ’s nomination right now .
I can forward those emails to any LNC member interested in that aspect of this controversy .
I ’ve tried to be very comprehensive in this email to bring the LNC up to speed on LPNH .
I figure too much is better than too little .
If LNC members want me to elaborate on any of this , please let me know and I ’ll try my best .

P.S. I spoke with George Phillies extensively at the Georgia LP convention .
George clarified some of what the Massachusetts LP had done , including the bylaws change that would seem to allow Massachusetts to disaffiliate from the national LP and re-affiliate with another entity .
George said his concern was the financial stability of the national LP , which he views as having been very close to bankruptcy several times .
The bylaws provision apparently was intended to allow the Massachusetts to disaffiliate from a bankrupt , defunct national LP and re-affiliate with the new national organization .
George pointed out that a backup corporation named LP US , Inc. was incorporated at the same
time as LNC , Inc. to prepare for this exact situation .

One of the hardest things about starting a home business is that it can cost so much .
In this economy , many people are looking for ways to earn a little extra money in order to provide a safety net — just in case the employment rate continues to sky rocket .
And I admit , it is nice knowing that I have a work from home business that costs very little .
I ’m a freelance writer and editor .
I write for blogs , and I write for print and online publications .
I also provide Web content for businesses .
While the journalistic reporting for print and online publications requires some professional experience and / or education ( to be paid decently ) , it is possible to blog and provide Web content with little more than life experience .
It costs very little to get started — just a computer and an Internet connection .
And some time to look for , and apply for online writing and editing jobs .
You do n’t have to be a writer to start a home business for practically nothing .
Ron over at the Wisdom Journal offers these ideas for low - cost work from home opportunities that you can take advantage of :
1 . Home makeover consulting .
You can offer your services as a baby - proofer or as a green home consultant .
In both cases , it is possible to provide help to homeowners looking to improve their homes .
You can also charge based on the cost of making the changes , so that you do not have to get equipment out of your pocket .
( Or at least you recoup the cost almost immediately . )
When you do the green home consulting , make sure you contract out to professionals who can do work you may not be qualified for ( i.e. electric ) .

2 . Pet training .
Pet sitting is a popular home business , Ron points out .
Instead , try pet training .
If you have managed to train your pet , and you like working with animals , you can offer these services .
3 . Genealogy research .
More people are interested in their roots these days , but do n’t know how to start digging up information on their ancestry .
You can get help from places like Ancestry.com , public records or familysearch.org , a site run by the LDS Church that offers access to free resources .
4 . Teach your talents .
If you are a musician , know a second language , qualified to tutor a school subject or have some sort of craft skill , you can teach others .
For a while , I was a piano teacher .
This month , I start taking guitar lessons from a local musician .
If you are good at some skill , chances are that someone will want to learn it from you .
There are plenty of other ideas for starting a home business with very little capital outlay .
Do you have a home business that you started for practically nothing ?

Prosecutors says some encounters with the boy occurred at a Katz relative 's home in Bergen County .
Amazing discovery of green algae which could save the world from global warming
Melting icebergs , so long the iconic image of global warming , are triggering a natural process that could delay or even end climate change , British scientists have found .
A team working on board the Royal Navy ’s HMS Endurance off the coast of Antarctica have discovered tiny particles of iron are released into the sea as the ice melts .
The iron feeds algae , which blooms and sucks up damaging carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , then sinks , locking away the harmful greenhouse gas for hundreds of years .
British scientists have discovered that green algae could bury CO2 omissions at the bottom of the ocean
The team think the process could hold the key to staving off globally rising temperatures .
Lead researcher Professor Rob Raiswell , from Leeds University , said : ‘ The Earth itself seems to want to save us . ’
As a result of the findings , a ground - breaking experiment will be held this month off the British island of South Georgia , 800 miles south east of the Falklands .
It will see if the phenomenon could be harnessed to contain rising
carbon emissions .
Researchers will use several tons of iron sulphate to create an artificial bloom of algae .
The patch will be so large it
will be visible from space .
Scientists already knew that releasing iron into the sea stimulates the growth of algae .
But environmentalists had warned that to do so artificially might damage the planet ’s fragile ecosystem .
Last year , the UN banned iron fertilisation in the Great Southern Ocean .
The team working on board HMS Endurance off the coast of Antartica have discovered tiny particles of iron are released into the sea as ice melts
However , the new findings show the mechanism has actually been operating naturally for millions of years within the isolated southern waters .
And it has led to the researchers being granted permission by the UN to move ahead with the experiment .
The scientist who will lead the next stage of the study , Professor Victor Smetacek , said : ‘ The gas is sure to
be out of the Earth ’s atmosphere for several hundred years . ’
The aim is to discover whether artificially fertilising the area will create more algae in the Great Southern Ocean .
That ocean is an untapped resource for soaking up CO2 because it does n’t have much iron , unlike other seas .
It covers 20 million square miles , and scientists say that if this could all be treated with iron , the resulting algae would remove three - and - a - half gigatons of carbon dioxide .
This is equivalent to one eighth of all emissions annually created by burning fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal .
It would also be equal to removing all carbon dioxide emitted from every power plant , chimney and car exhaust in the rapidly expanding industries of India and Japan .
Lead researcher Prof Rob Raiswell thinks the process could hold the key to staving off globally rising temperatures
However , the experts warn it is too early to say whether it will work .
The team from ice patrol ship HMS Endurance used sledgehammers to chip deep into the interior of a 33 ft - long mass of polar ice from half - a - dozen house - sized icebergs that had blown ashore in Antarctica .
Once back in the UK , they used a special microscope to analyse the samples , which revealed what they had been looking for – tiny iron particles , only a few millionths of a millimetre wide , embedded deep within the ice .
Until now , it was thought that the only source of iron in the Southern Ocean was wind blowing in metal compounds from the deserts of nearby continents like Australia .
But the research has disproved this .
Prof Raiswell said : ‘ These particles measure only a fraction of a millimetre , but they have great importance for the global climate . ’
Rising global temperatures , particularly over the past 50 years , have increased the rate at which polar ice melts , causing sea levels to rise .
Ten of the warmest years on record have been since 1991 , with experts predicting that 2009 could be the hottest year yet .
The climate - change effect is set to substantially increase over the coming decades , as developing industrial nations pump out more CO2 .
Temperatures along the Antarctic Peninsula alone have increased by 2.5C over the past 50 years .
But for every percentage point increase in the amount of ice that breaks off , Prof Raiswell calculates that a further 26 million tons of CO2 is removed from the atmosphere .
Polar expert Professor Smetacek and a 49 - strong German research team is due to set sail from Cape Town in the icebreaker Polarstern in the next few days to conduct their groundbreaking experiment .
Crucially , the scientists want to know how much algae will sink to the bottom of the ocean where the CO2 will be safely trapped .
Rob Raiswell a geochemist at the University of Leeds believes the project is controversial as they are unsure of the effects on the ecosystem
Algae that falls a couple of miles below the surface will remain there for hundreds of years ; algae that remains only a few hundred metres from the surface releases carbon back into the atmosphere .
Dr Phil Williamson , scientific co-ordinator of the Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere study , funded
by the UK’s National Environment Research Council , called the research ‘ exciting ’ .
‘ We have images from satellites which show the ocean stays green for weeks afterwards but the
key will be whether it stays that way , ’ said Dr Williamson .
Schemes to fertilise the seas with iron have in the past been driven by commercial interests .
This is the biggest ever scientific attempt .
Last May , the UN Convention on Biological Diversity called a halt to fertilisation around the Antarctic until there was more detailed scientific data .
But the British findings led to the go - ahead for Professor Smetacek ’s team from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven , Germany .
Nonetheless , even Prof Raiswell has called the project ‘ highly controversial ’ .
He said : ‘ Oceans are n’t isolated boxes and it would affect the surrounding areas as well .
‘ We do n’t know what effect that would have .
The ecosystems are very complicated .
If the iceberg iron is useful , then it will just buy us more time .
‘ The Earth might have fightback mechanisms but we must still try to reduce our CO2 emissions . ’
Prof Smetacek said the issue is too complex not to be explored by scientists .
He warned : ‘ Objections will be swept away when our powerlessness in the face of climate change becomes apparent . ’
There is a serious effort underway to block OctoMom from taking a million dollar offer to do porn -- except the opposition is coming from a rival XXX company !
Fearing that Nadya Suleman " will become the subject of endless ridicule and scorn , " the president of Pink Visual has offered Octo a " full year 's worth of diapers " if she keeps her baby maker where it belongs ... fully covered and far away from any type of recording device .
In a letter sent to Octo , morally righteous Pink Visual warns , " There 's a great deal of stigma attached to being a porn star " and that Octo needs to think " in the best interest of your children . "
For once .
So what 's it gonna be ?
Do porn ... and get a million bucks , health insurance and benefits -- or keep it covered ... so you can keep your kids clean ?
Decisions , decisions .

An explosion that critically injured the chairman of the Arkansas Medical Board on Wednesday was caused by a bomb , police said .
Dr. Trent Pierce was injured outside his home Wednesday , authorities and local media say .
Dr. Trent Pierce was wounded when the car blew up in front of his West Memphis , Arkansas , home , authorities said .
Earlier , police told CNN affiliate WREG that they did not believe foul play was involved .
Pierce , a family practitioner who specializes in asthma , was flown to a Memphis , Tennessee , hospital in extremely critical condition , the station reported , citing police .
The blast occurred at about 8 a.m. as Pierce got into the car , affiliate WMC - TV reported .
Aerial footage from the scene showed the white SUV with its hood blown up and its front end extensively damaged .
Medical board spokeswoman Peggy Cryer said the board heard Pierce was flown to the hospital but had no definite information beyond that .
" We do not know enough to give any kind of statement , " she said .
Callers to Pierce 's office received an answering machine message saying the office is closed , but the call repeatedly disconnected during the recording , preventing messages from being left .
Doris Davis , who works in an eye doctor 's office next door , said Pierce 's office staff is swamped trying to deal with patients who arrived for their appointments .
FBI spokesman Jason Pack said agents were en route to the scene , along with personnel from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
The FBI is assisting local authorities in their investigation , he said .
West Memphis , Arkansas , and Memphis , Tennessee , are separated by the Mississippi River .
Pierce was described as a pillar of the community in West Memphis , a small town of about 30,000 people .
Davis said Pierce is well - liked , active in his church and is married with two adult children .
She said the FBI was at her office and interviewed her boss , Dr. Eddie Bryant .
Bryant is a close friend of Pierce 's and went to medical school with him , Davis said .

All About Federal Bureau of Investigation
In historical terms , it is impossible to separate Israel 's offensive against Hamas in Gaza from the long narrative of conflict and mutual grievance in the region .
In geographic terms , the war over a tiny plot of land cannot be detached from the wider involvement and strategic interests of other countries : Syria , Egypt , the US , Iran .
All of which makes it difficult to judge where - even if a unilateral Israeli ceasefire holds - the war really begins and ends .
That fact alone explains why the operation represents a defeat for Israel , as was always likely to be the outcome .
The notion that the country 's security problems can be resolved by the unilateral use of extreme force is a persistent delusion among Israeli politicians .
In this case , the problem was perceived to be Hamas rocket fire into southern Israel ; the solution was judged to be a war against Hamas .
That analysis did not allow for the vital , humane recognition that , in densely populated Gaza , an all - out war against Hamas is , by necessity , an attack on the civilian population .
Even on its own terms , the campaign has failed .
Israeli authorities will insist that they have limited the ability of Hamas to launch rocket attacks .
But the ostensible war aim was destroying that capability completely .
Israel will also claim that its campaign has exposed a lack of support for Hamas in many Arab capitals ; that Hamas ' position as the ruling authority in Gaza has been undermined ; and that Hamas has been revealed as little more than a terrorist proxy acting on behalf of and armed by Syria and Iran .
But the reality is that the status of Hamas as the preferred vehicle for Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation has been enhanced by the indiscriminate brutality of the military assault .
Meanwhile , that status guarantees the resurgence , in some form , of armed response , including rocket fire and terrorist attacks on Israeli soil .
It is possible that Hamas ' military capability has been drastically reduced .
But even when Israel had full command of Gaza 's external borders , it could not stop the trade in smuggled weapons .
Sadly , Hamas will re-arm with or without a ceasefire agreement .
Meanwhile , any increased consideration of Iranian or Syrian sponsorship of terrorism will pale against global outrage at the extraordinary disregard shown by Israeli forces for the lives of Palestinian civilians .
It is quite possible , as the Observer today reports , that an Israeli withdrawal will reveal evidence of actions deserving indictment as war crimes .
Those allegations must be independently investigated .
Israel 's allies in the west , chiefly the US , have traditionally defended the country on the grounds that it is a democracy besieged by despotic regimes and terrorists .
But while Israeli citizens do enjoy immense political and social freedom , those values do not automatically prevent the state from committing atrocities .
The fact of Israeli democracy is not a reason to resist negotiations with Hamas .
That was true before this pointless , brutal war and will remain so afterwards .

All UK homes should have access to broadband and faster download speeds by 2012 , the government has said .
An interim report on the UK 's digital future also looked at plans for public service broadcasting .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said digital technology was as important today as " roads , bridges and trains were in the 20th Century " .
But the Conservatives said the report promised " no new action " .
The Lib Dems said it was a " complete damp squib " .
Culture Secretary Andy Burnham told MPs it would help Britain secure a competitive low carbon economy in the next five to 10 years , adding the country " led the world in content creation " .
Every aspect of our lives ... will be dependent on the services that the digital network provides
Gordon Brown
The report called for everyone in the UK to have access to a broadband speed of up to two megabits per second ( Mbps ) .
This would make internet connections capable of handling much more video and sites that offer greater interactivity .
By the time of the final report , the government will know whether internet service providers ( ISPs ) can build next generation networks themselves or if government help will be needed .
Parental control Mr Burnham said that he wanted to ensure public services online were accessible to the widest range of people and wanted to " give parents the information and tools to protect [ their ] children from inappropriate content " .
But opposition politicians said they were disappointed in the report .

At a glance : Digital Britain Shadow culture minister Jeremy Hunt told BBC
News it consisted of little more than promises to make more reports .
" We 're very disappointed .
We thought the report was going to contain a strategy .
David Cameron has said the majority of the population should have access to high - speed broadband in five years .
Instead they [ the government ] have announced another review .
" In France and Germany they are laying fibre , in Japan they already have it .
In Britain the average broadband speed is 3.6 M bps so what he [ Andy Burnham ] is talking about is getting half the current speed , " he added .
" We 're the second largest exporter of music and television and third for film .
But when it comes to the distribution of digital content , we 're lagging " .
The report also looked at the issue of internet piracy .
Mr Burnham said the government would look at setting up a new digital rights agency and wanted to introduce legislation requiring internet service providers to notify illegal file - sharers directly about their activity .

" The report identifies news at local , regional and national level and children 's programming as amongst the key priorities , " he said .
" The BBC - as an enabling force is central to this - strong and secure in its own future , working in partnership with others to deliver these objectives .
" We will also explore how we can establish a sustainable public service organisation which offers scale and reach alongside the BBC , building on the strength of Channel 4 . "
Communications watchdog
Ofcom last week warned Channel 4 faced a bleak future unless a deal could be reached .
The Liberal Democrats said the minister had failed to live up to his promises .
Speaking to the BBC , the Lib Dem 's culture , media and sport spokesman , Don Foster , said the report was " bitterly disappointing " .
" In September , the minister said ... ' Early in the New Year , Ofcom can conclude its review and the government can announce decisions and the process to implement those decisions ' .
But we have no decision , " he said .
" He failed to rule out top slicing .
He welcomed discussion between ITV and the BBC , between Channel 4 and the BBC , but no decision .
" We 've spent lots of money on reviews , but all we now have is a strategy group , an umbrella body , a delivery group , a rights agency , a exploratory review , a digital champion and an expert task force .
" This report has been a complete damp squib . "
Future radio
The report also examined the future of radio .
The culture secretary said digital audio broadcasting ( DAB ) will become the " primary distribution network " , potentially giving notice for the end of traditional FM analogue radio .
The government will also look at how the digital switch - over scheme - introduced for TV - could be expanded to help the radio transition .
The prime minister , speaking at the New Local Government Network in central London , said that the digital economy would play a crucial part in lifting Britain out of recession .
" Today we have an interim report from Lord Carter setting out the scale of our ambition to compete in the digital economy and that 's a market worth about £ 50bn a year , " he said .
" It affects every community in our country who are looking for the best digital infrastructure , access to broadband , that we can offer them .
" We know that every aspect of our lives in local communities - every school , every hospital , every workplace and even every home - will be dependent on the services that the digital network provides . "

Emacs has a feature where it can automatically convert leading spaces to tabs .
This is controlled by the indent - tabs - mode variable .
I find mixing tabs and spaces extremely annoying as graphical diff tools will often display a tab and an equivalent number of spaces differently .
Therefore I like to disable this behaviour .
However , the obvious solution does n’t work .
( setq indent - tabs - mode nil )
The documentation explains the reason
Its value is nil indent - tabs - mode is a variable defined in ` C source code ’ .
Its value is nil Automatically becomes buffer - local when set in any fashion . …
I ’m surprised it works like this .
Fortunately , there is a simple fix :
( customize - set - variable ' indent - tabs - mode nil )
If it was n’t a customizable variable you might use something similar to the following .
( add - hook ' first - change - hook ( lambda ( ) ( setq indent - tabs - mode nil ) ) )
Update : ( setq - default ... ) looks like a better solution .
Thanks to Ron for the tip .

The president 's $ 75 billion housing plan will help as many as 9 million U.S. homeowners refinance their mortgages if they owe more than their home is worth or avoid foreclosure if their payments are climbing beyond their reach .
The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan will help more people than expected .
But there will be no assistance for speculators who bought multiple homes as investments , or for people who bought homes they could n't afford and then tapped all their home equity .
" The plan I 'm announcing focuses on rescuing families who have played by the rules and acted responsibly , " President Barack Obama said during his speech at Mesa 's Dobson High School .
Before Obama 's speech , top White House advisers also emphasized that the goal of the plan is to stabilize the housing market for all homeowners .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ; Sheila Bair , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairwoman ; and Shaun Donovan , Housing and Urban Development secretary , accompanied the president to the Valley to discuss the housing plan .
Details on exactly how it will work will be released on March 4 .
Leveling out mortgages
A key element of the initiative will allow up to 5 million borrowers who owe more than their house is worth to refinance through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
That provision will help tens of thousands of homeowners in the Valley , where home prices have fallen more than 45 percent .
" I have not lost my job , so I can pay my mortgage , but it ( the home ) is worth less than I owe , " said Sharon Bonds of Surprise .
" I 'm not greedy .
I 'm not an investor .
I just have my one home .
This is going to help me . "
Previously , homeowners who were underwater with their mortgages , owing more than their home is currently worth , could n't refinance with the mortgage giants .
Now many in Arizona can .
Homeowners who have mortgages of more than $ 500,000 are not likely to qualify for aid , as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will typically guarantee only loans for less than that amount in Arizona .
The housing plan will also assist as many as 4 million U.S. homeowners facing or already in foreclosure but who still own their homes .
Avoiding foreclosure
For this group , the federal government will provide matching funds to lenders to lower interest payments on loans .
The plan requires that mortgage payments be no more than 31 percent of monthly incomes .
" We have never missed a payment , " Marilyn Uhl said .
She lives in Mesa with her husband , who is a mortgage broker making much less money because of the housing downturn .
" We are trying to make our house payments on my public - school teacher salary .
Honestly we need help , " she said .
Foreclosures push down overall home values .
A new White House statistic shows every foreclosure in a neighborhood can reduce home values in that area by 9 percent .
" All Americans have a stake in making this work , not just those Americans who were the victim of bad underwriting standards or in communities where you 've seen foreclosures , " Geithner said .
The government wants to entice lenders to work with more homeowners before they go into foreclosure .
Lenders can earn $ 500 for each modified loan that enables a borrower to afford the payment and avoid foreclosure .
Borrowers , who stay current on modified mortgage payments , can get up to a $ 5,000 reduction in the principal they owe .
Donovan said government estimates show another 6 million U.S. homeowners will go into foreclosure during the next few years without this plan .
Last year , 2.2 million houses were foreclosed on nationwide .
Not everyone will get help
People who own a home but do not live in that home will not be eligible for relief , including individuals and speculators who bought multiple homes as investments .
Also , people who have too much debt and can't afford a mortgage payment even with significant rate cuts wo n't be eligible for the loan modifications .
" This plan will not save every home , " Obama said .
" It will not rescue the unscrupulous or irresponsible by throwing good taxpayer money after bad loans . "
The Judiciary Committee was originally scheduled to vote today on Holder ’s nomination as attorney general , but Republicans have objected .
Holder confirmation delayed
Eric Holder ’s confirmation vote before the Judiciary Committee will be delayed for up to a week as Republican senators continue to press him on his views about interrogation and other Bush administration intelligence methods .
The Judiciary Committee was originally scheduled to vote today on Holder ’s nomination as attorney general , but Republicans have objected , and under committee rules they can delay the vote for up to a week .
Holder was grilled last week by Republicans on his views about interrogations , Guantanamo Bay and his involvement in the 2001 pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich .

Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) is seeking more information from Holder on whether the Department of Justice will pursue criminal prosecutions of " intelligence personnel " involved in detainee interrogations .
Holder declared that " waterboarding is torture " during last week 's session in the Judiciary Committee .
That statement raises the possibility that the government agents who used the method , which simulates drowning , could be prosecuted .
Holder said that the Obama administration does not want to " crimilinalize policy disputes " with the Bush White House during that hearing , but Republicans want a more firm commitment from the prospective attorney general .
" It could well be there will be a request to delay the markup for a week so those questions can be asked and answered , " Cornyn said .
" Part of my concern relates to his statements at the hearing with regard to torture and what his intentions are toward our intelligence personnel who were operating in good faith based on their understanding of what the law was . "
Graham said Judiciary Committee Republicans were upset by the lack of " comity and witnesses " given them during the hearing .

We here at Prose Before Hos editorial staff want to join with fellow bloggers in denouncing California ’s Proposition 8 , and supporting our gay brothers and sisters fight for equal rights .
We categorically believe that a motion to deny gays the right to marriage is a direct violation of civil rights provided by the Constitution .
Further , in time of great economic and diplomatic distress , it is both a fundamental waste of time and resources to lobby such a campaign when so much more imperils our nation .
As the battle enters its final weekend , the budget tally is astonishing : $ 67 million dollars in donation have poured from all over the country into California for the vote on Prop 8 .
Religion has taken on an interesting dynamic in the race as Mormons figure to account for between 40 to 70 percent of all donations to the Yes cause .
Here is an interesting excerpt :
Those words speak for Michele Sundstrom , 47 , of San Jose , who has been married for 18 years and has five children .
She and her husband gave $ 30,000 to the Yes on 8 campaign and put a sign on their home .
But in response , two women parked an SUV in front of their home , with the words “ Bigots live here ” painted on the windshield .
Sundstrom believes such responses must come from deep places of pain – and that gays and lesbians are entitled to the same rights as heterosexuals , just not the word marriage .
Any animosity toward gays or lesbians is wrong , she said .
“ There must be such deep , deep , deep hurt ; otherwise there could n’t be so much opposition , ” she said .
“ They ’ve lived with this .
I guess we ’re getting a taste of where they live . ”
Oddly enough two out of four of the latest news posts on the pro-Prop 8 website take a racial bent , my favorite being “ NAACP Los Angeles President Alice Huffman Sells Out Black Families . ”
Perhaps selling families is n’t the best metaphor to use … or maybe it ’s THE best ?
The No on Prop 8 site mostly talks about people who are against Prop 8 .
I do n’t know , but are people really swayed by whether or not Ugly Betty wants gay marriage ?
While it seems as if young people would be the most open to this argument by authority style advertisement , young people have started shifting towards a Yes vote in recent days .
And while Obama has energized the young liberal base in ways no politician has in recent years , he too is opposed to gay marriage , though for civil unions .
In any case , here is what Feministe recommends to help defeat this anti-gay legislation .
Users of Wikipedia have seen off a threat that the website would be forced to carry advertisements or charge for access , after one of the most successful online fundraising campaigns ever .
The free online encyclopaedia was struggling to raise $ 6 m ( £ 4.1 m ) to cover its running costs for 2009 and launched a campaign seeking donations on 3 November .
Money was coming in at the rate of about $ 30,000 a day but the drive appeared unlikely to reach its goal , which was $ 4.5 m more than the $ 1.5 m the site raised to cover costs last year .
So Wikipedia 's founder , Jimmy Wales , took the unusual step of publishing a personal appeal for donations , warning that unless the target was reached the site might be forced to start carrying adverts , which at the moment it does not do , and even introduce a subscription fee .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In his letter , which was posted online on 23 December , Mr Wales wrote : " Wikipedia is different .
It 's the largest encyclopaedia in history , written by volunteers .
Like a national park or a school , we do n't believe advertising should have a place in Wikipedia .
We want to keep it free and strong , but we need the support of thousands of people like you .
I invite you to join us : Your donation will help keep Wikipedia free for the whole world . "
And his tactic worked .
In the following 24 hours the site received 8,186 donations , compared to just 800 the previous day .
Before his appeal the site , which attracts about 254 million visitors a month , was receiving about $ 30,000 a day , but that rose to more than $ 215,000 after the letter was published .
And , on 1 January , the total crept past the crucial $ 6 m mark .
Many of the donations came from individual users and were from as little as $ 5 .
The largest was an annual pledge of $ 1 m for three years , and an anonymous donation of $ 250,000 was also received .
Arcadia , a grant - making group based in London , gave $ 100,000 .
Jay Walsh , a spokesman for Wikipedia , said : " We 're really thrilled that people have come out in force and made a clear statement that they care about this cause and they care about Wikipedia , even though we were kind of nervous after the economic news became really clear . "
Wikipedia was founded by Mr Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001 with a format that allows pages on topics to be created and edited by the public .
It has an editing team of 150,000 volunteers , but just 23 members of staff .
In eight years the site has grown to 12 million pages and is seen by many as a first - port - of - call for information on pretty much any subject .
However it has suffered criticism .
The reliability of the site has been repeatedly questioned due to the fact that anyone , without stating who they are , can change Wikipedia entries .
This has led to many malicious and some entirely fictitious entries .
This lack of reliability has also spawned rivals .
Google launched Knol last year , while Mr Sanger left Wikipedia and launched Citizendium in 2007 .
The feature of both is that all entries are attributed to real people .
And while the site and its reliability have provoked some controversy , so too has its founder , Mr Wales .
Last year he hit the headlines after a particularly acrimonious break - up with his ex-girlfriend Rachel Marsden , a US political pundit .
After altering his Wikipedia page to alert Ms Marsden to the fact that the two were separated – " I am no longer involved with Rachel Marsden , " Mr Wales wrote – the entrepreneur faced bitter recriminations in the form of an eBay fire - sale of items of clothing he had left at her flat .

He appeared in the Wangaratta Magistrates ' Court earlier today before magistrate Lance Martin on one count of murder .
Dale says he will vigorously defend the charge against him .
He represented himself in court and proclaimed his innocence , saying police inquiries had gone on for five years and any further delay was an abuse of process .
The final two chapters of 10 Moral Paradoxes are celebratory .
We are told itâ€™s good to think about moral paradoxes because they are fun , they can help us see the good in bad , they can help us make decisions , they can get us accustomed to uncertainty , deepen our understanding of morality , etc. etc. etc .
But hereâ€™s my question .
If paradoxes are so good for us , why do they make people so mad ?
You may have noticed in the comments here that there was an occasional outburst of impatience .
I noticed this up close , in the philosophy lab known as my dinner table .
Interestingly , the paradoxes didnâ€™t all get the same reaction .
Blackmail and retirement were fun to discuss , as were the paradoxes about punishment .
I was surprised by the very negative reaction to paradox # 6â € ” my own favorite .
I put it to my husband and children this way : say you are an African American happy to exist , and happy to live here in the US .
You regularly rail against slavery and consider it abhorrent .
Yet , without it your ancestors wouldnâ€™t have met here , and you wouldnâ€™t have existed , and you certainly wouldnâ€™t have lived in the US .
Are you sure youâ€™re sorry that Africans were enslaved ?
I was surprised this wonderfully interesting question was met with much philosophy - bashing .
After recovering from the rejection and scorn , I got to thinking .
As I believe I mentioned at the dinner table , part of paradoxophobia is a dislike of uncertainty and puzzlement , which is simply not good .
Then again , perhaps there really is something particularly annoying about paradox # 6 .
Instead of hurling invectives at philosophy , we might say this to comfort ourselves :
In the naÃ¯ve state we really are sorry about some things and glad about others .
These â€œpre- integratedâ€ attitudes do reveal much about â€ œwho we are .â€ 
In fact , thereâ€™s maybe even something weird about focusing on these links between past and present , arbitrary and fortuitous as they are .
We get particularly strong â€œskewingâ€  when the later good event is our own existenceâ € ” or the existence of someone we imagine as ourselves .
Itâ€™s highly unappealing to imagine a world without ourselves .
Bottom line : the attitudes revealed by the paradox arenâ€™t particularly the attitudes of my â€œtrue selfâ€  or my â€œbest selfâ€  or my most rational self .
With that realization , maybe we can just live with the paradox instead of trying to overcome it .
Â
I ’m not sure , but the same strategy might help us live with some of the other paradoxes as well .
Well , all good things have to come to an end .
Iâ€™ve really enjoyed reading and writing about 10 Moral Paradoxes .

Sketchy rumor Sunday , people -- Chinese site Apple.pro is saying there 's a 15 - inch MacBook Air in the works .
That would certainly be an interesting compromise between portability and screen real estate , especially since the Air 's new NVIDIA - based internals are actually somewhat capable , but we would n't bank on big brother making an appearance just yet -- although Apple.pro was right on the money with leaked unibody MacBook pictures , it 's also been way off in the past .
Anyone else mildly intrigued by the idea of a thin 'n'light with big screen ?
Comments await .

Nach 80 Jahren Zugehörigkeit zum General - Motors - Konzern erhält der Autobauer Opel eine weit gehende Selbstständigkeit .
Wie der Europachef des US - Konzerns , Carl - Peter Forster , am Freitag in Rüsselsheim sagte , soll das Gros der europäischen GM - Aktivitäten unter dem Dach von Opel zusammengefasst werden .
Die Politik reagierte positiv auf die Pläne .
Das neue Unternehmen brauche in den nächsten ein bis zwei Jahren Staatshilfen im Umfang von 3,3 Milliarden Euro , sagte Forster .
GM als bisherige Alleineigentümerin sei bereit , zunächst 25 bis 50 Prozent der Anteile an Opel an neue Eigner abzugeben .
Der US - Konzern wolle dem neuen Unternehmen Sachwerte und Patente im Wert von drei Milliarden Euro zur Verfügung stellen .
Ein späterer Rückzug von General Motors auf eine Minderheitsbeteiligung wurde nicht ausgeschlossen .
Um gemeinsam Teile einkaufen und neue Technologien entwickeln zu können , solle Opel aber weiterhin Teil des weltweiten GM - Verbundes bleiben , sagte der GM - Europachef .
Das neue Unternehmen wird die Marken Opel und Vauxhall samt aller Produktionsstandorte , aber nicht die schwedische Marke Saab umfassen .
Das vom Opel - Aufsichtsrat beschlossene und von GM gebilligte Zukunftskonzept soll nun der Bundesregierung und den Ländern mit Opel - Standorten vorgelegt werden .
Das Konzept gilt als wesentliche Voraussetzung für die Gewährung staatlicher Hilfen an Opel .
Der Vorsitzende des Gesamtbetriebsrats , Klaus Franz , sagte , Opel werde nach 80 Jahren Zugehörigkeit zu GM neu gegründet .
Er schlug vor , das Unternehmen in eine Aktiengesellschaft umzuwandeln , an der sich möglichst alle europäischen Länder mit Opel und Vauxhall - Standorten beteiligen sollten .
Opel ist bislang als GmbH organisiert .
Schulden sollen bis 2015 beglichen werden
Das neue Unternehmen könne bis 2011 wieder schwarze Zahlen schreiben und wolle bis 2014 oder 2015 seine Schulden an die öffentliche Hand zurückzahlen , sagte der GM - Europachef .
Forster erinnerte an das Ziel von GM , in Europa Arbeitskosten in einer Größenordnung von 1,2 Milliarden Dollar ( 950 Millionen Euro ) einzusparen .
Es werde über Lohn - und Gehaltsverzichte sowie freiwillige Abfindungsmaßnahmen gesprochen werden müssen .
Wie viele Arbeitsplätze in den nächsten Jahren abgebaut werden müssen , ließen Management und Betriebsrat offen .
Vizekanzler Frank - Walter Steinmeier ( SPD ) bekräftigte die grundsätzliche Bereitschaft der Bundesregierung , Opel zu helfen .
Auch Bundeswirtschaftsminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg begrüßte das Konzept , wollte sich aber zu seiner Tragfähigkeit nicht äußern .
Die hessische Landesregierung sagte eine rasche und konstruktive Prüfung des Opel - Rettungsplans zu .
Thüringen kündigte an , Bürgschaften und Darlehen für Opel zu prüfen .
Auch Rheinland - Pfalz betonte seine Bereitschaft zur Hilfe .
Nach Einschätzung der IG
Metall schafft der vom Aufsichtsrat verabschiedete Plan die Grundlage für das Überleben von Opel als europäischer Automobilkonzern .
„ Die Tür zur Opel Europa AG ist offen “ , sagte IG Metall - Bezirksleiter und Opel - Aufsichtsratsmitglied Armin Schild .
Zugleich warnte er vor Euphorie .
„ Wir haben noch eine lange Wegstrecke vor uns .
Das Risiko einer unnötigen und unsinnigen Insolvenz ist noch nicht vom Tisch , “ erklärte er .
Birtukan Mideksa has been sentenced to life in prison .
She spends her days and nights in solitary confinement in a two - metre by two - metre cell .
She can not leave it to see daylight or even to receive visitors .
Previous inmates say the prison is often unbearably hot .
Her crime : refusing to say sorry .
The judge , aged 34 , is the head of Ethiopia 's most popular political party , the only female leader of a main opposition party in Africa .
The government in Addis Ababa had her arrested on 28 December , claiming she had violated the terms of an earlier pardon .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Her previous release in 2007 , which came after serving two years in prison , was conditional on her signing an apology for taking part in protests against fixed elections .
In November , the woman who is becoming a democratic icon in Ethiopia told an audience in Sweden that she had not asked for a pardon .
On returning to Ethiopia it was demanded that she sign further apologies and , when she refused , she was re-arrested .
The Ministry of Justice then issued a statement reimposing her life sentence .
Mesfin Woldemariam , an award - winning Ethiopian human rights campaigner , is clear about what she says is going on : " She refuses to bow to them .
They want her to submit , but she did n't submit when she was a judge .
That 's why she left the bar .
And she wo n't now .
She 's a tough cookie . "
She won national acclaim by defying government control of the courts and resigning the bar to practice law after high - profile decisions were overturned .
The charges against her go to the heart of Ethiopia 's experiment with democracy in 2005 and the violent backlash that followed the country 's flawed first attempt at a multi-party election .
When demonstrators , including Ms Mideksa , took to the streets to protest at the skewed results which returned the ruling party , the police opened fire , killing at least 187 people .
The opposition leadership , along with thousands of others , were rounded up and jailed .
" In 2005 , we expected the results of the national parliamentary elections as a strong foundation for building a temple of democracy in Ethiopia , " she told a US Senate hearing in 2007 .
" Our hopes were dashed , and we found ourselves trapped in a burning house of tyranny . "
Her response since being released has been to unite the fragments of opposition into a single party committed to non-violence , democratic reform and an independent judiciary .

A mother who has missed much of her five - year - old daughter 's life so far , she has shown remarkable courage .
" I 'm not afraid of going to jail , " she said last year after founding the Unity for Democracy and Justice Party .
" Not because that is not a possibility .
I know that could happen . "
Professor Woldemariam was with her when it did happen .
Five cars pulled up and the pair were confronted violently by police while on a street in the capital city .
" They behaved as if there was a prize for the first person who got her , " the former Fulbright scholar and now professor of geography recalls .
When he asked why they had not issued a warrant and asked her to give herself into custody , one of the men turned on him .
" He hit me with the butt of his gun and they pushed her into a car and took her . "
Her destination was a cell in the notorious Kaliti prison outside the capital Addis Ababa .
It 's a place with which she is already intimately acquainted , where prisoners are kept in conditions she once described as " dehumanising " , " atrocious " and " barbarous " .
The UK director of Amnesty International , Kate Allen , said : " There appears to be no lawful reason why Birtukan Mideksa was arrested or remains in detention .
She has now been held for a month in solitary confinement and still has not been charged .
This is unacceptable . "
Ethiopia 's Prime Minister , Meles Zenawi , has been in power since 1995 .
He was formerly feted as a progressive voice by Tony Blair but he has become markedly dictatorial during his years in power .
One regional analyst said the government was becoming increasingly paranoid .
" This came in the context of an election that the government lost control of in 2005 , and ahead of 2010 elections that it fully intends to keep from going the same way . "
Recently , laws have been passed to heavily restrict the work of international non-government organisations , despite an ongoing famine in areas of the country .
" Much of the government 's behaviour stems from security concerns , and a lack of understanding that improving human rights will actually help to mitigate many of their concerns , " said the analyst .
Professor Woldemariam , one of a few people still prepared to speak out in a country he describes as a " police state " , says the regime had become frightened of Ms Mideksa .
" They are looking for any excuse to get her because she 's a dynamic girl who is getting increasingly popular .
They want to cut her short . "
But it will not be easy to intimidate her , he believes .
" She has such faith in the law .
She says to me , ' the law says this , the law says that ...'.
I said to her : ' What law are you talking about ?
You were locked up for two years with no due process . ' "
Described as an " Ethiopian Obama " and a brilliant speaker and organiser , she has become a symbol of democracy in her own country , compared with figures like Burma 's Aung San Suu Kyi .
There is reported to be deep disquiet among the general population at her arrest and conditions of detention , even though their dissent is not tolerated .
Ethiopia , largely Orthodox Christian , has been a staunch ally of the American - led war on terror and a partner in its disastrous policy on Somalia .
The arrest of Ms Mideksa has sparked criticism from some American senators and the hope that the Obama administration might change Washington 's relationship with the Zenawi government .
" There is no democracy in Ethiopia today , despite empty claims of ' recent bold democratic initiatives ' taken by our government , " Ms Mideksa told US senators .
Many in Ethiopia and its large diaspora are hoping that Mr Obama 's offer to " extend a hand " to dictatorships who would unclench their fists included a message to Addis Ababa .
Ms Mideksa has already given Washington her advice : " Ethiopia has many problems , including a legacy of repression , corruption and mismanagement .
The US can help by using its considerable influence to encourage the government to negotiate with the opposition .
It will not be easy to confront the past .
" We must start at the right point by embracing the rule of law , human rights and democracy . "
Views from cyberspace :
What the blogs say
* There is an old Ethiopian proverb which in translation says , " Oh , Mr Hyena , do n't give me excuse to eat me " .
( Aya jibo sata mehagne blagne ) .
Why is Zenawi resorting to such thuggish tactics against Birtukan ?
And Professor Mesfin ?
And the [ Unity for Democracy and Justice Party ] ?
Is he trying to create a convenient distraction from his devastating defeat in Somalia ?
- Quatero News and Views
* Birtukan has modelled courage and conviction .
I do not think she is asking the Ethiopian people to personally rescue her ; but instead , on behalf of others .
- Anyuak Media
* Birtukan Mideksa continues to impress millions of her fellow compatriots to promote the struggle forthe triumph of democracy over tyranny .
- Ethiomedia
* In fact , the Ethiopian tyrant has killed far more innocent people than the Zimbabwean tyrant .
The Ethiopian tyrant also has rigged national elections for three times like the Zimbabwean tyrant .
I hope and I believe democrats as well as President Obama will restore respect for the US by supporting people who aspire for their democratic rights .

PETA reminded Cannon that eating meat can lead to obesity , diabetes , heart disease , and other health problems .
They claim that taxing it would persuade people to eat less meat , and instead eat more plant - based proteins , thus improving health and welfare in the state .
The meat industry is also responsible for a large portion of human - caused greenhouse gas emissions , so cutting meat out of Oregonians ’ diets would help the state reach their climate change goals .
“ Slapping a long - overdue tax on artery - clogging meat would save countless lives , ” said PETA Director Sarah King .
“ After all , it ’s better to drink Rogue ’s Dead Guy Ale than to wind up as its mascot . ”
Check out the full letter :
February 20 , 2009
The Honorable Ben Cannon
Oregon House of Representatives
Via e-mail : rep.bencannon@state.or.us
Dear Representative Cannon :
As an Oregon native and a beer aficionado , I was extremely interested to read about the bill that you recently sponsored to increase Oregon ’s tax on beer .
On behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) and our more than 2 million members and supporters worldwide , including thousands of Oregonians , I ’d like to propose an alternative that would keep beer — a product that ’s important to the state ’s economy — affordable , yet still bring in needed revenue : an excise tax on meat .
A 10 - cent “ sin ” tax on every pound of chicken , turkey , pig , fish , and cow flesh sold in grocery stores and restaurants would not only raise funds but also help stop climate change and reduce health - care costs .
Tobacco , alcohol , gasoline , and luxury vehicles are all taxed because of the negative impact that they have on the environment and / or human health , so it makes sense to add meat to the group .
Please consider the following :
Meat is the number one cause of climate change , which threatens the U.S. with billions of dollars in damages from rising sea levels , worsening storms , and increased droughts .
According to a 2006 United Nations report , the meat industry produces 40 percent more greenhouse - gas emissions than all the cars , trucks , SUVs , planes , and ships in the world combined .
A tax on meat would help recoup some of the environmental costs associated with its production .
Meat is a leading contributor to many of the worst health problems that Americans face .
According to the American Dietetic Association , vegetarians have lower rates of obesity heart disease , certain types of cancer , and diabetes than meat - eaters do .
Just like the excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol , a meat tax could be used to promote health and well - being through educational programs .
With this proposal , a typical meat - eating family of four would pay only about $ 5 per month , and families who replace the meat in their diets with healthy vegetarian foods would likely save thousands of dollars in medical expenses over time .
Revenue shortages and climate change are two of America ’s biggest problems .
Adding a “ sin ” tax on meat could help alleviate these problems , in addition to improving the health of Oregon ’s residents .
After all , it ’s better to drink Rogue ’s Dead Guy Ale than to wind up as its mascot .
You can learn more about this proposal at TaxMeat.com .
Thank you for your consideration .
Sincerely ,
Sarah King
Director
It ’s a simple premise that has expanded from outwitting a single enemy unit into outthinking collective AI .
Instead of staying out of a guard ’s line of sight , you must now utilize dynamic light sources to make sure your shadow is n’t detected .
Instead of a small room with one predestined outcome , you have entire islands with bountiful foliage to disguise whatever you feel like doing .
And perhaps our favorite question - “ Do we kill that guy or let him live and find a way around ? ”
For your pleasure is a quick , pictorial history through the stealth subgenre .
Happy hunting and do n’t forget to comment on your favorite stealth games .
Wolfenstein series - 1981-2009
In the original Castle Wolfenstein for the Apple II , you needed to slowly traverse the Nazi castle , find secret plans and get out alive .
Mostly you ’d spend the game sneaking past guards with disguises .
It was n’t until 3D ( the third game ) that killing was necessary .
In fact , many stealth elements were deleted from 3D to make the game quicker .
We ’ve been shotgunning mutant Nazis ever since .
With glee .
Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid series - 1987-2008
Hideo Kojima can almost be directly responsible for incorporating stealth elements into modern action / adventure games .
Each game is designed so that you can play without engaging the enemy .
The NES originals were the first mainstream stealth games on consoles .
Solid 2 introduced collective / group AI for patrolling squads , while Solid 3 introduced camouflage to the genre .
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – 1989
You would think any time ninjas are in a game , there would be stealth .
Maybe because this game used stealth in a crappy and unforgiving way - in which you avoided tanks on an overworld map - the Ninja Turtles were then known for beat - ‘ em-ups .
It ’s cool , we like beating the crap out of numerous enemies with our ninja weapons anyway .
Alien versus Predator series – 1994 -2003
In this series of games ( originating on Jaguar ) , you ’re able to play as a colonial marine , Predator or Alien .
As the Predator , you ’re able to use a cloaking device to become invisible and can hunt using an infrared vision mode .
Clock Tower series – 1995 - 2003
In this classic survival - horror series , you explore a creepy castle while a demented killer - the aptly titled Scissorman - hunts for your blood .
A 2D point - and - click adventure on the PC , CT makes use of the gamepad on SNES and PlayStation for your evading abilities .
Even if Scissorman is hilariously slow , it was always frightening whenever that little guy showed up .
Oddworld series – 1997 - 2001
This critically acclaimed series is almost forgotten by time .
Control either Abe ( in the 2D PlayStation games ) or Munch ( in the Xbox follow - up ) to save members of your species through communication and possession .
Very rarely do you engage enemy Slogs ( bad guys ) .
Final Fantasy VII – 1997
There are few parts where sneaking is in order : a brief segment when you infiltrate Shinra headquarters or don a disguise to sneak into a military parade .
Did we mention an extended segment where you dress in drag to rescue Tifa ?
Or our favorite : tip - toeing out of Aerith ’s house after you survived an explosion .
Totally a guy thing to do .
GoldenEye – 1997
After our fifth failed firefight against multiple Russians , we realized that destroying security cameras and Judo - chopping those Pinkos from behind was the best way to go during certain missions of this N64 fave .
Tenchu series – 1998 - present
Released months before the original Metal Gear Solid - making it the first 3D stealth game ever , Tenchu demonstrated how to make a ninja game properly .
Scale rooftops , toss daggers or slowly stalk an enemy right before slicing his throat .
The subsequent titles were all a little ‘ eh . ’
Thief series – 1998 - 2004
The Dark Project holds the distinction of being the first 3D stealth game on the PC .
Not only was it the first game to also utilize lighting and shadows for hiding , but also the first to use audio cues like footsteps and eavesdropping .
Incredibly immersive and one of the best PC series ’ of all time .
Legend of Zelda series – 1998 - 2007
The famed adventure series does n’t usually favor flight over fight , but there are sections that rely on your cunning to progress .
For example , Ocarina of Time tasked you with sneaking by guards into Hyrule castle , Wind Waker had you avoiding beasties in the Forsaken Fortress and Phantom Hourglass ’
Temple of the Ocean King was filled with beefy soldiers you could n’t best .
In October , an accountant at 321 Takeoff Inc. in New York became suspicious after an employee who normally filed weekly expense reports for around $ 80 began requesting $ 120 .
When Alona Fromberg - Elkayam , the branding agency 's president , approached the employee , she says she was met with flimsy excuses .
She fired the employee , a midlevel designer .
In the wake of the recession , more businesses are facing a growing financial threat : employee theft .
New research shows that employers are seeing an increase in internal crimes , ranging from fictitious sales transactions and illegal kickbacks to the theft of office equipment and retail products meant for sale to customers .
Employers suspect that workers are pilfering from them to cope with financial difficulties at home or in anticipation of being laid off .
What 's more , it 's often the most trusted workers who are committing the thefts .
Literally .
Earlier this week our family returned from a quick vacation .
Now , I left my laptop at home , and while I brought my cell phone , it stayed turned off the entire time we were gone .
That does n't mean we were gadget - free during our vacation ... we just adapted to our surroundings .
If you listened to The GeekDads : Episode 38 , you know that the GeekMom and I took the kids on a Disney Cruise .
We did NOT fly from Wisconsin down to Florida - we drove .
Yes , 21 hours in the burbmobile ... thank you to whomever thought of in - van DVD players .
Twenty - one hours from Wisconsin to Port Canveral , Florida .
To aid us in the trip we had :
a Garmin Nuvi ( never question the lady in the box ... but that 's another post )
twenty - one family - friendly DVDs
family - friendly DVDs seven MP3 players ( for a family of six )
MP3 players ( for a family of six ) three Nintendo DS , and one Nintendo Gameboy Advanced SP
Nintendo DS , and one Nintendo Gameboy Advanced SP two digital cameras ( we 're guessing that only one survived )
Our burbmobile takes six DVDs at a time .
We loaded up the changer and played in order .
I think we got through 8 or 10 of the DVDs on the round - trip .
Seven MP3 players - the GeekMom brought two - because she was listening to audio books and we do n't have a car - charger for either of her MP3 players .
The Nindento DS and the picto - chat was really fun to watch in the Disney Cruise terminal .
Our kids were chatting with people they did n't ( knowingly ) meet face - to - face ... but hey , it passed the time between our check - in and when we were allowed on - board .
The digital cameras - well , I had one , my oldest GeekTeen had the other .
I put the family digi-cam in my swimsuit pocket and soon after jumped into one of the pools on - board the ship .
A less - than - family - friendly word escaped my lips when I realized what had happened .
The digi-cam is sitting in a container with uncooked rice in an attempt to revive it .
The jury 's still out on this one .
We had a fantastic time ( and this GeekDad highly recommends a Disney Cruise for the family [ or just the GeekMom and GeekDad ] * ) , and the kids were troopers considering we spent nearly two full days in our van .
So what gadgets go with you when you go on vacation ?
* this GeekDad is getting nothing for recommending a Disney Cruise - he 's just hooked on cruising with a magical mouse ...

If Americans Knew
Last Updated April 2013
In the late 1800s a small , fanatic movement called “ political Zionism ” began in Europe .
Its goal was to create a Jewish state somewhere in the world .
Its leaders settled on the ancient and long - inhabited land of Palestine for the location of this state .
1
Palestine 's population at this time was approximately ninety - six percent non-Jewish ( primarily Muslim and Christian ) .
2
Over the coming decades Zionist leaders used various strategies to accomplish their goal of taking over Palestine :
Encouraging Jewish immigration to Palestine , partly through the invention of such deceptive slogans as " a land without a people for a people without a land , " when , in fact , the land was already inhabited .
Since the majority of Jews were not Zionists until after WWII , Zionists used an array of misleading strategies , including secret collaboration with the Nazis , to push immigration .
3 Convincing a “ Great Power ” to back this process .
By turn , Zionists approached the Ottomans , the British , and the U.S. to further their cause .
While the Ottomans turned them down , the British ( being promised that American Zionists would push the U.S. to enter World War I on the side of England ) eventually acceded , as did the U.S. ( due to concerns of politicians like Harry Truman that they would lose elections otherwise ) .
4
Buying up the land ( sometimes through subterfuges ) , proclaiming it Jewish for all eternity , and refusing to allow non-Jews to live or work on the purchased land .
This was called " redeeming " the land and was financed by a variety of means , including by such wealthy banking families as the Rothschilds .
5
Historic Palestine , the land now occupied by the state of Israel , was a multicultural society .
During the 1947 - 49 War , Israel committed at least 33 massacres and expelled over 750,000 Palestinians .
( Click graph for large version . )
Violence , if such financial dispossession should fail or prove too slow – as it did .6
In the 1930s , Jewish land ownership had increased from approximately 1 % to just over 6 % of the land , and violence had increased as well .
With the emergence of several Zionist terrorist gangs ( whose ranks included a number of future Prime Ministers of Israel ) , there was violent conflict .
Numerous people of all ethnicities were killed – then , as now , the large majority of them Christian and Muslim Palestinians .
7
The Catastrophe
This growing violence culminated in Israel 's ruthless 1947 - 49 " War of Independence , " in which at least 750,000 Palestinian men , women , and children were expelled from their homes by numerically superior Israeli forces – half before any Arab armies joined the war .
This massive humanitarian disaster is known as ‘ The Catastrophe , ’ al Nakba in Arabic .
8
Zionist forces committed 33 massacres and destroyed 531 Palestinian towns .
Author Norman Finkelstein states : “ According to the former director of the Israeli army archives , ‘ in almost every village occupied by us during the War ... acts were committed which are defined as war crimes , such as murders , massacres , and rapes ’... Uri Milstein , the authoritative Israeli military historian of the 1948 war , goes one step further , maintaining that ‘ every skirmish ended in a massacre of Arabs . ’”
9
Count Folke Bernadotte , a former official of the Swedish Red Cross who saved thousands of Jews during World War II and was appointed U.N. mediator in Palestine , said of the refugees : " It would be an offence against the principles of elemental justice if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right to return to their homes .
” 10 Bernadotte was assassinated by a Zionist organization led by future Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.11
Injustice Continues
Over the 70 years since Israel ’s founding on May 14 , 1948 , this profound injustice has continued .
Palestinian refugees are the largest remaining refugee population in the world .
1.3 million Palestinians live in Israel as “ Israeli citizens , ” but despite their status as citizens , they are subject to systematic discrimination .
Many are prohibited from living in the villages and homes from which they were violently expelled , and their property has been confiscated for Jewish - only uses .
In Orwellian terminology , Israeli law designates these internal refugees as “ present absentees . ” 12
In 1967 Israel launched its third war and seized still more Palestinian ( and other Arab ) land .
Israel also attacked a U.S. Navy ship , the USS Liberty , killing and injuring over 200 Americans , an event that remains largely covered - up today , despite efforts by an extraordinary array of high - level military officers and civilian officials to expose it .13
Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip – the final 22 % of mandatory Palestine – and began building settlements for Jewish Israelis on land confiscated from Palestinian Muslims and Christians .
It has demolished more than 24,145 Palestinian homes since 1967 .
In 2005 Israel returned Gazan land to its owners , but continues to control its borders , ports , and air space , turning Gaza into a large prison , where 1.5 million people are held under what a UN Human Rights Commissioner described as “ catastrophic ” conditions .
Over 7,000 Palestinian men , women , and children are imprisoned in Israeli jails under physically abusive conditions ( many have not even been charged with a crime ) and the basic human rights of all Palestinians under Israeli rule are routinely violated .
Some prisoners tortured by Israel have been American citizens .
In the violence that began in fall , 2000 through Feb. 5 , 2009 , Israeli forces killed 6,348 Palestinians ; Palestinian resistance groups killed 1,072 Israelis .
Israel ’s military , the fourth most powerful on earth possesses hundreds of nuclear weapons .
14
American Involvement
American taxpayers give Israel more than $ 10 million per day , even though surveys reveal that 73 % of Americans oppose taking sides on Israel - Palestine .
Because of Israel ’s powerful US lobby , Congress gives far more money to Israel than to all of sub-Saharan Africa put together .
15
In its 70 years of existence , Israel , the size of New Jersey , has received more U.S. tax money than any other nation .
While most Americans are unaware of these facts ( studies have shown that media report on Israeli deaths at rates up to 13 times greater than they report on Palestinian deaths ) governmental actions are making Americans responsible for a continuing catastrophe of historic proportions – and which is , in addition , creating extremely damaging enmity to the US itself .
Israel partisans have played a significant role in promoting U.S. attacks on Iraq and Iran.16
As more Americans learn the facts , there is a growing bipartisan , multi-ethnic movement to counter Israel ’s US lobby , which has long held a vicegrip on American Mideast policies .
Palestinian Loss of Land 1946 -2005
“ Confusion about the origins of the conflict all too often has obscured Americans ’ understanding of its true dimension .
It began as a conflict resulting from immigrants struggling to displace the local majority population .
All else is derivative from this basic reality . ”
– Donald Neff , former Senior Editor , Time Magazine , Fallen Pillars : U.S. Policy towards Palestine and Israel since 1945
“ [ T ] he story of 1948 ... is the simple but horrific story of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine ...
Retrieving it from oblivion is incumbent upon us , not just as a greatly overdue act of historiographical reconstruction or professional duty ; it is ... the very first step we must take if we ever want reconciliation to have a chance , and peace to take root , in the torn lands of Palestine and Israel . ”
– Ilan Pappe , Israeli Historian , The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine
“ The Palestinian Holocaust is unsurpassed in history .
For a country to be occupied , emptied of its people , its physical and cultural landmarks obliterated , its destruction hailed as a miraculous act of God , all done according to a premeditated plan , meticulously executed , internationally supported , and still maintained today ... ”

There are numerous sources for the information in this brochure .
We will continue to add citations to this section , so people may wish to periodically check back for additional source information .
Cries for post - bailout accountability resounded at the biggest banks Tuesday as Citigroup Inc. issued a 43 - page defense of its lending , a consumer group lashed Bank of America Corp. for throwing a $ 10 - million Super Bowl bash , and Wells Fargo & Co. canceled plans to fete its top mortgage salespeople in Las Vegas .
The complaints raised questions likely to be asked more frequently as more government help for companies is doled out .
For example , can a bank answer to congressional committees as well as to its regular shareholders ?
And how much should banks alter their marketing in a highly charged political environment ?
The federal government has invested $ 45 billion in Citigroup and guaranteed more than $ 300 billion of its troubled loans .
Answering complaints that bailed - out banks are n’t lending , Citi said Tuesday that it had committed $ 36.5 billion “ to support U.S. consumers , businesses and our communities during these challenging times . ”
The funds are mainly for home mortgages and purchases of mortgage - backed securities .
In normal times , $ 45 billion in bank capital might result in 10 times that amount in new loans .
Citi described the $ 36.5 billion as the “ first stage ” of what it hoped to do .

Bank of America , which also got $ 45 billion from the government , had already released figures to show it was making new loans and had slashed bonuses for many employees and eliminated them for top executives .
But the Charlotte , N.C. , bank went ahead with a five - day Super Bowl carnival in Tampa as part of a sponsorship deal with the NFL .
The event drew condemnation Tuesday from consumer group Public Citizen of “ this latest wave of irresponsible spending . ”
No government funds were used to hold the event , said bank spokesman Lawrence Di Rita , who called it “ part of our traditional banking business . ”
The company decided to sponsor the carnival only after evaluating its “ underlying revenue generating potential , ” he said .
Wells Fargo had planned stays for top mortgage officers at the Wynn Las Vegas and a sister hotel starting Friday for “ a four - day business meeting and recognition event for hard - working team members . ”

Sales - driven businesses often use such meetings to motivate their staffs .
But the bailout has brought harsh criticism of the retreats : Congress vilified American International Group Inc. for spending $ 440,000 on spa treatments for executives at the St. Regis Resort in Dana Point days after the insurer took $ 85 billion from taxpayers .
After the Associated Press reported the Wells Fargo event Tuesday , lawmakers skewered the San Francisco bank , which got a $ 25 - billion infusion from the government .
In late 2008 , Wells called off its “ recognition events ” for 2009 except in cases in which doing so would generate “ no meaningful savings , ” spokesman Kevin Waetke said in an e-mail .
“ We had scaled back the mortgage event , but in light of the current environment , we have now decided to cancel this event as well , ” he said .

Cutting back on such perks and huge bonuses at a company with an aggressive sales culture could prompt the best salespeople to walk out the door , said Edward Lawler , a business professor at USC and head of its Center for Efficient Organizations .
But too many incentives “ can wind up motivating people to do all the wrong things , ” such as making mortgages that borrowers can’t afford , he said .
“ The interesting thing is whether this is the beginning of a real shareholder and public revolt ” about corporate pay , Lawler said .
“ We may be at a tipping point with respect to how people are compensated . ”

A New Kind of Threat The National Security Agency , or NSA , is the largest , most secret , most technologically advanced intelligence agency in the world .
It thrived during the Cold War with the Soviets , but Al Qaeda represents an entirely different kind of threat .
Is the NSA up to it ?

Children Survive the Israeli Destruction
The story of the eight children of Al - Samouni family who survived six days together with their beloved dead family under the rubble of their house in Gaza , and the story of dead people who are still under the rubble of their houses in Gaza , and the story of barring the rescuers from gathering the wounded people and collecting the dead bodies is a war crime which gives me the right to shout loudly , in the face of the deaf international political community , the leaders of the Holocaust in Palestine who are still crying about the Jewish holocaust in Europe , paying them compensation and freeing them from paying taxes , establishing more laws in their favor and denying the people who pay taxes the right to open their mouth to talk against the crimes of Israel .
To you all I say that your debauchery and your unlimited support for the Israeli genocide and war crimes has reached a level which makes even the stones speak .
Your continuous support to the Israeli criminality and holocaust against the Palestinians in Gaza will cause your nations many tragedies and deep suffering .
Each surviving child and person who has seen the murder of his family and the destruction of his house will never help Israel to live in peace , even if an army from all the nations of the world goes to Gaza to protect Israel .
Destruction , murder , genocide , ethnic cleansing and war crimes will never bring peace to Israel , or end the Palestinian resistance .
The Israeli war crimes are mobilizing new generations of hate around the world as well as in the Arab countries against Israel and the Jews of the diaspora .
I wonder if your so - called “ international community ” understands , or if you all deaf and blind before the facts .
I wonder what is behind your sacrifice and support for ethnic cleansing , for all the war crimes of Israel ?
Are you scared of the Jews returning to Europe or are you scare from the Jewish lobby and the Zionist organizations ?
Why will you not bring the Jews back to Europe instead of supporting their genocide and criminality everywhere in the world ?
Why will you not stop financing their genocide in Gaza and the West Bank and giving them unfair tax advantages in Europe ?
Why are you allowing the Israeli Jews to climb on the shoulder of your people ?
Why have you adopted such laws which free the Israeli Jews from paying taxes for 10 years for their projects in Europe ?
We would appreciate if you collect this criminal garbage from our land and take them back to Europe , instead of supporting their crimes against humanity for even one more day .
The story of the survival of the Al - Samouni children under the rubble of their house is a blot of shame on you , of shame on your useless laws , of shame on your craven humanity , of shame your dignity , of shame on your morality …
For six days of horror , 144 hour of terrorism , these children lived together with their beloved dead family under the rubble of their house destroyed by Israel .
Without food , or cover , in the cold of winter and under the Israeli bombs and the noise of their air strikes .
Six days of living among the dead under the silence of your criminal politicians .
What shall we tell these surviving children ?
Should we tell them that the Israeli air strike was “ defending the State of Israel ” when they killed their family ?
Should we tell them that Hamas is responsible for destroying the house over their heads , and that they should take revenge from Hamas ?
Should we tell them that the international criminal court does not exist any more ?
Should we recommend them to forget the six days of horror , and the death of their family ?
Should we tell them that they are not human beings and that Israelis are the only human beings and the chosen people God ?
Shame on you all and on your craven humanity .
Shame on you and your racism .
Shame on you and on your laws .
You are all criminal and racist liars .
Many dead people from Al - Samouni family are still under the rubble of their destroyed house .
The rescuers are not able to search for the bodies under continuous bombing of the Israeli criminals .
But the children of the Al - Samouni family were not the only children found alive under the rubble of the Israeli destruction .
The International Committee of the Red Cross found other four small children alive next to their mothers bodies in the Al - Zaytun neighborhood of Gaza , where the house of the family was shelled by Israel , and 15 relatives and neighbors of these children were recovered wounded from under the rubble .
According to Dr. Moaiya Hassanain , 35 bodies of dead people have been found in the rubble of a Gaza strip battle zone .
The bodies were discovered on Thursday during a three - hour lull in fighting .
Israel agreed to the pause to allow aid shipments into Gaza .
Red Cross spokesman Pierre Wettach said that rescuers had been refused permission by Israeli authorities to reach the site of the houses which the Israeli military bombed while the people had been inside for four days .
He said that the incident is really “ shocking . ”
The Geneva - based group said in a statement that the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded ; the Israeli delay in allowing access to rescue services was unacceptable , and according to the Geneva Conventions this is considered as a war crime .
On the other hand , dozens of Arab Union Doctors made a sit-in at the Rafah border as a protest against the Egyptian authorities , which does not allow them to enter the Gaza Strip .
And Egyptian authorities continued their restriction of movement against humanitarian aid reaching Gaza .
The Secretary - General of the Federation of Arab Doctors condemned the measures of the Egyptian authorities .
He said that the Egyptian doctors have carried out a sit-protest to call the attention of the Egyptian authorities to the urgently needed of opening of the Rafah crossing .

Some researchers in substance - abuse treatment and advocates for the medical use of marijuana marijuana are alarmed at reports that Representative Jim Ramstad , a Republican from Minnesota , is a candidate to become the next drug czar — the director of the office of National Drug Control Policy .
In a joint letter to President - elect Barack Obama , coordinated by Andrew Tatarsky , the past president of the division of addictions of the New York State Psychological Association , dozens of academics and other professionals in substance - abuse treatment write :
This country needs a drug czar who supports evidence - based policies and one who will make decisions based on science , not politics or ideology .
We strongly believe that Congressman Ramstad is not that person .
Rep. Ramstad voted in 1998 in favor of making permanent the federal funding ban on syringe exchange .
In 2000 , he voted to prohibit the District of Columbia from spending its own locally - raised funds on syringe exchange programs , and in 2007 , he voted against lifting the same DC ban , despite decades of research showing that syringe exchange programs reduce the spread of HIV / AIDS , save lives , save money , and do not increase drug use .
Representative Ramstad has also consistently opposed congressional efforts to stop the arrest of patients with HIV / AIDS , cancer , and other illnesses who use medical marijuana to ease their pain and suffering in states where it is legal .
Similar concerns have been raised in another joint letter , coordinated by the Drug Policy Alliance endorsed by more than three dozen other public - health , criminal - justice and drug - treatment organizations .
They write to Mr. Obama :
You showed strong leadership on the campaign trail by pledging to lift the federal funding ban on syringe exchange programs , end the excessive federal law enforcement raids aimed at medical marijuana patients , and eliminate the crack / powder cocaine sentencing disparity .
. .
We urge you to nominate for drug czar someone with a public health background , who is committed to reducing the spread of HIV / AIDS , hepatitis C and other infectious diseases , open to systematic drug policy reform , and able to show strong leadership on the issues you believe in .
The costs of the war on drugs are summed up by Ethan Nadelmann , the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance , in a Wall Street Journal op - ed article celebrating the 75th anniversary of the repeal of Prohibition .
After noting that that the repeal was popular not just among drinkers but also non-drinkers worried about the rise in organized crime and other consequences of Prohibition , Mr. Nadelmann writes :
They saw what most Americans still fail to see today :
That a failed drug prohibition can cause greater harm than the drug it was intended to banish .
Consider the consequences of drug prohibition today : 500,000 people incarcerated in U.S. prisons and jails for nonviolent drug - law violations ; 1.8 million drug arrests last year ; tens of billions of taxpayer dollars expended annually to fund a drug war that 76 % of Americans say has failed ; millions now marked for life as former drug felons ; many thousands dying each year from drug overdoses that have more to do with prohibitionist policies than the drugs themselves , and tens of thousands more needlessly infected with AIDS and Hepatitis C because those same policies undermine and block responsible public - health policies .
And look abroad .
At Afghanistan , where a third or more of the national economy is both beneficiary and victim of the failed global drug prohibition regime .
At Mexico , which makes Chicago under Al Capone look like a day in the park .
And elsewhere in Latin America , where prohibition - related crime , violence and corruption undermine civil authority and public safety , and mindless drug eradication campaigns wreak environmental havoc .
The joint letter to Mr. Obama organized by Dr. Tatarsky suggests a different approach : “ We need a new bottom line for U.S. drug policy so that treatment is more available and addiction is treated like a health issue , not a criminal issue .
To paraphrase former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke , we need a surgeon general , not a military general or police officer . ”
What do you think of Mr. Ramstad as drug czar ?
Do you have any other nominees for the job ?
Or other advice for Mr. Obama on drug policy ?
Normally we 'd scoff at the idea of Nintendo releasing yet another new controller ( hell , we 've already got the Wii-mote , nunchuk , zapper shell , wheel shell , balance board , classic controller , and GameCube controller , not to mention third party offerings like the Hori sticks and alternate pads ) but in this case , we 're on board .
Behold +the+new+Classic+Controller+PRO+from+Nintendo
Above , +Nyko's +Classic+Controller+and + Grip .++ Pretty+similar .
As seen above , Nintendo's Japanese website has been updated with a new Classic Controller PRO model , and while it 's got just a vague Summer release date and no price just yet , we 're already more than intrigued at this larger , more form - fitting design .
If you want to game on Virtual Console , your best bet right now is the Classic Controller or a GameCube pad .
Still , while the Wii's throwback offering has the look of the Super NES pad from the golden era of gaming , it does n't exactly feel form - fitting in its design .
The back is oddly slanted , the finish on the controller feels a bit slick , and the sticks are too close together to really feel comfy .
From the info we 've already got on the PRO , we know it 's a larger controller , not only in thickness , height , and width , but it also makes use of one of the more well - received concepts out there , which is the extension grips , which gives it a GameCube , Xbox Controller S/360 look .
As you can see , the Z buttons ( Z/L and Z/R ) are larger now , and placed like the R1 / R2 , L1/L2 setup found with Sony controllers .
The PRO even borrows from the Nyko Classic Controller and Click Grip , shown below .
It also looks like the Pro may be losing something from the standard Classic Controller : analogue shoulder buttons .
Nintendo's official site for the Pro states that the thumb sticks are analogue , but does not state the same for the L and R shoulder buttons .
In contrast , a similar page for the original Classic Controller lists both the shoulder buttons and the sticks as being analogue .
An oversight on Nintendo 's part ?
Possibly , although if you look closely at the Pro's image , it really does look like both shoulder buttons may be digital .
We 'll have more on Nintendo 's controller as news breaks .
As for price and strategy from here on out , Nintendo has n't commented but we 'd estimate a release throughout the world by the end of 2009 ( a slow move from Japan to Europe , US , and beyond , with no real fanfare for the switch ) , and a price tag of $ 24.99 , five bucks over the current Classic Controller , at least until the old model is worked out of retailers .
The Pro makes use of a Wii-mote for power , and we 're hoping Nintendo makes use of a back - mounted cradle system for the Wii-mote , though of course nothing has been mentioned yet on that .
This piece also appears at TPM Cafe
Speaking in southern Israel today , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert revealed details of a call he apparently placed to President Bush which led to the US changing its vote on U.N. Security Council Resolution 1860 calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and boasting how he had “ shamed ” the US secretary of state and laid down the law with the president ( full report below ) .
AIPAC has also slammed the Bush administration for not vetoing U.N. SCR 1860 , as MJ noted earlier .
The first thing to say is that a ceasefire is vital and the U.N. resolution if it helps deliver an end to the violence , rocket - fire and the human suffering , the opening of the blockade on Gaza , and the prevention of weapon smuggling , then it is an important contribution worthy of support .
Secondly , Secretary Rice would do best to respond to this act of chutzpah by using her remaining week in office to actually get that resolution implemented and deliver a meaningful ceasefire package – she can still do it and go out on a higher note than having been “ Colin Powell ” - ed by her own president at the U.N. and dissed by a foreign leader .
But the real point is this : what Olmert said is more than just mind - boggling chutzpah – it is deeply irresponsible , insulting and will be a boomerang for Israel .
Here ’s the full quote and report :
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was left shamefaced after President George W. Bush ordered her to abstain in a key U.N. vote on the Gaza war , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Monday .
“ She was left shamed …a resolution that she prepared and arranged , and in the end she did not vote in favor , ” Olmert said in a speech in the southern town of Ashkelon .
“ In the night between Thursday and Friday , when the secretary of state wanted to lead the vote on a ceasefire at the Security Council , we did not want her to vote in favor , ” Olmert said .
“ I said ‘ get me President Bush on the phone ’ .
They said he was in the middle of giving a speech in Philadelphia .
I said I did n’t care .
‘ I need to talk to him now ’ .
He got off the podium and spoke to me .
“ I told him the United States could not vote in favor .
It can not vote in favor of such a resolution .
He immediately called the secretary of state and told her not to vote in favor . ”
( AFP , 1/12/2009 )
I have been outspokenly supportive of many of the things Olmert has courageously said as PM of Israel ( I even posted a collection of them on my blog ) .
I have been less enthusiastic , to put it mildly , of the two wars that Olmert has waged as prime minister , the incessant settlement expansion he has overseen , and the basic gap between words and deeds .
But these latest comments are just remarkable .
Olmert is known to have a personality with an arrogant streak .
Most likely that was on display rather than a deeply thought through political move .
Olmert was speaking in Hebrew in the southern city of Ashkelon but surely he could n’t imagine that this would not be picked up by the world ’s media .
The repercussions – especially when heaped on top of everything that has happened in Gaza now ( and I agree that is much more important than what Olmert said ) – will be ugly .
Here are a few thoughts on those repercussions to leave you with ( also check out my colleague Steve Clemons at his blog , The Washington Note ) :
1 . This episode will play out for a very long time in the Arab world and its media , and it will be used to confirm every conspiracy and stereotype about the tail wagging the dog when it comes to Israel and US foreign policy in the Middle East .
You can imagine it .
The American president takes his instructions via phone from Israel .
Oy !
This is all we need .
2 . This is not a way to publicly treat your friends .
What example does this set for Israel with its other friends when the prime minister embarrasses an outgoing president and secretary of state in this way ?
Message to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton : whatever you do for Israel over the next four to eight years , do n’t be surprised if this is the gratitude you get .
Not a clever message .
3 . How is this likely to affect the hand - over of power in the US ?
Here ’s a speculative thought for you : when Clinton handed over the reigns of power to Dubya and Colin Powell , legend has it that his parting message on the Middle East was , “ Do n’t trust Arafat . ”
What one imagines might be Secretary Rice ’s parting message to Hillary Clinton on who should be trusted ?
4 . When world leaders take phone calls from their Israeli counterparts and are convinced to take on - board an Israeli position and act on it , should they now always expect to be similarly publicly humiliated ?
Anyway , like I say , this was an act of stupidity but a revealing one .
If only it could spur the ongoing administration to get a ceasefire and the incoming administration to encourage a more two - way friendship with Israel , most importantly , one that ends an occupation that is the source of so much that has gone wrong for Israel , not least the kind of hubris on display again today .
The stalemate with the Yankees lasted for months , but Pettitte said he always believed he would return .
A critical point was last month when Cashman met with Pettitte in Houston on his way back from the winter meetings in Las Vegas .
Image The Yankees winter - long standoff with Andy Pettitte is about to come to an end .
Credit ... Barton Silverman / The New York Times
It was the first time Cashman had spoken to Pettitte , and he sensed Pettitte ’s sincerity in wanting to come back .
Pettitte has spent 11 of his 14 seasons with the Yankees .
“ I remember him telling me at one point , ‘ Cash , if you want me back , we ’ll find a way to get this done , ’ ” Cashman said .
“ He honored that every step of the way . ”
Pettitte did not want the $ 10 million offer , but he agreed to the concept of an incentive - based deal .
Details were the problem , and weeks passed .
Pettitte took a vacation , and so did Cashman .
Finally , on Monday , it was time .
“ We had talked about so many scenarios and possibilities , it would n’t be too much of an exaggeration to say everybody was worn out , ” Hendricks said .
“ I think Cash and I both knew if we do n’t get it done now , we ’ll probably never get it done . ”
Pettitte pitched 204 innings last season , but he was 2 - 7 with a 6.23 earned run average in his last 11 starts .
That brought his final record to 14 - 14 .
His 4.54 E.R.A. was his highest since 1999 .
Yet Pettitte is only 36  a year older than Derek Lowe , who got a four - year , $ 60 million deal from Atlanta  and Cashman said he was surprised at the positive medical reports he got on Pettitte ’s tired shoulder .
Pettitte said he has worked this winter to strengthen it .

We introduce the blame calculus , which adds the notion of blame from Findler and Felleisen 's contracts to a system similar to Siek and Taha 's gradual types and Flanagan 's hybrid types .
We characterise where positive and negative blame can arise by decomposing the usual notion of subtype into positive and negative subtyping , and show that these recombine to yield naive subtyping .
Naive typing has previously appeared in type systems that are unsound , but we believe this is the first time naive subtyping has played a role in establishing type soundness .
ALRIGHT , here we go .
I 'm back .
After a slight case of " mom I do n't want to go to school today " and a moderate case of illness ( my sinus cavities are still rebelling ) , I 'm back .
Fine .

I 've gotta tell you , I 've pretty much slept through it so far .
Your Comments :
On the eve of the first ever free , online course on “ Git and GitHub ” , Satish Talim of RubyLearning caught up with Chris Wanstrath and talked to him , in this short interview .
Satish Talim >>
Welcome , Chris and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts .
For the benefit of the readers , could you tell us something about your self ?
Chris Wanstrath >>
I ’m a Ruby and JavaScript programmer living in San Francisco , CA .
I was one of the guys who started GitHub .
When I ’m not working on the site , I can be found playing guitar or drinking bourbon .
Sometimes at the same time !
Satish >>
Why according to you , is it important for a new Ruby developer to know and use Git and GitHub ?
Chris >>
I learned how to program by reading other people ’s code and contributing to open source projects .
Submitting a patch and seeing how the maintainer rewrites it is invaluable : it ’s like getting free , personalized programming lessons from someone with more experience than you .
GitHub is important because it ’s one of the best places to participate in active open source development .
The barrier to entry is extremely low , and with casual forking it ’s basically designed for the “ make small changes to a foreign project and see what happens ” workflow .
Satish >>
Why GitHub ?
Why not SourceForge ?
Chris >>
SourceForge is about publishing projects , GitHub is about collaborating on code .
SourceForge is helpful when exploring or working on projects , but this is really where GitHub shines .
Satish >>
What were the challenges of putting GitHub together ?
Chris >>
We ’re still facing them today .
We not only have to worry about the database when growing , but also Git repositories on disk – we essentially have two different data stores , one of which has never been used at this scale before .
We ’re constantly doing lots of very cool caching things under the hood to try and make everything faster .
Big database tables and high IO are our biggest issues .
I think the key is to recognize problems early on and not be afraid of throwing out existing code in order to implement a better solution .
It ’s okay to do things the simple way early on – probably better , really – but you need to understand that they ’re only going to take you so far before you need to spend more time coming up with a smarter solution that works for higher load .
Satish >>
Do you have any suggestions for RubyLearning ’s Git & GitHub course participants ?
Chris >>
Create and share open source – whether on GitHub or elsewhere !
It ’s very rewarding , a great way to meet people , and the best way to improve your skills .
Satish >>
Thanks Chris for sharing your views with the RubyLearning GitHub course participants .

Forging SSL Certificates
We already knew that MD5 is a broken hash function .
Now researchers have successfully forged MD5 - signed certificates :
Molnar , Appelbaum , and Sotirov joined forces with the European MD5 research team in mid-2008 , along with Swiss cryptographer Dag Arne Osvik .
They realized that the co-construction technique could be used to simultaneously generate one normal SSL certificate and one forged certificate , which could be used to sign and vouch for any other .
They purchased a signature for the legitimate certificate from an established company that was still using MD5 for signing , and then applied the legitimate signature to the forged certificate .
Because the legitimate and forged certificates had the same MD5 value , the legitimate signature also marked the forged one as acceptable .
Lots and lots more articles , and the research .
This is n’t a big deal .
The research is great ; it ’s good work , and I always like to see cryptanalytic attacks used to break real - world security systems .
Making that jump is often much harder than cryptographers think .
But SSL does n’t provide much in the way of security , so breaking it does n’t harm security very much .
Pretty much no one ever verifies SSL certificates , so there ’s not much attack value in being able to forge them .
And even more generally , the major risks to data on the Internet are at the endpoints —
Trojans and rootkits on users ’ computers , attacks against databases and servers , etc — and not in the network .
I ’m not losing a whole lot of sleep because of these attacks .
But — come on , people — no one should be using MD5 anymore .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/31 ) :
While it is true that browsers do some SSL certificate verification , when they find an invalid certificate they display a warning dialog box which everyone — me included — ignores .
There are simply too many valid sites out there with bad certificates for that warning to mean anything .
This is far too true :
If you ’re like me and every other user on the planet , you do n’t give a shit when an SSL certificate does n’t validate .

13 Years - Marijuana
I am a 52 - year - old college graduate , born and raised in Fairfax , Virginia .
I moved to Tucson , Arizona 27 years ago , married a lovely woman , Marsha , and have two wonderful kids , Ariel - 14 , and Colin - 11 .
I was arrested in November 1996 for conspiracy to distribute marijuana .
Eight months previous to this a former good friend of mine had been arrested for marijuana and had found it expedient to turn in life - long friends to save himself .
This is all too familiar under the current conditions of justice in America .
Another tactic is the common use of militaristic assault teams ( AKA ' goon squads ' ) to commit acts of terror against nonviolent families .
My case is instructive .
During the months following my notification by the US Justice Dept of their investigation of me , my attorney was in constant contact with them .
In fact , we met personally with them on two occasions , with a third scheduled , attempting to negotiate a plea agreement .
Unfortunately the US Attorney chose a not uncommon prosecutorial negotiating tactic : Acts of Terror .
My former house is located in a very middle class neighborhood with no history of violence .
Early before sunrise on November 6 , 1996 over a dozen men , dressed totally in black , wearing masks , and armed with automatic weapons assaulted my family .
They broke into my home without announcement or knock , screaming threats at my wife and children , and ultimately terrifying them with weapons trained at their heads .
For what purpose ?
What was accomplished ?
Permanently traumatizing a nine and twelve year old .
My children 's trust in law enforcement is gone , as is mine , but maybe this is their intent .
I am not violent and have no history of it .
Why does the government sponsor use of violence and terror ?
An Orwellian negotiating instrument .
Successful in my case , but what is the cost of authority run amuck ?
The day I was denied bond , they arrested my wife outside the courtroom .
This left my children at school on their own ; the authorities refused phone calls to either of us .
It took us two weeks to get my wife home again .
As anyone who has traveled through our justice system knows , there is no validity to the premise " innocent until proven guilty . "
You are guilty and treated as such from start to finish .
I was to learn this first hand as I began an arduous journey of extradition across the country in shackles .
It was weeks before I arrived at my destination during which I stayed in numerous jails where conditions of treatment were dehumanizing .
Little public attention is ever focused on this part of the American Gulag .
Men and women are subjected to conditions of animal bondage .
At my initial court appearance the prosecutor warned that any attorney accepting my case would have his fees confiscated ( which had just happened to my last attorney ) .
Denied an attorney of my choice , the court appointed me one who refused to spend any time investigating or preparing for my case .
He would not come visit me nor accept my phone calls .
This scenario is endemic to the system of court appointed attorneys .
These courthouse lawyers are given paltry remuneration and their quality and performance reflect the same .
In their defense they are up against a behemoth with near unlimited power and resources .
It is hard to imagine how out - of - whack our system of justice is until you ( God forbid ) experience it first hand .
The only advice I received from my attorney was to accept the prosecutor 's deal ; he felt I would be sentenced to 6 - 10 years .
Due to a 20 - year - old marijuana conviction , the prosecutor promised to double my sentence and recommend 30 years if I did not accept .
I had no alternative .
I felt betrayed when I discovered my Presentence Report was recommending that I receive 25 years , very near the 30 I was originally threatened with .
In spite of no appreciable help from my attorney at the sentencing hearing , I was able to limit the damage to 13 years .
Unlike many defendants , I was not offered a sentence reduction ( Rule 35 or 5K.1 ) because - I would not testify to untruths about others .
The government not only takes your freedom , but anything of value you might own .
All of my assets were seized , whether they were part of the crime or not , under the substitute assets law .
My wife and children 's life insurance , along with family heirlooms and even earned retirement funds were confiscated .
My family was left destitute .
If it had not been for the caring and assistance of relatives and neighbors , they would have been left to the streets .
I harbor no illusions that my marijuana dealings were wrong and violated the law .
But marijuana was a very small part of my life .
I was a successful homebuilder before helping to found an environmentally beneficial toxic waste recycling company .
We had perfected two inventions with worldwide patents pending .
We built our first plant and were on our way to alleviating one of the world 's worst pollution problems .
I lived in an historic area of Tucson where my wife and I were instrumental in starting a neighborhood association that has protected the cultural diversity and quality of life .
My wife , who was past president of the association , and I helped obtain state funding and matching donations to renovate a National Historic Register chapel into a neighborhood community center .
Upon completion of the project the Association received the Governor 's Award in recognition of our work .
Over the years this neighborhood association has donated thousands of dollars to the Tucson community .
I enjoy working with children and was involved in and coached youth soccer for five years .
I also coached Little League and assisted in Cub Scouts , as well as being an Eagle Scout sponsor .
There was more to my life than marijuana .
I remain a caring father who is still very much involved in my children 's lives regardless of my current circumstances .
Unfortunately , my wife and I are no longer married but remain extremely close .
We have weekly family meetings by telephone .
Why was none of this considered at sentencing ?
The answer is Mandatory Minimums and the Sentencing Guidelines that ignore what kind of person you are .
The Sentencing Guidelines equates the ' level ' of my crime as equal in severity to the taking of a life !
Is this the parity the Sentencing Guidelines were to bring to our system of justice ?
It seems yet another example of the Feds practicing the Law of Unintended Consequences .
What are the benefits of this war on drugs ?
Is there any reduction in drugs or drug use ?
No .
Is there less drug - related crime ?
No .
A huge growing number of displaced people and ruined lives ?
Yes .
Drugs as an escalating public health problem ?
A resounding yes .
The ultimate purpose of criminal law is to restore the peace that crime robs from victims , perpetrators , and communities alike .
This is known as restorative justice .
How is our current system restorative ?
The goals of punishment as expressed in the Sentencing Guidelines are deterrence , incapacitation , just punishment and rehabilitation .
Only warehousing human misery is accomplished under current policy and at great cost ( $ 150 plus billion per year ) .
But is this the true cost to society ?
What is the legacy created by the dissolution of families ?
The unproductive and wasted years of prisoners who one day will re-enter society naked of coping skills .
What of the unbounded power of prosecutors at the expense of fundamental liberties ?
The true cost of the war on drugs is of unholy proportions .
Is this what we intended ?
God help us .

You 're the stupid one for trying it out on a production machine .
If you 're curious , but unsure , just take my word for it , or install a virtual machine .
I came across an interesting post today , so I thought I 'd give it a go on a virtual machine that I did n't mind thrashing .
The subject of the post is in the title , namely as root , running 'rm - rf /'.
Have you tried this on the Ubuntu or Debian ?
It wo n't work :
root@host ~# rm - rf / rm : cannot remove root directory `/' root@host ~# echo #?
1
If you 're nervous about running the above command , then pass the interactive switch to rm , ( rm - ri / ) to force rm to ask you on every last item to remove ( you can answer no , or cancel with Ctrl - c ) .
Why is rm refusing to remove the root directory ?
From the man page :
--no-preserve -root
do not treat ‘/’ specially -- preserve-root
do not remove ‘/’ ( default )
Running 'rm - rf /' is the same as running 'rm - rf -- preserve - root /' , which of course makes no sense .
Has this always been the case for rm ?
No .
First off , Solaris made this a standard in Solaris 10 .
Second , -- preserve - root as default has been the default of Ubuntu since 8.04 , as it came upstream from Debian , and I 'm guessing further upstream from GNU coreutils ( probably v6.10 , although I can't verify ) .
Preserving root as default prevents easy mistakes , such as missing the assignment of variables :
root@host ~# : FOO= " / home /aaron /tmp " rm - rf $ FOO / rm : cannot remove root directory `/'
Notice , I forgot to end my variable statement with a semicolon , so FOO never got assigned , and rm proceeds forth with removing / instead of / home / aaron / tmp like it should have .
How about another example :
root@host ~# : rm - rf / tmp /* rm : cannot remove root directory `/'
In this case , I wish to delete all the contents of the /tmp directory , but I typed too fast , and put a space between / and tmp /* , and thus , rm attempts to remove the root directory which is not what I wanted at all !
Good to see this implemented in the latest versions of Debian and Ubuntu .
Rahman is a composer with a staggering range Indian music director AR Rahman 's score for Slumdog Millionaire has won an Oscar for best music , and a second for best song .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas discusses what makes Rahman tick .
The curiously named Panchathan Record Inn is a nondescript building tucked away in the thriving film district of the southern Indian city of Chennai ( Madras ) .
The backyard music studio is also AR Rahman 's atelier .
" We make a lot of noise here , " one of Rahman 's assistants told me wryly when I paid a visit a few years ago .
It was late in the evening , and trombone loops floated down the stairs from the state - of - the art studio above .
The " noise " has now conquered the world .
Seventeen years after he began writing music and songs for films , the jingle maker - turned - musician has finally got recognition as India 's first truly global film music composer with his score for Danny Boyle 's sleeper hit Slumdog Millionaire .
The score is an untidy smorgasbord of hip hop , Bollywood remix and signature pop anthem .
But it works because it follows the film 's giddy pace , the darkness of its characters , its portrayal of lives on the edge .
Bollywood outsider
The golden statue is a global recognition of Rahman 's enormous talent .
Like many film composers , he is not a particularly gifted vocalist or a player .
Rahman , instead , is an alchemist of sounds and voices , mixing and melting them in a potion that is usually a joy for the ear and soul .
Rahman is an alchemist of sounds and voices
Your comments on Soutik Biswas 's article
It is not surprising then that he is a composer with a staggering range - from raga to reggae to hip hop to Indian rustbelt folk to jungle rhythms to faux baroque .
All of it is brewed with an unerring feel for melody , swing and soul .
Rahman , who converted to Islam some 20 years ago , is also India 's - and Bollywood 's - first truly successful cross -over music director .
Bollywood has filched tunes from the West for as long as I can remember - check out rip - offs from Chuck Berry , The Beatles , swing jazz and vapid disco for many home - grown hit tunes since the 1950s .
But Rahman is not your archetypal tune ripper ; he is , instead , an intrepid fusion tunesmith .
Rahman says he is impressed with MIA 's music
It helps that he remains the outsider in Bollywood - the world 's most incestuous film industry .
Rahman cut his teeth scoring music for southern Indian films in the Telugu and Tamil languages , before scoring for Bollywood .
Even this year , he is working on several Tamil and Telugu films , and only two Hindi films .
And that is one of the reasons why the 43 - year - old composer has often reached out to little - known new singers and musicians from all over the country to lend their voices and instruments to his songs and score .
Rahman is also globalisation 's favourite child , always abreast of the world music that is making waves .
No wonder he discovered the music of MIA , aka Maya Arulpragasam , the war child turned feisty alternative rapper , who very few people in India had heard before Slumdog .
Rahman uses MIA 's Paper Planes - the singer rapping over a compelling sample riff and a rousing chorus line with gunshots and cash registers jingling in the background - in Slumdog .
" We met before but we never worked before , " he told one interviewer .
" MIA , she 's a real powerhouse .
Somebody played me her CD and I thought , who is this girl ?
She came here and knew all my work , had followed my work for ages .
I said cut the crap , this ' idol ' crap .
You have to teach me .
We started working in India , then we e-mailed the track back and forth .
She did the vocals in England , I did the rest in India . "
Mixing old and new I am now not surprised that the gritty girl rapper and the reclusive composer bonded so well .
I met MIA a couple of years ago on the Jamaica seafront where she was shooting a music video for a new album .
The boom box was playing her new song , a noisy mish - mash of what sounded like raucous Tamil gaana - a form of Tamil fast beat slum rap - over hip hop grooves .
The Sri Lanka - born Tamil MIA and Rahman share some of the same culture .
The score for Roja was a limpid fusion of raga and reggae For the Slumdog score , Rahman says he was mixing the sounds of new and old India .
But Slumdog is not even among his top five scores .
The songs and score for Roja ( The Rose ) , a 1992 film directed by Mani Ratnam , is possibly his best and most consistent work to date .
A limpid fusion of raga and reggae , Roja was a breathtaking achievement for a composer taking his first steps in the intensely competitive world of Indian film music .
Working with a number of vocalists , the film 's music showcases his talents - fusing flutes , synthesisers and traditional melody to a reggae backbeat and a rolling bass line .
Sometimes it felt like listening to The Wailers - Bob Marley 's iconic reggae band - playing to Indian vocals .
Time magazine called it one of the top 10 movie soundtracks of all time .
From then on , there has been no stopping the Rahman revolution in Indian film music , his best work usually coming with Mani Ratnam , an MBA - turned - filmmaker .
On the Ratnam movie , Bombay , on love and longing in a city torn apart by religious rioting , Rahman 's offerings are again rich and varied - from a sweaty , breathless love song by Remo Fernandes to a child chorus ditty to a background score that highlights the bleakness of a city and its people broken by hatred and fighting .
And then , just to pick two films , come the pulsating baroque tunes and sounds in Ratnam 's Thiruda Thiruda ( Thief , thief ) - my favourite Rahman soundtrack .
From there , Rahman travels to fusing swing jazz and smoky blues with pristine Carnatic classical in the political hero biopic , Iruvar , another Ratnam film .
There have been many good soundtracks and songs before and after these two films .
In the end , Rahman , like the best of Indian film music composers , is melody 's slave .
At his place we had discussed the possibility of a rap musical some day .
" I do n't think , " the alchemist frowned , " rap could sustain a two - hour musical ! "
This debate is closed .
Here is a selection of your comments .
I grew up with AR Rahman .
Every time I listen to a new sound track or song he 's done , I am blown away .
I do n't think any musician anywhere in the word has been able to deliver instantly catchy songs at such a consistent and frequent rate .
Another thing about ARR are his huge list of influences .
His early work indicates Blur , Carnatic music , Michael Jackson - in short the popular music at that time .
But over his career he 's increased his influences and allowed artists working under him to explore their creativity too .
He 's a genius .
Rock on Rahman .
Kaber Vasuki , India
This was an interesting article .
The film and music were excellent and really deserved to win this year !
Gary ,
Thailand I still remember the first time I heard AR Rahman 's music in Roja and Bombay , I thought why have I not heard such melody before ?
Bombay and Roja were a huge success in the Indian music industry .
Given the plethora of tunes and singers in Indian Cinema , any one in India knows that if the music is by AR Rahman , 1 ) It will be very pleasant to the ears 2 ) You always listen to it with respect as opposed to the suspicion which rises when you first listen to a new song .
Its completely befitting that he received two Oscar awards .
Chandu , US I have been listening to Rahman 's music for around 14 years .
I am happy to know that he has finally got a recognition in Hollywood .
Hopefully , this will open many doors to him and we can listen to more of his " soul rendering " works .
I agree with Rahman 's views on Bollywood , even the name itself does n't have originality , nevertheless to say about most of the screenplays .
The duo Rahman - Ratnam are one of the best things to watch out in Indian ( not Bollywood ) movies .
Chanchal , Nottingham , United Kingdom Quite true , Roja is the best .
Anoop , India
Well written article !
You are right when you say that Rahman 's best comes from the stables of Mani Ratnam and Thiruda Thiruda music is also my favourite .
But I do n't think Rahman deserves an Oscar for Slumdog simply because it is n't that great as compared to his other music scores .
Sri Vikas , India Wonderful piece this , really enjoyed reading it .
I was all this while a closet Rahman fan , worried that acknowledging Rahman 's greatness would somehow dilute my liking for , and loyalty to , RD Burman 's music .
Fact is , Rahman is perhaps superior to Pancham .
Rajan Chakravarty , India AR Rahman is a truly magical musician .
His ability to pick and mix instrumentals , melodies and vocals into meaningful coherent and powerful film ballads is unrivalled .
He is one of Asia 's few musicians who make classical Indian music relevant to our generation , Through the use of modern technology .
Rahman 's dedication and love of his art is evident in all of his work .
Haridhos Kurunadalingam , United Kingdom I remember his Vande Mataram album in India in 1997 .
I thought that was pure genius as well
Daniel James , New Zealand AR Rahman is more than just a musician .
He is a part of history .
I am an Indian who grew up in America , and while I love new music , English and in Hindi , my comfort music will always be the soundtrack of Bombay .
It has been there for me as a child , through high school , college , and hopefully for ever more .
Its the music I will have my children hear , and hope they love it as much as I have .
Monica , USA
Thank you BBC for this title on an Indian .
Today i am feeling very proud to be an Indian .
Rahman is now become a precious asset not only for India but also for whole world .
Sunil Dhiman , India AR Rahman has n't just won an award , he has won world recognition for Indian music , its long music tradition and Indians ' love for good music .
I 'm proud of Rahman for his talent , creativity , professionalism , hard work , modesty and his service to Indian and world music .
Hats off to Rahman for scoring distinction for India and Indian film music .
Jay , Australia Feel really proud for AR for winning this .
Had it not been a UK film he would never win an Oscar .
Congrats to all Slumdog winners .
D Kathapurkar , UK From the very first movie scored by Rahman , I have been listening to almost all the tracks composed by Rahman .
Being a resident of Tamil Nadu , from where " The Alchemist " comes from , I can surely say that Slumdog Millionaire is not Rahman 's best .
He had composed even better scores for Tamil movies which were left unrecognised .
Even it is a pain that larger part of his music is left unnoticed , I take this opportunity to praise the efforts of this great composer on behalf of all Indians .
David P Shenba , Chennai , India Very well researched and written article - shows the depth of talent Rahman possesses and his vast contribution to the Madras and Indian music industry .
Glad he got this long overdue recognition now - he has done India very proud !
Rose Ambat , India Oscar is GREAT but I want him to win a few Grammy awards too .
Sameer Rasaily , India
He also wrote the amazing score for the recent release Ghajni .
Sadly , only the pop songs are available on CD , not the incredible background he is so genius at .
If any Bollywood bigwigs are reading this , PLEASE release the Ghajni complete score .
It is so good .
Caleb Hicks , USA Search for the music from the Bollywood movie Taal .
It 's also provided by A.R. Rahman .
Check YouTube .
Great sound .
Roja 's soundtrack is also great .
John , New Zealand Soutik Biswas 's pen-portrait of AR Rahman is superb .
Indians in general , and those in the South of the country in particular , are really happy that Rahman has won two Oscars for his work in Slumdog Millionaire .
Congratulations to the master music maker !
We in India have never seen the kind of celebrations in our country that marked the Oscar awards this year .
Eight Oscars for one India - centric movie - can one ask for more ?
Achal Narayanan , India I was waiting for this moment since his first music direction in Roja .
All the best wishes to Rahman for his achievement .
Md Khairul Bashar , Bangladesh Dis Indian really kool man !
he can make gud music man !
Bless
Reggae King , Kingston , Jamaica
Years ago when I first heard Rahman 's theme music from film Bombay , I was convinced he would ascend to international recognition one day .
Here we are with two Oscars .
Congratulation , AR Rahman
Kanti Shah , UK I truly believe that Rahman has conquered the world by winning Oscars for best score and best song .
This has been ONE award that has eluded him since the time he made the charts and I think he deserves it in every way you can think of .
Rahman has done India , his motherland proud , and has put her on the international map of music and song .
Congratulations and we are extremely proud of you !
Christopher Dawes , India AR Rahman has once again proved to the world that there is no substitute for originality .
Dipayan Dasgupta , Singapore Certainly , the music of AR Rahman in Slumdog Millionaire is not that great as compared to his other works .
However , the Oscar has recognised him that he is now a Mozart of East .
And the movie , Slumdog Millionaire , is not exceptionally that good .
In fact enjoyed watching Salam Bombay .
Puran P Vista , Nepal Rahman is truly a tunesmith .
I am not surprised he has won the Oscar .
I am however more surprised that it takes an Oscar for the world to recognise the genius that is Rahman .
Very few musicians can compose , sing and create music commercially in as many as 6 different languages .
I am surprised that this acclaim has take this long .
Jai ho Rahman
Jason C , Hong Kong Bravo Mr Rahman !
The movie was really awesome and the same can b said about him too - his music really makes you literally feel the movie from within !
Derick Fernandes , Cayman Islands
I have grown up on Rahman songs ....
It is like a drug , you get addicted to them and then you yearn for more .... We are really proud of him .
Suna , Oman
Its great to see AR Rahman with such an achievement , he really deserves it .
He is not only popular in India , but he is equally popular in Bangladesh .
Ashik , Bangladesh
I remember when I first heard A R Rahman 's songs from the movie , ' Roja ' , all those years ago .
The songs captivated everyone in our Indian community , and people were rushing out to buy the cassette of the movie soundtrack .
Tamil audiences in have long enjoyed the beautiful songs he has produced for various Tamil movies and I 'm sure that the fame and awards he has garnered from Slumdog Millionaires will garner him new fans from other cultural backgrounds across the world .
Well done , A R Rahman .
Pari , Hong Kong Rahman was already a genius .
The difference is , now not just India but the world knows about his work .
Article is very well written .
Shah , Hong Kong Great moment and even greater news .
I congratulate Rahman and all Indians , for this great musician that they have produced .
Mohamed Adham , Sri Lanka
The music of Slumdog is not ARH 's best work .
He has been creating great music for over a decade in Bollywood cinema .
Its good to see he finally receives an Oscar .
Its just a shame that the Academy ( and the ' west ' ) has overlooked many of his real masterpieces from the past .
Amjad , UK AR Rahman is truly a musical genius .
Though Slumdog is no way near his other best scores , we shall happily take it as this give him the global recognition that he richly deserves
Sreeranga , India Congrats to the music wizard .
Slumdog is one of his average albums .
The world and Oscars must take a look at the scores he has done in the beginning of his career .
They will be nonplussed by the range .
Srikanth Mantena , India
It is a great moment for India , I am proud to be an Indian
Harish M Pavithran , INDIA
Well , at least now the world has recognised the immense talent of Rahman , by honouring him at the Oscars .
Rahman you really ' deserve ' the Oscars and you have put the Indian music on the global map .
Tom , India AR Rahman i s just next to the God to me
Protik , Bangladesh Jai Ho AR Rahman , Jay Ho Bollywood !
Imran , Saudi Arabia
I 've been a big fan of Rahman for over a decade now and to my untrained ears , he has done much better work than Slumdog .
But i guess as Einstein won the noble for e=mc2 rather than for theory of relativity so has Rahman for something that his not his best work and surely in either case , the true genius eventually got the reward it deserved
Rajesh , India Rahman 's music unlike others is n't just hear once and move on , it lingers in memory and one tends to hum it over and over again , he is beyond doubt the greatest musician we have , his talent in music is truly gifted , and like they say God chooses one in a million and he is the chosen one .
Vijay , India ARR is a trend - setter and a perfect inspiration for aspiring creative pros like me .
Though many can identify ARR 's song in their sleep from even a small interlude , his greatest composition till date is contemporarising India 's National Song Vande Mataram ... making it cool to sing patriotic songs :) ARR ki Jai Ho !
Magesh Iyer , India I 'm thrilled that an Indian has won not only one but double Oscar award .
My best wish to all Indians around the globe and I hope this trend of fetching the Oscar will continue in the future .
Deepak Chawla , Hong Kong AR Rahman is so humble and down to earth .
His great work in music speaks for itself .
You will never find him praising his own work .
He is a true Indian Hero .
Great talent and someone who makes us all very proud to be an Indian .
I would n't say that Slumdog his best work but he has done marvellous job in his earlier Tamil ( Mani Ratnam 's esp. ) films like Roja , Bombay , Dil Se ( Hindi ) , Minsara Kanavu , Kannathil Muthamittal , etc. .
He should have won the Oscar long time ago but nothing is too late for him to bag two Oscars .
Mohanavanan Selvaraju , China ( Malaysian ) Rahman has made all Indians very proud today .
He is the best musician of the modern India and represents India in its true form , traditional with a modern twist .
Few years ago I took my English husband to his concert in NEC a few years back and my husband has since become a fan of his , having loads of his tunes on his IPod along with the rest of the western music that he is into .
Way to go Rahman and India , we are very proud of you !!
A Shelley , UK Kudos to Rahman !
If his Slumdog score can fetch him 2 Oscars , one can only imagine how many will he be able to win if his other original works in Tamil and Hindi can fetch him .
He is a class act ; no doubt about it but what stands out is he keeps reinventing himself and his music .
No two films , songs , background score ever sound the same surprisingly for a career spanning 17 years so far .
With greatness comes humbleness and the only other contemporary that I can think of who fits this bill is Sachin Tendulkar !
Rajasekaran Elangovan , India Rahman Rocks !
Its just fitting that he got this recognition globally .
Also what better a place than the Academy Awards , after all , Slumdog Millionaire is a film about a city in India , directed / produced by a British , winning an Academy Award in America , that is being hosted by an Australia .
Now that 's a perfect global setting for a global tunesmith
Vishal , US
You have done a great job to make the world know his talent , creativity , humbleness and humility .
I salute you Biswas .
No wonder he has proved to this world that a guy with humble back ground can reach heights if one concentrate only on growth and love .
Rest is history .
RN Anand Kumar M.tech : M.B.A , India
He 's not my favourite but , I respect him for his originality and creativity .
I 'm proud he hails from my home town - Chennai and very glad that he remains as an outsider to the " world 's most incestuous film industry " - Bollywood , whose survival is a mystery .
Other Indian film industries like Tamil , Malayalam , Bengali , Oriya have managed to maintain higher degree of originality and has delivered lots of quality films and music .
To me , AR Rahman 's melody is only next to my all - time - favourite , genius , ' Maestro ' Illayaraja , whose talent is largely unrecognized outside South India .
Dbalaji , US Yes , I have to agree with the writer .
Somehow for me nothing comes close to Thiruda Thiruda ( Thief , Thief ) .
It is Rahman 's most unnoticed work .
Anand , India
It 's proud to see Tamils did very well in the Oscar .
Rahman is rock and MIA is upcoming singer .
I am delight and pleased about both achievements .
Kumar , UK Roja seemed to revive Indian film music .
At that most of music coming out of industry seemed ' routine ' .
It was like a new breath of life for film music .
All of his musical score are worth adding to your collection .
Some of them may not be outstanding but can be listened to again and again .
Anurag , UK I 'm amazed no one has mentioned AR Rahman 's work for the West End and Broadway in " Bombay Nights " , produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2002 .
Tanya , UK I am so pleased for Mr Rahman , he is a musical genius whom I 've listened to since the days of Roja and Bombay ...
Him mixing it up with M.I.A was such an amazing combination ....
I 'd recommend the BBC to do a documentary on his biography , what an exciting artist !
Gwan Rahman !
Aamir Idrees , UK Congrats to ARR for winning 2 Oscar awards in a year which makes him the only Indian to have achieved the honour so far .
He has come a long way from his first Tamil film ' Roja ' .
The very fact that a Tamil film music director has achieved national and international accolades speaks of his prowess in music .
Even though his ' Slumdog Millionaire ' music is not extraordinary as his many of the other Tamil movie songs which I have been collecting since his first Tamil movie ' Roja ' , his recognition in world forum needs to be applauded .
Way to go ARR .
I am looking forward to hearing more of your melodious Tamil Movie songs where you always excel .
Arun , Seattle , USA
As the writer rightly points out Slumdog probably does n't rank among his top 5 works - which is an indication of how consistent he is .
If you consider how many film scores he has written .
There are films like Dil Se , Taal , Rang DB , Lagaan that are arguably better .
Ahmed , UK What a combination !
A Tamil Hindu , converting to Islam , scoring the music and Hindi song for a largely British film , about slums in Mumbai , receiving an Oscar .
This is the epitome of a flat world with ARR summing it perfectly by saying that he chose love over hate .
Raj , India Please check out Rahman 's music on the just released movie " Delhi 6 " .. Its awesome .
the hit track " masakkali " and the back ground tunes just amaze me , as to how much more great music is left in his bag ..
Guru , India AR .
Rahman is the sure - fire hit maker whose unconventional compositions have inspired a sometimes stagnant genre .
As a composer , Rahman 's style is instantly recognisable and often imitated .
He 's a musical omnivore : synthesizers meet flamenco guitar , rock ' n ' roll rubs up against Indian folk and classical , and they all seem to get along .
Rahman is also known for breaking new and untrained vocalists in a notoriously insular field .
Finally an Oscar is an milestone achievement , another feather to his cap of achievements .
Manohar , USA Oodles of thanks for this wonderful write up .
Undoubtedly it is reader 's paradise .
Bless you for the genuine kudos on an Indian Mozart .
D Ramesh Walter , India AR Rahman is the best - ever music itself that God has offered us .
I am fully delighted and enthralled to live in the same country and having been born in the same state where he was born .
The moment of receiving two Oscars in a span of ten minutes is not only his moment but also the whole India 's moment .
He made India a proud country .
Indians look forward to listening to his best music numbers and scores which portray India 's talents and make them come to limelight .
Nagarajan S , India Fantastically written .
I am marvelled at Mr Biswas 's story - weaving facilities and vocabulary
The article made for a very interesting read .
Yogendra Kalavalapalli , India I am looking forward to watching this movie and after this story paying close attention to music .
Clyde Driscoll , Chicago , US Well written , revealing and well deserved article .
Truly humble personality who uplifted a number of artists and musicians to the Indian music and now to the world music .
From his start - up jingles to his first hit movie ' Roja ' to the latest ' Delhi 6 ' , ARR beautifully blended Indian classical music , folk music and world music by leveraging his magical synthesizing skills .
Wondered why the world unnoticed his music when my western friends instantly loved few of his numbers .
Finally , that day is today !
S Nambiar , Netherlands I do n't agree with Soutik on one point .
I think ARR is a gifted singer too .
Listen to the two Hindi / Jazz tracks of the movie " Jane tu yea jane ne na " and " Delhi 6 " .
No one ever done this before in Hindi .
It is a clever fusion of Hindi melody with Jazz .
He should sing more .
He made us proud to get Oscar recognition .
Ujjwal Dhar , USA
This may be the beginning of the Bollywood crossover into Hollywood .
Krishnan , USA AR Rahman is over rated !
John , USA
Fell in love with his music , from the first moment i heard the album Roja .
It was passed around all my friends how only listened to English music .
Since than its been a non -stop love affair .
His ability to fuse different sounds , the sheer diversity of his work , takes my breath away .
His latest album Delhi - 6 is just awesome .
He is a genius and am happy that the world has finally recognized it .
He deserved the double Oscars long time back .
What a moment , just so happy for him .
Aicha , Maldives
This is a staggeringly condescending article about an exceptional and uniquely talented composer of international repute .
" not your archetypal tune ripper " -- how exceedingly kind .
" The songs and score for Roja ... a 1992 film ... is possibly his best and most consistent work to date " -- so he peaked with his debut album 17 years back ?.
Skip this article and head directly to Wikipedia .
Srikanth , USA
He 's quite frankly a musical genius .
Every note he touches is golden .
From lounge scene ( Cafe del Mar ) , to dance floor fillers and everything in - between a talent beyond all belief .
Well done A.H.R .
Aaron , Netherlands
My introduction to AR Rahman was very interesting .
My otherwise serious boss used to play the songs in the office !!!!
Have not missed a single one since then .
Well done ARR , you are awesome .
M F Fakhru , Cambridge
You do n't get tired of listening to his music .
Murali , Denmark I fully appreciate and endorse most of the points written about Rahman in this article .
Years ago , I watched his first movie Roja after travelling about 450 KM in a motorcycle one ( that too a late night show ) .
The freshness of his music hit me that night and it continues to hit me movie after movie , irrespective of the language and storyline .
A R Rahman 's one of the rarest of combination , extraordinary talent and equally extraordinary humility .
May
God bless him with more and more success and in the process let him make the lives of every music love pleasant with his BRAND of music .
Shankar Muthukrishnan , India Believe it or not AR Rahman 's music made a turning point in my life in 1995 .
Rahman 's one after another super hit film music made me rethink about my way of life .
I was forcibly recruited into the child soldier wing of the rebel group in Sri Lanka as a teenage boy and was not allowed to listen to cinema songs .
But to listen Rahman 's songs from popular Tamil movies such as Roja , Kathalan , Thiruda Thiruda , Gentleman , Bombay and Duet ; I secretly sneaked out of the rebel base and used to visit a nearby home to listen to these sweet melodies .
Eventually I fell in love with a girl and ran away from the rebel movement to live a new life .
Thanks to Rahman , that his romantic music made me found someone to share my dreams with .
A.Murali , Canada
The article is really good .
I have seen his first film Roja in 1996 when I was in Sri Lanka .
That day I thought this musician would do a lot to the global world .
Anurakumara Munasinghe , Canada I think A R Rahman deserves more than Oscar award .
I am biggest fan of his music specially fusion type .
AR Rahman Rocks !
Ajit Kumar , Netherlands ARR is a legend for any good listener of music ..his tunes appeal across all cultures and tastes for music ... his works indeed signify the universality of music
Muhammad Sanusi Isa , Kano , Nigeria
Its a good article but misses one thing about Rahman 's music and that is his minute depiction of possible & imaginative natural sounds and echoes and his attempt to " musify " nature makes the phrase " nature sings " a literal one .
Syed Yazdan , Canada Great article , I did not know about AR Rahman that much , and now i enjoy reading about his life and his music .
I am just little bit curious that why and how he converted to Islam , not that i am against it just to want to know if some one know more details please write .
I think i will listen to his music more now as now i am his fan .
Sonny , Canada Excellent article in recognizing ARR great talent in music , whether English , Tamil , or Hindi .
Well awarded Oscar .
Briya T , Canada
Like many of the posters of above comments , I too grew up with ARR 's music .
He is a legend in my eyes .
The 2nd generation Tamils ( i am a Tamil ) in London would no doubt state ARR as their favourite Indian musician .
He has given us so much - such great music - it is time he is recognised .
" Ella Puhalum Oruvan Oruvanuke " - " all praise is really for that One person ( Almighty ) " - one of his most famous songs .
Mayooran , London , UK A superb summary of ARR 's work & a deserving tribute to him !
He deserved it long ago .
Long live Bollywood & Indian Music !!!
Ashish , UK Excellent article .
You have almost managed to catch the magic of Rahman 's music in words .
I am however surprised that you have written that he is not a " particularly gifted vocalist " .
I believe his version of Vande Mataram in 1997 and the song Lukka Chuppi from the move Rang De Basanti were technically brilliant .
Any comments ?
Sanjay Krishnamoorthy , UK Have n't seen the film yet , i look forward to it very much as i was born in Bombay as it was then , fifty years ago .
I remember the slums and the hard life of poverty that many shared .
i also remember the calm philosophy and acceptance and spirituality that exists there .
most of all there was LIFE and a huge Vitality that prevailed .
people got on with it .
the score of this film reflects this .
I plan to search out the music of Rahman , as i do n't know it .
i look forward to this ---- thank you to previous contributors to this item as i now know what to look for .
Well done Rahman --- Well done everyone connected with Slumdog Millionaire .
Adeline , united Kingdom Rahman , you are a true genius .
I feel as if I got that prize .
I hope things improve soon so that we can have you here as well for a performance that would set the pace for new relationship .
All the best to you and all Indians who made to the stage .
Ahmed Jahanzeb , Pakistan Great article , however , I would like to mention that Rahman 's all time best is from a Tamil movie called DUET .
He has so effectively used saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath in his tunes that it truly puts one into eternal bliss
Pradeep , USA
Those of you who love Rahman 's music , make sure you listen to this old ( 1994 ) album called " Duet " .
The movie Duet is a story about two brothers who are musicians and who have a common love interest .
Though the movie was standard Tamil romance fare , the soundtrack excelled and is fresh and exciting to listen to , to this day .
It has a prominent place for the saxophone and for the Indian drums and other traditional instruments , while maintain that aural sheen that Rahman managed to convey to most of his listeners in his music .
Rajesh , USA I agree , AR Rahman 's best are Roja and Thiruda Thiruda with Manirathnam .
There are two more bests with Bharathiraja , Kizhakku Cheemaiyile and Karuthamma .
AR Rahman is called Mozart of Madras .
I would say he should be called Beethoven of Chennai , Because there is a Mozart in Chennai , in the name Ilaiyaraja .
You may equate the relation between Mozart and Beethoven between these two Tamil Musicians , epitome of Indian Music .
Raj , India
Yes indeed - A R Rahman is a true musical alchemist as this feature says .
I have mostly enjoyed his music , but my problem with him has always been that he does not have his own signature trend like Ilayarajah , the other great musical legend from Chennai , who ironically has never achieved the recognition he should have .
Would Rahman have been such a success if he had started around 20 years earlier in the Indian music industry , when technology was limited and global influence was limited in Indian music .
Do n't get me wrong .
I do enjoy his music .
Being a Tamil and Indian , I am proud of his achievement and global recognition .
But I am just making my case that everyone should not start thinking of him as the greatest Indian cinema composer ever .
He is definitely one of the best , but he is yet to prove that he is the best .
Prathaban M , USA Great article .
But I was wondering how come no one has mentioned the movie Taal .
I think along with Roja , Taal songs are immortal .
I agree with some of the comments that Slumdog music is not his best - he has done much better with other film music .
Meenal , Boston , USA Danny Boyle staged the slums of Bombay to Oscar world and BBC followed it up with an exquisite resume of the musical maestro .
Britain continues to discover India and stage it to the World .
Rajen Narayan , USA Undoubtedly , Rahman 's master - piece was Roja , closely followed by Bombay .
In my opinion , he was quite undeserving of the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire .
Nevertheless , it 's good to know that his most ordinary work was much appreciated by the world .
Just imagine , what happens when the world gets to hear his best work !
Antara Majumdar , India / US
I have been a huge fan of Rahman myself and have followed his career quite closely for the past 16 years .
Regional and Hindi music alike , he has produced wonderful tunes that stayed with us for years after the movie faded away .
While I agree and join together with you in lavishing praise on Rahman , I would disagree with you when you say Bollywood music has just filched tunes from the West before Rahman came along .
Even a cursory glance at the works of giants of yesteryear would easily refute the claim .
The names Naushad Ali , Sachin Dev Burman , Madan Mohan , Salil Choudhary , O.P. Nayyar , R.D.Burman , Ilaiyaraaja spring to mind .
It might be true that their music did n't have the global appeal but then that 's only due to the fact that they never bothered to customize their music to suit the palate of Western audience .
They were all geniuses in their own right .
Usually , it takes a while to appreciate music of a totally different genre .
You can't expect the West to come harping about an Indian classical composition which is what most of these composers built their songs upon .
That should not take anything away from the beauty of their compositions though .
Even with Rahman 's own compositions , I would go as far as saying that this is not even one of his best works .
More suited to his global audience perhaps but his best ?
Not a chance .
Yes , there have been instances of plagiarism in Bollywood music but those instances can only be seen as aberrations .
It is blasphemous to belittle the countless beautiful melodies heard in the past five decades as unoriginal .
Chandrasekhar , Durham , USA
He also composed music for a Chinese movie called - Warriors of Heaven and Earth
Sidd , USA
What a marvellous musician he is .
AR Rahman 's music are wonderful , inspiring , awesome .
I am a Sri Lankan & proud that an Asian compose such great music to the world .
Ifthica Shamsudeen , Canada
Three cheers for this wonderful composer .
I have always loved his music and will always remain a die hard fan .
The beauty of his music is that it grows on you .
After listening four or five times one begins to like and then to love his music .
Many a times it has happened to me that I did n't like his music at the first place but after listening to it two or three times , it really gets you .
My favourite albums off course after Roja are : ' Rangeela ' , ' Taal ' & ' Rangde '
Abbas , Pakistan
It was amazing to see AR Rahman winning double OSCARs , congrats to him and India .
We were very surprised as well as felt very proud to here Tamil words from him during the awards .
( A ) ( R) eally highly talented and modest Rahman .
Jai Ho !!!
Varsha , Manju & Sentil , UK
Do not forget the awesome music of Lagaan ... Sheer Genius .
Ameesh , USA Rahman truly deserves this for his humbleness , talent and simplicity .
William Yesupatham , United Kingdom
An interesting article about ARR .
He is a magical musician and deserves this award very much .
I like MIA / ARR combination and hope they work together in future projects .
Durai Samy Anandanesan , United Kingdom
I was in school when I first heard Rahman 's first song , it was unbelievable .
No one in India had ever heard anything like that .
From that day onwards everyone new that a legend was born .
We used to wait to hear his next song and even after these years it has not changed .
I think there is no one in India who has made more hits than him .
I am happy that at last he is recognised for his talent .
It was just matter of time .
I hope this will let people around the world start listening to Rahman 's and Indian music and enjoy it .
Congrats to Rahman , you just made 100 million people proud to be called Indians .
Jai Hind .
Bjorn Mannathukkaren , Nottingham , United Kingdom
If you talk about AR Rahman , you should know about Ilyaraja - the first Indian composer to score a symphony and became the first Asian to score a symphony for the London Philharmonic .
Rahman worked as his assistant probably at the age of 14 yrs .
Momtaz A , Canada
Very well written .
all those lovers of Rahman 's music are very much happy after his victory at the greatest platform .
Long live Rahman , long live his magic - music !!!
Shawon , Bangladesh
At last , A R Rahman received his prize for his enthusiasm , dedication & hard working .
Hats off to ARR .
His creativity will be long run .
Anyway , excellent article which drew ARR smartly .
Tanim , Bangladesh AR Rahman really rocks and he has proved the world that Indian can do anything if they are determined .
Sadia Durrani , USA Listen to the album Connections ( 2009 ) by A.R. Rahman which would get him the next Oscars ...
Also probably " Delhi - 6 " songs are way ahead than the Slumdog scores ...
They is no competition to rahman ...
Pratheek , Germany I had the opportunity to work with Rahman about 20 years ago , on an ad jingle .
He was known as Dilip then .
I had composed the jingle , and his role was to just put it together on his keyboard in the recording studio .
He said hey let 's tweak this a bit , and turned a rather commonplace tune into a what turned out to be a hit jingle .
We became good friends .
I saw his genius even then , and knew he'd make it right to the top .
Rahman as I knew him was incredibly unassuming , soft - spoken , always cheerful , and very strong in his faith in God .
Hathef Khazvini , India
While this remains a milestome for Rahman , this can't be said to be recognition of Indian or Classical music which is highly evolved form of music and difficult to understand .
This form of music from ARR coming to us is extremely Western , this has everything : software , remix , fusion , rhythm , hip hop everything under the sun .
I would also like to point out that most of the Indians back at home realise that A R Rahman 's potential is going down , we are not getting to hear what he could compose in 90s , he was far more melodious .
Would be very happy the day ARR gets an oscar for a Hindi film .
Niraj , UAE Very nice article - but you forgot to mention ' Rangella ' , I think it 's fair to say that was the soundtrack that really got him accepted in the mainstream .
I have n't watched Slumdog yet but I 'm really happy that Rahman got the oscar !

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
This is obviously a terrible time for the economy .
For that reason , it made sense for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates near zero last month .
But I 'm starting to worry a bit that the Federal Reserve is willing to leave rates this low for too long and that this could spark inflation down the road .
In a speech in London Tuesday morning , Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke defended the Fed 's series of rate cuts since September 2007 , saying that inflation was no longer a major concern .
The Fed usually raises interest rates when it is worried about inflation .
" At this point , with global economic activity weak and commodity prices at low levels , we see little risk of inflation in the near term ; indeed , we expect inflation to continue to moderate , " he said .
Bernanke 's speech comes one day after Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said that there has been a " substantial slowing of inflation . "
What 's more , he hinted that rates could hover at this level for some time .
" I would argue that a federal funds rate this low will have considerable macroeconomic effect especially if accompanied by policies to improve the functioning of credit markets , " he said in a speech in Atlanta Monday .
Yes , these are unprecedented times .
And the Fed should be applauded for using every weapon in its arsenal -- and even creating a bunch of new ones -- to tackle the crisis .
What 's more , with economies around the world suffering a severe recession , it is tempting to declare that inflation is dead .
In fact , some economists are starting to worry more about deflation , a persistent decline in prices that could lead to further declines in industrial production , more job losses and even wage declines .
But inflation is not dead .
I 'd argue that it 's merely in hibernation .
The combination of the economic stimulus package proposed by President - elect Obama , the Treasury Department 's bank bailout , the Fed 's rate cuts and its various lending programs could eventually lead to an awakening of the inflation beast .
The Fed has to be mindful of that .
The government has to pay for all this spending somehow and the likely source of these funds , especially since tax cuts are a big part of the proposed stimulus , is probably going to be from new money printed by the Fed .
And adding dollars into the system can't help but add to inflationary pressures .
" The bottom line is that the only way to get out of this recession is to spend a lot of money on stimulus and dump a lot of money into the economic system .
That means there will be inflation for a long period of time , " said David Beahm , vice president of economic research with Blanchard & Company Inc , a New Orleans - based investing firm that specializes in tangible assets like gold and other precious metals .
Bernanke suggested Tuesday that the rapid rise in oil and other commodities prices earlier last year was due to strong demand from emerging markets and that the precipitous decline in oil prices since the summer was largely due to lower global demand in the wake of the credit collapse .
Is that really the case though ?
Just as oil may have been irrationally high when it was above $ 140 a barrel , crude may also be trading at an artificially low price below $ 40 a barrel .
" Commodities wo n't go up as quickly as they did last year , which is healthy .
But with all this money being dumped into the system to help the economy , it will allow companies to spend more and stimulate demand .
That 's when higher commodities come back into play , " Beahm said .
If commodity prices shoot higher in the near future , that could add to inflationary concerns since it could lead to another round of higher gas prices and food prices .
Now do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not arguing that the Fed raise interest rates at its next meeting later this month or even at the one following that .
But the Fed needs to keep a close eye on what commodity prices are doing .
In particular , the Fed has to be careful to not allow the dollar to fall as dramatically as it did against the euro and other currencies earlier last year .
The weak greenback was caused , in part , by the Fed 's interest rate cuts .
That 's because many other global central banks were not yet lowering their own rates .
And the weak dollar added to the upward pressure on the price of oil and other imported goods and commodities .
Kathy Lien , director of currency research with GFT , a foreign exchange and futures brokerage firm , said this should be less of a problem now that the Bank of England and European Central Bank have joined the Fed in lowering rates .
But with rates at zero in the U.S. , Lien said many foreign investors may wind up fleeing the dollar , which could spark another round of inflation fears .
" What the Fed risks is a potential run on the dollar , with rates at zero it makes the dollar - denominated assets unattractive for foreign investors , " she said .
Nonetheless , both Beahm and Lien think the Fed has done the right thing to lower rates .
The issue though is to not keep them this low for an indefinite period of time .
" The Federal Reserve can not afford to focus on inflation at this point .
They have to focus on growth and deal with inflation later , " Lien said .
" But as the economy stabilizes , inflation will become a greater risk and it could pick up at a relatively rapid pace , which could force aggressive measures by the Fed . "
Are you unemployed and using unconventional methods to find work ?
Tell us about it , and you could be included in an upcoming story .
Artificial Sunshine presents a history of domestic lighting in Britain , looking in turn at fire and firelight , rushlights and tallow candles , wax candles , and lighting by oil , gas , and electricity .
It covers the development of lighting technologies , the entrepreneurs and economics behind those , and the social context of lighting in different households .
Some excerpts will give a feel for the material covered .
" For centuries the use of beeswax candles remained the prerogative of the Church , the Crown and the nobility .
...
The royal household employed its own wax chandlers and although independent workers in this craft are thought to have emerged in the thirteenth century , it was not until 1484 that the Wax Chandlers of the City of London were granted a Royal Charter by Richard III . "
" A development of c.1773 that advanced oil technology was the introduction by Leger of a flat wick of woven cotton that improved combustion and produced a larger flame .
The flat wick was subsequently used to good effect with the ' air burner ' lamp that was first patented in France in 1783 by Ami Argand .
...
The burner comprised a wide , cylindrical woven wick held between two concentric metal tubes .
This increased air supply to the wick which was drawn up the middle tube and , together with the airflow on the outside of the wick , allowed for full aeration of the flame .
Combustion and efficiency were further increased by the addition of a glass chimney .
In terms of light - output the lamp had no rivals as it claimed to produce illumination equal to that of ten wax candles , 10 c.p . "
" electric lighting remained a luxury for many years , and a house lit by electricity indicated prosperity and progressiveness .
The non-inflammable nature of electric lighting provided unprecedented opportunities for decorative effects , while its combination of novelty , luxury and modernity was emphasised through the use of expensive and occasionally frivolous gadgets . "
At the end of the nineteenth century , nearly all the forms of lighting covered were in use in different settings .
" It was rare for the poor to waste light , although in the homes of the ' respectable ' working classes a shaded lamp may have been amongst the prized possession in the parlour or ' front ' room .
For very poor city or country dwellers , abundant light was still beyond the means of many , even at the end of the nineteenth century .
Rural labourers like the fenmen of Wicken ... were no doubt glad of the light provided by their humble oil lamps and candlesticks .
When money was tight , there was always the light from the turves burning in large open fireplaces .
Others , through choice or financial considerations , continued with candle and oil lighting into the twentieth century "
Dillon 's account tails off in the early 20th century , with the victory of electric lighting over gas , and ends by 1948 , with the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry .
She does n't venture at all into modern innovations in electric lighting such as fluorescents and LEDs .
There 's a fair bit of detail about individual items and the locations in which they can be found , which only those in Britain with a serious attraction to light fittings are likely to appreciate .
" Early pricket candlesticks in brass , bronze , silver , and carved and gilded wood can often be found in family chapels , as at Belton House , Ightham Mote and Hardwick Hall .
Some of the oldest were rescued by Charles Paget Wade , and form part of his Snowshill collection .
In a number of other houses , for example Antony , early candlesticks have been converted into electric table lamps . "
Many of these items are made more accessible , however , through colour photographs , which take up about half of Artificial Sunshine .
These depict candle holders , lamps , and other lighting implements , but also their settings in rooms and houses , and some aspects of their use .
Dillon also makes good use of quotes from contemporary publications , drawing on memoirs and diaries , manuals and trade journals , and a range of other sources .
Artificial Sunshine draws heavily on National Trust houses and their contents , but that 's not much of limitation given the number and variety of their properties .
The more fundamental constraint is , as Dillon acknowledges , that some kinds of items are much more likely to survive than others .
She also covers only Britain , with no attempt at international comparisons .
There is more than enough in Artificial Sunshine as it is , however .
Anyone curious about the history of technology or British social history should find much to enjoy in it , even if they have no special interest in lighting .
December 2008
John W. Ripley , a highly decorated former colonel who entered Marine Corps lore when he single - handedly blunted a major North Vietnamese offensive during the Vietnam War by blowing up a strategically placed bridge , died Oct. 28 at his home in Annapolis , Md. He was 69 .
The cause has not been determined , his son Stephen said .
Colonel Ripley , who at the time was a captain and a military adviser to a South Vietnamese Marine unit , blew up the southern end of the Dong Ha Bridge over the Cua Viet River on Easter Sunday , April 2 , 1972 .
On the north side of the bridge , which was several miles south of the demilitarized zone , some 20,000 North Vietnamese troops and 200 tanks were poised to sweep into Quang Tri Province , which was sparsely defended .
Going back and forth for three hours while under fire , Captain Ripley swung hand over hand along the steel I - beams beneath the bridge , securing himself between girders and placing crates holding a total of 500 pounds of TNT in a diagonal line from one side of the structure to the other .
The I - beam wings were just wide enough to form pathways along which he could slide the boxes .
When the boxes were in place on the bridge , Captain Ripley attached blasting caps to detonate the TNT , then connected them with a timed - fuse cord that eventually extended hundreds of feet .
THE devil is certainly in the detail when it comes to planning sanctuaries for plants and animals in the wild .
The amount of land available may well be less than we imagine because the scale of existing models is too large .
 The land available for saving plants and animals may well be less than we imagine 
At present , most models divide the world into 50 - kilometre grid squares , which gives a very coarse resolution .
Changwan Seo of the University of Seoul , South Korea , and his colleagues tested four models at a variety of spatial scales , using existing data for rare plants …
In a follow up post , I will take a look at the short term prospects to 2015 for coal production , imports , exports , and prices in relation to the World Energy Outlook 2008 .
Based on available coal reserve data and scenarios ( EWG 2007 ; Tao and Li 2007 ) , it is much more likely that China will reach a plateau in coal production somewhere between 2015 and 2025 .
The implications of this are significant , because it will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to substitute other energy sources for coal on the vast scale needed for Chinese growth .
The quality of reserve data is poor , however .
Better reserve data is needed , particularly for China , to have certainty with respect to these findings .
My conclusions are that if we look at a global level , taking coal reserve data at face value , the global IEA reference scenario for coal production to 2030 is possible .
However , when focusing on China , the country that now produces 41 % of all coal , the scenario is unlikely to occur because China possesses insufficient coal reserves to sustain production to 2030 at the level expected by the IEA .
Only in a highly optimistic case , if China 's coal reserves are more than double those currently known , will China be able to sustain coal production as expected in the IEA reference scenario .
The International Energy Agency expects coal production to nearly double by 2030 in their World Energy Outlook 2008 if no large scale governmental intervention occurs .
In this post , I analyse the likelihood of this happening from the perspective of available coal reserves .
Introduction
According to " common wisdom " , coal is an abundant energy resource .
The amount of coal underground is expected by most energy experts to be sufficient to sustain coal consumption until at least the end of the 21st century .
Recently , doubts have been raised about this view by two independent studies analyzing the quality of coal resource / reserve data , as well as potential for future coal production ( EWG 2007 ; Kavalov 2007 ) .
These reports make it clear that the quality of coal data is very poor and does not support the view that coal consumption can continue to grow in the second half of the 21st century .
More importantly , obtaining sufficient coal could become problematic for coal importers in the next two decades due to coal export constraints .
For the details on these reports , see an earlier post by Chris Vernon published on the Oil Drum .
In this post , I take an in - depth look at the coal production scenario of the IEA 's World Energy Outlook 2008 , building upon the research of EWG ( 2007 ) and Kavalov ( 2007 ) .
I do not make a distinction among the different types of coal ( Bituminous , Sub- bituminous and lignite ) in most of my analysis , as this makes the analysis easier , and I think that it will not change the picture to a significant extent .
The Reference scenario for coal from the IEA WEO 2008
In order to understand a scenario , we need to know how it has been constructed .
The IEA looks at future coal production from two perspectives : the availability of the resource and the price of coal in different coal producing markets .
Since the formulas used in the IEA model have not been published , I cannot tell in detail how the reference scenario has been created .
The following snippet is the only piece of information available :
" The coal module is a combination of a resources approach and an assessment of the development of domestic and international markets , based on the international coal price .
Production , imports and exports are based on coal demand projections and historical data , on a country basis .
Three markets are considered : coking coal , steam coal and brown coal .
World coal trade , principally constituted of coking coal and steam coal , is separately modelled for the two markets and balanced on an annual basis . "
( IEA World Energy Model 2008 )
From that piece of information and some personal experience with economic models , my guess is that model uses separate coal reserves and average price levels for each coal producing country .
Based on the demand model that I described in an earlier post , coal production likely occurs in the model in the location where it is most cost effective to produce .
Production likely also considers constraining import / export factors , leading to an expected pattern of coal production and trade .
I expressly state that I could be wrong here , since no formulas are available .
In any case , the World Energy Model of the IEA leads to the following reference scenario in the World Energy Outlook 2008 :
Table 1 - World Primary Coal Production in the IEA WEO 2008 Reference Scenario
As we can see from the table , the scenario shows continuing growth in coal production until 2030 in nearly all regions of the world except Europe .
Average annual coal production growth on a world - wide basis between 2006 and 2030 is expected to be 2 % .
What is written in the IEA WEO 2008 about coal reserves ?
The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) uses coal reserve data from the World Energy Council 's ( WEC ) survey of energy resources .
This is the only public source of coal reserve data in the world ; other publications with coal reserve data in the public domain always use data from the WEC Survey of Energy Resources .
An example is the widely used BP Statistical Review of World energy 2008 * .
The IEA uses the WEC coal reserve data without questioning its validity :
" Coal is the most abundant and geographically dispersed fossil fuel .
Proven reserves at the end of 2005 were 847 billion tonnes ( WEC , 2007 ) ... Current reserves are more than adequate to meet projected growth in coal demand through to 2030 in this Outlook . "
( IEA WEO 2008 , page 127 ) .
In my opinion , the unquestioned use of WEC data by the IEA is a core problem of the coal analysis in the World Energy Outlook 2008 .
Most of the data provided by WEC is of poor quality and outdated ( EWG 2007 ) .
This is a result of the manner in which the WEC collects its data .
It is collected by member committees of respective WEC member countries .
Members of these teams are in nearly all cases not experts in the field of coal reserves / resources .
They rely on asking institutes within their respective country to provide useful data , which is subsequently forwarded to the editors of the survey of energy resources .
Furthermore , every individual committee uses its own definitions of reserves and resources ( WEC 2007 , page III , 1 and 2 ) .
The effect on coal data can be assessed by looking at the individual WEC reports .
I have compared the data on coal reserves from the WEC Survey of Energy Resources 2001 , 2004 and 2007 .
Earlier editions are not available digitally and have thus not been included .
In the Survey of Energy Resources , 68 countries are reported to have coal reserves .
Of these countries , a total of 39 have had unchanged reserves since the 2001 WEC Survey of Energy Resource ( which contains reserve data as of the end of 1999 ) .
In addition to these 39 countries , another 8 countries show unchanged reserve data from the 2004 to the 2007 survey .
I made a table of the reserves for all 68 countries , together with each country 's latest known reserve year , which can be viewed by clicking this link .
The top - 15 coal reserve holding countries , which account for 96 % of all coal reserves , are shown below in Table 2 .
Table 2 - WEC Survey of Energy Resources 2007 Coal Reserve Figures in Million tonnes ( Top 15 coal reserve countries ) - click for large version
The table of the top - 15 has five anomalies that make it clear that the coal reserve data is of very poor quality :
1 ) The lack of a reserve updates from the 2nd largest coal reserve holding country , Russia .
According to the WEC report this is due to confidentiality issues over Russian coal reserves .
WEC has chosen to retain the latest Russian reserve figures available which date back to the end of 1996 .
2 ) The lack of a reserve update from the 3rd largest coal reserve holding country , China .
No valid reason is given as to why the figures from 1990 have been retained .
One argument is given to support the original data in the WEC report , but this argument leaves a lot to be desired .
It is a reference to a paper that was presented at the 11th Session of the UN committee on Sustainable Energy co-authored by Professor Huang Shengchu , vice - president of the China coal Information Institute .
In this paper the same reserve figure of 114.5 billion tonnes was published as the one published by WEC in 1992 , which according to WEC " indicates a degree of continuity in the official assessments of China 's coal reserves and supports the retention of the level originally advised by the Chinese WEC Member committee in 1991 " ( WEC 2007 , page 26 ) .
3 ) The large 38.9 % downward revision in the 5th coal reserve holding country , India , in the 2007 Survey of Energy Resources versus the 2004 edition .
This is a result of reporting reserves on a recoverable basis instead of reporting in - situ coal resource data ( WEC 2007 , page 2 ) .
4 ) The lack of a reserve update from the 6th largest coal reserve holding country , South Africa .
In the Survey of Energy Resources it is stated that the South African Department of Minerals and Energy has initiated a comprehensive survey to re-evaluate coal reserves but that no information was available as to the progress of this study .
Hence the WEC member committee had to revert to using a number from the latest report from the Department of Minerals and Energy which dates back to 1987 .
This figure has been adjusted by WEC for all the coal produced since then .
5 ) The large downward revision in the 10th largest coal reserve holding country , Poland .
The revision is due to a change in the type of reserves reported .
Poland now reports only the ultimately recoverable amounts in developed deposits ; previously reserves from all known coal deposits were reported .
These fives anomalies in some of the largest coal reserve holders in the world make it clear that there is a need to worry about the quality of coal reserve data .
Better data is needed as coal reserves could very well be much lower than currently reported .
The IEA , however , does not share this concern over data quality :
" Coal is the most abundant and geographically dispersed fossil fuel .
Proven reserves at the end of 2005 were 847 billion tonnes ( WEC , 2007 ) . . . Current reserves are more than adequate to meet projected growth in coal demand through to 2030 in this Outlook .
However the rapid increase in demand in recent years has seen the global reserves - to - production ratio fall sharply , from 188 years in 2002 to 144 years in 2005 ( WEC , 2007 and 2004 ) .
This fall can be attributed to the lack of incentives to prove up reserves , rather than a lack of coal resources .
Exploration activity is typically carried out by mining companies with short planning horizons , rather than by state - funded geological surveys .
With no economic need to prove long - term reserves , the ratio of proven reserve to production is likely to fall further . "
( IEA , WEO 2007 , page 128 ) . "
While the IEA does note that the Reserve to Production ratio is dropping sharply , mainly due to increasing demand ** , this is not seen as a potential limitation to coal production .
A favorable impression of future prospects is given by stating that a lot of coal is left to be explored .
This is a hollow statement in the sense that these amounts left to be explored are not quantified by the IEA in any manner .
Interestingly , this opinion is in stark contrast with that from the World Energy Council which states in its Survey of Energy Resources 2007 , " After centuries of mineral exploration , the location , size and characteristics of most countries ' coal resources are quite well known .
What tends to vary much more than the assessed level of the resources ( in other words , the potentially accessible coal in the ground ) is the level classified as proved recoverable reserves ( that is , the tonnage of coal that has been proved by drilling etc. and is economically and technically extractable ) .
( WEC 2007 , page 13 ) . "
As I am not an expert on the topic of coal exploration I cannot judge the value of either statements .
I do know that some large coal fields are still being found .
A large coal field of 23 billion tonnes of total resources has been uncovered in China since last year ( China People Daily 's Online ) .
What I can say based on current ( poor ) WEC 2007 reserve figures is that the IEA WEO 2008 reference scenario appears to be a scenario that holds some merit .
In this scenario , humanity will have used up 50 % of all coal reserves by 2040 , and 60 % by 2050 ( shown in figure 1 below ) .
The remaining reserve percentage is calculated by adding historic coal production to current WEC reserve statistics .
This is done based on the assumptions that no new coal fields will be discovered , that the current reserve figures are accurate , and that reserves will not be added due to technological improvements .
While we know that all three of these assumptions are incorrect , such a scenario at least tells us that coal production will not outlast the 2nd half of the 21st century without significant increases in reserves , if coal usage continues to grow .
Figure 1 - World Coal Production in blue with 1850 - 2007 ( Historical ) , 2007 - 2030 ( IEA WEO 2008 Reference Scenario ) , 2030 - 2050 ( Extrapolation of IEA WEO 2008 reference scenario ) and in red the reserves remaining measured in percentage of original amount of reserves .
The shape of coal production
In order to get a better understanding of the long term production of coal , we need to study the expected production path of this resource .
This is one of the the big questions that remains unanswered by the IEA .
What will be the shape that coal production takes on a country level and a world level ?
The IEA just makes a forecast that ends in 2030 without any production shape analysis .
When looking at historical data from the United Kingdom , Germany and Japan , we see a very similar shape for coal production on a country level ( Figure 2 below ) .
Coal production reaches a plateau when around 30%/ 40 % of coal reserves have been produced .
The plateau lasts for several decades , after which a quite steep decline sets in .
I have not studied the underlying economic and geological factors of this shape in detail .
My hypothesis is that a physical limitation to coal extraction per time unit occurs due to logistics and energy / economic costs .
In the beginning of extraction on a country level , more coal mines can be opened up and it makes economic sense to do so .
After several decades the better coal grades in easily mineable coal seams have been depleted , and it becomes more difficult to extract more coal per unit of time out .
The costs become too big to increase production ; thus a plateau sets in .
This is a simple hypothesis that needs to be explored further .
Figure 2 - Coal production in the United Kingdom , Japan and Germany from 1815 until 2005 .

In case of the three examples shown above , the decline around 1960 began due to factors affecting the energy market .
Between 1957 and 1960 , there was an oversupply of coal as demand for coal decreased .
The oversupply was caused by a combination of mild winters , several years of low economic growth , an increase of efficiency in the industrial sector , and a shift from coal to oil due to a favorable price difference ( Messing 1988 ) .
The steep decline of production in Japan , Germany and the United Kingdom after 1960 continued because it became more economic to import coal than to produce it at home .
Later on , after 1970 , natural gas began to be substituted for coal in the electricity market .
The specific factors at play in these three examples should lead to caution in duplicating this particular shape of production to other countries and the world .
In the coal studies that analyze the potential for future production , in my opinion , the duplication of a bell shaped curve with a long plateau is done too readily , without sufficient analysis .
I think that the IEA should work to develop a sound analytical framework for the expected production shape of coal , especially because the geographic spread of coal could cause several important producing countries to run out of coal long before 2050 if usage continues without interference .
The first country that is most likely to reach a plateau in coal production is China .
This occurs because 41 % of all coal production in the world came from the country in 2007 .
China - the key to knowing the long term future of coal
Relative to its current production , China appears to possess sufficient reserves .
China has 13.5 % of total global reserves according to WEC statistics , which implies that the country extracts 2 % of its reserves each year .
However , China 's coal extraction is growing rapidly at 12 % on average in the past five years ( 18 % in 2003 dropping each year since then to 7 % in 2007 ) .
If the 2007 growth rate of 7 % continues , China will be extracting 5 % of its reserves per year by 2017 .
According to the IEA World Energy Outlook 2008 , this will not become a problem .
The growth in Chinese coal production is expected to slow significantly , averaging 2.8 % between 2006 and 2030 , with growth continuing until 2030 .
If current WEC reserve figures are accepted at face value , it becomes clear that this scenario is not possible , as shown in Figure 3 below .
The red line in the figure shows the percentage of reserves remaining based on adding historic production to the WEC reserve figure , and subtracting the reserves produced in the WEO coal production reference scenario for China from this number each year .
As can be seen , China will have used up around 50 % of its reserves by 2020 , and 80 % by 2030 , in the IEA reference scenario for Chinese coal production .
Based upon empirical data from Germany , UK and Japan as shown above , it is much more likely that China will reach a plateau in coal production somewhere between 2010 and 2020 .
Again , I have to state as earlier , this is based on the assumptions that no new coal fields will be discovered , that the current reserve figures are accurate , and that reserves will not be added due to technological improvements .
While we know that all three of these assumptions are incorrect , it at least becomes clear that the IEA Reference scenario for China is not possible without a very large increase in Chinese reserves .
Figure 3 - Chinese Coal Production in blue with 1980 - 2006 ( Historical ) , 2007 - 2030 ( IEA WEO 2008 Reference Scenario ) , and in red the reserves remaining measured in percentage of original amount of reserves .
In the WEO 2008 , the IEA does not state what assumptions were made in arriving at their scenario for Chinese coal production .
However , some information is given in an earlier report , the World Energy Outlook of 2007 .
In the 2007 edition a more detailed look was taken on China and India , including Chinese coal production and consumption .
Regarding Chinese coal resources and reserves the following is stated :
" China ’s remaining coal resources are second only to Russia ’s , totalling 1003 billion tonnes ( General Geological Bureau , 1999 ) .
These resources have been defined by exploration and mapping , but only 115 billion tonnes can be regarded as proven reserves , yielding a reserve - to - production ratio of around 50 years at current production levels .
More recent assessments conclude that proven reserves could be as high as 192 billion tonnes ( Barlow Jonker , 2007 ) .
A prospecting programme is currently under way to prove up more resources , using revenues from the competitive tendering of mining rights . " ( IEA WEO 2007 , page 334 )
The reference to Barlow Jonker in the piece above quoting 192 billion tonnes , as a potential figure for proven reserves , is the only piece of information that the IEA gives to support their Chinese coal outlook .
Barlow Jonker is a daughter company of Wood Mackenzie .
The report the IEA refers to is Barlow Jonker 's China Coal Fourth Edition report from 2007 which is available at an unknown price ( probably more than $ 10,000 dollars ) through Wood Mackenzie 's China coal market service .
From Barlow Jonker 's statement of capability we learn the following about this report :
" Barlow Jonker ’s ‘ China Coal 4th Edition 2007 ’ is the most complete review of China ’s coal industry available on the market .
The 3 Volume Study covers China ’s coal geology , coal production , transport , consumption and trade .
Containing over 500 pages of information and 60 maps it is THE essential reference guide to all involved in and impacted by China ’s 2.3 billion tonne coal market .
Vol I ‘ Industry Overview ’ provides over 250 pages of information on China ’s entire coal chain from detailed reviews of each province ’s coal geology , to government policy , coal transport , consumption , and trade .
It contains Barlow Jonker ’s own expert opinion and analysis of a range of drivers shaping the industry and forward outlooks .
Vol II ‘ Key Producers ’ has been expanded and contains detailed mine data sheets ( including cost estimates ) on 66 of China ’s largest coal producing companies that collectively control over 500 mines together producing over 1,000 Mtpa .
Also included are data on 230 new coalmine projects with combined new production capacity of over 800 Mt .
The level of detail , presentation , and analysis of this data exists nowhere else .
Vol III ‘ Coastal Consumers ’ is a new addition to the Study examining coal demand in China ’s coastal provinces – the key region impacting on the international seaborne market .
It contains data and analysis of each province ’s coal demand , including power stations and coke producers .
It is essential information for exporters to China , as well as all those impacted by China ’s involvement in the international seaborne market . "
( Barlow Jonker 2007 )
The report sounds like a worthwhile piece of information , but it is inaccessible due to high costs .
Since we cannot read the report , no judgment can be made regarding the validity of the 192 billion tonnes coal reserves figure .
However , what is possible is modeling Chinese coal production with a figure of 192 billion tonnes .
Even better , to make my life easier , there already is a study in which Chinese coal production is modeled using a similar coal reserve figure .
This analysis has been conducted by Tao and Li ( 2007 ) from China Northeastern University .
In this study a coal reserve figure of 186.6 billion tonnes is taken that comes from the Chinese Ministry of Land and Natural Resources as of 2002 .
This figure is inserted in a bell shaped production formula after Laherrere ( 2000 ) by means of Stella modeling software .
Their results show that Chinese production will begin to plateau around 2025 , and the eventual decline sets in around 2035 ( green curve in Figure 3 below ) .
A similar study to that of Tao and Li , based on much lower reserves , has been conducted by the Energy Watch Group ( 2007 ) .
This study concludes that China could reach a plateau in coal production already around 2015 , if reserve figures are lower then WEC suggests ( blue curve in figure 3 below ) .
The EWG uses a coal reserve figure for China of 95.5 billion tonnes , which is the result of subtracting production since 1992 *** from the WEC reserve figure .
The International Energy Agency reference scenario for Chinese coal production almost exactly matches the Tao and Li ( 2007 ) scenario until 2025 .
After that , the two forecasts diverge , with the IEA expecting continued increasing coal production in China until 2030 ( purple curve in figure 3 below ) , while Tau and Li forecast a Chinese coal production plateau .
Figure 3 - Chinese coal production scenarios after Energy Watch Group ( 2007 ) , Tao and Li ( 2007 ) , and IEA WEO ( 2008 ) .
The difference between the scenarios caused by doubling the reserve estimate is striking .
If the Energy Watch Group scenario plays out , the world will be in significant additional trouble soon ( on top of the current problems ) , since it is unlikely that China 's growth boom can continue when Chinese coal production plateaus at the beginning of the next century .
There are no energy sources that can grow quickly enough to substitute for China 's appetite for more energy in such a short period of time , including the import of more coal .
( I will come back to this in the third part of this series . )
On the other hand , if Tao and Li's scenario plays out , there probably still is sufficient time for China to prepare for substitution of coal by other energy sources around 2030 .
In any case , the IEA scenario appears to be unfounded even if we look at a very optimistic coal reserve figure for China .
One of the first issues that needs to be sorted out to get a better grasp at future coal production is the actual state of Chinese coal reserves .
As I was writing this post , I investigated whether there are other sources of data for Chinese coal reserves outside of the public domain that are not as expensive as Barlow Jonker 's coal assessments .
The only source that I found was China Coal Resource .
This company gathers coal data based on an extensive resource / reserves classification assessment including grade quality , production location , and coal seam depth and thickness .
The details could be found earlier here , but this section has been put into the subscriber part as of last week unfortunately .
Subscriptions for one year to this data cost $ 700 , which is a very affordable price .
Furthermore I am informed by the company after inquiring that the reserves data has just been updated to reflect the latest data as of September of this year .
All in all it looks like quite a promising source of data that could shed a great deal of light on China 's coal production , and with China the entire world .
Conclusions
In this post I analyzed the likelihood that the IEA WEO 2008 reference scenario for coal production can happen from a coal reserves perspective .
My conclusions are that if we look at a global level and take the coal reserve data at face value , the data is supportive of the global IEA reference scenario for coal production to 2030 which shows on average coal production growth of 2 % per year between 2006 and 2030 .
Beyond this scenario , further growth of coal production into the 2nd half of the 21st century is unlikely to happen without a significant increase in reserves .
However , inasmuch as 41 % of coal production is now located in China , looking at whether coal production can match up with global reserves no longer makes sense .
When looking at Chinese reserve data , it is not likely that the IEA reference scenario for Chinese coal production can occur , because the coal is simply not there based on current reserve figures .
Only in a highly optimistic case , assuming China 's coal reserves are more then double those currently known , will China be able to produce the amount of coal that the IEA expects in their scenario .
Based on the available coal reserve data and scenarios ( EWG 2007 ; Tao and Li 2007 ) , it is quite likely that China will reach a plateau in coal production somewhere between 2015 and 2025 .
The implications of this are significant because it will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to substitute other energy sources for coal in the quantities needed to maintain China 's growth in consumption .
In order to be able to better assess the likelihood of a Chinese coal production plateau occurring and to study the effects of this on coal production on a global scale , better data and analysis of coal reserves in general , and for China specifically , is a necessity .

Notes
* In the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2008 it is stated that the coal reserve data shows proved reserves at end 2007 .
This is incorrect as the data is until end of 2005 , as stated in the original source of the data , the Survey of Energy Resources 2007 by the World Energy Council .
** While the IEA states that the drop in the reserves to production ratio from 188 years in 2002 to 144 years in 2005 is solely due to demand , this is not the case .
Coal reserves dropped from 909 billion tonnes in 2002 to 847 billion tonnes in 2005 ( WEC 2007 ; WEC 2004 ) , a difference of 62 billion tonnes .
In the same time period 16.6 billion tonnes of coal have been produced ( BP 2008 ) .
If coal reserves would not have been revised downwards due to other factors than the amount of coal produced , then reserves would have been 892 billion tonnes instead of 847 , and the R/P ratio in 2005 would have been 151 instead of 144 years .
*** The Energy Watch Group subtracts Chinese production since 1992 from the WEC coal reserve figure for China , as this was the year in which the last Survey of Energy Resources by the WEC was published that contained new data on Chinese coal reserves .
However , WEC normally publishes in their report data that is two years old ( the 2007 report showed end 2005 data , the 2004 report end 2002 data etc. ) .
I think it is likely that the 1992 report published end 1990 data .
Since I have not been able to find the 1992 report I cannot confirm that this is the case .
The Energy Watch Group has assumed that the 1992 report published 1992 data .
it 's all about Regular expressions ; Regular expressions are a very powerful tool for performing pattern matches in strings .
You can perform complex tasks that once required lengthy procedures with just a few lines of code using regular expressions ...
in this example , i made a simple Code Beautifier and formatter for VB / VBScript / VB.net using JavaScript and CSS .
in this syntax highlighter
There are patterns for matching Comments lines , Quoted strings , Escape HTML tags , and Language Keywords ..
To extend this to format C# for example ; all you need to change is the keywords of that programming language at the line
s = keywords_Beautifier ( " New|Class| .. " , s ) ;
where you should place language keywords as one string separated by | as the first parameter

Protestors demanding an end to drug prohibition caused an uproar outside Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s roundtable discussion on gang violence in downtown Vancouver yesterday .
Over fifty vocal critics gathered to call for an end to the drug war , which they see as the real cause of the gang violence , and to protest the Prime Minister ’s proposed anti-drug legislation that includes mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes .
The activists , including Green Party candidate Jodie Emery and her husband , BC Marijuana Party President Marc Emery ( both editors of Cannabis Culture Magazine ) , held placards reading “ Prohibition Funds Organized Crime ” and “ No Prison For Pot ” and shouted loudly at the Library Square building where Harper met with law enforcement officials .
The protest was covered by several television stations and newspapers , including the CBC , Global , CTV and The Province .

Seth Shostak is the Senior Astronomer at the SETI Institute .
We have seen that his description of SETI contains several points that converge with the approach that I take in The Design Matrix .
Let me now make this even more clear with a posting by Steven Novella , who is a neurologist at Yale University School of Medicine .
Novella expands on Shostak ’s explanation as follows :
What Seth is saying is that we have prior knowledge of the kinds of radio signals that nature is capable of producing .
Natural radio signals have a signature – they are inefficient , which operationally means that they are spread out over a wide spectrum .
So far , this has always been the case .
There is no known natural process that produces a narrow band transmission .
Therefore , SETI is searching for such a narrow - band signal .
But there is a flip side to this that Seth did not discuss – not only do we have knowledge of what kind of radio signals nature can produce , we have knowledge of what kind of radio signals can be generated deliberately by an intelligent race that has achieved radio astronomy ( namely us ) .
We can therefore say that a known marker or signature of technologically produced radio signals can be an efficient narrow band .
This is key – SETI is searching for signals that not only cannot currently be explained by nature , but have a positive feature known to be a marker of intelligent artifice .
I independently identified the same key – the coupling of the negative to the positive is essentially the very same argument I make in The Design Matrix :
The key is that an analogy to designed things is coupled to a discontinuity with non-teleological processes .
They are two sides of the same coin . [ … ]
The examples of the Face on Mars , a message in the DNA , Darwin ’s brass men , and the PCP degradation pathway all converge to highlight the power of a demonstrated analogy with designed things coupled to a demonstrated discontinuity when concluding design .
Join the two and there is a strong design inference .
Fail to join the two and there are serious problems trying to infer design .
Let us now deepen and extend this insight as we prepare a methodology that will help us traverse the Explanatory Continuum in an effort to better assess our suspicions of design .
Novella then continues :
Presumably , however , if SETI did find a candidate signal that had the markers of artifice and lacked a natural explanation , we would then take a closer look at the signal and look for encoded information .
If we found it , how would we know if the information is the product of natural processes or deliberate intelligent artifice ?
Well – we would go through the same process .
Is there anything known in nature that can account for the information , and if not does the information contain any positive evidence or marker for artifice ?
One such marker of technological intelligence is mathematics .
This is what leads to Carl Sagan ’s idea that something like a series of prime numbers would be a possible intelligent tag in an ET signal .
This again is much like The Matrix , where I advocate that we do n’t sit back and proclaim “ design ” upon finding some clue to support a design inference , but instead look more closely – a higher resolution analysis .
This is , after all , the whole point of the scoring things in the context of the Explanatory Continuum ( from my above quote ) .
It ’s the whole point behind using the Face as a metaphor .
This is an important point because I was under the impression that Shostak would conclude the existence of ETI because of the discovery of “ a persistent , narrow - band whistle . ”
Yet in reality , most scientists would likely consider this discovery as mere evidence that suggests ETI exists and would want something more solid , thus calling for a closer look .
In other words , we now exist at a stage where the existence of ETI is possible or weakly plausible .
The discovery of a persistent , narrow - band whistle would make the existence of ETI solidly plausible , perhaps weakly probable .
But something more would be needed to make it highly probable .
So how do we get there ?
Novella suggests we simply repeat the process of coupling discontinuity and analogy at a higher resolution , where “ Carl Sagan ’s idea that something like a series of prime numbers would be a possible intelligent tag ” vastly enhances the strength of the analogy .
Novella also notes that the positive markers are limited to analogies with the only known intelligent agents – us :
We are using , here , ourselves as the only known ( to us ) model of technological intelligence . [… ]
SETI , therefore , combines two criteria in its search for intelligence .
The first is negative – finding an anomaly that cannot be explained by known natural processes .
The second , however , is positive – finding that the signal has markers of technological intelligence , as best as we can infer from our solitary self - example .
Again , this is essentially the same approach I take :
To more effectively infer design , in an empirical , investigative sense , we will restrain our hypothesis to invoking a human - like intelligence .
If the intelligent cause is completely unlike human intelligence , how would an investigation recognize the signposts of its intervention ?
If the intelligence is completely unlike us , it would not think or design as we do .
As long as the hypothesized agency is human - like , we can more safely extrapolate from our own experience with our own intelligence and design .
And such extrapolations make it possible to formulate testable hypotheses .
Thus , we can see that the core approach that SETI uses to detect an artifact is essentially the same process that I advocate in The Design Matrix .
There are some differences at the edges , as I shall explain later , but that I independently converged on the same investigative logic / approach allows this author to enjoy a subjective sense of validation . 🙂
Let me conclude with the following comment from Novella :
Also – we can take Seth ’s statement of the difference between complex and artificial and apply it to biology ( as Seth briefly does himself in his article ) .
From what we know so far it seems that inefficiency is a general marker of natural systems , and “ narrow band ” type efficiency is a marker of deliberate artifice .
The information in DNA is not efficient .
It ’s a mess .
It ’s exactly what we would expect from a naturally self - organizing system .
It does not reflect the elegant simplicity or efficiency of artifice .
I am not proposing this line of evidence as strong evidence for evolution by itself .
But for what it ’s worth – this one goes in the evolution column , not the ID column .
I would agree with Novella ’s assessment and I also like how he formulates it .
By putting arguments / facts in “ columns , ” he has come close to scoring things as I advocate ( he ’s actually drawing on the Criterion of Rationality ) .
But any honest investigation should be open - ended , such that the same argument could be used to place things in the “ ID column . ”
As such , I would simply note that the Genetic Code ( which is different from DNA ) is clearly not “ a mess . ”
On the contrary , the Code is exceptionally well designed according to several different parameters .
If one can make this case ( and I can ) , an intellectually honest approach would admit we have a positive marker for life ’s design – something to put in the design column .
An anonymous reader sends us to GM - volt.com , an electric vehicle enthusiast blog , for the news that last week EEStor was granted a US patent for their electric - energy storage unit , of which no one outside the company ( no one who is talking , anyway ) has seen so much as a working prototype .
We 've discussed the company on a number of occasions .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
" What Do Women Want ? , " an article about new research into female arousal , published in the NYT magazine , has been the most read story for five straight days , lit up the blogosphere and sparked a lightning storm of comments at the NYT and in blogs .
Many sites have had to close their comments early , unable to keep up .
Obama 's inauguration and the deepening financial crisis have been pushed aside
The very long story , long blog posts , and longer list of letters are all deeply complex , confusing , contradictory , fraught , fascinating and overwhelming .
Kind of like the overarching metaphor in the piece , first articulated by Meredith Chivers , a 36 - year - old psychology professor at Queens University , and one of the scientists whose work is profiled : " I feel like a pioneer at the edge of a giant forest . "
I 'm thrilled people are trying to understand the ladyboner ( blogger slang for female arousal that you wo n't find in the Times piece ) ; amazed by the dedication of the scientists and the intelligent and nuanced approach of the writer ; and delighted that the attempt to shed some light on what makes women 's privates work has moved past the suggestion that we get out our lipstick mirrors and take a look " down there . "
Who would n't be ?
Women : nature 's Rubik 's Cube ?
The body of information ( sorry ) about men's arousal is disproportionately swollen ( sorry , again ) because most scientists have been male , and most of the cultural focus has been on how to arouse men .
And only recently , with a sudden " critical mass " of female scientists , and articles like this , has there been a serious attempt to address the " problem " Freud posed over a century ago : " The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer , despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul , is , What does a woman want ? "
But the metaphor of darkness , which permeates the well - researched article , many of the blog posts , and most of the comments , is itself , frankly , what 's well - intentioned but sexist .
The article reports that most research into sex used to take the premise that men and women were extremely similar ; whereas , now research on differences are what gets funded .
Fine .
But the current research , or at least the way this article presents it , seems to consider men's arousal to be simple , clear and straightforward , and women's as opposite , unusual , other , " a problem , " worrying and abnormal .
Bonobo sex , yes or no ?
There are some fascinating findings but , as I 'll get back to in a minute , they all contain some hand wringing .
First , some findings about flexosexuality ( my term ) or heteroflexibility ( Slate 's term ) .
Meredith Chivers hooked up a plethysmograph ( an apparatus that fits over the penis or in the vagina and measures blood flow ) , and gave subjects a keypad to indicate arousal , then showed men and women , both straight and gay , short clips of bonobo monkeys having sex , of human heterosexual sex , male and female homosexual sex , a man masturbating , a woman masturbating , a chiseled man walking naked on a beach and a well - toned woman doing calisthenics in the nude .
The men responded the same way genitally and through the keypad .
The heterosexual men were aroused by heterosexual or lesbian sex , by the masturbating and exercising women , and were unmoved by the other clips .
The gay males were aroused in " the opposite categorical pattern . "
But " all was different with the women .
No matter what their self - proclaimed sexual orientation , they showed , on the whole , strong and swift genital arousal when the screen offered men with men , women with women and women with men ... with the women , especially the straight women , mind and genitals seemed scarcely to belong to the same person .
The readings from the plethysmograph and the keypad were n't in much accord .
During shots of lesbian coupling , heterosexual women reported less excitement than their vaginas indicated ; watching gay men , they reported a great deal less ; and viewing heterosexual intercourse , they reported much more .
Among the lesbian volunteers , the two readings converged when women appeared on the screen .
But when the films featured only men , the lesbians reported less engagement than the plethysmograph recorded .
Whether straight or gay , the women claimed almost no arousal whatsoever while staring at the bonobos . "
Interesting , but oh so confusing and worrying !
Science says men do think with it ...
There 's more .
Men 's narrower arousal is n't just due to inhibition , apparently .
Chivers ' colleague , Michael Bailey , a sexologist at Northwestern University , " took MRI scans of gay and straight men as they were shown pornographic pictures featuring men alone , women alone , men having sex with men and women with women .
In straights , brain regions associated with inhibition were not triggered by images of men ; in gays , such regions were n't activated by pictures of women .
Inhibition , in Bailey 's experiment , did n't appear to be an explanation for men's narrowly focused desires . "
And another piece : after the arrival of Viagra in the late '90s , drug companies wanted to find an equivalent drug for women .
So they funded research to investigate physiological arousal .
In short , researchers found female physiological arousal is pretty straightforward , but is totally separate from cognitive arousal , or lust .
" In men who have trouble getting erect , the genital engorgement aided by Viagra and its rivals is often all that 's needed .
The pills target genital capillaries ; they do n't aim at the mind ...
In women , though , the main difficulty appears to be in the mind , not the body , so the physiological effects of the drugs have proved irrelevant .
The pills can promote blood flow and lubrication , but this does n't do much to create a conscious sense of desire . "
... but women do n't
The separation of physiological and conscious arousal has also been a finding in rape studies .
Chivers argues that genital lubrication is necessary " to reduce discomfort , and the possibility of injury , during vaginal penetration ...
Ancestral women who did not show an automatic vaginal response to sexual cues may have been more likely to experience injuries during unwanted vaginal penetration that resulted in illness , infertility or even death , and thus would be less likely to have passed on this trait to their offspring . "
( On this topic , later on in the piece , scientist Marta Meara adds , " Arousal is not consent . "
A statement which has proved of particular interest to dozens of commenters and bloggers . )
Next , the article talks about Chivers ' findings that " women 's system of desire , the cognitive domain of lust , is more receptive than aggressive .
" One of the things I think about , " she said , " is the dyad formed by men and women .
Certainly women are very sexual and have the capacity to be even more sexual than men , but one possibility is that instead of it being a go - out - there - and - get - it kind of sexuality , it 's more of a reactive process . ' "
( Which got at least one blogger saying that she knows plenty of women who like to go out and pick up men , not just wait for an invitation ) .
' Being desired is the orgasm '
Which in some ways is similar to Marta Meana 's findings .
In the article , Meana , a professor of psychology at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas said , " I consider myself a feminist .
But political correctness is n't sexy at all , " before declaring that for women , " Being desired is the orgasm . "
" ' Really , women 's desire is not relational , it 's narcissistic ' -- it is dominated by the yearnings of ' self - love , ' by the wish to be the object of erotic admiration and sexual need .
Still on the subject of narcissism , she talked about research indicating that , in comparison with men , women 's erotic fantasies center less on giving pleasure and more on getting it .
' When it comes to desire , ' she added , ' women may be far less relational than men . ' "
Like Chivers , Meana thinks of female sexuality as divided into two systems .
But Meana sees those systems in a different way from her colleague .
On the one hand , as Meana constructs things , there is the drive of sheer lust , and on the other the " impetus of value . "
Another scientist , Lisa Diamond , an associate professor of psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah , finds that above all , female desire is dictated by intimacy and emotional connection , and is malleable .
In writing a book , she studied 100 women for 10 years who self - identify as lesbian , bisexual or refuse a label , many of whom change in their orientations .
A famous example is Anne Heche , who had " a widely publicized romantic relationship with the openly lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres after having had no prior same - sex attractions or relationships .
The relationship with DeGeneres ended after two years , and Heche went on to marry a man . "
Diamond argues that women 's desire can't be captured by asking women to categorize their attractions at any single point , that to do so is to apply a male paradigm of more fixed sexual orientation .
( This assertion drew some blogger ire about the constant stereotyping of male gayness as real , but lesbian orientation as a kind of undergraduate , whimsical interest . )
Diamond 's premise of emotionally based arousal is one that Meana rejects .
Her research has found many women who report loving a partner very much , but not having any arousal for them .
' Core of sexual desire is deeply un - PC '
In short , the article reports that the core of sexual desire is deeply un - PC .
Straight , bi and lesbian women are aroused by women and men ; whereas , straight men are only aroused by women and gay men are only aroused by men .
Many women get aroused during rape , but " arousal is not consent . "
There 's a difference between physiological and cognitive arousal .
Women 's arousal might be based on receptivity , emotion or on narcissism .
Or it might be none of the above .
Got it ?
A producer once told me that every good story is a mystery story .
Complexity and contradiction are good things ; they 're what make us human , they 're what keep us interested .
In fact , until I read this article , I 'd always believed men's arousal was complex and mysterious , too .
I 've read articles claiming that women 's historical preoccupation with fashion is actually based on satisfying the male genetic appetite for variety and promiscuity : that on some level , different outfits and hairstyles work to give men the sense of being with more than one partner .
Or that by watching strippers or porn , men are more able to stay faithful in a monogamous relationship because it satisfies their genetic programming to seek as many partners as possible .
True ?
No idea .
Also , have n't we all read countless articles about homo - eroticism in male sporting culture -- tight uniforms , skin - on - skin , sweat , bum pats ?
I 'm not saying any of this is true , but it 's entertaining to contemplate the possibilities , is n't it ?
And do n't possibilities like this do more justice to men than suggesting they either like men or women ?
So , by all means let 's investigate , research and probe ( intellectually ) , but worry less when the results are complex or seemingly contradictory .
How about we suspend our desire for total clarity , in favor of paying more attention to and enjoying women's ( and men's ) sexually omnivorous and often mysterious desires ?

INAUGURAL PARADE INAUGURAL PARADE PLANNING :
For director , Inaugural Parade a ' staggering task '

WASHINGTON  At 9 , Amy Carter warmed hearts as she walked down Pennsylvania Avenue with her parents .
At 12 , Chelsea Clinton won cheers from revelers at an Inaugural Ball .
Presidential children are magnets for attention on Inauguration Days , as Americans get to know a new first family or chart the changes in youngsters from term one to term two .
TELL US : What does the inauguration mean to you ?
New heights of cuteness are likely Tuesday with Barack Obama 's two daughters , Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , in the inaugural spotlight .
Will their outfits set trends for the tween set ?
Will they eat peanut butter sandwiches or fancy food ?
Will they dance with Daddy at an Inaugural Ball ?
Will they look back on the experience as fun ?
For presidential families , inaugurations are joyous occasions usually undisturbed by controversy or criticism .
They 're also complicated .
For kids , the pressure is on to look adorable or ( if they 're older ) at least presentable , behave well and generally advance the image of the picture - perfect first family .
Yet so much can go so wrong .
Young children operating on minimal sleep can get sick or cranky .
Grown children might drink too much or argue over who sleeps in the Lincoln Bedroom .
Robert Lincoln , 18 , lost a satchel containing the only copy of his father 's inaugural address during their journey to the capital in 1861 ( it was eventually found in a hotel baggage room ) .
" There 's always a lot of stress , " says Doug Wead , author of All The Presidents ' Children .
At the same time , he says , the visiting relatives and friends cramming the White House make it " really fun .
It 's like a 24/7 Christmas thing .
It 's ongoing .
It never ends . "
Lynda Johnson Robb was 20 when her father , Lyndon , was inaugurated in 1965 .
She describes a blur of activities , crowds and logistical hassles getting from place to place .
" We were immensely proud and excited , but we were overwhelmed .
It was long hours , " she says .
" It was a very joyous , happy occasion , but a very rushed occasion .
You were just panting . "
Malia and Sasha Obama have sparked intense interest among Americans .
Their move to a new school was followed so closely that the Obama team released photos of them getting ready for their first day .
Obama has called the issue of choosing a family dog " major " and said it generated " more interest on our website than just about anything . "
Their own schedule During the inauguration whirl , like many young children before them , the Obama girls will follow an abbreviated schedule .
Michelle Obama has tried to make the week " as fun and comfortable " as possible for her daughters , transition spokeswoman Katie McCormick Lelyveld says .
That means arranging kid-friendly activities such as the free children 's concert Monday night at the Verizon Center , complete with Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers .
It also means letting the girls off the hook for ceremonial duties and making time for them to hang out with their cousins and friends .
Tonight 's Inaugural Balls start around the time the girls usually go to bed .
" If they make an appearance , it will be short , " Lelyveld says .
Chelsea Clinton , in a simple black dress with a sweetheart neckline , her hair piled on her head , attended the MTV Inaugural Ball in 1993 .
Chants of " Chelsea ! Chelsea ! Chelsea ! " erupted when she joined her parents on the stage .
The 12 - year - old spent some time at the MTV bash after her parents left for 11 more balls , but not much .
By 9 p.m. she was back at the White House for a small gathering of Little Rock friends and children of incoming administration officials , says former chief usher Gary Walters , whose job was to run the White House household staff and operations .
Walters says Hillary Rodham Clinton had asked for a party that would help Chelsea and her friends get to know the White House .
The result was a " history scavenger hunt . "
The kids were divided into groups and sent to search for a yellow bird in a painting , an apple in a small kitchen and the like .
Then they retired to the State Dining Room , complete with Corinthian columns and Lincoln portrait , for a pizza buffet .
Chelsea Clinton declined to be interviewed about her inauguration experiences , as did Amy Carter and the Bush twins , Barbara and Jenna .
Walters observed presidential children at close range for decades .
He says they often enjoy watching the Inauguration Parade .
The reviewing stand in front of the White House is heated and stocked with hot chocolate , Fruit Roll - ups and other snacks .
However , the parade did n't prove compelling to the 7 - year - old Bush twins when their grandfather , George H.W. Bush , was inaugurated in 1989 .
Walters says their mother , Laura , brought them inside the White House at about 3 p.m. — right in the middle of the frantic changeover from one first family to another .
" The idea is that when a new president moves in after the Inaugural Parade , he moves into his own home .
All the clothes are hanging , the boxes are put away .
There 's an awful lot of activity between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. , " Walters says .
About 90 people were moving furniture all over the White House when the Bush twins arrived .
" I did n't want them in the middle of that , " Walters says .
" I sent them with the chief florist down to a floral shop .
I asked the florist to help them learn how to put some flowers together . "
Walters says he counseled the White House staff to be prepared Tuesday in case Malia and Sasha get cold or bored .
" On that day and in those circumstances , you have to be pretty creative , " he says .
" You never know what 's coming your way . "
There was , for instance , the blankie emergency .
Jack Carter , 61 , was 29 when his father took the oath of office in 1977 .
He recalls a potential crisis when it turned out his son Jason , then 18 months , had lost his baby blanket somewhere between the Capitol swearing - in ceremony and a post - parade reception at the White House .
" I thought this was really going to be rough , " he says , but the White House staff " got him another blankie , and he acted like it was his own . "
Carter says Jason fell asleep on a bench under a portrait of John Kennedy .
Crisis averted .
Walters says it was no accident that the White House had baby blankets on hand .
One of Jimmy Carter 's daughters - in - law was due to have a baby in February , and the staff had stocked up on everything that might be needed if she delivered early .
Family duties and celebration
In earlier times , inaugurations sometimes were shadowed by the deaths of children .
Benjamin Pierce , 11 , was killed in a train crash a few weeks before his father , Franklin , took the oath in 1853 .
He was the third of the Pierces ' three children to die ; his parents were desolate , his mother convinced the deaths were God 's punishment for Franklin 's political ambitions .
Anna Harrison refused to attend her husband William 's 1841 inauguration .
She had lost three adult sons in the previous three years and was in mourning .
Back when women bore so many children they often were sickly in later years , presidential daughters sometimes filled in as inaugural planners and hostesses .
Adult sons and daughters also have been sources of emotional support over the years .
In 1945 , newly sworn in for his fourth term as president , Franklin Roosevelt confided to his eldest son , James , that he was chilled and in pain but would not skip a White House buffet lunch for 1,000 people .
" The people elected me their leader , and I can't quit in the middle of a war , " he told James , according to Paul Boller 's account in Presidential Inaugurations .
He then asked his son to fetch a bottle of bourbon he kept in his room , saying that would enable him to get through the event .
James poured half a tumbler , which his father " drank as if it were medicine , " Boller writes .
A few weeks later , FDR died of a cerebral hemorrhage .
Wead writes that Inauguration Day 1969 was a chance for one child to help another .
Waiting for Richard Nixon to be sworn in , Luci Baines Johnson told Julie Nixon that she and her sister Lynda had become much closer in the past year with their husbands both serving in Vietnam .
" Do n't let all the attention drive a wedge between you and Tricia , " she advised Julie .
For most presidential children in their teens and older , inauguration week is a mix of family duties and giddy celebration .
Robb recalls campaigning for her father on weekends in 1964 and " doing our part supporting our parents " at the inauguration .
Her escort was a White House aide she was dating at the time .
She wore " a beautiful white dress with a long coat " for the ceremony and went to all the Inaugural Balls with her date .
" You do n't get to do a lot of dancing , " she says .
" We would get to a place .
The room would be very , very crowded .
You would all go and stand on a platform .
Everybody could see you and wave .
Then we would get down on the dance floor just cheek to jowl , twirl around a few times , get into a car and rush to another one . "
The Bush twins were 23 for their father 's second inauguration in 2005 , and considered fair game by reporters .
Late - night comedians , harking back a few years to the pair 's widely reported underage drinking , made jokes about lost memories and designated drivers .
The Associated Press distributed a photo of Jenna yawning after her father 's address .
The media also put the twins ' wardrobe choices under the microscope , right along with their mother's .
Washington
Post fashion writer Robin Givhan praised their ball gowns and said Jenna 's trousers were " a thunderclap of modernity " at the swearing - in .
Wead says inaugurations often are emotional peaks for the children of presidents , before the realities of governing and public opinion set in .
" The real suffering for these kids is the treatment of their fathers , " he says .
Even when they disagree with their fathers ' policies , as did children of Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan , Wead says , the rough and tumble still hurts .
" The media give them the inauguration .
There 's no criticism there , " Wead says .
" It 's the one moment where their daddy is loved by everybody .
And it never happens again . "
Jack Carter remembers an exhilarating walk down Pennsylvania Avenue after his father was sworn in .
With Jason on his shoulders , he took in the crowds , the mood and the architecture .
" It was very much like going through Rome , " he says .
He ended the day with visits to several Inaugural Balls .
" It was a blast , " Jack says .
" I had been on the road for a year and a half campaigning for dad , since late spring of 1975 .
And this is what we wanted .
We were there , we knew a lot of the people , it was a big party , and they were celebrating our family . "

Breast - Feeding Past Infancy : ' I'm Comforting Him '
One mother speaks out , saying she 's doing what 's best for her family .
Jan. 2 , 2009  -- Robyn Paul , her husband and their three children look like the classic American family -- until you find out that Tiernan , their kindergartner , is still breast - feeding .
Many people are shocked by the idea of nursing a child who is nearly 6 years old , but Paul remains determined to do what she says is best for her child .
" In this culture , breasts are viewed as sexual , " Paul said .
" We use breasts to sell everything from beer to motorcycles , then a toddler is in mom 's arms nursing for what they 're supposed to be used for and everybody freaks out . "
No one is sure how many women in the United States are breast - feeding older children , but Paul said she suspects the number is higher than you might think .
Most wo n't admit it , she said , because of the stigma .
" There are those women that do nurse that keep it under wraps because they 're afraid of what others are going to say about it , " she said .
Paul said she usually breast - feeds Tiernan at home when he needs comforting .
" They 're running around and playing , " she said .
" Once they get beyond 3 years old they 're not nursing but a couple of times a day . "
Although some might consider a pacifier a more socially acceptable way to comfort their child , Paul said she would prefer that her child receive comfort at her breast .
When Tiernan needs comforting , he will ask his mother for " nummies , " his word for breast - feeding , Paul said .
" We 've had conversations about what it tastes like and he says it 's very sweet , " like vanilla ice cream , Paul said .
She is happy with the choice she made , she said , but she would never force it on somebody else .
" All I 'm trying to do is let people know that it does happen , that it is perfectly normal , " she said .
How Old Is Too Old ?
She has a point .
The average age of weaning around the world is 4 years old and there are no studies saying it is harmful .
But child psychologist Will Braun said he is n't so sure and he wonders whether it 's appropriate from a developmental standpoint .
" I think a child really needs to learn to develop the capacity to soothe oneself , the capacity to tolerate frustration , " he said .
" When a child is constantly given a breast , it might thwart that from happening . "
' Extra Bonding '
Paul said her decision to continue breast - feeding is in her children 's best interest .
" I 've never done it for my own reasons .
Yes , there are some wonderful benefits for moms , but I consider them bonuses , " she said .
" I 've never done it for myself , unless you consider having a wonderful relationship with my kids , you know , as being something selfish to do for myself .
...
But I do n't think that is .
It 's always been for them . "
Paul 's older children -- Morgan , 12 , and Siobhan , 9 -- were each breast - fed until age 6 , and they appear to be well - adjusted and happy .
They 're good students , have plenty of friends and were eager to reminisce about the " good old " days of breast - feeding .
Morgan remembers saying , " Can I pleeeease … " and her mom saying , " OK . Fine . "
Paul said she 's heard other parents complain about how distant their children are , especially the boys .
" They come home from school and you ask how their day was and all you get is a ' fine ' as they walk back to their room and slam the door shut .
...
They can't talk to them about anything , " she said .
But she said her children are different .
" They 're very loving , very close children .
I can still talk to my older son and have long , lengthy conversations cuddled up on the couch with him .
He will on his own accord , if we 're watching a movie , come and sit down next to me and rest his head on my shoulder , put his arm over my shoulder , come talk to me about whatever 's bothering him at school , " she said .
" I really feel that there is an extra bonding or attachment there that I would like to think that because he nursed until he was 6 , that there was some more closeness there ... that you get when you 're able to have him in your arms for a longer period of time , " she said .
" My daughter 's the same way .
Very much so . "
When Siobhan sees Tiernan with their mother , she said , she wishes she could still do it sometimes .
" But I 'm getting older and I 'm just happy to see them doing it , " she said .
But it 's not just Paul 's older children who say it is all right that Tiernan still breast - feeds .
Her husband said it 's no problem , too .
Sexual ?
Developmental ?
' I Compartmentalize It '
Paul said she is able to distinguish between being her children 's comfort object and being a sexual partner for her husband .
" I compartmentalize it , " she said .
" When I 'm with my children and they need to nurse , then I 'm mom .
When I 'm in the bedroom with my husband , I 'm his wife and we have our intimate time .
It 's very much , they 're two totally separate things . "
' There 's Nothing Wrong With This '
Though their children seem happy now , some may ask late breast - feeding moms whether they 're doing what nature intended or taking a good thing too far .
With no long - term studies , the jury 's still out .
" Who would n't want to stay with mother 's love , mother 's nourishment , for their entire life ? "
Braun said .
" It 's a very seductive pull .
But I think a mother 's main job is to work herself out of a job . "
Despite getting some negative feedback from people who disapprove of her choice to continue breast - feeding , Paul said she is not going to stop .
She said she believes she is giving her son the best start she can in life .
" I 'm comforting him , and when he 's ready he 'll quit , " she said .
Paul said she hopes that more women will choose to breast - feed their children past infancy .
" This is a wonderful way to parent and nurture our children and give them the start that they deserve in life , " she said .
" You know , in other places in the world this is perfectly normal .
There 's nothing wrong with this and there is n't anything wrong with it .
We just are n't used to seeing it in this country . "
Good news , everyone !
In an admittedly algorithmic - driven survey of positive and negative stories about the company , their handling of the Phelps issue did the brand some damage :
Out of the 5,600 company reputations Vanno monitors , Kellogg ranked ninth before it booted Phelps .
Now it 's ranked 83 .
Not even an industry - wide peanut scare inflicted as much damage on the food company 's reputation .
The peanut scare was much less toxic for them .

Like all hockey fans , we here at Gunaxin are excited about the Winter Classic , to be played today between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings .
We wanted to do something special to mark the occasion , but just a preview of the game did n’t seem to be our style .
So we thought instead , why do n’t we take a look at the Ice Girls from the two teams competing .
Well much to our disappointment , the Red Wings do n’t have an Ice Girls squad to speak of .
We found mention of something called the Red Patrol , but alas no photos could be acquired , and I do n’t think they are really the same as Ice Girls .
The Chicago Blackhawks on the other hand have one of the sexiest squads in the NHL , and they more then made up for Detroit ’s lameness .
So I think you know who we will be rooting for in today ’s featured contest .
Below you will find 80 photos ( 4 Pages ) and several videos of the Blackhawks Ice Crew .
Enjoy and Go Hawks !

Everyone agrees reading is good for kids .
But a federal law taking effect next month appears to deem children ’s books a potential health hazard and may force libraries and bookstores to clear out entire children ’s collections until they ’re proved free of toxic lead and plastic .
That little - known consequence of a law passed to protect kids from tainted toys has librarians and publishers lobbying furiously for an exemption before it takes effect Feb. 10 .
Without a reprieve , San Jose library officials say they could be forced to close their children ’s sections and send off all 700,000 volumes in them for safety testing .
“ It ’s truly a case of unforeseen consequences , ” said Assistant Library Director Ned Himmel .
“ It seems so unbelievable that we ’d have to close off children ’s rooms .
We consider our libraries a healthy place and good for children . ”
Congress passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in August to protect kids from exposure to lead and plastic .
The law followed the discovery of lead paint in imported toy trains and mounting health concerns about baby bottles and toys containing phthalates , used to make some plastics more flexible .
Lawyers for the Consumer Product Safety Commission told publishers in a recent opinion that the law covers children ’s books as well as toys and applies retroactively to include library collections .
All books aimed at kids under 12 , the commission said , need to be tested to ensure they do n’t exceed the new lead and phthalate limits .
Although publishers presented the commission with evidence they say proves books do n’t pose any of the health risks to children that the law intended to address , the agency has yet to be convinced .
The commission is n’t just looking at the paper , ink , binding and cover material .
Many children ’s books , like the Dorothy Kunhardt touch - and - feel classic “ Pat the Bunny , ” have pages with plastic , cloth or other material to excite young minds .
Commission spokesman Scott Wolfson says the agency is n’t telling libraries and bookstores to clear their shelves .
But he said it may not have a decision on exempting books by Feb. 10 and has yet to decide what libraries and bookstores should do in the meantime .
“ We ’re looking at options , ” Wolfson said .
The commission has not addressed whether parents should yank books from their own homes .
The law requires manufacturers and importers to have their products tested to ensure they meet the new safety requirements , Wolfson said .
Retailers and resellers do n’t need to test the products as long as their suppliers indicate they are meeting the requirements .
Bookshop Santa Cruz owner Casey Coonerty Protti said she already does that , so she does n’t anticipate any changes at her Pacific Avenue store because of the new law .
Kristin Murphy , government relations specialist with the American Library Association , said in a message Thursday night to Himmel that she was “ hopeful ” the commission will exempt libraries , and she advised librarians to sit tight for now .
The library association says it consulted with the new law ’s sponsors in Congress and were told books were never intended to be covered .
But Murphy warned that without an exemption from the product safety commission , public and school libraries would be forced “ to take drastic steps to come into compliance . ”
“ They would either have to ban children from their libraries or pull every book intended for children under the age of 12 from their bookshelves , ” Murphy wrote .
At San Jose ’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library , parents gathered Friday in the children ’s section for the weekly Toddler Story Time event were dumbfounded by that possibility , and they dismissed any notion that books pose a health hazard .
“ It ’s really ridiculous , ” said Meryll Quizon , as her 2 - year - old son Alessandro leafed through pictures of frogs in a National Geographic kids ’ magazine .
“ They proved once that toys from China are toxic , but for books , I have n’t seen any evidence . ”
Julie Borbon , 33 , another library regular whose 2 - year - old daughter Julianna loves Lucy Cousins ’
Maisy mouse books , said the children ’s section is a blessing .
Closing it , she said , “ would be the worst thing that they could do . ”

A flock of canada geese brought down US Airways flight 1549 ( Image : Mike Baird - http://flickr.com/photos/mikebaird/2336548126/)
The Wright Brothers were inspired to take to the air by the sight of turkey vultures circling over the Ohio River .
Unfortunately , the history of birds and aircraft has n’t always been so productive .
Yesterday ’s ( thankfully nonfatal ) splashdown of a jet in the Hudson River has thrown the threat that birds pose to modern aircraft into sharp relief .
Since 1988 , 219 people have died worldwide in air crashes caused by birds choking jet engines , according to the Bird Strike Committee , an advocacy group trying to alleviate the problem .
In 2001 , a UK study estimated that birds cost aviation $ 1.3 billion globally by damaging and delaying planes .

The toughened turbine blades in a jet engine are immensely strong , but there ’s little they can do when confronted with a flock of fat Canada geese , each weighing up to 6kg .
Do n’t explode
International Civil Aviation Organisation regulations say that jet engines must be able to ingest a small bird without problems .
But for large birds , the rules say only that the engine must not explode .
So why not stop our feathered friends getting into the turbines at all , perhaps by fixing a grille over the engine ’s air intake ?
John Downer , an expert in risk management at the London School of Economics , researched anti-birdstrike safety measures for his 2007 paper When the Chick Hits the Fan .
He says anti-avian grilles have been considered but ruled out .
‘ Not practical ’
Birds hit engines so fast that any sufficiently sturdy grille would be very heavy , Downer told me .
“ There would also be fuel inefficiency as the heavy grille would occlude airflow into the engine , ” Downer says .
“ So the idea gets dismissed quickly because it is not practical from an engineering point of view . ”
So the only answer appears to be continued vigilance on the part of air traffic managers , who can use cannons and recordings of predators ’ songs to scare birds off , or direct planes to avoid migratory routes and delaying flights .
But it ’s probably going to get more difficult to predict when bird strikes are likely as climate change alters behavioural and migratory patterns ( PDF ) .
New tools may make the job easier .
For example , improved radar or “ audio telescopes ” could make it easier to spot dangerous situations .
But despite these advances , it seems likely that bird strikes are with us to stay .
Interestingly , the Smithsonian Institution ’s Feather Identification Laboratory has worked out which species causes the most costly birdstrike damage .
It ’s the turkey vulture – the bird that originally inspired the Wright brothers .
Americans hail Obama but China says racial divisions remain
China has responded in detail to a US report published this week criticising China for alleged rights abuses .
Beijing released its own report on the US , saying crime is a threat to many Americans and racial discrimination prevails in social life across the US .
When US officials first published their report on China , Beijing told them to mind their own business .
The BBC's James Reynolds , in Beijing , says the reports are a standard yearly exchange with little practical impact .
The 9,000 - word Chinese report depicts a bleak picture of the US , saying violent crime is a widespread threat to people 's lives , property and personal security .
The American people 's economic , social and cultural rights are not properly protected , say the Chinese , and many young Americans " have personality disorders " .
" The US practice of throwing stones at others while living in a glass house is testimony to the double standards and hypocrisy of the United States in dealing with human rights issues , " says the report .
Beijing 's report came after the US state department concluded in its annual report on rights around the world that China 's human - rights record worsened in some areas in 2008 .
The US report accused China of harassing dissidents and increasing its repression of ethnic minorities .
Last weekend , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held talks in Beijing with China 's leaders and , in public , the issue of human rights was barely mentioned .
A group of devoted Shenmue fans , incensed that Sega has apparently nixed all plans to conclude the originally planned epic trilogy of games , intend to inundate Sega 's offices with thousands of tiny toy capsules in protest .
The Shenmue MySpace Campaign outlines the details of the event and invites any fans of the Dreamcast classic to join ther struggle .
From November 27 through 29 , the group will be shipping packages of the capsules – which were a precious commodity in the Shenmue game world – to Sega of Japan and series creator Yu Suzuki in the hopes that the firm will reconsider its plans to leave the series abandoned .
Though it may seem like a crazy idea the scheme echoes a similar mailbombing event initiated by fans of the television series Jericho that actually succeeded .
After sending literal tons of peanuts to the show 's creators , the series was put back on the air .
Any Shenmue fans wishing to join the effort need only read the MySpace Events page linked above .
All the details are there , though be warned :
The effort will set you back $ 20 to $ 30 .

When Professor and media researcher Roger Wallis left the stand yesterday , the court asked whether he wanted to be reimbursed for his appearance .
“ You are welcome to send some flowers to my wife , ” he responded .
In the hours that followed , many Pirate Bay supporters took this suggestion to hand .
Professor and media researcher Roger Wallis appeared as an expert witness at the Pirate Bay trial yesterday .
He was questioned on the link between the decline of album sales and filesharing .
Wallis told the court that his research has shown that there is no relation between the two .
He was heavily attacked by industry lawyers Danowsky , Pontén and Wadsted who did everything they could to discredit and slander his reputation .
When Wallis was asked whether he wanted to be reimbursed for travel expenses etc , he light - heartedly suggested sending some flowers to his wife .
His statement was picked up by the large audience listening in to the live audio from the trial and flowers soon began arriving at the Wallis ’ house .
Mr. and Mrs. Wallis and their flowers .
Roger ’s wife , Görel Wallis , was n’t surprised by her husband ’s whim in court :
“ We have been married for 38 years .
He proposed half an hour after we met and I said maybe .
After a day , he had convinced me ” , she said .
At a local flower store in Stockholm they had received 100 orders by 20.30 last night .
Owner Kristian Skald said that two nearby stores had received an equal amount of orders .
“ Last delivery was 33 bouquets Thursday night .
There will be more to come on Friday , ” the owner of the flower shop commented .
Today , Friday , the couple celebrates their wedding day anniversary and on Saturday it ’s Görel ’s birthday .
Roger Wallis feels she is worth all the flowers she gets .
“ She was very worried before the trial .
They questioned my competence and that made her very sad .
She had n’t slept for two days , ” Roger said .
A web page has been set up that collects what has been given so far , complete with an ever - growing stack of CDs that show how many sales the music - industry has lost by slandering the Professor .
Thus far , in an amazing show of generosity from a section of society labeled by the music industry as ‘ thieves ’ , more than 4100 Euros worth of flowers , chocolate and gifts have been sent to the couple .
The Wallis ’ soon ran out of vases for the flowers but Görel knows that sharing is caring and will distribute the flowers to all residents in their apartment building .
“ We will make sure it will be beautiful here . ”
PROTECTING AMERICAN JOBS IS A BAD THING
By : Devvy
January 8 , 2009
ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
" Tell them ( the South Carolinians who wanted to nullify the Tariff Act of 1832 ) that I will hang the first man of them I can get my hands on to the first tree I can find . "
-- President Andy Jackson
Did you know protecting American jobs is a bad thing for the banking cartels ?
So says one anti-American globalist :
" The $ 17bn bail - out of General Motors and Chrysler last month was already a step across the Rubicon towards a protectionist industrial policy , even if that was not the motive .
The EU is exploring a World Trade Organisation complaint over " illegal state aid . "
But the latest Buy American move is much more explicit .
" This is quite dangerous , " said Peter Sutherland , chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former director - general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) .
" The US is the key to keeping a one - world trading system , but there is always the tendency to go for protectionism in a recession , and this is the worst one I 've ever seen . "
So , Americans must continue pushing paper for foreign companies and commie countries and buying their junk while our key industries that made this country the richest , most self - reliant and independent in the world , continue to go under - to protect a one world trading system ?
Agriculture , manufacturing and industrial -- all crippled and dying a slow death because of destructive trade treaties signed by Billy Clinton ( NAFTA & GATT ) and George Bush , Jr. ( CAFTA ) to keep a " one world trading system " operating .
George Bush , Sr. , spearheaded the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico ; Billy was selected to continue the destruction .
Obama is to cement the final stakes through the heart of this republic .
Goldman Sachs and Hank Paulson -
In bed with your money : " Goldman Sachs cashed in under Paulson , with earnings in 2005 of $ 5.6 billion ; Paulson made more than $ 38 million that year . "
These vile people are getting away with it because Americans continue voting the same crooks back to Congress who give people like Paulson unlimited power to rob you of all you 've worked for and your children 's future .
Let me remind Americans of some prophetic words :
In a December 6 , 1993 , Washington Times interview with the late billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith , he warned that " GATT will mean social upheaval and political instability bringing far worse global consequences than the Bolshevik Revolution ...
If the masses understood the truth about GATT , there would be blood in the streets of many capitals . "
Thomas Jefferson weighed in back in 1815 with , " He , therefore , who is now against domestic manufacture , must be for reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation , or be clothed in skins , and to live like beasts in dens and caverns .
I am not one of those . "
The day is coming when Americans will be reduced to rags and then the rage will spill over .
Since these toxic " free trade " treaties went into effect , the trade deficit has skyrocketed , but most Americans have no idea what that means .
They just continue voting back in the same unlawfully seated U.S. Senators who keep selling US out to foreign interests via trade treaties .
This map appeared in the Denver Post , August 30 , 1992 , a mere four months before NAFTA was unconstitutionally signed into law that has destroyed millions and millions of good paying jobs for Americans .
" Free trade " destroys boundaries and sovereignty .
That is the agenda in reducing America to third world status to enrich those who care about nothing but money and power .
Americans have become beasts of burden , wearing their yokes with resignation .
Congressional Record , Appendix , May 4 , 1955 , Page A3016 - A3018 , Congressman Lawrence Smith comments that there are people in our country today who would surrender our national sovereignty to a fictitious form of world government .
He then goes on to outline with uncanny accuracy back then , the disaster just over our horizon as the infrastructure for this totalitarian one world government is now in place .
Implementation only requires one more " act of terrorism . "
Goals of the Communist Party , Congressional Record , January 10 , 1963 : Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war .
Full page ad , NY Times , April 15 , 1994 :
1944 .
Bretton Woods : The IMF and the World Bank .
1945 .
San Francisco : The United Nations .
1994 , Marrakech : The World Trade Organization .
History knows where its going .
The final act of the Uruguay Round .... to the WTO , the third pillar of the New World Order , along with the UN and the IMF . "
Henry Kissinger , a tried and true traitor and Soviet agent recently said when asked the most important role Marxist Obama can play regarding the middle East : Obama can give a new impetus to American foreign policy .... his task is to step forward to create a new world .
You can watch this human excrement on video here .
The global elitists will continue unabated because virtually the same U.S. Senate left over from the last disastrous session of Congress , and who sit in office under a law that does not exist , have no intention of going up against their money masters .
However , as I have written for more than a decade : they cannot force you to spend your money on foreign products .
The more Made in America products we buy and services we use , the more competitive the industries become and we keep our people employed .
We keep the money in this country and we rebuild our constitutional republic .
Building print and electronic media for we the people
Anyone not in a self imposed coma fully understands that there is no " freedom of the press " because the dominant media in this country ( print , radio and the boob tube ) are corporate owned and those corporations no longer represent these united States of America .
They are " multi-national " corporations who care nothing for our people except as peasants who work to pay them huge profits .
That is changing for print and electronic media as the people 's determination to stop this tyrannical government grows .
We can forget TV ; it 's too expensive and is 100 % controlled by draconian government regulations , corporate sponsorship and owned by a handful of conglomerates .
The same corporations that have sold out the American worker and middle class in this country .
Why continue rewarding your enemy ?

As I outlined in my last column , I will have a one hour nightly radio show soon and thank you for all the emails expressing your support and spreading the word .
Talk radio is listener driven .
It is also profit driven and if advertisers see a continuing decline in ratings for any talk show host , those advertising dollars dry up .
The American consumer can not only make sure their dollars go to Made in America , we can also direct our spending to advertisers who carry pro-America talk show hosts .
Slowly , but surely , we will make our way to AM and FM stations via new technology for automobiles and continue to grow with your help .
My show debuts January 12 , 2009 , and can be heard Mon - Friday , 6:00 pm PST , 8:00 PM CST and 9:00 PM EST .

At the risk of repeating myself , we also have to have a real newspaper in every state of the Union that reaches a large portion of a state .
There are many very fine newspapers out there which serve local areas helping to spread the truth .
The big newspapers in this country who want global government are taking a beating because they have betrayed the trust of the American people .

Update on the Obama cover up .
Congress is to count the electoral college votes today .
The follow day ( January 9 , 2009 ) is the first conference for Phil Berg 's lawsuits by the U.S. Supreme Court ; the second date for the supremes is January 16 , 2009 .
After a frustrating wait , Dr. Orly Taitz has news :
January 7 , 2009
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts agreed to hear my case
Press Release from Dr. Orly Taitz , ESQ .
" Good news .
Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to hear my case Lightfoot v Bowen , challenging eligibility for presidency of Barack Hussein Obama .
He distributed the case to the full conference of the Supreme Court .
The timing of this decision by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , John Roberts , is absolutely remarkable .
On January 7 , one day before the January 8 vote by Congress and Senate , whether to approve or object to the electoral vote of Barack Hussein Obama , aka Barry Soetoro , as president of the United States , Chief Justice Roberts is sending a message to them :
" Hold on , not so fast , there is value in this case , read it .
Hawaiian statue 338 allows Foreign Born children of Hawaiian Residents to obtain Hawaiian Birth Certificates , it allows one to get Hawaiian Certification of Life birth based on a statement of one relative only , without any corroborating evidence .
You need to investigate , you need corroborating evidence .
" If only one Congressman or one Senator presents a written objection , then there has to be a formal investigation by the joint session of Congress and Senate .
During this investigation original birth certificate from Hawaii will be subpoenaed .
All other pertinent documents will be subpoenaed : Obama 's immigration records , any and all passports from Indonesia , Kenya and Great Britain ; University enrollment records , showing if he was enrolled in US schools and universities and received financial aid as a foreign exchange student from Indonesia or Kenya .
All of it can be subpoenaed and obtained within a day or two .
" Each and every member of US Congress and Senate owes it to 320 million American citizens to do his due diligence and demand all necessary records .
When American servicemen are told to risk their lives defending Constitution of this country against all enemies , foreign and domestic , each and every Congressman and each and every Senator can spend a day or two of their time defending this Constitution , reviewing necessary documents , in order to see if Barack Hussein Obama is a Natural Born Citizen , if he is a citizen at all . "
This is the message that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is sending to them , and if they are not listening , there has to be a massive petition drive to recall them .
Truth will come out , no matter how many millions Obama is spending to hide it . "
Lightfoot v Bowen is Distributed for Conference , January 23 , 2009 .
How many more " conferences " will the nine justices hold in private before they order oral arguments ?
How many more cases before they decide it 's time to judge these cases on merit ?
We have Donofrio ( Denied ) , Wrotnoski ( Denied ) , Berg on January 9 , 2009 , Berg on January 16 , 2009 , and now Orly 's case scheduled for January 23 , 2009 .
Both Phil and Orly have gone to extraordinary lengths , as well as so many others in their lawsuits and they can use some financial support .
These lawyers have had to give up other clients and case work that pays the bills to stay on these lawsuits .
I 'm sure they would appreciate a donation in what ever amount is comfortable for your situation .
Phil's web site is here .
Dr. Orly Taitz is here .
We the people DO have the destiny of America in our hands and we can put serious road blocks in the way of the destroyers by directing our consumer dollars to Made in America products and services .
Do n't talk to foreigners in India or the Philipines and give them your credit card information .
Call the company direct here in the U.S.
Force the issue by the millions and those companies will bring those jobs back home where they belong .
We have the absolute right to protect our job bases .
Free trade is not fair trade .
America first .
Millions have died so we could have our tomorrows as a free people .
Honor them and fight for our republic .

There are a number of reasons to think twice ( or three times , or four times , or fifty times ) before sending a nude photo of yourself to someone electronically .
But , if you 're under the age of 18 , there 's at least one big , glaring , serious reason : you and the recipient could be charged with trafficking child pornography .
If you think this sounds crazy , it is exactly what happened in Greensburg , Pennsylvania after two teenage girls send nude photos to some teenage boys .
Two girls from Greensburg , who police say are " 14 or 15 " years old , allegedly sent nude photos to two boys who are slightly older than them ( 16 or 17 ) using their cell phones .
The photos were discovered in October after one of the youngsters was caught using a cell phone during school hours — a violation of school rules — and had the phone taken away .
The photos were discovered at that time — I did n't know teachers could go snooping through your cell phone , either — and turned over to police .
" It was a self portrait taken of a juvenile female taking pictures of her body , nude , " Greensburg Police Department captain George Seranko told WPXI News .
" Taking nude pictures of yourself , nothing good can come out of it . "
This might seem like a one - off story , but last month , the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy released survey results that said 20 percent of all teens have sent a nude photo of themselves to someone else electronically .
More than two thirds of those who have sent photos claim they sent them to a boyfriend or girlfriend , but 15 percent say they have sent them to people they only " know " from the Internet .
And they 're not staying private , either — a quarter of teen girls and a third of teen boys said that they 've had nude images originally meant for someone else shared with them .
Though the discovery was made several months ago , the Greensburg Police Department apparently decided to arrest and charge the teenagers this week .
According to the police , the two girls are being charged with manufacturing , disseminating , or possessing child pornography , while the two boys are being charged with possession of child porn .
We 'll have to wait and see whether anything actually comes of this case — like cases involving underage sex and statutory rape , there 's a huge and inconsistent gray area when it comes to teens dealing with other teens .
One thing 's for sure , though ; the students at the kids ' high school will probably be scared straight about sending nude photos to each other — at least until the end of the school year .

At first I thought Beartato said " Also I 'm gonna eat more whale groins " , which - which I guess would be pretty hard , actually .
If somebody told me that I would one day have to hide my beer from the cat , I would have ...
SINCE 1904 , when Prince Piero Conti managed to get a light bulb to flicker in an Italian lava field , geothermal power has depended on volcanic heat .
The earth 's crust needs to be thin , with high temperatures just below the surface .
Cold water is pumped down a deep borehole and returns superheated to spin a turbine .
To power its tiny and now spluttering economy , Iceland has already made use of what scientists call volcanism .
Fiery bits of the Philippines also run on geothermal power .
So what about Africa ?
The continent 's lack of electricity is a big deterrent to foreign investors , as demand for power grows by 8 % a year .
Some experts think the Rift Valley , which stretches from the northern end of the Red Sea down to Mozambique , is ideal for generating geothermal power .
This has many advantages .
Geothermal power runs whatever the weather , making it ideal for providing the base power station of a national grid .
It emits negligible carbon compared with fossil - fuel stations .
Best of all , it offers indigenous power cheaply : east Africa sorely lacks west Africa 's oil or the potential for solar power in the Sahel , Africa 's wide belt just south of the Sahara desert .
The United Nations Environment Programme , which has its world headquarters in Kenya 's capital , Nairobi , thinks the geothermal potential of the Rift Valley is 14,000 MW , yet only 200MW is currently captured .
Aficionados of geothermal power say it could provide 10 - 25 % of the region 's energy by 2030 .
But the technology has snags .
It would create few jobs , a fact that turns off many African politicians , who tend to like national projects to be labour - intensive .
It disrupts pastoralists herding their cattle and can leak radon and other gases .
Its start - up costs are as high as drilling for oil , and may be higher than for coal power stations .
So the World Bank has set up a geothermal fund to underwrite exploration in east Africa .
If the Kyoto treaty on carbon emissions is rewritten , Africa may get cheap loans and know - how to help install more geothermal power stations .
Some 18 geothermal sites in the Ethiopian part of the Rift Valley and in the Danakil depression on the border with Eritrea and Djibouti have been identified .
The Ethiopians hope for 440MW of geothermal power against their present energy capacity of 790MW .
Geothermal could be an alternative to hydroelectric dams , which provide most of the region 's power but are vulnerable to drought .
Djibouti has signed a deal with Iceland to build a geothermal plant near the Dantean furnace of Lake Assal , the continent 's lowest point .
The project will also capture steam for use as water in the parched country .
Kenya is Africa 's geothermal pioneer .
Its Olkaria station outside Naivasha already produces 158MW .
The government says it wants to raise its geothermal capacity to 576MW within a decade .
That could make a big difference .
Kenya already uses up all its 1,200MW capacity and is compensating for frequent power cuts by installing temporary diesel generators .

Justice Department Non-Committal on Corporate Crime Database
23 Corporate Crime Reporter 7 , February 12 , 2009
A group of Nader ’s Raiders has sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder , urging him to create a corporate crime database and issue an annual report on corporate crime .
The Justice Department response ?
We ’re thinking it over .
The letter to Holder was signed by Ralph Nader , Jim Donahue of Essential Information , and Charlie Cray of the Center for Corporate Policy .
“ The Department ’s development of a corporate crime database is long overdue , ” Nader , Donahue and Cray wrote .
“ For example , it has now been nearly 30 years since the Department has undertaken a comprehensive study of the extent and cost of corporate crime to the United States .
We have urged your predecessors to undertake the creation of an annual report since 1992 . ”
In February , 2006 the Nader group met with representatives from the Bureau of Justice Statistics , who agreed that , if given the resources to do so , such an effort would be possible .
Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney told Corporate Crime Reporter the Department is reviewing the letter and will “ keep in mind the suggestion as we explore ways to efficiently and effectively prosecute these crimes that not only harm shareholders and employees , but also the integrity of the marketplace . ”
The FBI oversees the Uniform Crime Reporting ( UCR ) Program , which tracks certain categories of street crime from over 17,000 local and state law enforcement agencies .
The UCR program ’s annual reports constitute a useful barometer of trends in street crime .
“ An equivalent program should exist to collect and track information on various types of corporate crime and corporate law - breaking , including but not limited to antitrust and price - fixing , environmental crimes , financial crimes – including the various types of accounting fraud witnessed in recent years – overseas bribery , health care fraud , trade violations , labor and employment - related violations – discrimination and occupational injuries and death – consumer fraud and tax fraud , ” Nader , Donahue and Cray wrote .
“ Some of this information is already compiled by different state and federal agencies , including the Department of Justice itself , but the data are rarely aggregated so as to provide an overall assessment of the state of corporate crime .
Other agencies and departments that currently do not compile this kind of information would be encouraged to do so if the Department of Justice signaled its importance .
As the nation ’s top law enforcement officer , we are asking you to provide the kind of leadership necessary for this coordination to occur . ”
Justice Department officials argue that they already are providing a slew of public information on corporate and white collar crime .
Press releases routinely report arrests , indictments , guilty pleas and sentencings and all are available on the Department ’s web site .
“ Except in rare instances where confidentiality is necessary , most court hearings are open to the public , ” a Department official said .
“ Department officials often address corporate audiences at conferences and in panel discussions , as well as in testimony before Congress , to increase awareness of the Department ’s actions and to encourage enhanced corporate compliance programs . ”
Donahue said that with the Internet , a database and yearly annual report should n’t be a heavy lift .
“ We have written every administration since 1992 , urging them to do this , ” Donahue said .
“ With today 's technology this effort will be easier than ever . ”
Cray said if the government can do it for street crime , it should be able to do it for corporate crime as well .
“ President Obama has pledged to use the Internet to make his government the most transparent administration in history , ” Cray said .
“ Given the widespread corruption witnessed in the past decade – including Enron , the Iraq contract crimes and numerous other conspicuous examples – it is imperative that the administration track corporate crime trends and create a publicly - available database , and conduct a comprehensive annual review of corporate crime similar to the review that the department conducts each year for street crime . ”

Whiting confirms new safety car rules
After several complaints over the safety car rules in Formula
One last season , the FIA decided to change the regulations .
After conducting several simulations during test sessions and Friday practice sessions , Charlie Whiting today confirmed that the new rules will be introduced during the 2009 season .
Charlie Whiting said : " Yes .
The rule introduced in 2007 was a bad one , and we ’ve gone back to the 2006 regulations .
The only difference is we intend to implement a minimum time back to the pits .
When we deploy the safety car , the message will go to all the cars , which will then have a “ safety car ” mode on their ECUs .
As soon as that message gets to the car , it ’ll know where it is on the circuit , and it ’ll calculate a minimum time for the driver to get back to the pits .
The driver will have to respect this and the information will be displayed on his dashboard .
" If you remember , the reason we closed the pit entry was to remove the incentive for the driver to come back to his pit quickly .
That ’s gone now , as you wo n’t be able to reach the pits any quicker than your dashboard display allows you to . "
Sweeping new laws to allow ministers to release the private details of millions of people to a string of public bodies or private firms have been condemned as being " open sesame to a vast increase in government power " .
Opposition MPs joined human rights campaigners in attacking the new powers , warning that they could lead to the widespread release of medical records and other sensitive data .
As MPs opened debate on the Coroners and Justice Bill , Conservatives and Liberal Democrats branded the plans an unacceptable extension of the state , while the all - party Commons Justice Committee called for greater safeguards to protect the public against the sharing of information .

Genewatch , a genetic technology pressure group , warned that proposed data - sharing powers could ultimately open the door to the creation of a national DNA database linked to medical records .
It said the Bill could allow DNA samples taken for medical reasons to be released alongside people 's medical records .
Dr Helen Wallace , the group 's director , said it would " wipe out the personal privacy of everyone in Britain at a single stroke " .
Under the proposals , ministers will be able to draw up new information - sharing orders that would allow them to release private data – such as tax returns , personal details or medical records – to any public or private body .
Orders would have to be vetted by the Information Commissioner , the official freedom of information watchdog , and approved by Parliament .
Jack Straw , the Justice Secretary , insisted yesterday that sharing data between government departments would reduce the burdens on taxpayers and businesses .
But Dominic Grieve , the shadow Justice Secretary , said the plans would " drive a coach and horses through the traditional relationship between the state and individuals " to serve a " nebulous case of public good " .
He warned that the Bill would allow ministers to share medical records with organisations that had no link to people 's health .
Mr Grieve said that clauses " tucked away " at the back of the Bill would give ministers " carte blanche to expand data sharing between officials across Whitehall , with local authorities and even with companies in the private sector " .
He added : " This should be done with great caution and should not be open sesame to a vast increase in government power . "
David Howarth , the Liberal Democrat justice spokesman , said the data - sharing proposals were " outrageous " .
He said : " These provisions will allow all the restriction on data sharing in the ID Cards Act to be overridden and drive a coach and horses through all other restrictions on medical and DNA records .
These plans are not confined to government departments and other public authorities .
They would allow unlimited data sharing between private sector organisations and government and the private sector , whether in this country or abroad . "
Ministers insist that tough safeguards would prevent the misuse of data .
The Information Commissioner would have to investigate any proposed data sharing , which must then be approved by MPs and peers .
But members of the Justice Committee called on ministers to increase the safeguards in the Bill .
Mr Straw said that data sharing powers could help relieve the burden on bereaved families who were forced to notify a string of public bodies when a relative died .
He said : " Responsible data sharing between the relevant agencies would reduce the number of people who need to be notified of a death , thereby helping to relieve distress . "
Ext4 , the next generation of Linux 's Ext3 filesystem , is now available in the latest Ubuntu 9.04 installer images .
Ext4 was officially declared stable in version 2.6.28 of the Linux kernel , which was released last month .
Ext4 is designed to provide better performance and increase reliability .
It also increases the maximum filesystem size to one exabyte and reduces the amount of time that is required to perform a fsck operation .
Linux hardware site Phoronix has released benchmarks based on extensive Ext4 performance testing that was conducted with a solid - state drive .
The most impressive results can be seen in the IOzone test , which measures write performance for a large file .
In this test , Ext4 annihilated the competition and significantly outperformed XFS , JFS , ReiserFS , and Ext3 .
The new filesystem also outpaced its peers in the Intel IOMeter File Server Access Pattern Test .

Her name is Joan ; she is just a few years old and very talkative ... and now she is officially the world 's most human computer program .
On Sunday , the computer - generated character scooped the prestigious Loebner prize for artificial intelligence , seeing off some of the world 's most hi-tech creations in the process .
Joan 's maker , the British entrepreneur Rollo Carpenter , emerged victorious after a day of intense competition as a quartet of software experts attempted to pass the famous " Turing test " and scoop a purse of $ 100,000 in the process .
The test began well before computers were capable of such complex interaction .
In 1950 the British mathematician Alan Turing , who famously helped crack German military codes during the second world war , asked how scientists would determine whether computers had successfully achieved truly artificial intelligence .
His suggestion was that a computer which could give conversational responses that were indistinguishable from a human 's could be said to be thinking for itself .
That challenge turned into an annual competition when New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner offered $ 100,000 to the first program to successfully fool a panel of judges into thinking it was a real person .
Despite 16 years of trying , no technology has made that breakthrough , and the grand prize remains unclaimed .
However , Joan was deemed to be the most human competitor on show after a blind test held at University College London .
The judges held typed conversations - similar to an internet chat program - with all of the challengers , before they declared her the winner .
That victory earned Carpenter a $ 2,000 prize and a bronze medal - and also helped him retain the title he first won last year with George , another program driven by Jabberwacky , the technology behind Joan .
What 's unusual about Jabberwacky is that it uses its experience of interaction with humans to create a store from which to draw its next response .
The system has been entered for the Loebner Prize contest since 2003 , and now seems to be building up an impressive lead over its rivals .
That may be helped by the fact that it is always able to enlarge its database through conversations online : if you want to try it out , go to jabberwacky.com .
" I 'm very pleased , " said Carpenter .
" In a way this is very subjective test ... but I believe that for practical purposes , people in working conditions will believe it's a human . "
( Technology Guardian had a conversation with Joan ; you can judge the results below ) .
Carpenter is now working with call centre companies to help train his robots into understanding how to better interact with humans - with the possibility of using them to replace human workers in the near future .
But experts say that a program that will successfully pass the Turing test is still some years away .
" We 're still a long way off , but I think he 's onto something , " said Duncan Graham - Rowe , one of the judges .
But Carpenter is used to the long haul .
The very first version of the program was written in 1982 , and ran on a Sinclair ZX81 , an 8 - bit home computer which had a maximum of 16 K of RAM .
Bobbie Johnson talks to Joan
Bobbie : You won the Loebner prize !
Joan : Nobel beats a Loebner hands down .
Bobbie :
You should n't be so hard on yourself .
Joan :
In a world of depression and misery , the least you can do is try to be optimistic .
Bobbie :
That 's the spirit .
How does it feel to be a winner ?
Joan :
Do n't be silly .
Bobbie :
Why is that silly ?
Are you embarrassed ?
Joan : A little ... I 'm talking to a robot here .
Bobbie : Well , it is a difficult experience .
Joan :
You 're so stupid .
Bobbie :
So you keep telling me .
Joan : I do n't like you very much .
Bobbie : I see .
Do you ever think you 'll win $ 100,000 ?
Joan : I already am .
Bobbie :
Well , you 're not there yet .
Joan :
Do you like cyborgs ?
Bobbie : Not really .
I have to go now , goodbye !
Joan : Sorry .
