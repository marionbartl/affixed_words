A blog about regular things in life some annoying some not so annoying
( This essay appears in the e-book What I 've Learned From Failure : A quarter - century of experience shipping software , distilled into fixnum bittersweet essays )
I have been fired from more jobs than most people have had .
We tend to seek easy , single - factor explanations of success .
For most important things , though , success actually requires avoiding many separate causes of failure .

The expected value of the product to its stakeholders
The fitness of the proposed solution
The quality of project management and expectations communication
I think the root of your mistake is saying that macros do n't scale to larger groups .
The real truth is that macros do n't scale to stupider groups .
Argue with idiots , and you become an idiot .

A chicken and a pig decided to open a diner together .
The pig asked the chicken what they should call their new restaurant .
The chicken suggested " Ham and Eggs . "
The pig thought about it for a while , then decided she did n't want any part of the venture .
" You , " she told the chicken , " would only be interested in serving breakfast .
I 'd be committed . "

Always dive down into a problem and get your hands on the deepest issue behind the problem .
All other considerations are to dismissed as " engineering details " ; they can be sorted out after the basic problem has been solved .

In most companies if a good quality project ships late then the managers will still get it in the neck whereas if poor quality project ships on time then the managers say " we did our best - obviously the dev team seem to be of a poor standard " .

If documents do n't serve to avoid stupid things , mitigate risks or calculate budgets then what are they for ?
They 're to show you have a " process " and a " paper trail " so that you can get ISO certified .
That 's all they look for , they do n't care if you read them or not .
Few projects are cancelled because their designs and implementation were n't complicated enough .
Many are cancelled because they become so complicated that no one can understand them anymore ; any attempt to change or extend the system results in so many unintended side effects that continuing to extend the system becomes practically impossible .

It 's important to remember that when you start from scratch there is absolutely no reason to believe that you are going to do a better job than you did the first time .
First of all , you probably do n't even have the same programming team that worked on version one , so you do n't actually have " more experience " .
You 're just going to make most of the old mistakes again , and introduce some new problems that were n't in the original version .
It had taken 3 years of tuning to get code that could read the 60 different types of FTP servers , those 5000 lines of code may have looked ugly , but at least they worked .

New processes
A way to measure compliance with the new processes
Even when my proposals are seen as significant improvements , they are often rejected on the grounds that they are not intuitive .
It is a classic Catch - 22 :
The client wants something that is significantly superior to the competition .
But if it is to be superior , it must be different .
( Typically , the greater the improvement , the greater the difference . )
Therefore , it cannot be intuitive , that is , familiar .
What the client wants is an interface with at most marginal differences from current practice ... that , somehow , makes a major improvement .

A musician performed a new piece he had written for his best friend .
The friend sat in wonder and listened to the entire piece .
When it was over , he nodded and told the musician that the music was wonderful .
But what , he wondered , did the piece mean ?
The musician nodded at this question and bent over his instrument , then played the entire piece again from the beginning .
It 's a funny thing .
After almost twenty years of drawing a paycheque for creating software , people generally want to hire me because they want me to duplicate the successes I 've had .
The model seems to be " do the things you 've done successfully before , and you 'll be successful now .
" My experience is that this has never worked on its own .
Success in software development is at least as much about avoiding failure modes as it is about " best practices . "
I conjecture it 's because software development on a commercial scale is so hard that almost any mistake will sink a project if left uncorrected or even worse , actively encouraged .
With that in mind , I 've taken a little time to jot down some thoughts about situations where I 've personally failed .
I 'm not going to tell you about some theoretical anti-pattern , or relate some broken thing I 've fixed , I 'm going to share things that caused me to leap from the deck of a burning boat to avoid drowning .
Some of them , in retrospect , would be comical if it was n't for the human misery , damaged careers , and money wasted on failed projects .
Or worse , in my opinion , the opportunity cost of putting good people to work on things that never end up delighting the world .
I weep for what might have been .
The first thing I 've learned from failure is that the four things which matter most are :
In my experience , you need all four working to have a successful project .
I 've personally failed when even one of those four things was bad and not corrected immediately .
If two , three , or all four were wrong , my discovery is that I 've been unable to avert disaster .
( This list obviously does n't cover all of the factors needed for business success : I 'm just talking about getting the software to ship ) .
Now that I 've learned this , I have four new things to evaluate when placed in charge of a new project .
And regardless of what I 'm told , I 'm going to investigate these four things every time , right away , without fail .
I 've never seen a project where strength in one area made up for weaknesses in others .
I 've never personally seen a great technology platform , for example , that magically enabled low - quality developers to produce commercial - quality results .
And do n't talk to me about XP being a magic bullet : all of the good XP teams I 've seen happened to have quality developers , a valuable objective , decent technology , and yes , good project management .
I 've been involved with strong teams and weak teams , and the weak teams always failed .
Weak teams have individuals whose performance is weak .
The strongest indication of a weak team is the realization that if you were to quit and start your own business , you would n't try to poach any of your colleagues .
Painful experience has taught me some of the signs that a team does n't have the chops to perform up to par .
The first sign of a weak team is poor hiring practices .
Developing software is a difficult job .
It requires a panoply of strengths .
Hiring good people is never as simple as interviewing three people with " five years of J2EE " on their résumés and making an offer to the best of the three .
Strong teams have almost impossibly high hiring standards .
Strong teams will always leave a desk empty rather than settling for less than the best .
Another sign of a weak team is poor development hygiene .
There are dozens of development practices that seem trivial to the inexperienced outsider or to the manager focusing on " big wins . "
Examples of development hygiene include source code versioning , maintenance of an accurate bug or issue database , significant use of automated testing , continuous integration , and specifications that are kept current ( whether incredibly detailed or high - level overviews ) .
One team I audited were not just unwilling , but were actually unable to build a product that was in sustaining development .
In other words , the product was in the field , in use by customers , and the team were not able to rebuild it from source .
They were issuing all of their bug fixes as patches on their existing binaries .
This was not a good sign .
Does this mean that nothing can be done if the team is weak ?
Not exactly .
Some of the time I 've had the authority to replace members of the team .
I 've always had the ability to set an example and suggest practices .
But sometimes I 've thought that an organization would be unreceptive to calls for change .
And for want of courage , projects have been lost .
The bottom line is that when I 've failed to recognize weakness in the team and / or failed to take immediate and decisive action to bring the team up to world - class strength , I 've failed .
I 've mentioned that I 've failed with weak teams .
Would you believe I 've compounded this failure by failing with weak stakeholders ?
Whenever I 've had stakeholders who did n't have the horsepower or the will to recognize that a project was in trouble , I 've wound up in the E.R. having the brick dust removed from my forehead .
Getting away from weak teams , another source of failure is the omnipresent threat of " chickens . "
A chicken is not necessarily a weak individual , but a sign of a weak management structure .
A chicken is an individual who has significant authority over your project , but does not make a personal commitment to the success of the project .
Significant authority includes the authority to impose constraints on the team .
Even a single chicken can take a project out .
Chickens are a special case of " external dependencies . "
Special , because they are often politically entrenched .
I 've worked with teams where the pay scale was determined by an edict from H.R .
They were literally prevented from hiring top talent , and it was n't a question of budget : they did not have the freedom to replace three mediocre programmers with two good programmers for the same price .
Another situation involved a team that were continually pestered to include functionality and architecture for " strategic " reasons by a Business Development person .
Although senior management made the importance of the strategic functionality clear , they were unwilling to relax tactical requirements like the ship date or the target revenues .
They had to constantly manage the " chicken " in order to succeed .
I 've managed around chickens here and there , but I 've failed to deliver a successful project whenever I 've failed to limit the effect of chickens on the management of projects .
The next thing I 've learned from my failures is something familiar to the test - driven development crowd .
It 's mandatory to fail early .
You need to know you 're in trouble right away .
That 's essential when taking over an existing project or starting something new .
You have to find out how you 're doing within weeks .
Not quarters , not months .
The longer you wait , the more inertia the failure will have .
You have to come in , take over , and establish some incredibly short - term goals and be prepared to take action based on the project 's performance .
I 've learned that there 's no such thing as too little time between milestones .
Looking back at projects where I 've failed , many contained some uncertainty or risk that I did n't address immediately .
In one case there was a critical piece of functionality that was so important the entire architecture was designed around it .
The CTO and every developer swore it was the greatest thing since sliced bread .
I made a back - of - the - envelope risk calculation and scheduled testing of that functionality to begin three months before the project was to be delivered .
A week before the function was to go into test , the technical lead informed me that it did n't work , had never worked , and that no attempt to fix it would work , because there was a major , glaring flaw that had been overlooked .
A rewrite would be required .
The stakeholders agreed and appointed a new team to handle the rewrite .
Needless to say , the old team 's job security suffered a major hit .
Today , older and wiser , I would demand immediate proof of feasibility of all critical pieces of the product , no matter how obvious things may be to everyone else .
I should have said " Great !
It 's a slam dunk !
Wonderful , let 's schedule a demo next week . "
At least we would have felt the pain early .
Whenever I 've allowed the details of a project to escape me , I 've failed .
On one project , the technical lead was a Ph.D. and refused to describe his work , saying that although I was the managing product development , he was n't going to try to explain his rarified code or architecture to a layperson .
Needless to say , I was unable to ship a successful project .
On another project the CEO would ask me the same question every few days : " draw on my whiteboard who 's working on what . "
I had no trouble with this on that particular project , but looking back there have been projects where I was not tracking people 's work on a day to day basis .
And I can tell you , whenever the details of a project have slipped from my grasp , the project has started to drift into trouble .
I make no apologies for now insisting on knowing exactly who , what , where , when , and why .
There 's a big difference between being asked to explain your work in detail and being told how to do your job .
My personal experience is that attention to detail has always accompanied successful projects . ; losing track of the details has always accompanied failing projects .
Dates are sacred .
I 've learned this lesson in good times and bad .
Stakeholders treasure good dates .
Stakeholders despise bad dates and the people who make flawed promises .
That would have been me , more than once .
Every time , the lesson has been clear .
Do n't get the dates wrong .
I 'll confess : I do n't really think Scrum is an order of magnitude more effective than anything else at producing beautiful , world - changing software .
It may be worse .
But it does produce software every month , month after month .
And every time I 've delivered software on schedule milestone after milestone , my influence and standing with stakeholders has grown .
And every time I 've missed a date , I 've suffered , regardless of whether the late software was demonstrably better than what was originally planned for the missed date .
Back to the measurable processes .
I 've learned from failure that stakeholders like to know what 's going on .
I hate producing useless documentation .
The net result is that I 've tried to find the happy medium where I generate weekly management reports on projects .
A management report is something that is used to actually make a decision .
Everything else is garbage .
I 've learned that when I have n't had management reports for a project , failure has resulted .
Worse , sometimes I 've had documents and metrics that were used to justify bad decisions that sank the ship .
So my lesson from these failures is that every project needs a set of regular reports that contain information you 'll actually use to make decisions .
One of the reasons people associate me with " Agile " development approaches is that I 'm always trying to simplify , simplify , simplify .
This is because almost every time I added something to a milestone , I 've gotten burned .
It seems like it 's always better to say " just finish what we planned , get that 100 % functional , and then we 'll add foobars .
" I recently got burned twice in the same project adding functionality in between milestones .
Both times I was sure that the changes were low risk .
Both times I burned myself .
Now I 'm licking my wounds and swearing I 'll never , ever break my agile principles of restricting scope changes to between increments .
Here 's something that I 've screwed up repeatedly .
Sometimes I 've bounced back , sometimes the project has paid the ultimate price .
The grand " this time we 'll get it right " mantra is absolute garbage .
Do n't talk to me about porting to Java , or new design patterns .
If you must refactor , refactor here , and there , and there to solve this , and that , and the other specific problem that has a specific feature or bug attached to it .
And show me that you had 100 % unit testing coverage on the affected code and completed each refactoring in a day or so and then ran all the unit tests and got a green light .
If you can't do that , you 're going to fail .
I know it , because I 've failed when I did n't do that .
And when I cried on a friend 's shoulder , he told me " I also made that mistake once , and I suffered the same horrible fate .
" Thinking that a major rewrite is going to solve all of your problems is just revisiting my four things that matter most and planning on having one , the fitness of the proposed solution , overpower defects in the people , expected value , and process .
It wo n't happen .
A major rewrite should produce a major new product that offers an order of magnitude more expected value .
And you 'll need to be 100 % sure your team has the horsepower to get the job done and is going to use a process that can handle the load .
I say this because I 've tried and failed to rewrite entire applications , and I 've taken over other people 's rewrite projects and failed there too .
I 've learned a little about politics from failing .
What I 've learned is that if you stick your neck out and evangelize change , you will be blamed if you do not achieve results .
You may or may not care about that .
But be aware of the fact that making changes involves spending your personal credibility .
If you do n't want to lose it , do n't ante up : get out of the project .
And if you decide to make changes , have the courage to go 100 % with your gut .
I 've failed more than once when I watered down my convictions in order to appease dissenters .
The only thing worse than evangelizing change and failing is looking back and realized you might have succeeded if you 'd held firm on your convictions .
What a waste !
I 've seen a number of " sweat shops , " and I 've worked in several places where long hours and rhinoplastic intimacy with the grind stone were demanded of the team .
I can honestly say that hard work makes no long - term difference to failing software development teams .
I disagree with those who say that long hours are 100 % detrimental to software development : I ''ve seen lots of situations where people worked around the clock , motivated by passion .
But those were successful projects .
I 've learned that redoubling effort when a project is in trouble has not fixed the project .
The conclusion I draw is that although teams have worked long hours on many successful projects , there is no causal relationship between long hours and success ( It 's another example of the fallacy of " best practices " : copying a single element of a successful project does not guarantee that another project will be improved ) .
My experience with failing projects is that the exhortation " Ahh , I 'm going to have to go ahead and ask you to come in on Sunday , too ... " has always been interpreted as punishment , not a meaningful way to fix the project .
It has had no effect on under - performing members of the team and tends to strongly demotivate the people who are pulling more than their fair share of the weight .
Good luck convincing stakeholders of this .
One of the reasons people love to hand out overtime like candy is that hours in the office are measurable .
The team 's behind ?
Make them stay until midnight every night .
Even if it does n't work , the executive handing out this order can be sure she can measure compliance .
The bottom line is , it 's easy to measure how many axes you 're using to sharpen a pencil .
When you discover that a blunt axe is n't sharpening the pencil , how do you propose to measure " sharpness " ?
How do you measure " working smarter " ?
So another thing I 've learned about failure is that when things start to go wrong , stakeholders want two things :
Overtime meets both criteria nicely , as do other simple panaceas like generating reports with every build or compliance with coding standards .
Fixing failing projects demands lots of things that are easy to measure and some that are n't .
I 've learned that if you do n't control your stakeholder 's expectations around change , you 'll find yourself fending off demands for things like overtime and reports .
When I 've been brought in specifically to " work out " a failing project I 've failed when I did n't have the authority and support to make major changes .
This is saying the same thing I 've said several times already , but it needs to be repeated .
Often , the stakeholders have just finished casting someone into the darkness and think that they 've cast failure into the darkness with him .
Take a moment and look up the definition of the word " scapegoat . "
They may have symbolically cleansed the project of sin , but the sins remain , and I have inherited them whenever I 've allowed the project to continue to do business as usual .
I 've heard dozens of variations on the same line ( yes , I 've failed dozens of times ! )
The line is " Well , so - and - so failed because he did n't x .
But now you 're here , you 'll get x cleaned up , and we 'll start succeeding right away .
We were hardly failing , really , a little behind , nothing serious . " Every time I 've been told that , things have ended up being seriously dire .
No , it was n't as simple as implementing monthly sprints or formalizing acceptance tests or nightly builds .
The rot went right to the core and the stakeholders were usually ( unwittingly ) enabling it by not understanding or being in denial of the real problems .
When people do n't see the depth of the problem , they do n't accept the importance of making changes .
It has boiled down to something so simple that you 've probably heard it described in jest as the definition of insanity .
If a project has been doing things a certain way , and the stakeholders are not 100 % happy with the results , doing things substantially the same way will not produce substantial changes in the results .
Getting back to failing early , I 've learned it 's important to completely fail .
Get fired .
Shoot the project , then burn its corpse .
Melt the CVS repository and microwave the backup CDs .
When things go wrong , I 've often tried to play the hero from start to finish .
Guess what ?
Some projects are doomed no matter what .
Some need skills I do n't possess .
And some need a fresh face .
I 've ridden more than one project down in flames , and as painful as it is to 'fess up and admit defeat , it 's important to know when to fold your cards and quit .
Yes , that sounds defeatist .
But most success stories are comebacks from personal failures , not wondrous turn - arounds .
Sometimes you should n't finish what you started .
Sometimes you should n't finish what somebody else started .
Every essay ought to end with a summary .
Since this is n't an essay , I 'll end with an adaptation of a Taoist story :
Labels : agile , passion
THE UNITED STATES upset the regional balance in the Middle East when it invaded Iraq .
Restoring it requires bold initiatives , but “ cutting and running ” must precede them all .
Only a complete withdrawal of all U.S. troops — within six months and with no preconditions — can break the paralysis that now enfeebles our diplomacy .
And the greatest obstacles to cutting and running are the psychological inhibitions of our leaders and the public .
Our leaders do not act because their reputations are at stake .
The public does not force them to act because it is blinded by the president ’s conjured set of illusions : that we are reducing terrorism by fighting in Iraq ; creating democracy there ; preventing the spread of nuclear weapons ; making Israel more secure ; not allowing our fallen soldiers to have died in vain ; and others .
But reality can no longer be avoided .
It is beyond U.S. power to prevent bloody sectarian violence in Iraq , the growing influence of Iran throughout the region , the probable spread of Sunni - Shiite strife to neighboring Arab states , the eventual rise to power of the anti-American cleric Muqtada Sadr or some other anti-American leader in Baghdad , and the spread of instability beyond Iraq .
All of these things and more became unavoidable the day that U.S. forces invaded .
These realities get worse every day that our forces remain in Iraq .
They ca n’t be wished away by clever diplomacy or by leaving our forces in Iraq for several more years .
The administration could recognize that a rapid withdrawal is the only way to overcome our strategic paralysis , though that appears unlikely , notwithstanding election - eve changes in White House rhetoric .
Congress could force a stock - taking .
Failing this , the public will sooner or later see through all of the White House ’s double talk and compel a radical policy change .
The price for delay , however , will be more lives lost in vain — the only thing worse than the lives already lost in vain .
Some lawmakers are ready to change course but are puzzled as to how to leave Iraq .
The answer is four major initiatives to provide regional stability and calm in Iraq .
They will leave the U.S. less influential in the region .
But it will be the best deal we can get .
First , the U.S. must concede that it has botched things , cannot stabilize the region alone and must let others have a say in what ’s next .
As U.S. forces begin to withdraw , Washington must invite its European allies , as well as Japan , China and India , to make their own proposals for dealing with the aftermath .
Russia can be ignored because it will play a spoiler role in any case .
Rapid troop withdrawal and abandoning unilateralism will have a sobering effect on all interested parties .
Al Qaeda will celebrate but find that its only current allies , Iraqi Baathists and Sunnis , no longer need or want it .
Iran will crow but soon begin to worry that its Kurdish minority may want to join Iraqi Kurdistan and that Iraqi Baathists might make a surprising comeback .
Although European leaders will probably try to take the lead in designing a new strategy for Iraq , they will not be able to implement it .
This is because they will not allow any single European state to lead , the handicap they faced in trying to cope with Yugoslavia ’s breakup in the 1990s .
Nor will Japan , China or India be acceptable as a new coalition leader .
The U.S. could end up as the leader of a new strategic coalition — but only if most other states recognize this fact and invite it to do so .
The second initiative is to create a diplomatic forum for Iraq ’s neighbors .
Iran , of course , must be included .
Washington should offer to convene the forum but be prepared to step aside if other members insist .
Third , the U.S. must informally cooperate with Iran in areas of shared interests .
Nothing else could so improve our position in the Middle East .
The price for success will include dropping U.S. resistance to Iran ’s nuclear weapons program .
This will be as distasteful for U.S. leaders as cutting and running , but it is no less essential .
That ’s because we do share vital common interests with Iran .
We both want to defeat Al Qaeda and the Taliban ( Iran hates both ) .
We both want stability in Iraq ( Iran will have influence over the Shiite Iraqi south regardless of what we do , but neither Washington nor Tehran want chaos ) .
And we can help each other when it comes to oil : Iran needs our technology to produce more oil , and we simply need more oil .
Accepting Iran ’s nuclear weapons is a small price to pay for the likely benefits .
Moreover , its nuclear program will proceed whether we like it or not .
Accepting it might well soften Iran ’s support for Hezbollah , and it will definitely undercut Russia ’s pernicious influence with Tehran .
Fourth , real progress must be made on the Palestinian issue as a foundation for Middle East peace .
The invasion of Iraq and the U.S. tilt toward Israel have dangerously reduced Washington ’s power to broker peace or to guarantee Israel ’s security .
We now need Europe ’s help .
And good relations with Iran would help dramatically .
No strategy can succeed without these components .
We must cut and run tactically in order to succeed strategically .
The United States needs to restore its reputation so that its capacity to lead constructively will cost us less .
Right city , wrong state
FEMA accused of flying evacuees to wrong Charleston
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) or or Create Your Own
( CNN ) --
Add geography to the growing list of FEMA fumbles .
A South Carolina health official said his colleagues scrambled Tuesday when FEMA gave only a half - hour notice to prepare for the arrival of a plane carrying as many as 180 evacuees to Charleston .
But the plane , instead , landed in Charleston , West Virginia , 400 miles away .
It was not known whether arrangements have been made to care for the evacuees or transport them to the correct destination .
A call seeking comment from FEMA was not immediately returned .
" We called in all the available resources , " said Dr. John Simkovich , director of public health for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control .
" They responded within 30 minutes , which is phenomenal , to meet the needs of the citizens coming in from Louisiana , " he said .
Simkovich said that the agency had described some of the evacuees as needing " some minor treatment ... possibly some major treatment . "
" Unfortunately , the plane did not come in , " Simkovich said .
" There was a mistake in the system , coming out through FEMA , that we did not receive the aircraft this afternoon .
It went to Charleston , West Virginia . "
A line of buses and ambulances idled behind him at Charleston International Airport as he described what happened .
" This is a ' no event ' for today , " Simkovich said .
Ha !
Da sind sie wieder , die kleinen aber feinen kulturellen Unterschiede zwischen Europäern und Amerikanern .
YouTube rockt .
Das System funktioniert einfach .
Anmelden , Datei hochladen , Video ansehen , Video bloggen .
– Ausser , in dem hochgeladenen Video ist nackte Haut zu sehen .
Dabei ist das kleine Video , um das es mir geht , ganz harmlos .
Während der CeBIT schrieb ich etwas über Messegeilheit und wollte zur Illustration des Themas einen Videobeitrag über das , was so mittags auf der CeBIT an manchen Messeständen über die Flachbildschirme flimmert , zu YouTube hochladen .
Dort wurde das Filmchen auch gesehen .
Nach 172 Abrufen war dann aber Schluss : Das Video wurde als „ inappropriate “ eingestuft und gesperrt .
Also suchte ich eine Alternative .
Google Video hat das Video mit der gleichen Begründung erst gar nicht freigeschaltet .
Schliesslich habe ich den französischen Anbieter Dailymotion ausprobiert .
Dort läuft nun das Video – ohne das es Anstoss erregt .
Im Gegenteil , bei Dailymotion gibt es sogar einen Channel mit dem bezeichnenden Titel Sexy .
Dort finden sich dann geklaute Schnipsel von kommerziellen Soft - Pr0n - Sites und ziemlich zweifelhafte Werke einiger Spanner .
Was lernen wir daraus ?
Während die , vorwiegend amerikanischen , Nutzer von ganz im Sinne YouTubes handeln ( „ Please help keep this site FUN , CLEAN , and REAL “ ) und für die Sperrung von aus ihrer Sicht anstössigem Material sorgen , scheinen die , mehrheitlich europäischen , Benutzer von Dailymotion ein signifikant anderes Verständnis davon zu haben , was als anstössig zu bezeichnen ist .
Denn anstössige Inhalte kann man auch dort melden , nur geklickt wird dieser Link offensichtlich nicht so häufig .
Leider hat man bei YouTube meine Frage nach einem Katalog der Kriterien , die zur Sperrung eines Videos führen ( noch ) nicht beantwortet .
Übrigens gibt es noch weitere Argumente , Dailymotion als Alternative zu YouTube in Betracht zu ziehen : Satte 150 MB grosse Videos lassen sich hochladen .
YouTube akzeptierte zwischenzeitlich nur noch Videos mit einer maximalen Grösse von 100 MB und einer maximalen Laufzeit von 10 Minuten .
( Aktuell wird der Hinweis nicht mehr angezeigt ) .
Auch geht der Upload bei Dailymotion ( gefühlt , nicht wirklich gemessen ) deutlich zügiger von statten .
Klare Nachteile von Dailymotion :
Es gibt deutlich weniger Benuzter als bei YouTube ( Laut Futurezone ist YouTube inzwischen der mit Abstand grösste Player im boomenden Online - Video Geschäft ) und man muss ein Login haben , um Videos im eigenen Blog darstellen zu können .
Vorher bekommt man den entsprechenden HTML - Code nicht zu Gesicht .
In diesem Zusammenhang sei übrigens noch auf KeepVid hingewiesen , über das die Riesenmaschine bereits berichtete .
Damit lassen sich Streaming - Flash - Videos fast aller Anbieter lokal als Flash - Filme speichern und z.B. mit dem FLV - Player ( unter Windows ) wiedergeben .

Canadian scientists have observed a case of learning and culture in a killer whale .
A four - year - old orca in a marine park in Ontario has found a way not just to provide fresh fowl for supper , he has shown other young whales how to do the same thing .
The precocious predator made a practice of regurgitating his fish supper and then lurking just below the water 's surface .
The moment a gullible gull touched down for a free meal , the creature lunged .
According to New Scientist today , within a few months the whale 's younger half - brother began trying the same trick .
Then a six - month - old calf and an older male at Marineland in Niagara Falls started doing the same thing .
" They are in a way setting a trap , " animal behaviourist Michael Noonan of Canisius College in Buffalo , New York , told the magazine .
" They catch three or four gulls this way some days . "
The capacity to innovate and then transmit the innovative technique - in a word , culture - was once supposed to be one of the things that separated humans from other mammals .
The others were language and tool use .
But biologists observed that animals could communicate , and that great apes had a capacity to understand and even use human language .
Then other biologists began observing sophisticated tool use , not just in primates but in sea otters and birds such as crows .
A British team has also recorded a range of cultural traditions within chimpanzee groups .
Today 's report suggests killer whales , too , can learn and pass on their learning .
" I 'm not surprised , " said Phil Hammond of St Andrews University , in Scotland .
" It is the sort of thing killer whales ... are known for doing : coming up with inventive ways of catching their prey . "
The LED on his answerphone read zero when Sam returned to his flat last night following after - work drinks with colleagues .
Today he 'll sleep in , watch a DVD or two , play Xbox and call his mum .
Tomorrow he plans to slip back into the office for a couple of hours .
Sam has few friends outside work and the last two ( brief ) relationships he had originated in the office .
He 's carrying over holidays to next year ( again ) and the five - day Christmas shutdown is , he believes , too long .
But Sam is not like his father , a workaholic who became an alcoholic .
Sam believes he is different because he finds meaning in his work .
He is an agency " creative " and some of his clients are NGOs and voluntary sector organisations .
He loves what he does .
He wakes up at 3 am buzzing with ideas .
His dad hated his job and lay awake worrying about work .
People are taking their work more personally than ever .
And it 's healthy to find meaning and fulfilment in our work , to be passionate about what we do .
But what happens when our work becomes too personal ?
Phillip Hodson meets people like Sam - lawyers , bankers , journalists , actors - on an almost daily basis at his north London counselling and psychotherapy practice .
" I see a lot of clients who work double - digit days but do n't understand why they have started walking in front of buses , why they can't sleep any more , why they have no partners - why they have no life . "
Many are depressed , says Hodson , but the reason is not some horrible trauma .
It 's because they love their work too much .
Research by consultancy Penna suggests a quarter of British workers are so passionate about their job they believe it defines who they are and gives their life meaning .
For a significant 12 % , work is the single biggest provider of " community and belonging " .
A fifth have built up a close network of friends through their workplace , a figure that rises in London , where the workplace is an even more important social agent .
A quarter of directors say they get more meaning from work than at home or socially .
Another poll says more than 90 % of employees would rather find a new job than love this Christmas .
British workers spend 60 % of their waking hours in work , but many put in long hours because they want to , rather than out of economic necessity .
The workplace , instead of the home , is where they make friends , feel supported and find opportunities to " make a difference " .
Older workers - those in their 40s and 50s - were brought up on a live - to - work ethic : work harder , work longer , earn lots of money .
In contrast , surveys suggest younger workers focus on quality , not quantity of work .
They take it for granted that they will be paid well .
But they want work to mirror their values , too .
Younger workers hope to avoid the mistakes their parents made .
But the lure of work that is " significant " or " challenging " can be incredibly seductive .
You know who they are - friends for whom work has become their sole passion , their primary source of self - esteem , recognition and respect .
Maybe it 's you .
Having a job that makes you feel valued and part of a community does not in itself render you unbalanced .
The imbalance occurs when work is the only place where your needs are being met .
Workplace shocks such as redundancy , being passed over for promotion or poor appraisals can be devastating - an awful epiphany when you discover that work is not a meritocracy , your boss is not your friend and your colleagues are not your family .
In short , bring your heart and soul to work , and there 's a good chance you 'll end up feeling betrayed .
For people with partners and families , marital or sexual problems are often an early warning sign , says Hodson .
" Many of my clients have become so adrenalised by their job that everything else , even playing with their children or looking after their partners , gets lost .
Young entrepreneurs tell me that they 're ' only doing it for the family ' .
But it 's bollocks .
They 're doing it for themselves .
I find it very strange that you would build a family and then spend most of your time away from it . "
Employers , meanwhile , are joining the dots , ready to believe that more engaged workers are more productive workers .
" Employees will be more motivated , loyal , creative and productive in an organisation that has helped them find meaning at work , " says Gary Browning , chief executive of Penna .
Nokia , Unilever , McKinsey , Shell , Coca - Cola , Hewlett Packard , Merck Pharmaceuticals , Starbucks and the Co-operative Bank are among the big employers exploring the concept of " spiritual intelligence " .
While emotional intelligence is about what we feel , spiritual intelligence ( SI ) concerns the soul and the quest for purpose and meaning .
For some employers , the interest is as perfunctory as rewriting mission statements to include " social responsibility " or " the environment " .
But others are introducing the SI concept into their management processes and business practices .
Danah Zohar , the academic who wrote the book ( literally ) on spiritual intelligence , defends employers ' right to create meaning at work .
" The point is not to find all our meaning at work , but to find more meaning at work , " she says .
" It 's not a case of making work more meaningful than home , or vice versa .
The more meaning the better , wherever we find it .
" Most executives have to work long hours ; that 's what is expected of them .
But I know many who are now happy to work a 16 - or 17 - hour - day because they 've found meaning . "
Should we accept that work is our new religion , where we worship and sacrifice our time ?
Or should we put our work back in context ?
The Spanish word for work , " trabajo " , comes from a Latin word for an instrument of torture .
Even the Puritans considered work a means to an end .
Successful companies are usually the ones that stick to their core competencies .
Maybe the smart ones should trust their employees with the time and space to find more meaning outside work , and leave spiritual experiences to babies in mangers .

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad presented himself as a humble alternative
Mr Ahmadinejad won 62 % of votes , defying predictions of a close race , to defeat the more moderate ex-President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
After his win , Mr Ahmadinejad said he planned to create a " modern , advanced and Islamic " role model for the world .
His victory means all the organs of the Iranian state are now in the hands of conservative hardliners .
Mr Ahmadinejad , 49 , who campaigned on a conservative Islamic platform , had surprised observers by beating five other candidates in the first round to reach the run-off .
The BBC's Frances Harrison in Tehran says his taped statement , broadcast on state radio after the result was announced , was aimed at easing worries about his conservative views .
Some 22 million people voted in this run -off poll - a turnout of 60 % , down from 63 % in the first round a week ago .
Our correspondent says it was Mr Ahmadinejad 's appeal to the poor that seems to be the secret to his success .
Despite Iran 's huge oil wealth the country has high unemployment and a big gap between rich and poor .
' Flawed ' election
Mr Ahmadinejad has also pledged to tackle corruption and resist Western " decadence " .
The US said the election was " flawed " and described it as " out of step " with regional trends towards democracy .
In Washington , a state department official said the US would judge Iran under Mr Ahmadinejad by its actions .
" In light of the way these elections were conducted , however , we remain sceptical that the Iranian regime is interested in addressing either the legitimate desires of its own people , or the concerns of the broader international community , " the spokeswoman said .
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said there were " serious deficiencies " in the election , noting that many reformists , and all women candidates , had been barred from standing .
" I hope that under Mr Ahmadinejad 's presidency , Iran will take early steps to address international concerns about its nuclear programme " as well as its policies toward terrorism , human rights and the Middle East peace process , Mr Straw said in a statement .
' Profound humiliation '
Supporters of Mr Rafsanjani said before the result that victory for Mr Ahmadinejad would signal voting fraud .
Reformist candidates accused Iran 's Revolutionary Guards and Basij security services of orchestrating a plot to boost Mr Ahmadinejad .
Interior ministry officials monitoring polling stations received some 300 complaints of electoral violations in Tehran alone , the Associated Press news agency reports .
The Islamic regime that has lost popular support is now seeking to renew itself by playing a new trick

Iranian election : Your views
The Guardian Council , which ran the poll , has dismissed allegations of election fraud .
Mr Ahmadinejad will be Iran 's first non-cleric president for 24 years when he takes office in August .
Iran 's supreme spiritual leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , banned both camps from celebrating victory and urged people to keep off the streets .
He said the election result was a " profound humiliation " for the US .
Detectives reconstructed the bombers ' movements after studying thousands of hours of film as part of the probe into the blasts which killed 52 people .
CCTV images show three of the bombers entering Luton station , before travelling to King 's Cross station where they are also pictured .
Officers are keen to find out if the men met anyone else on the day .
Intensive probe
The three , Mohammad Sidique Khan , Shehzad Tanweer and Germaine Lindsay , were conducting a carefully planned reconnaissance exercise , police said .
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke , head of Scotland Yard 's Anti-Terrorist Branch , said : " What we want to know is where else they went and did they meet anybody else while they were in London ?
The new footage shows the three men travelling to King 's Cross from Luton station on 28 June
In pictures
" If any member of the public thinks that they know something about the movement of these men on that day , they should call us on the anti-terrorist hotline . "
He added that it was " part of a terrorist 's methodology " to check timings , lay - out and security precautions .
Police traced the movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which pointed to their trip .
Mr Clarke said the investigation would carry on for months .
More than 3,000 plus witness statements had been gathered and 80,000 CCTV tapes analysed .
Police revealed that two bombs were found in a car left by the attackers at Luton train station on 7 July .
It has also emerged that a landfill site in Skelton Grange , West Yorkshire , is being searched in a bid to uncover more clues .
DUMMY RUN DETAILS Sidique Khan and Tanweer meet Lindsay at Luton station around 0810 BST
The trio buy tickets and catch a train to King 's Cross
The men arrive at King 's Cross at 0855 BST and are also seen at Baker Street at midday
The bombers leave King 's Cross at 1250 BST and arrive back in Luton at 1340 BST
London bomb families ' grants double
A dozen officers in fluorescent jackets could be seen on Tuesday afternoon working on the site .
The men , who were wearing overalls under their jackets and white safety hats , appeared to be systematically searching a small area of the rubbish heap helped by two mechanical diggers .
One local resident said : " They 've been here for weeks , dozens of them .
" They 've been searching the same bit of rubbish every day it seems .
" The diggers skim off a layer at a time and then they move in and search it quite painstakingly . "
A landfill site the size of 18 Olympic swimming pools is being searched
Detectives believe the site could be connected to the apparent " bomb factory " at a flat in Alexander Grove in Leeds .
Meanwhile , al - Qaeda has said for the first time the group carried out the attacks .
In a videotaped message aired on Arab television station al - Jazeera , al - Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al - Zawahri said the group had the " honour " of carrying out the attacks .
The 7 July bomb attacks killed 56 people - including the four bombers - and injured more than 700 .
Tube theory
Three bombs were detonated on underground trains just outside Liverpool Street and Edgware Road stations , and on another travelling between King 's Cross and Russell Square .
The fourth explosion took place on a double - decker bus in Tavistock Square , not far from King 's Cross .
Evidence of a reconnaissance mission supports the theory that all four had planned to detonate their rucksack bombs on the Underground system .
It is believed that the bus bomber , Hasib Hussain , was prevented from getting onto the Northern Line on the day of the attacks because the service had been disrupted .
The other bombers - Tanweer , Lindsay and Sidique Khan - detonated their devices almost simultaneously .
Anyone with information in connection with the London bombings should ring the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800789321 .

The Bluths are out of business .
" Arrested Development , " the critically praised but low - rated Fox show that won an Emmy for outstanding comedy series , as well as Emmys for writing , will not be resurrected on Showtime as rumors circulating for months have suggested .
A source close to the negotiations said that creator Mitch Hurwitz had decided after a lengthy period of debating an offer from Showtime that " Arrested Development reached its end , creatively , as a series . "
Reached on his cell phone while filming a movie in Toronto , star Jason Bateman said he had mixed emotions about the news , saying he was sad for the series to end but happy that the beloved series will live on DVD for people to enjoy .
" I 'm so proud of it and so like it as a TV fan that I 'm happy we 're not going to get a chance to screw it up , " he said , in the deadpan style of his character , Michael Bluth , about the only sane member of the dysfunctional Bluth clan .
" Our luck would n't have held .
There would have been cast fighting .
We would have messed it up . "
Part of the reason Bateman can joke about it now -- and perhaps it will sting a little less painfully for diehard fans -- is that the fate of the series has been in limbo for so long .
Though Fox has n't even officially canceled the series , Fox entertainment President Peter Liguori said months ago that the network was moving on -- and the last four episodes from this truncated third season were burned off in February up against the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics , a sure sign of not being wanted .
Despite the Emmys , the audience never showed up to make " Arrested Development " a hit .
Though Fox renewed it for a second season , it ended up cutting the order to 18 ( a move spoofed in a later " Arrested Development " episode ) .
When Liguori took over as entertainment president of Fox , one of the first things he was told , according to a source inside the network , was " You do n't want to be the guy who cancels ' Arrested Development . ' "
But risking a critical backlash was apparently easier to do than making the show profitable , so even though " Arrested Development " was brought back for its third and final season , it was moved to Mondays and limited to 13 episodes .
" Arrested Development " premiered in November 2003 and quickly became a critical darling for its brilliant writing , superb cast and multilayered jokes .
Narrated by Ron Howard ( whose company produced the series ) , " Arrested Development " had a faux - documentary , cinema verite style that traced the sorry path of the Bluths from the glory days of their home development company to their cash - strapped existence thanks to a government fraud bust .
The series mined hilarious performances from Bateman , Jeffrey Tambor , Jessica Walter , David Cross , Will Arnett , Tony Hale , Portia de Rossi and others , plus a string of memorable guest stars .
Bateman , who 's in Toronto filming " Mr. Magorium 's Wonder Emporium " alongside Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman , said " Arrested Development " opened a lot of doors for him .
" The people who hand out jobs in L.A. were basically the only ones who watched the show , which worked out great for me .
I 'm getting a lot of flattering opportunities . "
Bateman said the reason he got the role in his latest film is " a direct result of ' Arrested Development . ' "
Everyone involved in the series benefited , Bateman said , including Fox .
" At least they had a presence at the Emmys , which was new for them . "
For a series that never attained more than cult status , " Arrested Development " set off one of the strangest behind - the - scenes bidding wars when it was clear Fox had given up on it .
The Chronicle first reported that Showtime was interested in picking up the series and moving it to pay cable , where it would not only add significant value to the Showtime lineup but also be immune to the ratings pressure of broadcast television .
Then word came that ABC wanted to get into the bidding ( probably because " Arrested Development " would have been a good stylistic match for that network 's midseason comedy " Sons & Daughters " ) .
Once the ABC interest surfaced , sources inside
Fox said the network became worried that it would suffer great embarrassment if it lost the series to a rival that managed to make it a hit .
That 's partly why no official cancellation came from Fox .
But 20th Century Fox TV , the studio that made " Arrested Development , " was clearly pursuing a home for the series .
The Showtime offer was reportedly for two 12 - episode seasons , with the entire cast coming back .
Though the deal was on the table for some time , Hurwitz sounded out cast members about whether it made sense for the show to continue .
Noted for his work on getting all the details right ( not just the writing , but the visual humor and the ceaseless references to past episodes and previous punch lines ) , Hurwitz ended up putting an inordinate amount of time into the series , and no doubt that workload played a part in his decision to pass on the Showtime offer .
Though the demise of one of television 's most devastatingly funny comedies deals a blow to the hopes of a diehard audience ( not to mention the sitcom genre ) , Hurwitz and his writers deserve credit for a tremendously effective wrap - up of the myriad story arcs in " Arrested Development . "
The series would have had to change gears on Showtime .
And as Bateman said about the three - season DVDs : " It 's nice that there 's a medium to preserve it . "
Recently , John Gruber ( DaringFireball ) and Tim Bray have been conjecturing on why or why not Apple does n’t open source its apps .
For many reasons , I ’m not going to commit on the political or business side of the decision .
I do n’t have any knowledge of why Apple — or any other company — has chosen to close or open what they have .
Instead , I ’m going to point out a fact that Bray seems to largely ignore and Gruber only touches on in passing .
Open sourcing a large body of source that has always been closed is really damned hard .
It takes a monumental amount of effort to do so and , once open , it takes a whole bunch of ongoing effort to keep it open in a productive fashion ( which Gruber does cover , actually ) .
At the lowest level , pretty much every line of code has to be reviewed to ensure that it is n’t offensive , does n’t cross any number of lines ( licensing , intellectual property , etc.. ) , is formatted reasonably well , and every file must contain the appropriate header .
For any company that has a suite of products where some build on others — especially when the others are developer tools ( think Sun ’s JDK or IBM ’s libraries or Microsoft ’s DLLs ) — it is quite likely that any given piece of code is going to contain stuff done “ the wrong way ” .
It may have been “ right ” or “ only way ” when written and you may have intended to fix it later , but it just has n’t happened yet .
As a result , you are likely going to have to break the project across potentially unnatural lines to separate the parts to be open sourced from the parts that need to remain closed for various reasons .
And the reasons are many and not just because you want to keep something secret .
Sometimes the code is so completely counter to the way developers should develop apps that you do n’t want to run the risk of other developers doing the same thing ( and there are very valid reasons for such a case to arise — bad engineering is rarely the reason ) .
Then there is the intellectual property .
If there are any random patents embodied in the code — of which there likely will be in this day and age — you have to figure out exactly how open sourcing said implementation changes the whole IP landscape .
Example : Before joining Apple , I was involved in various IP related conflicts as they meandered through the court system .
In one case , one party used open source to bolster their position .
In particular , they used the openly available implementation to strengthen their particular position — had that source remain closed , that particular defense / offense would not have been available .
( Suitably vague to protect the , uh , innocent ?
guilty ?
was n’t really clear )
And once you have everything all cleaned up , have the license selected , and are ready to roll it out , you have to expend the engineering effort to actually set up a community portal of some kind .
Bug tracking .
Source repository .
Some kind of channel for receiving patches .
It is going to be an ongoing engineering investment .
There is no such thing as “ just publish the source and be done with it ” .
Publishing source — be it under an open or closed license ( like the GPL ) — changes a product in unavoidably large ways .
Sometimes good .
Sometimes bad .
Always a lot of effort to deal with .

Michael Berube wrestles with " popular culture " :
Invasion of the Marriage Disaster Flicks : So Janet and I saw War of the Worlds last night , a movie we wanted to see precisely because it has no emotional content whatsoever .
We were pleased , however , to find out that ( and I think I ’m paraphrasing a reviewer here , but I ca n’t remember which one ) a brutal alien invasion will get Tom Cruise back in touch with his children ( Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin ) .
I suppose there ’s more to say about the film , particularly about Tim Robbins ’s bizarre appearance as himself in Mystic River ( apparently he ’s now ready to re-enact the child molestation in the basement bit , this time with himself as the molester ) .
But what Janet and I wanted to know , as we left the theater , was how the hell the marriage between Mary Ann ( Miranda Otto ) and Ray Ferrier ( Cruise ) could ever have happened in the first place .
That ’s far less plausible than a mass invasion of insect - lizard aliens driving huge tripods around the globe .
As for the closing scene , in which Cruise delivers the kids to Otto ( who ’s in Boston with her second husband ) and Chatwin finally calls him “ dad ” : what is it with this narrative trope , anyway ?
There ’s a disaster or an invasion or a lethal virus or a mysterious bunch of aliens living in our oceans , and the story ends when the family romance is completed in some way ?
Quoi ?
And pourquoi ?
I ’ve been wondering about this for some time , and even tried to write about it a few years ago , but I do n’t really know what to do with it aside from pointing it out .
So , dear readers , I cheerily invite you to give it a go .
Here are your Texts for Analysis .
Please remember to write legibly !...
Well , it seems to me that what what Michael and Janet regard as a strange deviation from the disaster - movie genre is an attempt by Hollywood to stretch the movie 's appeal by combining typical narrative patterns expressed by preschool - age boys and girls .
The boys want ( and tell ) stories about power , violence , chaos , and destruction .
The girls want ( and tell ) stories about people embedded in family relationships doing things which end with the reaffirmation or restoration of the harmonious family .
Here , for example , is Agelike Nicolopoulou of Lehigh , analyzing stories told by 4 - year - olds at a western Massachusetts nursery school http://www.lehigh.edu/~inpsy/nicolopoulou1997.pdf:
The preschool makes strong and deliberate efforts to create an egalitarian , nonsexist atmosphere ....
[ O ] ne of the teachers ' intentions in using this storytelling and story - acting practice is to help generate greater cohesion and a common culture ....
[ T ] o a great extent , however , [ the children ] ... build up two subcultures within the classroom , not one ....
The kinds of stories told by the boys and girls differ systematically ... in both form and content ... embody two distinctive types of genuine aesthetic imagination ( surprising as it may seem to assert this about preschoolers ) , each with its own inner logic and coherence ....
The girls ' stories show a strain toward order , whereas the boys ' stories show a strain toward disorder ....
The older girls in this group told stories that largely fit within what I call a " family genre " ... start ... with characters already embedded ... in stable and given networks of social relations , the most favored of these being the family unit ....
[ T ] he world outside the home may be a source of danger and disruption ....
Once upon a time there was a castle , and a king and a queen and a prince and a princess and a unicorn and a pony lived in it .
And they went for a walk .
And they found a playground and they swang on the swings , and they slide down the slide , and then they went back home .
But they had some trouble finding the way .
But then a dog came to them and said , " I 'll help you find the way home , " and he did .
The End . [ W ] hen the girls do introduce a danger , threat , or surprise , they are almost always careful to resolve it in a positive way before ending the story ....
In short , the girls ' stories are ... organized around the representation , maintenance , and restoration of order ... rooted in a frameork of stable social relationships ... anchored topographically in the home ....
In contrast , the overwhelming majority of 4 - year - old boys ' stories start with isolated individual characters ... defined ... through their actions ....
The characters most often used by boys tend to be either big and powerful animals .. superheroes , villains , and other cartoon action characters ... [ and ] a small number of small but lethal characters ....
The stories focus on struggle and destruction ... straightforward descriptions of destruction and / or chaos are not uncommon :
Once there was Robin Hood .
Then Batman came .
Then prince John came -- he's the king .
Then Superman came .
Superman battled with Batman and Batman died .
Then he came alive again .
Superman died .
And then Splinter , Raphael , Donatello , and Michelangelo came .
Then an Indian came on a horse with a bow and arrow .
Then a cowboy came on a horse with a bow and arrow just like the Indian and shot Superman so he would n't ever come alive again .
And they lived happily ever after .
The end .
The standard action movie pattern used to be ( a ) that the movie ended when the antagonist had been overthrown and ( b ) that ending was announced by the clinch between the hero and the ingenue .
This new " combinatory " narrative pattern is a shift .
And I do not think it is a successful shift -- the attainment of harmonious family relationships is simply grafted on , and does not emerge organically out of the central action of the movie .
Hollywood is aware that it has an audience bifurcation problem with movies like " War of the Worlds , " and it is trying to figure out how to fix it , but it is failing .
In spite of the restoration of harmonious family relationships at its end , " War of the Worlds " does not make it as a chick flick .
" Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants " is a much better movie , even though it lacks death rays and large explosions .

As you can see the much anticipated redesign is now live .
It was over a year ago that it was suggested that a “ visual identity team ” be formed for the purpose of redesigning the Ruby Web site .
The redesign team created over 20 mockups for the the new site , posted several for the Ruby community to comment on , and finally decided on the current design .
Once the design was chosen it was lovingly converted to CSS and XHTML and an administration system was written for it .
The content was then ported over from the old Web site and massaged by an enthusiastic group of volunteers .
The Ruby Visual Identity Team is composed of :
Ben Giddings
James Edward Gray II
Curt Hibbs
John Long
Shugo Maeda
Michel Martens
Why the Lucky Stiff
The following people also contributed expertise or content to the new Web site :
David Alan Black
Alex Combas
Damphyr
Eric Davis
Yukihiro “ Matz ” Matsumoto
Matt Todd
Usaku Nakamura
A handful of Japanese volunteers ( who did the translation )
It would be great if we could list the names of all the people who gave suggestions , reported bugs , or contributed in some way , but the list would grow very long indeed .
This site is truly a product of the Ruby community and we want to thank everyone who made it happen .
Kudos to each and every one of you !
If you have comments or questions about the redesign , you are cordially invited to join the discussion over on the VIT - Discuss mailing list .
Lindsay Lohan begs Wilmer Valderrama for help On Sunday night , some guy called , Danny Masterson would n't let Lindsay Lohan into Kid's Cotton Club , his weekly jazz night at Guy 's reports LA.com .
Lohan resorted to calling ex-boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama , who was inside with Jamie Foxx and Mekhi Phifer , to ask him to get Masterson to let her in .
This certainly does n;t sound like a hot spot to me , but what do I know .
According to LA 's source , who witnessed the whole thing , Valderrama asked Masterson , but he would n't budge .
Danny Masterson reportedly said that he did n't want her in because he does n't respect the way she lives her life — and that Paris Hilton is n't welcome either .
According to the crowd , Lohan screamed at the top of her lungs and threatened to call the cops .
Eventually , simply left

‘ Design by Contract ’ is good , right ?
It ’s supposed to be , but you always have to deal with that one question : what do you do when a precondition fails in production ?
In some systems you can throw an exception , or abort processing .
But , what do you do when you ’re committed ?
When failure is unacceptable ?
There are many answers to this question , but the one that I do n’t hear often enough is that you can , in many cases , design away preconditions .
Here ’s a simplified example .
Suppose that we need to do work using a date range .
We can define a DateRange class and give it a constructor which takes two dates : the starting and ending dates of the interval :
new DateRange ( start , end ) ;
That works , but it lets us fumble our arguments like this :
new DateRange ( end , start ) ;
Sure , we can have a precondition that tells us that the start must be less than or equal to the end , but it ’s still a shame that our interface allows the error .
Can we make a better interface ?
We could have a DateRange constructor that accepts a starting date and an extent in days :
new DateRange ( start , 4 ) ;
That ’s better , but we still have a precondition .
The number of days should be positive .
Is there any way around that ?
Well , we could create a date range at a particular date and “ inflate ” it afterward :
DateRange vacation = new DateRange( startingDate ) ;
vacation.addWeek ( ) ;
vacation.addDay ( ) ;
No more preconditions .
Is the interface a little funky ?
In this case , definitely .
But the point is we do n’t have to take preconditions as given .
They are n’t always inevitable .
In many cases , we can systematically reduce them with a bit of redesign .
Are there preconditions you can remove by redesigning your interfaces ?
Is the interface change worth it ?
This post is my fourth in a series providing some straightforward recommendations for managers responsible for the care and feeding of IT staff .
I suggest reading Part One , Part Two and Part Three first if you have n’t done so already but it is n’t absolutely necessary .
This part deals with the second key area of job satisfaction : the actual work performed by staff .
This is one area where the Cabal Of Disaffected and Exploited Information Technology ( CODE - IT ) workers can be particularly demanding in ways that confuse managers and employers .
To be honest , CODE - IT workers sometimes complain quite unfairly about their work being “ boring ” but this is an area where positive changes can be made to the great benefit of both staff and management .
So long as staff and management each understand where the other is coming from ( aye , there ’s the rub . )
Because I honestly believe this is one of the most subjective areas of job satisfaction in the CODE - IT world , I will be treading more carefully than usual .
The two extremes of the spectrum are the CODE - IT high - flyer who thinks everything is below his mighty intellect ( and this type is almost universally male ) and the manager whose motivational speeches consist of variations on : “ Getting paid should be all the motivation you need , now shut up and do what I say . ”
Neither of these attitudes is conducive to a happy workplace so I ’ll be exploring the middle ground today .
I ’ve never been fond of the CODE - IT warriors who spout condescending lines like “ I do n’t want to go to my grave saying ‘ at least I made the company database more stable ' ” ( these days you ’re most likely to hear that sort of sanctimonious drivel from a Web2.0 entrepreneur or wannabe . )
The truth is , somebody has to do the unglamorous jobs so it does n’t serve anyone ’s interests to degrade the day - to - day grunt work of the IT world .
In fact , this is probably at least 75 % of the work faced by IT workers so why is it looked down on so often ?
I think I hear the intake of breath as the CODE - IT equivalent of Opus Dei assassins prepare to kill me with poison darts from their blow guns ( purchased on ThinkGeek of course ) but here goes with some brutal honesty .
If you take on a job knowing full well the nature of the work involved , you should commit to doing that work no matter how boring you decide it is .
There are two honourable courses of action : honour your commitment to do a job or leave for something you consider better .
Do n’t sit on your arse and complain .
I have been accused of simply whining in these posts but I have to admit I have no time for someone who complains about a job and does nothing constructive to remedy the situation .
Bad management is n’t the problem in these situations , the problem is a bad attitude .
Having said that , I would like to point out that management is in a very strong position to alleviate IT drudge - work .
Too often , the complaints of CODE - IT workers are dismissed as whining ( “ They ’re never satisfied , ” ) without looking at the root causes .
Most CODE - IT workers complain about boring work not because they ’re complainers by nature but because they ’re trained , intelligent and driven individuals who want to be challenged and are constantly looking to expand their horizons .
If your company ca n’t benefit by harnessing and channeling this sort of power , well , you have bigger problems than complaining CODE - IT workers .
Some self - help for the CODE - IT brigade : so you ’re stuck doing boring work .
Short of quitting and looking for a better job , what can you do ?
Step one : take pride in your work .
If you ca n’t find the dignity in your work , nobody can .
Whether you ’re propping up the corporate database , refactoring code , tweaking the e-commerce engine or writing user manuals it actually feels better if you ’re doing the work to the best of your ability or , better still , finding ways to stretch beyond your comfort zone .
A friend of mine was a PhD doing some very fulfilling high flying research work at a well - known university when she was lured away to do contract / compliance analysis at a big legal firm by doubling her salary .
People asked if she found this boring and she always said “ No , because I apply the same intellectual rigour to this work as I did to my university research so I get similar stimulation . ”
Plus she was a lot richer .
I doubt she ’ll be doing the contract work for the rest of her life but the point is , this is a very intelligent person choosing to do work that many people would find boring .
Instead of focusing on the boring aspects she focuses on the positive and ends up feeling stimulated and well - rewarded .
If you ’re not applying a similar positive approach to your work then you ’re falling into the old cliche : you ’re not part of the solution , you ’re part of the problem .
Step two to self fulfillment : identify the solutions yourself and then communicate , communicate , communicate .
If you feel that your manager has no idea how to improve the quality of work assigned to you , this likely has one of two sources : ( 1 ) They do n’t care about you and your quest for interesting work ( 2 ) They do n’t understand enough about your work to realise how it could be made more interesting for you .
So take charge : do n’t go to your manager with problems , go to them with solutions .
And do yourself a favour ; do n’t couch your solution in terms of how it will make your life better , say how it will benefit the company ( increased security / stability / profits are all good ) .
But these posts were meant to be pointing managers to what they should do .
So how can a manager decrease the angriness of CODE - IT staff by making their work more interesting ?
Listening is a good first step .
Encourage your underlings to explain their issues to you , then find a way to turn these issues to your mutual benefit .
Higher up the food chain , your focus should be on strategy rather than the nuts and bolts .
Focus on your strengths ( see how positive I ’m being ?
Assuming managers have strengths ! ) and ask your CODE - IT legions how their nuts - and - bolts expertise can help deliver on the big - picture strategy .
And just to repeat : LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY !
There are two absolutely poisonous things a manager can do in this scenario : ( 1 ) be two faced – ask for input with no intention of acting on it ( 2 ) come up with some totally inappropriate forced “ fun ” to make work more “ enjoyable ” .
On point one , you are far better off never engaging with CODE - IT workers on this topic than getting them to come forward with suggestion that you intend to ignore .
You may gleefully assume you have come up with a cunning way to appease their whining by making them think you are their friend or are listening to them .
They will see straight through this and know you are a lying sack of shit .
On point two , you ca n’t force something to be fun .
Forcing staff to go off on some “ team - building ” exercise can have two disastrous effects ; one , if they really do n’t want to spend time outside the office with cow - orkers you ’ll just make them more resentful and anti-social .
Two , if they actually have fun doing something that ’s totally unrelated to work you run the risk of simply highlighting how far away from fun work actually is .
Keep your motivational efforts focused on work .
Encourage people to socialise by all means but do n’t force it .
If your CODE - IT workers want to spend more time together , they ’ll do it without being forced .
Also , social events have nothing to do with making the actual work more interesting .
Enjoyable social events are part of the overall workplace environment as discussed in previous posts .
This is linked to but distinct from interesting , challenging and enjoyable work .
The important thing is to make decisions based on your individual business and staff needs .
Do n’t make sweeping generalisations about what work your CODE - IT staff will enjoy , engage them in the process .
The high - flying , fast paced world of dot - coms / Web2.0 / whatever the hell is coming next is not for everybody .
Some people are absolutely terrified by that sort of thing .
Including some of the best CODE - IT staff you may ever be lucky enough to find .
Not everybody who maintains mainframes is forced to – some people positively thrive on it .
Do your best to match the strengths of your staff to your business needs and you ’ll maximise both staff satisfaction and productivity .
Remember that ; with CODE - IT workers ( and almost everybody else ) , happiness and productivity almost always go hand in hand .
I ’ve worked for managers who clearly thrived on having angry underlings – if the staff were happy they must be getting away with something .
Any sort of decent human should want their staff to be as satisfied as possible in their work while meeting business needs .
That ’s somewhat intangible , but increased productivity – that you can explain at board meetings .
READ PART FIVE
Former civilizations here
The news in this book is that the New World was an old world .
It was far more populated , far more developed , far longer before the arrival of Columbus , then orthodox history believes .
Charles
Mann makes the best case yet , in non-technical prose , for the emerging archeological view that native Americans ( north and south ) had created vast cities and civilizations on a scale that dwarfed Europe at the time .
These bustling cities , not just in MesoAmerica , but in the Mississippi and the Amazon , were erased into invisibility ahead of settlers ( and textbooks ) by disease and environmental factors .
In scope this book is a good compliment to Jared Diamond ’s Guns Germs and Steel .
But 1491 heightens the discrepancy of development described by Diamond because now we see how far along American civilizations were before they unraveled on contact with the old world .

Excerpt
When I went to high school , in the 1970s , I was taught that Indians came to the Americas across the Bering Strait about thirteen thousand years ago , that they lived for the most part in small , isolated groups , and that they had so little impact on their environment that even after millennia of habitation the continents remained mostly wilderness .
Schools still impart the same ideas today .
One way to summarize the views of people like Erickson and Balee would be to say that they regard this picture of Indian life as wrong in almost every aspect .
Indians were here far longer than previously thought , these researchers believe , and in much greater numbers .
And they were so successful at imposing their will on the landscape that in 1492 Columbus set foot in a hemisphere thoroughly marked by humankind .
*
In 1501 , just nine years after Columbus 's first voyage , the Portuguese adventurer Gaspar Corte - Real abducted fifty - odd Indians from Maine .
Examining the captives , Corte - Real found to his astonishment that two were wearing items from Venice : a broken sword and two silver rings .
As James Axtell has noted , Corte - Real probably was able to kidnap such a large number of people only because the Indians were already so comfortable dealing with Europeans that big groups willingly came aboard his ship .
*
The British and French , many of whom had not taken a bath in their entire lives , were amazed by the Indian interest in personal cleanliness .
A Jesuit reported that the " savages " were disgusted by handkerchiefs : " They say , we place what is unclean in a fine white piece of linen , and put it away in our pockets as something very precious , while they throw it upon the ground . "
The Micmac in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia scoffed at the notion of European superiority .
If Christian civilization was so wonderful , why were its inhabitants all trying to settle somewhere else ?
*
It is true that European technology dazzled Native Americans on first encounter .
But the relative positions of the two sides were closer than commonly believed .
Contemporary research suggests that indigenous peoples in New England were not technologically inferior to the British -- or , rather that terms like " superior " and " inferior " do not readily apply to the relationship between Indian and European technology .
Guns are an example .
As Chaplin , the Harvard historian , has argued , New England Indians were indeed disconcerted by their first experiences with European guns : the explosion and smoke , the lack of a visible projectile .
But the natives soon learned that most of the British were terrible shots , from lack of practice -- their guns were little more than noisemakers .
Even for a crack shot , a seventeenth - century gun had fewer advantages over a longbow than my be supposed .
Colonists in Jamestown taunted the Powhatan in 1607 with a target they believed impervious of an arrow shot .
To the colonists ' dismay , an Indian sank an arrow into it a foot deep , " which was strange , being that a Pistoll could not pierce it . "
*
Utterly without fear , De Soto ignored the taunts and occasional volleys of arrows and poled over the river into what is now Eastern Arkansas , a land '" thickly set with great towns , " according to the account , " two or three of them to be seen from one . "
Each city protected itself with earthen walls , sizable moats , and deadeye archers .
In his brazen fashion , De Soto marched right in , demanded food , and marched out .
After De Soto left , no Europeans visited this part of the Mississippi Valley for more than a century .
Early in 1682 white people appeared again , this time Frenchmen in canoes .
In one seat was Rene - Robert Cavelier , Sieur de la Salle .
La Salle passed through the area where De Soto had found cities cheek by jowl .
It was deserted -- the French did n't see an Indian village for two hundred miles .
About fifty settlements existed in this strip of the Mississippi when De Soto showed up , according to Anne Ramenofsky , an archaeologist at the University of New Mexico .
By La Salle 's time the number had shrunk to perhaps ten , some probably inhabited by recent immigrants .
De Soto " had a privileged glimpse " of an Indian world , Hudson told me .
" The window opened and slammed shut .
When the French came in and the record opened up again , it was a transformed reality .
A civilization crumbled .
The question is , how did this happen ? "
*
The Caddo had a taste for monumental architecture ; public plazas , ceremonial platforms , mausoleums .
After De Soto's army left the Caddo stopped erecting community centers and began digging community cemeteries .
Between the visits of De Soto and La Salle , according to Timothy K. Perttula , an archaeological consultant in Austin , Texas , the Caddoan population fell from about 200,000 to about 8,500 -- a drop of nearly 96 percent .
In the eighteenth century , the tally shrank further , to 1,400 .
An equivalent loss today would reduce the population of New York City to 56,000 , not enough to fill Yankee Stadium .
" That 's one reason whites think of Indians as nomadic hunters " Russell , an anthropologist at the University of California at Los Angeles , said to me .
" Everything else - - all the heavily populated urbanized societies -- was wiped out . "
The bra can heat to the same level as domestic heaters
The fluffy creation contains special pads filled with an eco-friendly gel that can be easily heated in a microwave or with a hot water bottle .
The design also includes a furry boa designed to double as a winter scarf .
Lingerie giant Triumph unveiled the bra months after PM Junichiro Koizumi urged Japan 's office workers to ditch ties to save on air conditioning .
Being padded , the new bra packs a little more bulk than most regular designs , but the Japanese arm of Triumph insisted the look was more chic than sheep .
" We hope this will not only help prevent global warming but also provide a little fashion chic to the office , " the company said in a statement .
The bra , which comes only in white , also features a pendant shaped like a chilli pepper dangling on its front .
Environmental support
The bra comes with matching shorts , but is not being offered for general sale .
Instead the set is being viewed as a prototype product , the first step towards mass - producing eco-friendly clothing .
Japan 's government is encouraging people not to set their domestic heating higher than 20 C this winter , to reduce fuel consumption and conserve energy stocks .
During the summer , Mr Koizumi surprised Japan 's traditionally well - dressed office workers by discarding his tie and urging his countrymen to do the same .
The drive to reduce air - conditioning use and thus greenhouse gas emissions was estimated to have saved enough power to supply 240,000 homes for a month .
Summary : Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources .
The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford .
Some people think that usability is very costly and complex and that user tests should be reserved for the rare web design project with a huge budget and a lavish time schedule .
Not true .
Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources .
The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford .
In earlier research , Tom Landauer and I showed that the number of usability problems found in a usability test with n users is :
N ( 1 -( 1- L ) n )
where N is the total number of usability problems in the design and L is the proportion of usability problems discovered while testing a single user .
The typical value of L is 31 % , averaged across a large number of projects we studied .
Plotting the curve for L =31 % gives the following result :
The most striking truth of the curve is that zero users give zero insights .
As soon as you collect data from a single test user , your insights shoot up and you have already learned almost a third of all there is to know about the usability of the design .
The difference between zero and even a little bit of data is astounding .
When you test the second user , you will discover that this person does some of the same things as the first user , so there is some overlap in what you learn .
People are definitely different , so there will also be something new that the second user does that you did not observe with the first user .
So the second user adds some amount of new insight , but not nearly as much as the first user did .
The third user will do many things that you already observed with the first user or with the second user and even some things that you have already seen twice .
Plus , of course , the third user will generate a small amount of new data , even if not as much as the first and the second user did .
As you add more and more users , you learn less and less because you will keep seeing the same things again and again .
There is no real need to keep observing the same thing multiple times , and you will be very motivated to go back to the drawing board and redesign the site to eliminate the usability problems .
After the fifth user , you are wasting your time by observing the same findings repeatedly but not learning much new .
Iterative Design
The curve clearly shows that you need to test with at least 15 users to discover all the usability problems in the design .
So why do I recommend testing with a much smaller number of users ?
The main reason is that it is better to distribute your budget for user testing across many small tests instead of blowing everything on a single , elaborate study .
Let us say that you do have the funding to recruit 15 representative customers and have them test your design .
Great .
Spend this budget on 3 studies with 5 users each !
You want to run multiple tests because the real goal of usability engineering is to improve the design and not just to document its weaknesses .
After the first study with five participants has found 85 % of the usability problems , you will want to fix these problems in a redesign .
After creating the new design , you need to test again .
Even though I said that the redesign should " fix " the problems found in the first study , the truth is that you think that the new design overcomes the problems .
But since nobody can design the perfect user interface , there is no guarantee that the new design does in fact fix the problems .
A second test will discover whether the fixes worked or whether they did n't .
Also , in introducing a new design , there is always the risk of introducing a new usability problem , even if the old one did get fixed .
Also , the second study with 5 users will discover most of the remaining 15 % of the original usability problems that were not found in the first round of testing .
( There will still be 2 % of the original problems left — they will have to wait until the third study to be identified . )
Finally , the second study will be able to probe deeper into the usability of the fundamental structure of the site , assessing issues like information architecture , task flow , and match with user needs .
These important issues are often obscured in initial studies where the users are stumped by stupid surface - level usability problems that prevent them from really digging into the site .
So the second study will both serve as quality assurance of the outcome of the first study and help provide deeper insights as well .
The second study will always lead to a new ( but smaller ) list of usability problems to fix in a redesign .
And the same insight applies to this redesign : not all the fixes will work ; some deeper issues will be uncovered after cleaning up the interface .
Thus , a third study is needed as well .
The ultimate user experience is improved much more by 3 studies with 5 users each than by a single monster study with 15 users .
Why Not Test With a Single User ?
You might think that 15 studies with a single user would be even better than 3 studies with 5 users .
The curve does show that we learn much more from the first user than from any subsequent users , so why keep going ?
Two reasons :
There is always a risk of being misled by the spurious behavior of a single person who may perform certain actions by accident or in an unrepresentative manner .
Even 3 users are enough to get an idea of the diversity in user behavior and insight into what 's unique and what can be generalized .
The cost - benefit analysis of user testing provides the optimal ratio around 3 or 5 users , depending on the style of testing .
There is always a fixed initial cost associated with planning and running a study : it is better to depreciate this start - up cost across the findings from multiple users .
When To Test More Users
You need to test additional users when a website has several highly distinct groups of users .
The formula only holds for comparable users who will be using the site in fairly similar ways .
If , for example , you have a site that will be used by both children and parents , then the two groups of users will have sufficiently different behavior that it becomes necessary to test with people from both groups .
The same would be true for a system aimed at connecting purchasing agents with sales staff .
Even when the groups of users are very different , there will still be great similarities between the observations from the two groups .
All the users are human , after all .
Also , many of the usability problems are related to the fundamental way people interact with the Web and the influence from other sites on user behavior .
In testing multiple groups of disparate users , you do n't need to include as many members of each group as you would in a single test of a single group of users .
The overlap between observations will ensure a better outcome from testing a smaller number of people in each group .
I recommend :
3 –4 users from each category if testing two groups of users
3 users from each category if testing three or more groups of users ( you always want at least 3 users to ensure that you have covered the diversity of behavior within the group )

Lately I 've been noticing the spread of a meme regarding " Dunbar 's Number " of 150 that I believe is misunderstanding of his ideas .
The Science of Dunbar 's Number
Dunbar is an anthropologist at the University College of London , who wrote a paper on Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size , Group Size And Language In Humans where he hypothesizes :
... there is a cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships , that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size , and that this in turn limits group size ... the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained .
Dunbar supports this hypothesis through studies by a number of field anthropologists .
These studies measure the group size of a variety of different primates ;
Dunbar then correlate those group sizes to the brain sizes of the primates to produce a mathematical formula for how the two correspond .
Using his formula , which is based on 36 primates , he predicts that 147.8 is the " mean group size " for humans , which matches census data on various village and tribe sizes in many cultures .
The following chart shows the distribution produced by Dunbar 's analysis :
Source : Boston Consulting Group
This number of 150 has become " Dunbar 's Number " and has been popularized by various very popular business books such as Malcolm Gladwell 's The Tipping Point : How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference ( summary ) , Duncan J. Watts ' Six Degrees : The Science of a Connected Age ( review ) and Small Worlds : The Dynamics of Networks between Order and Randomness ( review ) , and Mark Buchanan 's Nexus : Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks ( review ) , the ideas from which are the foundation of the various Social Network Services that I 've discussed elsewhere in this blog .
Revisiting Dunbar's Number
Lately , Dunbar 's number has been taken as a mean size for online networks and groups , as shown in Ross Mayfield 's Weblog , where he states :
Network Size Description Distribution Political Network ~1000s
Blogs as mass media Power - law ( scale - free ) Social Network ~ 150 Blogging Classic Bell - curve ( random ) Creative Network ~ 12 Blogs as dinner conversation Dense ( equal )
However , Dunbar 's work itself suggests that a community size of 150 will not be a mean for a community unless it is highly incentivized to remain together .
We can see hints of this in Dunbar 's description of the number and what it means :
The group size predicted for modern humans by equation ( 1 ) would require as much as 42 % of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming .
...
My suggestion , then , is that language evolved as a " cheap " form of social grooming , so enabling the ancestral humans to maintain the cohesion of the unusually large groups demanded by the particular conditions they faced at the time .
Dunbar 's theory is that this 42 % number would be true for humans if humans had not invented language , a " cheap " form of social grooming .
However , it does show that for a group to sustain itself at the size of 150 , significantly more effort must be spent on the core socialization which is necessary to keep the group functioning .
Some organizations will have sufficient incentive to maintain this high level of required socialization .
In fact the traditional villages and historical military troop sizes that Dunbar analyzed are probably the best examples of such an incentive , since they were built upon the raw need for survival .
However , this is a tremendous amount of effort for a group if it 's trying not just to maintain cohesion , but also to get something done .
Furthermore , Dunbar specifically restricts himself to physically close groups :
... we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal .
In dispersed societies , individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each , so group sizes should be smaller in consequence .
My anecdotal evidence generally seems to support the idea that group sizes will usually plateau at a number lower than 150 participants .
This comes from 20 years of doing facilitation both on and offline , running several software companies , and running various forums at America Online .
In particular , many online communities provide good evidence for Dunbar 's Number actually being an upper limit ( either due to reduced efficiency or due to increased dispersion ) .
Ultima Online provides one of the best examples of what sizes an online community will support because it's well documented and the overall game size is large enough to generate many smaller communities .
If you look at Raph Koster 's statistics for the size of groups in Ultima Online , you will see a definite point of diminishing returns at around 150 ; however , you will also see that most groups are around 60 large .
Jessica Mulligan , executive producer at Turbine Games , confirmed these numbers to me :
The numbers match up with my ( currently ) mostly anecdotal evidence for Asheron 's Call .
We have allegiances in the hundreds and even thousands of members , but most of those members are inactive , non-participatory in the group on a regular basis or are mule accounts for farming XP .
It is rare to have more than 40 or so active participants in an Allegiance .
I 've seen similar limits myself in some of the small online games that Skotos produces .
For instance , in Castle Marrach , which is a social - dominant game ( i.e. like a MUSH ) , the game grew quickly until we reached approximately 150 - 200 active users .
However , whenever it grew beyond that number , it always seemed that politics and dissatisfaction would bubble up such that people would drop out , leaving us back close to 150 or 160 .
( That we would ever exceed 150 is a bit of a surprise , but I think it 's due to any number of factors , including a variable 24 - hour user base , wherein on a given day we might only see a little more then half of our community members , below Dunbar 's Number , and only get up to close to 200 or so over a full week . )
We have had some games at Skotos that do manage to overcome Dunbarrian social limits , prime among them The Eternal City which regularly exceeds the Marrach community by more then double .
However , TEC is a much more achievement - oriented game , meaning that people spend much of their time interacting with the environment -- fighting monsters and training skills as it happens -- rather than directly interacting with other players all the time .
Thus social limits become less important .
Other online communities that I 've had experience with have been more traditional , and thus more closely met my expectations for Dunbar 's Number acting as a limit rather than a mean .
When I managed the Mac Developer 's Forum community on AOL , a forum would start to break down when it reached about 80 active contributors , requiring a forum split before continued growth could occur .
Wikis provide another good example ; the WikiPedia , one of the largest active Wikis online , appears to have hovered at approximately 150 - 175 active administrators for over a year , in spite of a huge growth in usage during the same period .
These numbers just keep coming up .
This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival - oriented groups , such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25 - 80 , but is best around 45 - 50 .
Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time " grooming " to keep group cohesion , rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product , learn a technology , promote a meme , or have fun playing a game .
Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you do n't have requisite variety .
Thus Dana Boyd gets it right when she uses the word MAXIMUM in her eTech Talk , not average or mean :
[ Dunbar ] found that the MAXIMUM number of people that a person could keep up with socially at any given time , gossip maintenance , was 150 .
This does n't mean that people do n't have 150 people in their social network , but that they only keep tabs on 150 people max at any given point .
Expanding Dunbar 's Numbers
To open up the discussion a bit , I 'd also hypothesize that Dunbar 's Number is just one datapoint in an overall equation describing what group sizes work and what do n't .
Working our way up from the smallest group sizes , I think we can find many break points , both above and below Dunbar 's Number of 150 .
In my experience the smallest viable group size seems to be somewhere in the range of 5 to 9 .
Looking smaller , we see that a group of 2 can be tremendously creative ( ask any parent ) , but often has insufficient resources and thus requires deep commitment by both parties .
Notably , often the difficulty of a 2 - person business partnership is compared to that of a marriage .
A group of 3 is often unstable , with one person feeling left out , or else one person controlling the others by being the " split " vote .
A group of 4 often devolves into two pairs .
In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of " team " really starts .
At 5 to 8 people , you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing , and everyone feels highly empowered .
However , at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough " attention " is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy , too boring , too long , or some combination thereof .
Although I 've been unable to find the source , I 've heard of some references to a study from the 1950s that says that the optimum size for a committee is 7 .
Likewise , it 's fairly easy for us to see and agree that a dinner party starts to break down somewhere above 7 or 8 people , as do also tabletop games of both the strategic ( I prefer 5 ) and role - playing varieties ( I prefer 7 ) .
These size limits can be overcome , but require increased amounts of " grooming " .
The chasm that starts somewhere between 9 to 12 people can be especially daunting for a small business .
As you grow past 12 or so employees , you must start specializing and having departments and direct reports ; however , you are not quite large enough for this to be efficient , and thus much employee time that you put toward management tasks is wasted .
Only as you approach and pass 25 people does having simple departments and managers begin to work again , as it starts to really make sense for department heads to spend significant time just communicating and coordinating ( and as individual departments become large enough to once again allow for the dynamic exchange of ideas that had previously occurred in the original 5 - 9 member seed group ) .
I 've already noted the next chasm when you go beyond 80 people , which I think is the point that Dunbar 's Number actually marks for a non-survival oriented group .
Even at this lower point , the noise level created by required socialization becomes an issue , and filtering becomes essential .
As you approach 150 this begins to be unmanageable .
Once a company grows past 200 you are really starting to need middle - management , but often you can't afford it yet .
Only when you get up past that , maybe at 350 - 500 people , does middle - management start really working , primarily because you 've once again segmented your original departments , possibly again reducing them to Dunbar - sized groups .
The following chart shows anecdotal satisfaction ratings for these lower group sizes :
Much of this is probably predicted by Dunbar 's model , if you add in the non-survival and dispursed community modifiers that I discuss here .
Essentially , as we increase group sizes beyond 80 , to 150 , 200 , or even 350 - 500 , we typically do so by breaking larger groups down into smaller ones , and continually reducing community sizes down to the point where they can be understood and managed by people -- and so efficiency reasserts itself .

Correction Appended
Each day since Katrina brings more evidence of the lethal ineptitude of federal officials .
I 'm not letting state and local officials off the hook , but federal officials had access to resources that could have made all the difference , but were never mobilized .
Here 's one of many examples : The Chicago Tribune reports that the U.S.S. Bataan , equipped with six operating rooms , hundreds of hospital beds and the ability to produce 100,000 gallons of fresh water a day , has been sitting off the Gulf Coast since last Monday -- without patients .
Experts say that the first 72 hours after a natural disaster are the crucial window during which prompt action can save many lives .
Yet action after Katrina was anything but prompt .
Newsweek reports that a " strange paralysis " set in among Bush administration officials , who debated lines of authority while thousands died .
What caused that paralysis ?
President Bush certainly failed his test .
After 9/11 , all the country really needed from him was a speech .
This time it needed action -- and he did n't deliver .

Bloggers may find a pseudonym is not enough to preserve anonymity
Catherine - who blogged anonymously under the pseudonym " Petite Anglaise " about life , love and work - has now launched a test case under French employment law .
She claims she was dismissed from accounting firm Dixon Wilson for bringing the company into disrepute , despite never naming it in her diary .
The firm has not commented .
Since Catherine - who told anecdotes about office life and admitted lying to take time off - announced the legal case on her blog site , more than 200 readers have posted messages of support .
Her story is far from unique in the blogosphere .
Hazy guidelines
Delta Air Lines attendant Ellen Simonetti , known as Queen of the Sky , has brought legal action in the US after she lost her job apparently for posting " inappropriate images " of herself wearing company uniform .
Ellen Simonetti ran into trouble after posing in her uniform for her blog
In the UK , Joe Gordon was sacked by bookseller Waterstones for " bringing the company into disrepute " after mentioning his boss in his satirical blog , the Woolamaloo Gazette .
And the experience of Heather Armstrong , a US web designer fired in 2002 for writing about a former employer on her blog , Dooce , led to a new term being coined : people sacked for blogging talk of being " dooced " .
Blog sites have even compiled lists of dozens of " blogophobic " companies alleged to have sacked staff over their online journals .
With guidelines hazy on where the line can be drawn between an individual 's private online writings and their public work persona , more such cases can be expected .
' Respect the law '
So how should individuals - and companies - pick their way safely through the potential minefield of blogging ?
Struan Robertson , a technology lawyer for Pinsent Masons and editor of Out - Law.com , a website offering legal advice on internet issues , admits it is a difficult path to tread .
TOP TIPS FOR SAFE BLOGGING
Remember you can never be entirely sure who is reading Do n't rely on a pseudonym to preserve anonymity
Be aware of the dangers of defamation Respect copyright and intellectual property laws Avoid jokes which could provoke a sexual or racial harassment claim
" It needs to bring out someone 's personality - and that means keeping the legal department at arm 's length . "
To this end , bloggers must avoid defamation , respect copyright and take care not to spill trade secrets .
" A blogger could unwittingly knock millions off a company 's value by making a market announcement in a blog exchange , " Mr Robertson points out .
One problem is that bloggers writing personal journals , as opposed to blogging on their company 's site , often believe using a pseudonym will be enough to protect their own - and their employer 's - anonymity .
However , many firms take the view that a member of staff recognisable in any way will be seen by readers as representing the company .
Catherine , who was identified through a photo , told AFP : " In the dismissal letter they told me I had brought the company into disrepute , but I never once referred to it or the people there by name . "
Much of her journal is devoted to tales of her relationship with " Mr Frog " , father of her three - year - old daughter " Tadpole " , and home life - with only occasional light - hearted references to her workplace .
Different faces
Amanda Lenhart , of the Pew Internet and American Life Project , says a survey of US bloggers released this week has found that most are focused on describing their own life and experiences .
What we might say to our mother or best friend is very different to what we might say to our boss - and a blog does n't let you change that persona

Many also assume their blog is read only by people they know .
" The real problem is that we present ourselves differently to different people , " Ms Lenhart says .
" What we might say to our mother or best friend is very different to what we might say to our boss - and a blog does n't let you change that persona . "
Some 55 % of an estimated 12 m US bloggers use a pseudonym " so they can be a little more free in what they say " , she says , but problems come if the connection is made between their online and offline lives .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , a website supporting bloggers ' legal rights , has published detailed tips on how to stay anonymous and advises against blogging in work time .
But , it warns , increasing scrutiny means " you can no longer safely assume that people in your offline life wo n't find out about your blog , if you ever could " .
' Do n't over - react '
Of course , another approach is to be open about who you work for and write " sensibly " , says Mr Robertson .
Not all companies are against blogging - in fact some see it as an effective PR tool , giving a human face to their firm , and encourage staff to write by providing server space .
But Mr Robertson has a word of warning : companies must set out their blogging policy clearly .
Computer services firm IBM - where more than 3,000 employees have now set up a blog - consulted the company 's own blogging community before drawing up its guidelines .
" If you publish a blog ... use a disclaimer , " is one of the firm 's 10 principles .
Another tells writers : " Do n't pick fights . "
And if a member of staff does raise hackles by criticising their boss ?
" The employer needs to be careful , " warns Mr Robertson .
" The employee has to understand that they are breaking the rules - and the employer should n't just sack them ... or they could face a claim for unfair dismissal . "
Companies and bloggers may watch the case brought by Petite Anglaise - due before a French employment tribunal later this year - with interest .
It is every traveller 's nightmare - to be stuck in a snowstorm just as the flight is about to take off .
But on Thursday one desperate passenger aboard British Airways flight 981 from Berlin to Heathrow decided to take matters into his own hands .
After more than four hours stranded on the runway of Berlin 's snow - encrusted Tegel airport , the disgruntled passenger phoned German police demanding that they come and rescue him .
The captain had refused his requests to get off , he explained , leaving him with no choice but to dial 110 - Germany 's equivalent of 999 .
The BA flight was originally due to take off at 7.38 am , officials at Tegel said yesterday .
But with the heaviest snowfall of the year , the plane was forced to turn back to the terminal building when the runway briefly shut .
Three passengers got off at this stage .
The pilot then decided to make another attempt at takeoff , only to find himself repeatedly stranded after clearing the airport 's de-icing machine .
It was at this point that the passenger called police , officials said , saying he was being held against his will .
Detectives called the control tower and ordered the pilot to turn back .
Seven more passengers then disembarked , including the man who had raised the emergency .
Waiting police then interviewed them , establishing nobody had been kidnapped .
The flight finally took off at 2.38 pm , airport spokesman Ralf Kunkel said - seven hours late .
Yesterday BA officials voiced irritation that the unnamed passenger , who had no luggage with him , had not got off earlier .
" By calling police he delayed the flight even more , " a BA spokesperson said .
Women told that female under - achievement in mathematics is due to genetic factors perform much worse on maths tests than those told that social factors are responsible .
These new findings could have serious implications not only for the way the subject is taught in schools , but for public discussions about genetic influences on behaviour .
It may also inform debates about why women are under - represented in university mathematics and science departments .
The question of whether there might be gender differences in mathematical ability remains contentious .
Earlier this year , Lawrence Summers , then president of Harvard University , Massachusetts , US , resigned in response to an outcry over his speculation on the topic .
He said one reason women are under - represented in science and engineering jobs could be because of a “ different availability of aptitude at the high end ” .

Serious impact
“ As our research demonstrates , just hearing about that sort of idea is enough to negatively affect women ’s performance , and reproduce the stereotype that is out there , ” says Steven Heine at the University of British Columbia , Canada , who led the new study .
Whether true or not , the stereotype of innate sex differences does exist in mathematics departments , and it can have a serious impact , agrees Peter Hall at the Mathematical Sciences Institute at the Australian National University in Canberra , and president of the Australian Mathematical Society .
“ It can be very forbidding for a young woman to come up against that generalisation – and that ’s one of the environmental factors that has kept women out of not just maths but science , ” he says .
Nature or nurture ?
Heine and colleague Ilan Dar - Nimrod told 220 women that there are definite sex differences in maths performance .
One group was then told that genetic factors were the cause .
Another group was told that experiences with studying maths were responsible – that women do worse than men because of the way their teachers interacted with them in elementary school , for instance .
The impact on subsequent mathematics tests was pronounced , with the “ genes ” group getting about half as many correct answers as the “ experiential ” group .
“ Experiential accounts make people think they can overcome those experiences , ” says Heine .
“ Whereas the ‘ genes ’ group think of genes as the core of themselves , so ask : how can I overcome this , when this is part of who I am ? ”
Interest levels
The media , and sometimes scientists , are often guilty of over - simplifying the influence of genes on behaviour , he says , which can compound this deterministic view .
“ We have to ask : are there ways of communicating genetic accounts of behaviour that do n’t yield these sorts of results – and that ’s something we want to pursue , ” he says .
When it comes to female under- representation in university maths departments , one reason could be sex differences not in ability but interest , Hall suggests .
In general , women tend to be more interested in applied rather than pure maths , and as maths departments increase the number of applied posts , the number of women being appointed is also rising , he notes .
But look for reasons for those differences in interest , and you are back at the nature versus nurture debate .
“ Partly , it has to do with what society says , even very subtly , about what women should or should not be involved in , ” Hall says .

Earlier today I ran a simple test of Erlang ’s process creation and teardown code , resulting in a rough figure of 350,000 process creations and teardowns per second .
Attempting a similar workload in Java gives a figure of around 11,000 thread creations and teardowns per second – to my mind , a clear demonstration of one of the main advantages of Erlang ’s extremely lightweight processes .
Here ’s the Java code I used – see the earlier post for the Erlang code , to compare :
// Java 5 – uses a Blocking Queue .

While same day loans all share the fact that they aim to get the money into your account the same day as you apply , there are numerous different types of these loans currently on offer .
The same day loans can differ regarding how you receive the money , how much you borrow , whether you need a guarantor or not and of course how long you want to repay the money back .
One such loan that has grown in popularity is same day payday loans .
Featuring very short repayment periods ; often less than one year , these loans are available online and are usually paid out in just minutes once an application has been approved .
Therefore , if you are looking for a payday loan with same day payout , we can help .
Because you have so much freedom regarding how much you borrow and for how long , you will be able to create a same day loan that enables you to get the money you require and repay it back in affordable instalments over a period of your choosing .
While many lenders will offer similar interest rates , there will be some differences in how much you pay back .
Such factors include how much you borrow , your credit profile , and of course how long you want to borrow the money .
While you will pay less back in total if you repay the loan quickly , this must always be balanced by whether you can afford the higher repayments as late repayments can seriously impact you through charges and negative marks on your credit score .
There ’s a poster on the wall of an Islamic dress shop in East London showing a young woman in a black hijab .
Above her is the word “ Pure . ”
The saleswoman who is helping me also has a scarf covering her head .
I ’m here to buy a hijab too — but that ’s not all .
I ’m here for the full Islamic covering , the complete three - piece suit : the hijab that I will wrap around my head , the shapeless robe known as an abaya , and the now - terribly - controversial niqab — a square of material that goes over one ’s face with a slit of about five inches for my eyes .
I buy it for $ 73 and take it all home , but I do n’t put it on until the next morning .
When I do , I see myself for the first time in full Islamic dress — and I ’m horrified .
I have disappeared , and somebody I do n’t recognize is looking back at me .
I cannot tell how old she is , how much she weighs , whether she has a kind face or a sad face .
Even my own mother could n’t recognize me .
I ’ve seen this shrouded figure in news reports from the mountains of Afghanistan and the cities of Saudi Arabia , but she looks out of place here in my bedroom in West London .
In fact , I feel so dissociated from my own reflection that it takes me over an hour to pluck up the courage to leave the house .
I ’ve never worn the niqab before .
Growing up in a Muslim household in Bradford , a city in the north of England , in the 1970s and ‘ 80s , I dressed modestly .
But my hair was only covered in the presence of the imam and while I was reading the Koran .
Today , however , things have changed .
I see second - and third - generation British Muslims concealed in black .
They say they wear the niqab voluntarily , to demonstrate their dedication to Allah and to protect them from male eyes .
In recent weeks , this dress code has become the focus of an intense debate that has gripped Britain .
It began when Jack Straw , a former British foreign secretary and member of Parliament for Blackburn ( a town with a high percentage of Muslims ) started the ball rolling .
He revealed that he asks Muslim women to remove their veils when they visit him because it makes him feel uncomfortable .
These comments were , needless to say , incendiary , and Prime Minister Tony Blair added to the controversy when he described the item of clothing as a “ mark of separation . ”
As I head onto the street , it takes just seconds for me to become the object of attention .
I quickly discover that there are different categories of stares .
The one favored by elderly people is to glare directly ; women wait until you ’ve passed and then turn around when they think you ca n’t see ; men look out of the corner of their eyes , and children just stare , point and laugh blatantly .
I ’m having coffee with a friend .
I ’m finding it hard to breathe .
There is no inlet for air ( although the material itself is somewhat porous ) , and I can feel the heat of every breath I exhale .
Plus the slit for my eyes keeps slipping down , so I can barely see a thing .
My peripheral vision is obscured , as if I were stuck in a car that is completely buried in snow with only a tiny sliver of clean windscreen .
I ca n’t fathom a way of drinking my cappuccino , and when I become aware that everybody in the coffee shop is staring at me , wondering how I ’m going to do it , I give up .
At the supermarket , a baby no more than 2 years old takes one look at me and bursts into tears .
After a few hours , I get used to the gaping and the sniggering .
But what does surprise me is what happens when I head into central London .
I have arranged to meet a friend at the National Portrait Gallery .
In the 15 - minute walk from the bus stop to the gallery , two things happen .
A man in his 30s stops in front of me and asks : “ Can I see your face ? ”
“ Why do you want to see my face ? ” I ask .
“ Because I want to see if you are pretty .
Are you pretty ? ”
Before I can reply , he shouts : “ You ---- ing tease ! ”
I ’m completely taken aback .
Just as I ’m thinking about this , I hear the impatient beeping of a horn .
A middle - aged man is behind the wheel of a van , leering at me .
“ Watch where you ’re going , you stupid Paki ! ” he screams .
This time I ’m a bit faster .
“ How did you know I ’m Pakistani , underneath all of this ? ” I shout at him .
He responds by driving so close past me that when he yells “ Terrorist ! ” I can feel his breath on my veil .
Things do n’t get much better at the National Portrait Gallery .
Art lovers pay as much attention to me as they do to the paintings .
I might as well be one of the exhibits .
Maybe they ’re trying to come to grips with the irony of a faceless woman staring at faces .
I float from room to room , like some apparition , looking at paintings of Queen Anne and Mary II .
They ’re in extravagant ermines and taffetas , and their ample bosoms are on display .
All I can think is that if all women dressed in the niqab , how sad and how strange this place would be .
I miss seeing my own face , my own shape .
Yet at the same time I feel completely naked .
The women I have met who have taken to wearing the niqab tell me that it gives them confidence , but I find that it saps mine .
Nobody has forced me to wear it , but I feel as though I have oppressed myself and isolated myself .
Maybe I ’d feel more comfortable being so covered if I were among women who dress in a similar fashion ?
I head to the Central Mosque in Regents Park .
Hundreds of women are seated on the floor .
I look up and down the lines of worshipers .
Of course the women here have their heads covered , but I am the only person wearing the niqab .
Everyone else ’s face is visible .
The woman next to me explains that the niqab is seen as “ extreme . ”
“ Allah gave us faces , and we should not hide them , ” she says .
I ’m reassured by her words .
I think deep down my anxiety about having to wear the niqab , even for a day , was based on guilt — that I am not a true Muslim unless I cover myself from head to toe .
But the Koran says : “ Allah has given you clothes to cover your shameful parts , and garments pleasing to the eye .
But the finest of all these is the robe of piety . ”
I do n’t understand the need of women to wear something as severe as the niqab .
But for that tiny number that do , I will shake their gloved hands for bearing this endurance task — the staring , the swearing and the discomfort .
On the streets of London , the black veil does nothing to distract attention — and everything to attract it .

Out at the Wanapum Dam on the Columbia River , a new turbine is being tested that generates more electricity , but wo n't kill so many fish – thanks to research dollars from Uncle Sam .
Down in California 's Long Valley , on the Sierra Nevada range , federal researchers are working to boost efficiency of geothermal energy , which uses the earth 's natural heat to generate power .
But renewable energy advocates may have to kiss goodbye those and other research projects .
The US Department of Energy ( DOE ) is quitting the hydropower and geothermal power research business – if Congress will let it .
Declaring them " mature technologies " that need no further funding , the Bush administration in its FY 2007 budget request eliminates hydropower and geothermal research , venerable programs with roots in the energy crises of the 1970s .
" What we do well is research and funding of new , novel technologies , " says Craig Stevens , chief spokesman for the DOE .
" From a policy perspective , geothermal and hydro are mature technologies .
We believe the market can take the lead on this at this point . "
Still , " zeroing out " such research could end up being a penny - wise , pound - foolish move , some energy advocates say .
Any savings from the cuts would be nil since all of the nearly $ 24 million ( $ 1 million from hydropower and $ 23 million from geothermal ) research funding would go to other programs such as biofuels .
" I 'm just astonished the department would zero out these very small existing budgets for geothermal and hydro – it makes no sense at all , " says V. John White , executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies , an environmental group based in Sacramento , Calif .
" These are very important resources for our energy future that could replace the need for a lot of coal - fired power plants . "
Indeed , the costs of lost opportunities from dropping such research could be enormous in the long run , recent federal studies suggest .
Geothermal is a case in point .
Its power plants need water , heat , and permeable rocks no deeper than about three miles beneath the surface to generate affordable electricity , says Karl Gawell , executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association , a Washington trade group .
Today more than 60 geothermal plants with the capacity of about three big coal - fired power plants produce less than 1 percent of the nation 's electricity .
Yet geothermal holds vast potential – at least 30,000 megawatts of identified resources developable by 2050 and more unidentified resources , much of it in Western states , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported in May .
Research aims at new technologies that can use underground zones with good heat but little water and those with lower temperature rocks deeper in the earth .
" The idea that geothermal is a mature technology that does n't need further research does n't even pass the laugh test , " says Mr. Gawell .
" What they 're saying is that if your program does n't have to do with biofuels , wind , or solar , you wo n't have a program . "
Meanwhile , the more than 5,400 potential " small hydro " power projects could produce about 20,000 megawatts of power , a DOE study in January found .
And most would require no new dams at all , shunting a portion of a small river 's flow to one side to make electricity .
Others would add turbines to dams that do n't have them yet .
Together , high - tech hydropower and geothermal resources could contribute at least enough power to replace more than 100 medium - size coal - fired power plants with emissions - free electricity – about the number now on the drawing board .
There have been moves in the Senate to restore DOE funding for geothermal , but far less support in the House , leaving uncertainty about the outcome , Gawell says .
For hydropower , matters are worse .
Though $ 4 million in funding has been proposed in the Senate , nothing has emerged from the House , observers say .
" There 's this view that hydropower is a technology that 's been around a long time , and there 's not much more we can do to improve it – but we 've got the next generation of hydropower – ocean , tidal , wave and conduit energy coming on , " says Linda Church Ciocci , executive director of the National Hydropower Association , a Washington trade group .
Even those focused on environmental damage from dams worry about lost funding .
" We 'd like to see federal funding continue for new research on hydrokinetic systems and damless hydro , " says Robbin Marks , director of the hydropower reform campaign at American Rivers , a Washington environmental group .
" We 're interested in understanding more about the environmental impact of those systems . "
Power from tidal flows , waves , and irrigation canals are expanding the definition of hydropower – none of which are likely to get DOE research funding if the hydropower budget gets whacked , some observers say .
Others remain skeptical .
" I find myself agreeing with the DOE argument that hydropower is a mature technology , " says Jerry Taylor , the Cato Institute 's director of Natural Resource Studies .
" If there 's economic merit to this area , then venture capitalists will put their money into it . "
But that kind of waiting game would be a shame , says Trey Taylor , cofounder and president of Verdant Power in Arlington , Va .
Two weeks ago his company received venture capital funding for its program .
Next month , Verdant will deploy its first two underwater turbines in New York City 's East River , the first step in an experimental technology that attempts to harness the tidal currents to create power .
But more firms would be competing to get into tidal power today – if the government shouldered more of the environmental research costs , Mr. Taylor says .
The current high cost of researching areas such as a technology 's environmental impact makes it likely that a company will fail .
He and his partners remortgaged their homes and begged friends for funds .
" I can understand the tight situation DOE is in , " he says .
" But what they 're not seeing is that a whole new breed of technology has come on right now .
The push for sustainable power is sweeping the globe . "
Picture the scene :
You walk into a chic bar where the clientele is young and the drinks reassuringly expensive ; you note the stylish combinations of red and white furniture , the impressive attention to detail that goes into everything from the cushions to the ashtrays .
Suddenly , inexplicably , you urgently want to smoke a Marlboro cigarette .
It sounds the stuff of bad science fiction , but Philip Morris , the manufacturer of Marlboro , is such a believer in ' experiential ' marketing - where furniture and design are used to subtly convey a brand 's strengths - it has created a crack team to transform the insides of Britain 's upmarket bars and music events , in an attempt to boost its profits .
As a smoking ban in England nears and tobacco advertising has been banned , cigarette companies have had to find other ways to sell their products .
Internal marketing plans , drawn up by the company last year and obtained by The Observer , show that Philip Morris offered financial incentives to managers to fill their bars with furniture bearing the Marlboro logo or place its branded ashtrays and vending machines in areas where smoking is allowed .
' Should you take up this offer [ of ashtrays ] , Philip Morris will give you a £ 20 music voucher from HMV as a token of their thanks , ' the marketing teams were instructed to tell the managers .
The company also experimented with subliminal ways of communicating its brand , through themed bar areas which could be put up at major social events , and did not feature the Marlboro logo or its packaging .
These ' installations ' , as they were called , created lounge areas by placing comfortable red sofas in front of video screens showing scenes redolent of Wild West ' Marlboro country ' to convey the essence of the cigarette brand while circumnavigating sponsorship bans .
One plan Philip Morris experimented with was the use of ' chill out ' smoking areas .
These featured a sofa shaped like a bath , to give the impression it was an area in which smokers could relax , subtly suggesting cigarettes help people deal with stress .
' Philip Morris would pay for the installation - known as the Marlboro Motel - to be erected .
That way the company could say they were paying for the right to sell cigarettes rather than sponsoring an event , ' said one person familiar with the installations .
Experts said the company was not alone in trying to find new ways to communicate its brand amid severe marketing restrictions .
' All that former advertising money has to go somewhere , ' said one industry insider .
' The tobacco firms are looking to create extensive " design languages " in bars and clubs and other venues through the use of particular types of furniture or material which will make people think of their brands . '
Experts said such marketing was becoming increasingly popular .
' The more subtle the message , the more likely it is to be accepted , ' said Gerard Hastings , director of the Institute for Social Marketing and Centre for Tobacco Control based at Stirling University .
' If you see something blatant , it forewarns you .
But if it 's something subliminal it will go under the radar . '
The elite teams of marketing experts were armed with scripts to use when approaching bar managers and event promoters .
' Our customers are your customers , ' runs the script .
' Nearly 80 per cent of Marlboro smokers are ABC1 , aged 18 to 35 . '
The teams were told to stress : ' Marlboro is arguably the world 's best known brand after Coca - Cola . '
The project was part of a wider plan to target affluent smokers aged between 18 and 35 .
The company sought to secure exclusive retail rights at the 2004 Glastonbury festival , and a number of other high - profile music events where attractive female ' Marlboro models ' would sell cigarettes .
Since last December all cigarette advertising is banned except small displays on vending machines .
Amanda Sandford , research director of the anti-smoking group Ash , said the marketing plans raised serious concerns .
' Cigarette advertising is going underground , it 's becoming more covert .
This just shows the need for greater vigilance .'
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the company did not to discuss its marketing plans , but added : ' We have a range of strategies to support Marlboro which , combined with the taste of the product , have helped to contribute to its success . '

Beale Ciphers -
In 1885 , a small pamphlet was published in Virginia containing a story and three encrypted messages .
According to the pamphlet , around 1820 a man named Beale buried two wagons - full of treasure at a secret location in Bedford County , Virginia .
He then left a small locked box with a local innkeeper , and left town , never to be seen again .
The pamphlet went on to state that the innkeeper , after having not heard from Beale for many years , opened the box and discovered encrypted messages .
Never able to read them , he eventually passed them along to a young friend shortly before the innkeeper 's death in 1863 .
According to the pamphlet , the friend spent the next 20 years trying to decrypt the messages , solving only one which detailed the tons of gold , silver and jewels that were buried , along with a general location .
The still unsolved messages supposedly give exact directions , and a list of who the treasure belongs to .
According to the story , the friend finally decided to walk away from the quest , and publish everything they knew about the situation in the ( anonymous ) pamphlet , which was supposedly published by James Ward , another friend of the innkeeper .
There have been many exhaustive searches for the treasure , and much effort spent on decoding the other messages , without ( confirmed ) success .
There are many claimed solutions , usually bannered in combination with a book that someone is trying to sell , but no one has ever been able to produce a duplicatable decryption method .
There have also been some pretty compelling arguments that the entire original story was a hoax .
There are several inconsistencies in the pamphlet 's text , and even speculation that the story was a parable related to Masonic rituals .

Voynich Manuscript -
At least 600 years old , this is a 232 - page illuminated manuscript entirely written in a secret script .
It is filled with copious drawings of unidentified plants , herbal recipes of some sort , astrological diagrams , and many small human figures in strange plumbing - like contraptions .
Carbon - dated to the early 1400s , it was brought to modern attention in 1912 when it was purchased by Wilfrid Voynich from the collections at the Villa Mondragone , near Rome .
Color images of all of the pages can be seen at archive.org and Yale 's Beinecke Library website ( the current owner of the manuscript ) .
The script is unlike anything else in existence , but is written in a confident style , seemingly by someone who was very comfortable with it .
In 2004 there were some compelling arguments which described a technique that would seemingly prove that the manuscript was a hoax , but to date , none of the described techniques have been able to replicate a single section of the Manuscript , so speculations continue .
Attempts at identifying the plants can be seen here , and more information about the Manuscript can be found at voynich.net , voynich.nu , and crystalinks.com .
New !
To celebrate the centenary of Wilfrid Voynich finding the manuscript , a conference was held at the Villa Mondragone near Rome on May 11 , 2012 .

Zodiac Killer ciphers - From 1966 to 1974 , the Zodiac serial killer sent more than 20 written communications to police officials .
Most of these messages have been cracked , but there are still some that remain unsolved .
The killer was never caught .
Kryptos -
In 1990 , a sculpture was installed at CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia , as a challenge to the employees at the Agency .
Its thousands of characters contain encrypted messages , of which three have been solved , but there is still a fourth section at the bottom consisting of 97 or 98 characters which remains uncracked .
The sculpture was created and encoded by Washington DC sculptor Jim Sanborn , using encryption systems designed by the Chairman of the CIA 's Cryptographic Center , Ed Scheidt .

Dorabella Cipher -
In 1897 , the well - known composer Edward Elgar ( of " Pomp and Circumstance " fame ) sent an encrypted message to a 23 - year - old friend , Miss Dora Penny .
To this day , it still has not been solved .
D'Agapeyeff - Alexander d'Agapeyeff wrote an elementary book on cryptography in 1939 , entitled " Codes and Ciphers . "
In the first edition , he included a challenge cipher .
Nobody 's solved it , and he embarrassedly admitted later that he no longer knew how he 'd encrypted it .
It was left out of the second and later editions .
Some think it was botched , and many think it could still be solved despite that .
It has lots of " phenomena " noted , but nothing close to a crack .
Linear A - In 1900 , a large number of clay tablets dating back to 1800 BC were discovered in Crete .
The tablets appear to use two different types of scripts , which were named " Linear A " and " Linear B. " Linear B was finally deciphered in the 1950s .
Linear A remains unsolved .
The Phaistos Disk -
A circular clay tablet about six inches across , discovered in Crete in the early 1900s , and believed to date back to 1800 BC .
With an " alphabet " of 45 different symbols , 241 signs are stamped into both sides in spiral patterns .
There has been much speculation about its meaning , with wildly variant claimed solutions so far .
It 's also been suggested that the disk might turn out to be a Rosetta Stone to help decipher Linear A , since it was discovered near a fragment of a Linear A tablet .

Chinese " Gold Bar " ciphers -
In 1933 , seven gold bars were allegedly issued to a General Wang in Shanghai , China .
These gold bars appear to represent metal certificates related to a bank deposit with a U.S. Bank .
The gold bars themselves have pictures , Chinese writing , some form of script writing , and cryptograms in latin letters .
Indus Script -
The Indus Valley civilization flourished around 2600 to 1800 BC on the Indian sub - continent , leaving behind thousands of objects inscribed with a pictographic script that seems to have been composed of about 400 signs .
A great deal of work has been done on analyzing the messages that are available , but to this date the script still has not been deciphered .
RSA Challenges -
There have been a number of modern computer - based challenges , including several factoring challenges from RSA Labs with implications for the strength of public - key systems , and some equivalently difficult elliptic curve challenges , also relating to public - key cracking ( check here for Bruce Schneier 's high - math analysis of the RSA / Elliptic Curve debate ) .
The elliptic challenge ran from 1997 to 2009 .
The RSA Challenge with prize money was discontinued in 2007 , though several numbers remain unfactored , and distributed .
net has announced that they are continuing to privately sponsor the prize .
Some snake - oil crypto companies also put out challenges that are arguably famous because the media sometimes pick up the challenge uncritically , but they are usually not worth mentioning on this list .
Richard Feynman's Challenge Ciphers -
In 1987 , someone posted a message to an internet cryptology list , saying that Caltech Physics Professor Richard Feynman was given three samples of code by a fellow scientist at Los Alamos .
Only one of the three was ever solved .
Unsolved World War II Systems -
Though the Enigma encryption system was cracked , and the Bletchley Park crypto project is quite famous , there are still some scattered unsolved Enigma messages from World War II .
There are also various other WWII encryption systems that were never solved , but they have not been included on this list because the focus is more on specific famous messages or entire well - known systems that have not yet been cracked .
One message that received a great deal of attention in November 2012 is the " Pigeon Cipher " , a WWII message that was found attached to the remains of a pigeon that a man found while he was cleaning out his chimney in Surrey , England .
The message was given to GCHQ and sparked an international flurry of attention : BBC News , The Telegraph , New York Times , etc .
If you know of any other particular message or system that you think is worthy of inclusion , please contact the webmistress .
Rongorongo Script of Easter Island -
In 1868 , Europeans first reported seeing wooden tablets on the incredibly remote Easter Island in the south Pacific .
The tablets were covered with an unknown hieroglyphic script .
Only 20 or so tablets are thought to be in existence , with little progress in determining what it is that they say .
Other Uncracked Ancient Ciphers -
There are several other ancient writing systems that are still undeciphered , such as the 13,000 Etruscan inscriptions , Proto - Elamite , Meroitic , and various other obscure glyphs .

Poe 's Cryptographic Challenge -
In 1839 , Edgar Allan
Poe published two cryptographic challenges which remained unsolved for over 150 years .
The first one was finally solved in 1992 , and the second one in October 2000
Cyrillic Projector Cipher - Washington DC sculptor Jim Sanborn , famous for the CIA 's Kryptos sculpture , also created some related sculptures which included both the text from Kryptos , and some encrypted Russian text about KGB operations .
The best example was the Cyrillic Projector , which was created in the early 1990s and then installed permanently at the University of North Carolina , Charlotte in 1997 .
It was cracked in September 2003 by an international team involving the Kryptos Group .
Oak Island Money Pit Cipher Stone ( solved , though alleged treasure still unrecovered ) -
In 1795 , a teenager discovered a deep pit on Oak Island in Nova Scotia , along with hints that there was a great treasure at the bottom .
Over the next two hundred years , multiple well - financed attempts have been made to learn what is hidden , but have been repeatedly foiled due to the unstable nature of the surrounding land , and the tendency for deep tunnels to suddenly flood with water .
Multiple reports referred to tantalizing artifacts from 300 years ago , such as a pair of scissors , an encrypted stone tablet , barriers of oak logs , and other man-made objects deep below the ground .
In 1976 , a camera lowered into a subterranean chamber allegedly recorded images of wooden chests , tools , and a body , before the unstable land again collapsed the exploration tunnel .
In 2002 , a report was produced by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute with more recent information , and which challenged some of the earlier findings .
In any case , along with large amounts of money which have been sunk into this quest , multiple lives have also been lost attempting to solve the mystery .
Smithy Code . -
In April 2006 , as part of the trial ruling of a plagiarism trial about the book '' The Da Vinci Code ' ' , the judge in the case , Justice Peter Smith embedded his own secret code in the 71 - page trial ruling ( zipped pdf ) .
Once the code was discovered by a London legal analyst , it sparked off a worldwide race to see who could crack the code first .
According to The Guardian , it was solved by Dan Tench , the legal analyst who first discovered the code , after he received a series of email hints from the judge .

Chaocipher - Algorithm revealed , ciphers solved in 2010 .
In 1918 , J.F. Byrne created a machine - based cryptographic system .
In 1953 , he used it to create a code challenge as part of his autobiography Silent Years .
There were at least three people who knew how the system worked : his son , and two editors of the journal Cryptologia who were let in on the secret in 1990 .
Chapter 21 of Byrne 's book contained four ciphers created with the Chaocipher device .
Byrne had included both the plaintext of the ciphers , and the ciphertext , except for the last two lines of the fourth cipher , for which he did not include plaintext , and offered a $ 5,000 prize to any solver who would come forward within three months of the book 's publication .
Byrne died in 1960 with the cipher still unsolved .
For the next 50 years , the cipher remained ( publicly ) unsolved , until May 2010 , when Byrne 's materials were donated by his estate to the National Cryptologic Museum .
In July 2010 , the actual algorithm was described publicly by Moshe Rubin , and he has since released a report discussing the decipherment of the first cipher in the book .
Check here for a timeline and further information .

If history really is repeating itself , the schools are in serious trouble .
In Teachers and Machines : The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920 ( 1986 ) , Larry Cuban , a professor of education at Stanford University and a former school superintendent , observed that as successive rounds of new technology failed their promoters ' expectations , a pattern emerged .
The cycle began with big promises backed by the technology developers ' research .
In the classroom , however , teachers never really embraced the new tools , and no significant academic improvement occurred .
This provoked consistent responses : the problem was money , spokespeople argued , or teacher resistance , or the paralyzing school bureaucracy .
Meanwhile , few people questioned the technology advocates ' claims .
As results continued to lag , the blame was finally laid on the machines .
Soon schools were sold on the next generation of technology , and the lucrative cycle started all over again .
Today 's technology evangels argue that we 've learned our lesson from past mistakes .
As in each previous round , they say that when our new hot technology -- the computer -- is compared with yesterday's , today 's is better .
" It can do the same things , plus , " Richard Riley , the U.S. Secretary of Education , told me this spring .
How much better is it , really ?
The promoters of computers in schools again offer prodigious research showing improved academic achievement after using their technology .
The research has again come under occasional attack , but this time quite a number of teachers seem to be backing classroom technology .
In a poll taken early last year U.S. teachers ranked computer skills and media technology as more " essential " than the study of European history , biology , chemistry , and physics ; than dealing with social problems such as drugs and family breakdown ; than learning practical job skills ; and than reading modern American writers such as Steinbeck and Hemingway or classic ones such as Plato and Shakespeare .
In keeping with these views New Jersey cut state aid to a number of school districts this past year and then spent $ 10 million on classroom computers .
In Union City , California , a single school district is spending $ 27 million to buy new gear for a mere eleven schools .
The Kittridge Street Elementary School , in Los Angeles , killed its music program last year to hire a technology coordinator ; in Mansfield , Massachusetts , administrators dropped proposed teaching positions in art , music , and physical education , and then spent $ 333,000 on computers ; in one Virginia school the art room was turned into a computer laboratory .
( Ironically , a half dozen preliminary studies recently suggested that music and art classes may build the physical size of a child 's brain , and its powers for subjects such as language , math , science , and engineering -- in one case far more than computer work did . )
Meanwhile , months after a New Technology High School opened in Napa , California , where computers sit on every student 's desk and all academic classes use computers , some students were complaining of headaches , sore eyes , and wrist pain .
Throughout the country , as spending on technology increases , school book purchases are stagnant .
Shop classes , with their tradition of teaching children building skills with wood and metal , have been almost entirely replaced by new " technology education programs . "
In San Francisco only one public school still offers a full shop program -- the lone vocational high school .
" We get kids who do n't know the difference between a screwdriver and a ball peen hammer , " James Dahlman , the school 's vocational - department chair , told me recently .
" How are they going to make a career choice ?
Administrators are stuck in this mindset that all kids will go to a four - year college and become a doctor or a lawyer , and that 's not true .
I know some who went to college , graduated , and then had to go back to technical school to get a job . "
Last year the school superintendent in Great Neck , Long Island , proposed replacing elementary school shop classes with computer classes and training the shop teachers as computer coaches .
Rather than being greeted with enthusiasm , the proposal provoked a backlash .
Interestingly , shop classes and field trips are two programs that the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council , the Clinton Administration 's technology task force , suggests reducing in order to shift resources into computers .
But are these results what technology promoters really intend ? "
You need to apply common sense , " Esther Dyson , the president of EDventure Holdings and one of the task force 's leading school advocates , told me recently .
" Shop with a good teacher probably is worth more than computers with a lousy teacher .
But if it 's a poor program , this may provide a good excuse for cutting it .
There will be a lot of trials and errors with this .
And I do n't know how to prevent those errors . "
The issue , perhaps , is the magnitude of the errors .
Alan Lesgold , a professor of psychology and the associate director of the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh , calls the computer an " amplifier , " because it encourages both enlightened study practices and thoughtless ones .
There 's a real risk , though , that the thoughtless practices will dominate , slowly dumbing down huge numbers of tomorrow 's adults .
As Sherry Turkle , a professor of the sociology of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a longtime observer of children 's use of computers , told me , " The possibilities of using this thing poorly so outweigh the chance of using it well , it makes people like us , who are fundamentally optimistic about computers , very reticent . "
Perhaps the best way to separate fact from fantasy is to take supporters ' claims about computerized learning one by one and compare them with the evidence in the academic literature and in the everyday experiences I have observed or heard about in a variety of classrooms .
Five main arguments underlie the campaign to computerize our nation 's schools .
Computers improve both teaching practices and student achievement .
Computer literacy should be taught as early as possible ; otherwise students will be left behind .
To make tomorrow 's work force competitive in an increasingly high - tech world , learning computer skills must be a priority .
Technology programs leverage support from the business community -- badly needed today because schools are increasingly starved for funds .
Work with computers -- particularly using the Internet -- brings students valuable connections with teachers , other schools and students , and a wide network of professionals around the globe .
These connections spice the school day with a sense of real - world relevance , and broaden the educational community .
" The Filmstrips of the 1990s "
LINTON 's vision of computerized classrooms arose partly out of the findings of the presidential task force -- thirty - six leaders from industry , education , and several interest groups who have guided the Administration 's push to get computers into the schools .
The report of the task force , " Connecting K - 12 Schools to the Information Superhighway " ( produced by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. ) , begins by citing numerous studies that have apparently proved that computers enhance student achievement significantly .
One " meta - analysis " ( a study that reviews other studies -- in this case 130 of them ) reported that computers had improved performance in " a wide range of subjects , including language arts , math , social studies and science . "
Another found improved organization and focus in students ' writing .
A third cited twice the normal gains in math skills .
Several schools boasted of greatly improved attendance .
Unfortunately , many of these studies are more anecdotal than conclusive .
Some , including a giant , oft - cited meta- analysis of 254 studies , lack the necessary scientific controls to make solid conclusions possible .
The circumstances are artificial and not easily repeated , results are n't statistically reliable , or , most frequently , the studies did not control for other influences , such as differences between teaching methods .
This last factor is critical , because computerized learning inevitably forces teachers to adjust their style -- only sometimes for the better .
Some studies were industry - funded , and thus tended to publicize mostly positive findings .
" The research is set up in a way to find benefits that are n't really there , " Edward Miller , a former editor of the Harvard Education Letter , says .
" Most knowledgeable people agree that most of the research is n't valid .
It 's so flawed it should n't even be called research .
Essentially , it 's just worthless . "
Once the faulty studies are weeded out , Miller says , the ones that remain " are inconclusive " -- that is , they show no significant change in either direction .
Even Esther Dyson admits the studies are undependable .
" I do n't think those studies amount to much either way , " she says .
" In this area there is little proof . "
Why are solid conclusions so elusive ?
Look at Apple Computer 's " Classrooms of Tomorrow , " perhaps the most widely studied effort to teach using computer technology .
In the early 1980s Apple shrewdly realized that donating computers to schools might help not only students but also company sales , as Apple 's ubiquity in classrooms turned legions of families into Apple loyalists .
Last year , after the San Jose Mercury News ( published in Apple 's Silicon Valley home ) ran a series questioning the effectiveness of computers in schools , the paper printed an opinion - page response from Terry Crane , an Apple vice - president .
" Instead of isolating students , " Crane wrote , " technology actually encouraged them to collaborate more than in traditional classrooms .
Students also learned to explore and represent information dynamically and creatively , communicate effectively about complex processes , become independent learners and self - starters and become more socially aware and confident . "
Crane did n't mention that after a decade of effort and the donation of equipment worth more than $ 25 million to thirteen schools , there is scant evidence of greater student achievement .
To be fair , educators on both sides of the computer debate acknowledge that today 's tests of student achievement are shockingly crude .
They 're especially weak in measuring intangibles such as enthusiasm and self - motivation , which do seem evident in Apple 's classrooms and other computer - rich schools .
In any event , what is fun and what is educational may frequently be at odds .
" Computers in classrooms are the filmstrips of the 1990s , " Clifford Stoll , the author of Silicon Snake Oil : Second Thoughts on the Information Highway ( 1995 ) , told The New York Times last year , recalling his own school days in the 1960s .
" We loved them because we did n't have to think for an hour , teachers loved them because they did n't have to teach , and parents loved them because it showed their schools were high - tech .
But no learning happened . "
Stoll somewhat overstates the case -- obviously , benefits can come from strengthening a student 's motivation .
Still , Apple 's computers may bear less responsibility for that change than Crane suggests .
In the beginning , when Apple did little more than dump computers in classrooms and homes , this produced no real results , according to Jane David , a consultant Apple hired to study its classroom initiative .
Apple quickly learned that teachers needed to change their classroom approach to what is commonly called " project - oriented learning . "
This is an increasingly popular teaching method , in which students learn through doing and teachers act as facilitators or partners rather than as didacts .
( Teachers sometimes refer to this approach , which arrived in classrooms before computers did , as being " the guide on the side instead of the sage on the stage . " )
But what the students learned " had less to do with the computer and more to do with the teaching , " David concluded .
" If you took the computers out , there would still be good teaching there . "
This story is heard in school after school , including two impoverished schools -- Clear View Elementary School , in southern California , and the Christopher Columbus middle school , in New Jersey -- that the Clinton Administration has loudly celebrated for turning themselves around with computers .
At Christopher Columbus , in fact , students ' test scores rose before computers arrived , not afterward , because of relatively basic changes : longer class periods , new books , after - school programs , and greater emphasis on student projects and collaboration .
During recent visits to some San Francisco - area schools I could see what it takes for students to use computers properly , and why most do n't .
On a bluff south of downtown San Francisco , in the middle of one of the city 's lower - income neighborhoods , Claudia Schaffner , a tenth - grader , tapped away at a multimedia machine in a computer lab at Thurgood Marshall Academic High School , one of half a dozen special technology schools in the city .
Schaffner was using a physics program to simulate the trajectory of a marble on a small roller coaster .
" It helps to visualize it first , like ' A is for Apple ' with kindergartners , " Schaffner told me , while mousing up and down the virtual roller coaster .
" I can see how the numbers go into action . "
This was lunch hour , and the students ' excitement about what they can do in this lab was palpable .
Schaffner could barely tear herself away .
" I need to go eat some food , " she finally said , returning within minutes to eat a rice dish at the keyboard .
Schaffner 's teacher is Dennis Frezzo , an electrical - engineering graduate from the University of California at Berkeley .
Despite his considerable knowledge of computer programming , Frezzo tries to keep classwork focused on physical projects .
For a mere $ 8,000 , for example , several teachers put together a multifaceted robotics lab , consisting of an advanced Lego engineering kit and twenty - four old 386 - generation computers .
Frezzo's students used these materials to build a tiny electric car , whose motion was to be triggered by a light sensor .
When the light sensor did n't work , the students figured out why .
" That 's a real problem -- what you 'd encounter in the real world , " Frezzo told me .
" I prefer they get stuck on small real - world problems instead of big fake problems " -- like the simulated natural disasters that fill one popular educational game .
" It 's sort of the Zen approach to education , " Frezzo said .
" It 's not the big problems .
Isaac Newton already solved those .
What come up in life are the little ones . "
It 's one thing to confront technology 's complexity at a high school -- especially one that 's blessed with four different computer labs and some highly skilled teachers like Frezzo , who know enough , as he put it , " to keep computers in their place . "
It 's quite another to grapple with a high - tech future in the lower grades , especially at everyday schools that lack special funding or technical support .
As evidence , when U.S. News & World Report published a cover story last fall on schools that make computers work , five of the six were high schools -- among them Thurgood Marshall .
Although the sixth was an elementary school , the featured program involved children with disabilities -- the one group that does show consistent benefits from computerized instruction .
Artificial Experience
ONSIDER the scene at one elementary school , Sanchez , which sits on the edge of San Francisco 's Latino community .
For several years Sanchez , like many other schools , has made do with a roomful of basic Apple IIes .
Last year , curious about what computers could do for youngsters , a local entrepreneur donated twenty costly Power Macintoshes -- three for each of five classrooms , and one for each of the five lucky teachers to take home .
The teachers who got the new machines were delighted .
" It 's the best thing we 've ever done , " Adela Najarro , a third - grade bilingual teacher , told me .
She mentioned one boy , perhaps with a learning disability , who had started to hate school .
Once he had a computer to play with , she said , " his whole attitude changed . "
Najarro is now a true believer , even when it comes to children without disabilities .
" Every single child , " she said , " will do more work for you and do better work with a computer .
Just because it's on a monitor , kids pay more attention .
There 's this magic to the screen . "
Down the hall from Najarro 's classroom her colleague Rose Marie Ortiz had a more troubled relationship with computers .
On the morning I visited , Ortiz took her bilingual special - education class of second - , third - , and fourth - graders into the lab filled with the old Apple IIes .
The students look forward to this weekly expedition so much that Ortiz gets exceptional behavior from them all morning .
Out of date though these machines are , they do offer a range of exercises , in subjects such as science , math , reading , social studies , and problem solving .
But owing to this group 's learning problems and limited English skills , math drills were all that Ortiz could give them .
Nonetheless , within minutes the kids were excitedly navigating their way around screens depicting floating airplanes and trucks carrying varying numbers of eggs .
As the children struggled , many resorted to counting in whatever way they knew how .
Some squinted at the screen , painstakingly moving their fingers from one tiny egg symbol to the next .
" Tres , cuatro , cinco , seis ... , " one little girl said loudly , trying to hear herself above her counting neighbors .
Another girl kept a piece of paper handy , on which she marked a line for each egg .
Several others resorted to the slow but tried and true -- their fingers .
Some just guessed .
Once the children arrived at answers , they frantically typed them onto the screen , hoping it would advance to something fun , the way Nintendos , Game Boys , and video - arcade games do .
Sometimes their answers were right , and the screen did advance ; sometimes they were n't ; but the children were rarely discouraged .
As schoolwork goes , this was a blast .
" It 's highly motivating for them , " Ortiz said as she rushed from machine to machine , attending not to math questions but to computer glitches .
Those she could n't fix she simply abandoned .
" I do n't know how practical it is .
You see , " she said , pointing to a girl counting on her fingers , " these kids still need the hands - on " -- meaning the opportunity to manipulate physical objects such as beans or colored blocks .
The value of hands - on learning , child - development experts believe , is that it deeply imprints knowledge into a young child 's brain , by transmitting the lessons of experience through a variety of sensory pathways .
" Curiously enough , " the educational psychologist Jane Healy wrote in Endangered Minds : Why Children Don't Think and What We Can Do About It ( 1990 ) , " visual stimulation is probably not the main access route to nonverbal reasoning .
Body movements , the ability to touch , feel , manipulate , and build sensory awareness of relationships in the physical world , are its main foundations . "
The problem , Healy wrote , is that " in schools , traditionally , the senses have had little status after kindergarten . "
Ortiz believes that the computer - lab time , brief as it is , dilutes her students ' attention to language .
" These kids are all language - delayed , " she said .
Though only modest sums had so far been spent at her school , Ortiz and other local teachers felt that the push was on for technology over other scholastic priorities .
The year before , Sanchez had let its librarian go , to be replaced by a part - timer .
When Ortiz finally got the students rounded up and out the door , the kids were still worked up .
" They 're never this wired after reading group , " she said .
" They 're usually just exhausted , because I 've been reading with them , making them write and talk . "
Back in homeroom Ortiz showed off the students ' monthly handwritten writing samples .
" Now , could you do that on the computer ? " she asked .
" No , because we'd be hung up on finding the keys . "
So why does Ortiz bother taking her students to the computer lab at all ?
" I guess I come in here for the computer literacy .
If everyone else is getting it , I feel these kids should get it too . "
Some computerized elementary school programs have avoided these pitfalls , but the record subject by subject is mixed at best .
Take writing , where by all accounts and by my own observations the computer does encourage practice -- changes are easier to make on a keyboard than with an eraser , and the lettering looks better .
Diligent students use these conveniences to improve their writing , but the less committed frequently get seduced by electronic opportunities to make a school paper look snazzy .
( The easy " cut and paste " function in today 's word - processing programs , for example , is apparently encouraging many students to cobble together research materials without thinking them through . )
Reading programs get particularly bad reviews .
One small but carefully controlled study went so far as to claim that Reader Rabbit , a reading program now used in more than 100,000 schools , caused students to suffer a 50 percent drop in creativity .
( Apparently , after forty - nine students used the program for seven months , they were no longer able to answer open - ended questions and showed a markedly diminished ability to brainstorm with fluency and originality . )
What about hard sciences , which seem so well suited to computer study ?
Logo , the high - profile programming language refined by Seymour Papert and widely used in middle and high schools , fostered huge hopes of expanding children 's cognitive skills .
As students directed the computer to build things , such as geometric shapes , Papert believed , they would learn " procedural thinking , " similar to the way a computer processes information .
According to a number of studies , however , Logo has generally failed to deliver on its promises .
Judah Schwartz , a professor of education at Harvard and a co-director of the school 's Educational Technology Center , told me that a few newer applications , when used properly , can dramatically expand children 's math and science thinking by giving them new tools to " make and explore conjectures .
" Still , Schwartz acknowledges that perhaps " ninety - nine percent " of the educational programs are " terrible , really terrible . "
Even in success stories important caveats continually pop up .
The best educational software is usually complex -- most suited to older students and sophisticated teachers .
In other cases the schools have been blessed with abundance -- fancy equipment , generous financial support , or extra teachers -- that is difficult if not impossible to duplicate in the average school .
Even if it could be duplicated , the literature suggests , many teachers would still struggle with technology .
Computers suffer frequent breakdowns ; when they do work , their seductive images often distract students from the lessons at hand -- which many teachers say makes it difficult to build meaningful rapport with their students .
With such a discouraging record of student and teacher performance with computers , why has the Clinton Administration focused so narrowly on the hopeful side of the story ?
Part of the answer may lie in the makeup of the Administration 's technology task force .
Judging from accounts of the task force 's deliberations , all thirty - six members are unequivocal technology advocates .
Two thirds of them work in the high - tech and entertainment industries .
The effect of the group 's tilt can be seen in its report .
Its introduction adopts the authoritative posture of impartial fact - finder , stating that " this report does not attempt to lay out a national blueprint , nor does it recommend specific public policy goals . "
But it comes pretty close .
Each chapter describes various strategies for getting computers into classrooms , and the introduction acknowledges that " this report does not evaluate the relative merits of competing demands on educational funding ( e.g. , more computers versus smaller class sizes ) . "
When I spoke with Esther Dyson and other task - force members about what discussion the group had had about the potential downside of computerized education , they said there had n't been any .
And when I asked Linda Roberts , Clinton 's lead technology adviser in the Department of Education , whether the task force was influenced by any self - interest , she said no , quite the opposite : the group 's charter actually gave its members license to help the technology industry directly , but they concentrated on schools because that 's where they saw the greatest need .
That sense of need seems to have been spreading outside Washington .
Last summer a California task force urged the state to spend $ 11 billion on computers in California schools , which have struggled for years under funding cuts that have driven academic achievement down to among the lowest levels in the nation .
This task force , composed of forty - six teachers , parents , technology experts , and business executives , concluded , " More than any other single measure , computers and network technologies , properly implemented , offer the greatest potential to right what 's wrong with our public schools . "
Other options mentioned in the group 's report -- reducing class size , improving teachers ' salaries and facilities , expanding hours of instruction -- were considered less important than putting kids in front of computers .
" Hypertext Minds "
ODAY'S parents , knowing firsthand how families were burned by television 's false promises , may want some objective advice about the age at which their children should become computer literate .
Although there are no real guidelines , computer boosters send continual messages that if children do n't begin early , they 'll be left behind .
Linda Roberts thinks that there 's no particular minimum age -- and no maximum number of hours that children should spend at a terminal .
Are there examples of excess ?
" I have n't seen it yet , " Roberts told me with a laugh .
In schools throughout the country administrators and teachers demonstrate the same excitement , boasting about the wondrous things that children of five or six can do on computers : drawing , typing , playing with elementary science simulations and other programs called " educational games . "
The schools ' enthusiasm for these activities is not universally shared by specialists in childhood development .
The doubters ' greatest concern is for the very young -- preschool through third grade , when a child is most impressionable .
Their apprehension involves two main issues .
First , they consider it important to give children a broad base -- emotionally , intellectually , and in the five senses -- before introducing something as technical and one - dimensional as a computer .
Second , they believe that the human and physical world holds greater learning potential .
The importance of a broad base for a child may be most apparent when it 's missing .
In Endangered Minds , Jane Healy wrote of an English teacher who could readily tell which of her students ' essays were conceived on a computer .
" They do n't link ideas , " the teacher says .
" They just write one thing , and then they write another one , and they do n't seem to see or develop the relationships between them . "
The problem , Healy argued , is that the pizzazz of computerized schoolwork may hide these analytical gaps , which " wo n't become apparent until [ the student ] can't organize herself around a homework assignment or a job that requires initiative .
More commonplace activities , such as figuring out how to nail two boards together , organizing a game ... may actually form a better basis for real - world intelligence . "
Others believe they have seen computer games expand children 's imaginations .
High - tech children " think differently from the rest of us , " William D. Winn , the director of the Learning Center at the University of Washington 's Human Interface Technology Laboratory , told Business Week in a recent cover story on the benefits of computer games .
" They develop hypertext minds .
They leap around .
It 's as though their cognitive strategies were parallel , not sequential . "
Healy argues the opposite .
She and other psychologists think that the computer screen flattens information into narrow , sequential data .
This kind of material , they believe , exercises mostly one half of the brain -- the left hemisphere , where primarily sequential thinking occurs .
The " right brain " meanwhile gets short shrift -- yet this is the hemisphere that works on different kinds of information simultaneously .
It shapes our multi-faceted impressions , and serves as the engine of creative analysis .
Opinions diverge in part because research on the brain is still so sketchy , and computers are so new , that the effect of computers on the brain remains a great mystery .
" I do n't think we know anything about it , " Harry Chugani , a pediatric neurobiologist at Wayne State University , told me .
This very ignorance makes skeptics wary .
" Nobody knows how kids ' internal wiring works , " Clifford Stoll wrote in Silicon Snake Oil , " but anyone who 's directed away from social interactions has a head start on turning out weird ....
No computer can teach what a walk through a pine forest feels like .
Sensation has no substitute . "
This points to the conservative developmentalists ' second concern : the danger that even if hours in front of the screen are limited , unabashed enthusiasm for the computer sends the wrong message : that the mediated world is more significant than the real one .
" It 's like TV commercials , " Barbara Scales , the head teacher at the Child Study Center at the University of California at Berkeley , told me .
" Kids get so hyped up , it can change their expectations about stimulation , versus what they generate themselves . "
In Silicon Snake Oil , Michael Fellows , a computer scientist at the University of Victoria , in British Columbia , was even blunter .
" Most schools would probably be better off if they threw their computers into the Dumpster . "
Faced with such sharply contrasting viewpoints , which are based on such uncertain ground , how is a responsible policymaker to proceed ?
" A prudent society controls its own infatuation with ' progress ' when planning for its young , " Healy argued in Endangered Minds .
Unproven technologies ... may offer lively visions , but they can also be detrimental to the development of the young plastic brain .
The cerebral cortex is a wondrously well - buffered mechanism that can withstand a good bit of well - intentioned bungling .
Yet there is a point at which fundamental neural substrates for reasoning may be jeopardized for children who lack proper physical , intellectual , or emotional nurturance .
Childhood -- and the brain -- have their own imperatives .
In development , missed opportunities may be difficult to recapture .
The problem is that technology leaders rarely include these or other warnings in their recommendations .
When I asked Dyson why the Clinton task force proceeded with such fervor , despite the classroom computer 's shortcomings , she said , " It 's so clear the world is changing . "
Real Job Training
N the past decade , according to the presidential task force 's report , the number of jobs requiring computer skills has increased from 25 percent of all jobs in 1983 to 47 percent in 1993 .
By 2000 , the report estimates , 60 percent of the nation 's jobs will demand these skills -- and pay an average of 10 to 15 percent more than jobs involving no computer work .
Although projections of this sort are far from reliable , it 's a safe bet that computer skills will be needed for a growing proportion of tomorrow 's work force .
But what priority should these skills be given among other studies ?
Listen to Tom Henning , a physics teacher at Thurgood Marshall , the San Francisco technology high school .
Henning has a graduate degree in engineering , and helped to found a Silicon Valley company that manufactures electronic navigation equipment .
" My bias is the physical reality , " Henning told me , as we sat outside a shop where he was helping students to rebuild an old motorcycle .
" I 'm no technophobe .
I can program computers . "
What worries Henning is that computers at best engage only two senses , hearing and sight -- and only two - dimensional sight at that .
" Even if they 're doing three - dimensional computer modeling , that 's still a two - D replica of a three - D world .
If you took a kid who grew up on Nintendo , he 's not going to have the necessary skills .
He needs to have done it first with Tinkertoys or clay , or carved it out of balsa wood . "
As David Elkind , a professor of child development at Tufts University , puts it , " A dean of the University of Iowa 's school of engineering used to say the best engineers were the farm boys , " because they knew how machinery really worked .
Surely many employers will disagree , and welcome the commercially applicable computer skills that today 's high - tech training can bring them .
What 's striking is how easy it is to find other employers who share Henning 's and Elkind 's concerns .
Kris Meisling , a senior geological - research adviser for Mobil Oil , told me that " people who use computers a lot slowly grow rusty in their ability to think . "
Meisling 's group creates charts and maps -- some computerized , some not -- to plot where to drill for oil .
In large one - dimensional analyses , such as sorting volumes of seismic data , the computer saves vast amounts of time , sometimes making previously impossible tasks easy .
This lures people in his field , Meisling believes , into using computers as much as possible .
But when geologists turn to computers for " interpretive " projects , he finds , they often miss information , and their oversights are further obscured by the computer 's captivating automatic design functions .
This is why Meisling still works regularly with a pencil and paper -- tools that , ironically , he considers more interactive than the computer , because they force him to think implications through .
" You ca n't simultaneously get an overview and detail with a computer , " he says .
" It 's linear .
It gives you tunnel vision .
What computers can do well is what can be calculated over and over .
What they can't do is innovation .
If you think of some new way to do or look at things and the software can't do it , you 're stuck .
So a lot of people think , ' Well , I guess it 's a dumb idea , or it 's unnecessary . ' "
I have heard similar warnings from people in other businesses , including high - tech enterprises .
A spokeswoman for Hewlett - Packard , the giant California computer - products company , told me the company rarely hires people who are predominantly computer experts , favoring instead those who have a talent for teamwork and are flexible and innovative .
Hewlett - Packard is such a believer in hands - on experience that since 1992 it has spent $ 2.6 million helping forty - five school districts build math and science skills the old - fashioned way -- using real materials , such as dirt , seeds , water , glass vials , and magnets .
Much the same perspective came from several recruiters in film and computer - game animation .
In work by artists who have spent a lot of time on computers " you 'll see a stiffness or a flatness , a lack of richness and depth , " Karen Chelini , the director of human resources for LucasArts Entertainment , George Lucas 's interactive - games maker , told me recently .
" With traditional art training , you train the eye to pay attention to body movement .
You learn attitude , feeling , expression .
The ones who are good are those who as kids could n't be without their sketchbook . "
Many jobs obviously will demand basic computer skills if not sophisticated knowledge .
But that does n't mean that the parents or the teachers of young students need to panic .
Joseph Weizenbaum , a professor emeritus of computer science at MIT , told the San Jose Mercury News that even at his technology - heavy institution new students can learn all the computer skills they need " in a summer . "
This seems to hold in the business world , too .
Patrick MacLeamy , an executive vice - president of Hellmuth Obata & Kassabaum , the country 's largest architecture firm , recently gave me numerous examples to illustrate that computers pose no threat to his company 's creative work .
Although architecture professors are divided on the value of computerized design tools , in MacLeamy 's opinion they generally enhance the process .
But he still considers " knowledge of the hands " to be valuable -- today 's architects just have to develop it in other ways .
( His firm 's answer is through building models . )
Nonetheless , as positive as MacLeamy is about computers , he has found the company 's two - week computer training to be sufficient .
In fact , when he 's hiring , computer skills do n't enter into his list of priorities .
He looks for a strong character ; an ability to speak , write , and comprehend ; and a rich education in the history of architecture .
The Schools that Business Built
EWSPAPER financial sections carry almost daily pronouncements from the computer industry and other businesses about their high - tech hopes for America 's schoolchildren .
Many of these are joined to philanthropic commitments to helping schools make curriculum changes .
This sometimes gets businesspeople involved in schools , where they 've begun to understand and work with the many daunting problems that are unrelated to technology .
But if business gains too much influence over the curriculum , the schools can become a kind of corporate training center -- largely at taxpayer expense .
For more than a decade scholars and government commissions have criticized the increasing professionalization of the college years -- frowning at the way traditional liberal arts are being edged out by hot topics of the moment or strictly business - oriented studies .
The schools ' real job , the technology critic Neil Postman argued in his book The End of Education ( 1995 ) , is to focus on " how to make a life , which is quite different from how to make a living . "
Some see the arrival of boxes of computer hardware and software in the schools as taking the commercial trend one step further , down into high school and elementary grades .
" Should you be choosing a career in kindergarten ? " asks Helen Sloss Luey , a social worker and a former president of San Francisco 's Parent Teacher Association .
" People need to be trained to learn and change , while education seems to be getting more specific . "
Indeed it does .
The New Technology High School in Napa ( the school where a computer sits on every student 's desk ) was started by the school district and a consortium of more than forty businesses .
" We want to be the school that business built , " Robert Nolan , a founder of the school , told me last fall .
" We wanted to create an environment that mimicked what exists in the high - tech business world . "
Increasingly , Nolan explained , business leaders want to hire people specifically trained in the skill they need .
One of Nolan 's partners , Ted Fujimoto , of the Landmark Consulting Group , told me that instead of just asking the business community for financial support , the school will now undertake a trade : in return for donating funds , businesses can specify what kinds of employees they want -- " a two - way street . "
Sometimes the traffic is a bit heavy in one direction .
In January , The New York Times published a lengthy education supplement describing numerous examples of how business is increasingly dominating school software and other curriculum materials , and not always toward purely educational goals .
People who like the idea that their taxes go to computer training might be surprised at what a poor investment it can be .
Larry Cuban , the Stanford education professor , writes that changes in the classroom for which business lobbies rarely hold long - term value .
Rather , they 're often guided by labor - market needs that turn out to be transitory ; when the economy shifts , workers are left unprepared for new jobs .
In the economy as a whole , according to a recent story in The New York Times , performance trends in our schools have shown virtually no link to the rises and falls in the nation 's measures of productivity and growth .
This is one reason that school traditionalists push for broad liberal - arts curricula , which they feel develop students ' values and intellect , instead of focusing on today 's idea about what tomorrow 's jobs will be .
High - tech proponents argue that the best education software does develop flexible business intellects .
In the Business Week story on computer games , for example , academics and professionals expressed amazement at the speed , savvy , and facility that young computer jocks sometimes demonstrate .
Several pointed in particular to computer simulations , which some business leaders believe are becoming increasingly important in fields ranging from engineering , manufacturing , and troubleshooting to the tracking of economic activity and geopolitical risk .
The best of these simulations may be valuable , albeit for strengthening one form of thinking .
But the average simulation program may be of questionable relevance .
Sherry Turkle , the sociology professor at MIT , has studied youngsters using computers for more than twenty years .
In her book Life on the Screen : Identity in the Age of the Internet ( 1995 ) she described a disturbing experience with a simulation game called SimLife .
After she sat down with a thirteen - year - old named Tim , she was stunned at the way Tim can keep playing even when he has no idea what is driving events .
For example , when his sea urchins become extinct , I ask him why .
Tim : " I do n't know , it 's just something that happens . "
ST : " Do you know how to find out why it happened ? "
Tim : " No . "
ST : " Do you mind that you can't tell why ? "
Tim : " No . I do n't let things like that bother me .
It 's not what 's important . "
Anecdotes like this lead some educators to worry that as children concentrate on how to manipulate software instead of on the subject at hand , learning can diminish rather than grow .
Simulations , for example , are built on hidden assumptions , many of which are oversimplified if not highly questionable .
All too often , Turkle wrote recently in The American Prospect , " experiences with simulations do not open up questions but close them down . "
Turkle 's concern is that software of this sort fosters passivity , ultimately dulling people 's sense of what they can change in the world .
There 's a tendency , Turkle told me , " to take things at ' interface ' value .
" Indeed , after mastering SimCity , a popular game about urban planning , a tenth - grade girl boasted to Turkle that she 'd learned the following rule : " Raising taxes always leads to riots . "
The business community also offers tangible financial support , usually by donating equipment .
Welcome as this is , it can foster a high - tech habit .
Once a school 's computer system is set up , the companies often drop their support .
This saddles the school with heavy long - term responsibilities : maintenance of the computer network and the need for constant software upgrades and constant teacher training -- the full burden of which can cost far more than the initial hardware and software combined .
Schools must then look for handouts from other companies , enter the grant - seeking game , or delicately go begging in their own communities .
" We can go to the well only so often , " Toni -Sue Passantino , the principal of the Bayside Middle School , in San Mateo , California , told me recently .
Last year Bayside let a group of seventh - and eighth - graders spend eighteen months and countless hours creating a rudimentary virtual - reality program , with the support of several high - tech firms .
The companies ' support ended after that period , however -- creating a financial speed bump of a kind that the Rand Corporation noted in a report to the Clinton Administration as a common obstacle .
School administrators may be outwardly excited about computerized instruction , but they 're also shrewdly aware of these financial challenges .
In March of last year , for instance , when California launched its highly promoted " NetDay ' 96 " ( a campaign to wire 12,000 California schools to the Internet in one day ) , school participation was far below expectations , even in technology - conscious San Francisco .
In the city papers school officials wondered how they were supposed to support an Internet program when they did n't even have the money to repair crumbling buildings , install electrical outlets , and hire the dozens of new teachers recently required so as to reduce class size .
One way around the donation maze is to simplify : use inexpensive , basic software and hardware , much of which is available through recycling programs .
Such frugality can offer real value in the elementary grades , especially since basic word - processing tools are most helpful to children just learning to write .
Yet schools , like the rest of us , ca n't resist the latest toys .
" A lot of people will spend all their money on fancy new equipment that can do great things , and sometimes it just gets used for typing classes , " Ray Porter , a computer resource teacher for the San Francisco schools , told me recently .

Internet Isolation
T is hard to visit a high - tech school without being led by a teacher into a room where students are communicating with people hundreds or thousands of miles away -- over the Internet or sometimes through video - conferencing systems ( two - way TV sets that broadcast live from each room ) .
Video conferences , although fun , are an expensive way to create classroom thrills .
But the Internet , when used carefully , offers exciting academic prospects -- most dependably , once again , for older students .
In one case schools in different states have tracked bird migrations and then posted their findings on the World Wide Web , using it as their own national notebook .
In San Francisco eighth - grade economics students have E- mailed Chinese and Japanese businessmen to fulfill an assignment on what it would take to build an industrial plant overseas .
Schools frequently use the Web to publish student writing .
While thousands of self - published materials like these have turned the Web into a worldwide vanity press , the network sometimes gives young writers their first real audience .
The free nature of Internet information also means that students are confronted with chaos , and real dangers .
" The Net 's beauty is that it 's uncontrolled , " Stephen Kerr , a professor at the College of Education at the University of Washington and the editor of Technology in the Future of Schooling ( 1996 ) , told me .
" It 's information by anyone , for anyone .
There 's racist stuff , bigoted , hate - group stuff , filled with paranoia ; bomb recipes ; how to engage in various kinds of crimes , electronic and otherwise ; scams and swindles .
It 's all there .
It 's all available . "
Older students may be sophisticated enough to separate the Net 's good food from its poisons , but even the savvy can be misled .
On almost any subject the Net offers a plethora of seemingly sound " research . "
But under close inspection much of it proves to be ill informed , or just superficial .
" That 's the antithesis of what classroom kids should be exposed to , " Kerr said .
This makes traditionalists emphasize the enduring value of printed books , vetted as most are by editing .
In many schools , however , libraries are fairly limited .
I now volunteer at a San Francisco high school where the library shelves are so bare that I can see how the Internet 's ever - growing number of research documents , with all their shortcomings , can sometimes be a blessing .
Even computer enthusiasts give the Net tepid reviews .
" Most of the content on the Net is total garbage , " Esther Dyson acknowledges .
" But if you find one good thing you can use it a million times . "
Kerr believes that Dyson is being unrealistic .
" If you find a useful site one day , it may not be there the next day , or the information is different .
Teachers are being asked to jump in and figure out if what they find on the Net is worthwhile .
They do n't have the skill or time to do that . "
Especially when students rely on the Internet 's much - vaunted search software .
Although these tools deliver hundreds or thousands of sources within seconds , students may not realize that search engines , and the Net itself , miss important information all the time .
" We need less surfing in the schools , not more , " David Gelernter , a professor of computer science at Yale , wrote last year in The Weekly Standard .
" Could n't we teach them to use what they 've got before favoring them with three orders of magnitude more ? "
In my conversations with Larry Cuban , of Stanford , he argued , " Schooling is not about information .
It 's getting kids to think about information .
It 's about understanding and knowledge and wisdom . "
It may be that youngsters ' growing fascination with the Internet and other ways to use computers will distract from yet another of Clinton 's education priorities : to build up the reading skills of American children .
Sherry Dingman , an assistant professor of psychology at Marist College , in Poughkeepsie , New York , who is optimistic about many computer applications , believes that if children start using computers before they have a broad foundation in reading from books , they will be cheated out of opportunities to develop imagination .
" If we think we 're going to take kids who have n't been read to , and fix it by sitting them in front of a computer , we 're fooling ourselves , " Dingman told me not long ago .
This does n't mean that teachers or parents should resort to books on CD - ROM , which Dingman considers " a great waste of time , " stuffing children 's minds with " canned " images instead of stimulating youngsters to create their own .
" Computers are lollipops that rot your teeth " is how Marilyn Darch , an English teacher at Poly High School , in Long Beach , California , put it in Silicon Snake Oil .
" The kids love them .
But once they get hooked ....
It makes reading a book seem tedious .
Books do n't have sound effects , and their brains have to do all the work . "
Computer advocates like to point out that the Internet allows for all kinds of intellectual challenges -- especially when students use E-mail , or post notes in " newsgroup " discussions , to correspond with accomplished experts .
Such experts , however , are n't consistently available .
When they are , online " conversations " generally take place when correspondents are sitting alone , and the dialogue lacks the unpredictability and richness that occur in face - to - face discussions .
In fact , when youngsters are put into groups for the " collaborative " learning that computer defenders celebrate , realistically only one child sits at the keyboard at a time .
( During my school visits children tended to get quite possessive about the mouse and the keyboard , resulting in frustration and noisy disputes more often than collaboration . )
In combination these constraints lead to yet another of the childhood developmentalists ' concerns -- that computers encourage social isolation .
Just a Glamorous Tool
T would be easy to characterize the battle over computers as merely another chapter in the world 's oldest story : humanity 's natural resistance to change .
But that does an injustice to the forces at work in this transformation .
This is not just the future versus the past , uncertainty versus nostalgia ; it is about encouraging a fundamental shift in personal priorities -- a minimizing of the real , physical world in favor of an unreal " virtual " world .
It is about teaching youngsters that exploring what 's on a two - dimensional screen is more important than playing with real objects , or sitting down to an attentive conversation with a friend , a parent , or a teacher .
By extension , it means downplaying the importance of conversation , of careful listening , and of expressing oneself in person with acuity and individuality .
In the process , it may also limit the development of children 's imaginations .
Perhaps this is why Steven Jobs , one of the founders of Apple Computer and a man who claims to have " spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet , " has come to a grim conclusion : " What 's wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology , " he told Wired magazine last year .
" No amount of technology will make a dent ....
You 're not going to solve the problems by putting all knowledge onto CD - ROMs .
We can put a Web site in every school -- none of this is bad .
It 's bad only if it lulls us into thinking we 're doing something to solve the problem with education . "
Jane David , the consultant to Apple , concurs , with a commonly heard caveat .
" There are real dangers , " she told me , " in looking to technology to be the savior of education .
But it wo n't survive without the technology . "
Arguments like David 's remind Clifford Stoll of yesteryear 's promises about television .
He wrote in Silicon Snake Oil , " Sesame Street " ... has been around for twenty years .
Indeed , its idea of making learning relevant to all was as widely promoted in the seventies as the Internet is today .
So where 's that demographic wave of creative and brilliant students now entering college ?
Did kids really need to learn how to watch television ?
Did we inflate their expectations that learning would always be colorful and fun ?
Computer enthusiasts insist that the computer 's " interactivity " and multimedia features make this machine far superior to television .
Nonetheless , Stoll wrote , I see a parallel between the goals of " Sesame Street " and those of children 's computing .
Both are pervasive , expensive and encourage children to sit still .
Both display animated cartoons , gaudy numbers and weird , random noises ....
Both give the sensation that by merely watching a screen , you can acquire information without work and without discipline .
As the technology critic Neil Postman put it to a Harvard electronic - media conference , " I thought that television would be the last great technology that people would go into with their eyes closed .
Now you have the computer . "
The solution is not to ban computers from classrooms altogether .
But it may be to ban federal spending on what is fast becoming an overheated campaign .
After all , the private sector , with its constant supply of used computers and the computer industry 's vigorous competition for new customers , seems well equipped to handle the situation .
In fact , if schools can impose some limits -- on technology donors and on themselves -- rather than indulging in a consumer frenzy , most will probably find themselves with more electronic gear than they need .
That could free the billions that Clinton wants to devote to technology and make it available for impoverished fundamentals : teaching solid skills in reading , thinking , listening , and talking ; organizing inventive field trips and other rich hands - on experiences ; and , of course , building up the nation 's core of knowledgeable , inspiring teachers .
These notions are considerably less glamorous than computers are , but their worth is firmly proved through a long history .
Last fall , after the school administrators in Mansfield , Massachusetts , had eliminated proposed art , music , and physical - education positions in favor of buying computers , Michael Bellino , an electrical engineer at Boston University 's Center for Space Physics , appeared before the Massachusetts Board of Education to protest .
" The purpose of the schools [ is ] to , as one teacher argues , ' Teach carpentry , not hammer , ' " he testified .
" We need to teach the whys and ways of the world .
Tools come and tools go .
Teaching our children tools limits their knowledge to these tools and hence limits their futures . "

Geek Culture Considered Harmful to Perl
Geeks tend to treat others who disagree with loud , obvious disdain .
These behaviors are harmful both to the disagreer and to the community as a whole .
Originally presented as a Lightning Talk at YAPC ::NA 2002 .
Hi , thanks for coming and listening .
I 'd like to introduce myself .
My name is Andy Lester .
I 've been working with Perl for about seven of my sixteen professional programming years .
I 'm an editor and author for The Perl Review .
I maintain HTML :: Lint , a module for checking validity of HTML code , and Apache : : Lint , a mod_perl handler that automates the process .
I 'm also on the cpan-testers list , the folks that Brian King was just talking about .
And , I 'm a fuckhead .
At least that 's what I 've been tagged by one of our esteemed Perl developers .
I 'm not really a fuckhead , of course , and the specifics of the exchange do n't matter , but being so dubbed because of a disagreement is a perfect example of the chronic problem of pointlessly hostile behavior that makes
Perl less fun and degrades the value of the Perl community as a whole .
Eric Raymond notes in The Jargon File that " [ h ] ackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with other people . "
Specifically , we forget that there are actual people on the other end of the email we send .
Even knowing this , and after years of fighting this in my own life , it still scares me .
Please , do n't accept this part of your hacker nature .
Real people do n't need to call their colleagues " fuckhead " .
People are all there is
People are Perl 's only asset .
The code can be recreated , but if the people disappear , Perl starts the quick slide into the toilet .
It is incumbent on each of us to maintain the assets of Perl .
Attacking and degrading your co-assets is counterproductive .
Nat Torkington put it beautifully last year , after a flame war resulted in a casualty on the team : " [ I ] t's hard to find capable intelligent volunteers " , and " chas[ing ] one away [ is ] a reprehensible act of destruction . "
" A reprehensible act of destruction . "
Think about that next time before you fan the next flame war .
In case there 's anyone out there who thinks that they 're more valuable than anyone else , wake up .
We are all peers .
Our skills and contributions are different , but we 're still peers .
Besides , nothing warrants the sort of sneering disdain that 's often heaped upon the newer members .
Tim O'Reilly : " Open Source means anyone can join the party as an equal participant . "
An equal participant .
Hacking core code and driving Perl 6's direction are only the high - profile roles .
Without the little guys , you have little more than a language that runs .
The CPAN is more than just the core modules .
Plus , for those of you who are in leadership roles in the community , it 's even more important for you to be civil to your fellow programmer .
You are representing Perl .
If Larry was as much of a jerk as some of the rest of us are , Perl would be a ghost language .
There 's more to this than just destroying the community .
It 's also about underutilizing the resources available .
When you 're at the point of tagging someone as " fuckhead " , or " stupid " , you 've probably flipped the Bozo Bit .
The Bozo Bit was introduced in Dynamics of Software Development .
It 's the mythical switch you flip on someone after they 've done or said something that you deem stupid .
It 's a permanent black mark against that person , and once its set , anything else coming from that person is deemed worthless .
" And as far as his making a contribution is concerned , he 's just dead weight , a bozo . "
( By the way , if you saw this book and saw it was from Microsoft and assumed it must be trash , that 's flipping the Bozo Bit , too . )
The Bozo Bit also indicates a fear of things that are different .
It 's a lot easier to tag someone a bozo if they 're different , and yet those are exactly the people we should be turning to for their differing backgrounds and insights , Perl - related or not .
There 's so much talent and areas of knowledge beyond mere Perl hackery , if we 'd just look for it .
We all know about Larry being a linguist , and Randal 's karaoke and Damian 's love of Latin and Klingon , but what about the others ?
A random survey of Perl 's expertise include a pediatric pathologist , an MP in the National Guard , a pharmaceutical research chemist , a banjo player , an expert in go , a knife collector and wine connoisseur , a PhD in physics , some Biblical scholars , and a photographer who 's designed wheelchairs and taught deaf kids math .
Imagine what we can learn from these people if we just take advantage of it .
This diversity is a huge challenge , too .
The Perl community is literally global .
The dangers of electronic communication are tough enough , but cultural differences make it worse .
What may be an off - handed joke to you may be a great insult to someone from another .
We owe it to Perl to watch carefully for these inadvertant slights .
So what can you do ?
What can you , personally , do to keep Perl fun and useful for all ?
First , get off your high horse .
No one is any better than anyone else .
" Open Source means anyone can join the party as an equal participant . "
Second , think before you type .
What you say will be archived , logged or otherwise stored in some permanent form for Google to pick up within days .
This goes for IRC logs , too .
" This will go down on your permanent record " has never been so literally true .
Third , do n't accept it from others .
Some people may need private reminders of varying firmness , but they do need them .
In some cases , I do think we need to act as our brothers ' and sisters ' keepers .
Finally , remember this :
We 're all fuckheads sometimes .
Cut the other fuckhead a little slack , willya ?
Thanks for listening .
Back to Perl , or home .

And there she was onstage , in her literal Broadway debut , the very first preview of Three Days of Rain , and she was wearing a trench coat she would n’t take off and holding a big valise she would n’t put down .
Her hair was pulled tightly back .
She was a stiff .
It might have been nerves , but it might have also been — to give her the benefit of the doubt — that the woman she was playing was a stiff .
Even so , she could n’t find a way to animate her character ’s unease .
She just stood there .
She was far livelier in the second act , a flashback in which she played the mother of her first - act character , described as “ Zelda Fitzgerald ’s less stable sister . ”
She was n’t that charismatically crazy , but she could move freely and wave her hands and smoke and flirt and drawl like the Georgia peach she once was .
And she could smile , which always helps .
All the same , one of the happiest moments of the night came when she dropped a fake tomato and it bounced — as plastic tomatoes will — and she broke character and had the giggles for 20 or 30 seconds .
Another was the curtain call with the lights all the way up , when she came downstage with a huge grin , having made it through her first public performance .
It was the first time I thought , “ It ’s Julia Roberts ! ”
It ’s patently unfair to pass judgment publicly on an actor in a first preview — although at these prices …
( Tickets were going for $ 100 a pop , and mine cost $ 250 through a broker . )
But it ’s fair to say that Julia Roberts did not seem like a natural onstage .
When her co-star Bradley Cooper made his entrance , the difference hit you at once .
Even though this is also his Broadway debut , his gestures were expansive — he physicalized everything .
You could read him from way back in my seat in Row R , whereas you could only have read Roberts with a pair of opera glasses .
Of course , a lot of people had brought opera glasses .
Every season , theatrically unseasoned American movie stars ignore the advice of agents and managers and accountants and , touchingly , expose themselves in “ legit ” theater .
In interviews , they say they have a hunger to play a part from beginning to end , instead of doing one little shot at a time — take after take after take — over four to six weeks , with most scenes out of order .
Some film stars have an itch to make direct contact with the people .
In The Season , William Goldman ’s portrait of a year ( 1967–68 ) on Broadway , George C. Scott explained that he always went back to the theater because he was tired of directors , editors , and producers making a mess of his movies .
Onstage , he said , there are n’t “ fourteen fucking neurotics between you and the audience . ”
But the stage is a different arena , with different physical laws .
In A Streetcar Named Desire , a cunning hambone like Alec Baldwin outshines Jessica Lange , one of the most electrifying film actresses of her generation .
Denzel Washington — a great seducer of the camera , one of those sleekly self - centered creatures who can reshape time and space — looks almost ordinary .
Washington ’s 2005 turn as Brutus in Julius Caesar was admirably ungimmicky , without a trace of ham .
His entrance was confident and yet cagey , taking the measure of the space as he let us take the measure of him .
The problems began when he opened his mouth .
He gabbled his speeches in a voice that came too much from his head , and ran out of breath at the ends of lines .
He seized on individual words as if they might rescue him from the rushing tide of verse .
In the end , he did n’t drown — merely shrank .
In the underrated , bracingly colloquial production of Hedda Gabler that just ended a sold - out run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , Cate Blanchett seemed temperamentally unsuited to the role ( which could be taken as a compliment ) .
True , it was refreshing to see a Hedda who was n’t the usual glowering gorgon , and there were moments when Blanchett ’s flibbertigibbet antics were fascinating :
This Hedda might have been a shrewd actress playing Nora in the first half of A Doll ’s House , which made the supporting characters seem less cretinously oblivious than usual .
What was missing from Blanchett ’s performance was weight — and with it the demonic radiance that lifts Ibsen ’s drama out of the drawing room and into the realm of myth .
Most movie stars have some Method training , but the “ classic ” Method — which focuses on psychological self - plumbing — has generated a lot more revelatory film than stage acting .
In theater , there ’s no substitute for the boot camp of drama schools like Juilliard and Yale — classes in dance ( all kinds ) , movement , clowning , speech , Shakespearean speech , and singing , along with endless scene work and a chance to tackle the theater ’s meatiest roles .
When stage actors refer to their bodies as their “ instruments , ” they ’re not just being pretentious .
They must be finely tuned .

The movie stars who began onstage move naturally from one medium to the other .
That means the majority of Brits , who have a rich tradition of repertory .
One of our greatest living actors , Vanessa Redgrave , can almost achieve the same degree of intimacy with a theater audience that she can with a movie camera — high praise .
Maybe the greatest film actor of all , Marlon Brando , reportedly had the stature and emotional intensity to grab a theater audience , and his disdain for rehearsal kept his performances raw .
But he was too capricious , too undisciplined , too lazy to go back to Broadway once his star had risen .
Onstage , Dustin Hoffman ’s relish for transforming himself is even more delightful than onscreen .
Christopher Walken began his career as a brilliant hoofer , and it ’s thrilling to see him in Shakespeare or Chekhov because you can tell he never says a line the same way twice .
In the seventies , Meryl Streep , a drama student at Yale , was the most exciting stage actress I ’d ever seen .
When she played a Salvation Army worker in Happy End on Broadway , her machine - gun patter , combined with her dexterous juggling of props , made me gasp at her virtuosity , and a pratfall - somersault she did as Dunyasha in Andrei Serban ’s Lincoln Center production of The Cherry Orchard stopped the show .
But in her flashy early film performances , her stage training got in her way .
She became the queen of exotic accents , and the kind of busyness that was so dazzling onstage made her more remote onscreen than , say , Jessica Lange or Debra Winger .
She was n’t what Method actors call “ in the moment . ”
Streep has given sensational performances in movies , but when she effectively gave up the stage , we lost a major theatrical presence .
( What a Hedda she ’d have made ! )
And then there are the Broadway stars who ’ve never captured the public ’s imagination onscreen .
Kevin Kline is always a treat in the theater , but he ’s almost too restless for the kinds of dramas he usually does .
( His best work , his Oscar - winning turn in A Fish Called Wanda , was over - the - top farce . )
The superb Cherry Jones does n’t have star presence on film .
It might be that she disappears too deeply into her roles , whereas real movie stars bring their parts into themselves , adapting them to their outsize personalities .
No matter how different their characters , you can always say , “ There ’s Bogie !
There ’s Jack ! ”
Or , “ There ’s Julia ! ”
Then there are the Broadway stars , like Nathan Lane , who are all surface onscreen .
In close - up , there ’s nothing to see .
The close - up is Julia Roberts ’s voodoo .
Critics and elite cineastes discuss Julia Roberts with a certain amount of condescension .
No one claims she ’s not a true movie star , but is she much of an actress ?
Her industry colleagues gave her an Oscar for Erin Brockovich , but Laura Linney snagged all the critics ’ prizes that year for You Can Count On Me .
To critics , Julia was just being , you know , Julia — only with a potty mouth and in short - short dresses and a push - up bra .
On the other hand , Roberts has inspired in this reviewer a fair amount of gush .
During my tenure as film critic of Slate , readers made sport of my frequent application of the word “ thoroughbred . ” I stand by it .
It ’s not that she ’s an icon of glamour .
This is a woman who was once married in bare feet , and part of her charm is that she does n’t move especially gracefully .
It ’s not that her features are refined , either .
They ’re outsize , even freaky : that friendly , unpatrician nose with its bumpy slope and large nostrils ; that smile that ’s wider than most people ’s heads .
( As Morris Day said to the wrong actress in Purple Rain , “ Your lips would make a lollipop too happy . ” )
It ’s that somehow those clown - princess features coalesce into one of the best faces ever captured on the big screen .
She ’s plainly gorgeous in still photos , but it ’s in motion that the real magic happens .
She can entrance you with the tiniest shifts in expression .
And does she know it !
Early in her career , Roberts had a reputation for being edgy , hypersensitive , and on sets a huge pain in the ass .
She needed constant stroking , rather like a skittish , um , thoroughbred .
Her performances were needy , too .
The most highly paid actress in film history made her name as heartbreakingly vulnerable working - class girls — like the hotcha Portuguese - American waitress in shorty dresses ( displaying a cushy derriere that has n’t looked so generous since ) in her breakthrough , Mystic Pizza , a feel - good salt - ( and - oregano - ) of - the - earth female - bonding picture .
It was , of course , in Pretty Woman that Roberts bonded permanently with the mass audience , as — it ’s weird to write this now about a $ 20 million –a–picture screen goddess — a cheap hooker .
Before she ’s rescued by ( and , morally speaking , rescues ) her hostile - takeover Prince Charming ( Richard Gere ) , she ’s cruelly snubbed by the hoity - toity saleswomen of Rodeo Drive .
But she blooms when the luxuries flow her way .
Who can forget when she gleefully wriggles into one little couture number after another ?
Or her whoop of joy in a big sudsy tub — followed by a delirious slide under the bubbles ?
Even those of us who bridled at the movie ’s retro sexual politics were smitten .
For a while it was a bumpy affair .
When she played the companion and lover of a terminally ill rich boy ( Campbell Scott ) in the mildewed Dying Young , her smiles came too far apart .
( The ads might as well have said , “ Julia Roberts Is Dying Young . ” )
A brave change of pace as the housemaid to Dr. Jekyll in Mary Reilly proved that accents were n’t her forte , and mousy self - effacement did n’t become her .
In Something to Talk About , Kyra Sedgwick ( as her character ’s sister ) upstaged her .
It was Sedgwick in the flouncy skirts , and Sedgwick whose face looked broken in by life .
But the bumps did n’t last long .
And , oh , what a joy it was to see her get her mojo back in My Best Friend ’s Wedding , a romantic farce in which her character — a food critic with an aversion to commitment — sets out to sabotage the wedding of an ex-beau to a sparkling heiress ( Cameron Diaz ) .
The mission is selfish , and the character suffers one well - deserved humiliation after another ; and in this bracing context , Roberts shows crack timing and a gift for dizzy slapstick .
Daring to be unsympathetic , she seems more self - possessed onscreen , more conscious of her own power .
Opposite then - boyfriend Benjamin Bratt , she ’s shockingly effective as a Medusa - like seductress on Law & Order .
As Hollywood superstar Anna Scott in Notting Hill , she has an affect that ’s wary and daringly flat .
She might be signaling something about her own runaway celebrity : that in the face of so much attention you ca n’t help but be overdefended .
It ’s a battle just to stay human .
Notting Hill was a breakthrough in other ways — a perfect demonstration of her mastery of the close - up .
Her immobility is always pregnant .
In response to Hugh Grant ’s adorable abashment , her face is almost frozen — but there ’s the slightest suggestion of movement under the surface that prepares you for her impulse to kiss him .
Her defensive stillness is the perfect counterpoint to later scenes in which Anna lets down her guard .
She sits at the kitchen table of commoner William Thacker ( Grant ) with no makeup and moves you with the utter simplicity of her acting .
Her close - ups do n’t come off as the usual movie - star narcissism , because she ’s almost always responding to someone else .
The thrill of Erin Brockovich was watching Roberts tackle a working - class woman again — seeing her stride into an office on those long legs and blast the hell out of anyone in her way .
She had a teasing rapport with the groggy , thickset Albert Finney .
In fact , for an object of beauty , Roberts works better with other actors ( generally male ) than almost any star I can think of .
In Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride , she warms up Richard Gere , an actor whose Buddha - like self - containment can border on self - love , but who seems tickled when he can reflect Roberts ’s light .
In The Pelican Brief , she makes the sometimes - remote Denzel Washington almost fatherly .
In My Best Friend ’s Wedding , she manages to penetrate Rupert Everett ’s languid self - regard .
In a low - key , vulnerable , and overlooked turn in Closer , Roberts makes a cold - fish Jude Law look genuinely horny .
Her close - ups do n’t come off as the usual movie - star narcissism , because she ’s almost always responding to someone else .
Given her utter control as an actress , it can take you aback to see Roberts on talk shows being , well , actressy .
In her Academy Awards acceptance speech , she frankly declared that the rules did n’t apply to her , that she and she alone was entitled to override the ( admittedly obnoxious ) orchestral hook .
She even threatened the conductor .
But magazine profiles in the past five years have focused on her attempts to come off as a “ normal ” person — knitting on the set , dispensing with airs , even making an effort to bond with lowly crew members .
Her marriage ( after broken engagements , many public affairs , and a short - lived union with Lyle Lovett ) has given her twins and multiple covers of People .
She has talked about giving up acting and being a mother .
She has developed a healthy sense of humor about her movie stardom and seems to enjoy being teased by Steven Soderbergh .
In Full Frontal , she delivers a devastating ( but so subtle ) portrait of an overly entitled star issuing orders to an assistant .
And after her ill - at - ease turn in Ocean ’s Eleven , she steals Ocean ’s Twelve when her character is forced to impersonate … Julia Roberts .
What a marvelous farcical turn it is — giddy to the point of hysteria but again , perfectly controlled .
As an actress , Julia Roberts is still peaking .
So why Broadway — and why Richard Greenberg ’s 1997 play Three Days of Rain , which is n’t remotely a star vehicle ( or a particularly flashy piece of dramaturgy ) ?
It seems that the package was put together by Roberts ’s agency , CAA , which also boasts as clients Greenberg and Joe Mantello , the show ’s director .
But there ’s clearly a large and very public agenda in Roberts ’s choice of this relatively modest stage role :
She ’s doing the working - actress thing instead of the movie - star thing .
She ’s staying in one place , New York City , with her twins and husband .
And if access to her is as tightly controlled by her handlers as ever , there ’s a mob scene every night outside the stage - door alley , where her fans can get an eyeful .
And no one will be able to keep from her any bad reviews .
Which brings us back to the Bernard B. Jacobs
Theatre , where I returned exactly two weeks after that first preview .
Let ’s be clear :
This is n’t a review .
That would , again , be unfair ( even though my ticket was once more $ 250 ) .
It would also be stepping on the feet of this magazine ’s excellent theater critic , who will deliver his review next week ( the play opens this Wednesday ) .
But I can report on the changes .
In the first scene , her hair is down .
Big improvement !
She charges into the space ; she ’s brisker , more animated .
She still carries that damn shoulder bag and spends too much time with her arms crossed .
But her features are readable , at least in Row M , and on certain lines , she gestures with her head — something she ’d never do onscreen .
She ’s learning .
Gradually , though , she recedes :
The cruel fact is that in Act One , the two guys get all the histrionic speeches — it ’s their play — while her character sits and watches .
At intermission , the audience is visibly deflated .
They want her to be larger - than - life , to dominate .
It ’s not like we meanies want to see Our Julia fall flat on her face , the way we might if this were , say , Madonna or Demi .
Even if she stank up the stage ( which she does n’t remotely ) , those of us lucky ( and wealthy ) enough to score tickets have the privilege of saying we were in the same space , at the same time , breathing the same air as America ’s favorite movie star .
And maybe , conversely , we have the privilege of saying that we had , for the first time , some power in the relationship — dependent as she was on our applause .
For a movie star like Julia Roberts , the stage is empowering and disabling .
In a way she has more control — she ’s Out There , on the wire , proving that she does n’t need handlers to protect her or directors to stroke her after every take .
But her superhuman powers do n’t work here ; she ’s vulnerable to laughs and cheers that might not come .
True , this is what happens with every single theater actor on every stage everywhere , but come on : This is Julia we ’re talking about .

Disposable Scalpels ( $ 10 , 10 pk )
I grew up in a household where both of my parents went to art school and they had not gotten in the habit of using scissors to cut paper and things .
If you wanted to cleanly cut paper , you put it down on something , on a piece of glass or something and you use a razor blade to cut it .
So I grew up using razorblades instead of scissors , which is not the safest thing , but it ’s a habit I got into .
And I always noticed that not - great scissors leave terrible edges .
I have been using razorblades for a long time , but they are awkward to hold and difficult and hard to precisely get into places .
So I discovered not too long ago , disposable scalpels .
They last for quite a long time .
I ’m not very tough on them .
There ’s various shapes , they ’re super useful for cleaning up 3D prints and cutting things precisely .
They are wickedly sharp when they finally do go and they can crack because they ’re not that tough .
I put a piece of tape over them .
So no one gets cut when they go into the garbage .
Threaded Inserts
A threaded insert is basically a plug with a screw hole in the middle of it , and there are many kinds .
So what I do is when I 3D print something , I leave a 6.5 millimeter hole where I want the bolt hole to be .
And then when it ’s time to put together , I put the threaded insert on the tip of a solder iron , and I just push it into the hole and it lines up and pops in .
And now I have a brass threaded slot in my 3D print .
There are ones that have external threads so that you can screw them in .
And in fact , on a CNC table that I made , our CNC router table , I drilled holes and then I screwed in brass threaded inserts .
I put like a hundred threaded inserts into this piece of plywood .
And then I could bolt down anything I wanted and then unbolt it , re-bolt it , because the brass is going to survive the threading and unthreading for a long time .
Slim Project Case ( $ 45 , 10 pk )
This is an organizational thing that I use .
Basically , if I ’m working on a circuit board , like an Arduino with a sensor and there ’s eight parts and three tools and whatever , I put all this stuff in the project case together .
And what happens is when I have to swap to another project , or I get blocked on this project , I can just close the thing up , and put it on the shelf .
Many of my projects are small enough to fit in that .
I do have larger bins for bigger projects , but I have dozens of these .
And it lets me keep everything together .
Especially if I ’m using a special tool or something , I ’ll just put the tools in the box with it directly .
So that means that when I want to pick up a project , everything is already organized and put together in one spot .
So I do n’t spend a lot of time gathering the pieces to work on something , working on it , and then scattering the pieces when I have to stop working on it .
The McMaster - Carr Catalog
McMaster - Carr is the ultimate hardware store .
They have everything .
And it ’s literally the best e-commerce site I ’ve ever , ever seen , plus education on everything .
There ’s a plastic section and they will tell you , this plastic has good durability but poor machinability , and this one will melt at whatever .
There was a physical catalog , but I do n’t have one , I go online and it was kind of the inspiration for the Wheelhouse mailing lists that I run , which is like about 60 % of the time , I ’ll talk to a very active maker and they ’ve never heard of this .
And I ’m like , how do you survive ?
I will still go to Amazon a lot for bolts or whatever , it ’s fine , but for like really expensive things like the linear rail I bought , I assume that the McMaster ’s just carrying the good stuff .
I ’m so uneducated .
I do n’t know what even the name of the thing that might solve the problem is .
So I will just type stuff that ’s sort of related to the problem into the search box , like clips , grabby clips , long clips , et cetera .
And you will get stuff .
That ’s the problem with Amazon — if you ask for something sufficiently weird or obscure , you just get like , t- shirts .
About Wheelhouse mailing list :
Wheelhouse is basically three or four things that you might add to your repertoire as a maker .
It ’s a new material , it ’s a new kind of tool , or it ’s a new kind of technique .
And the idea is that there is some reasonable chance that you ’ve never heard of it .
For example , a couple of weeks ago , I saw a YouTube video that you can cause silicone molds to grow or shrink with the application of mineral oil .
So you can actually scale 3D parts .
And I was just like , Holy crap , that seems very useful , right , and then you put that in your pocket for later .
And on top of that , I try to get cross pollination from other communities .
I was watching a video about a cosplay costume build and she glued two pieces of foam together and then just sanded it down and it never would ’ve occurred to me that you could use sandpaper on foam to clean it up and it worked fine .
And I ’m like , well that seems useful for cosplay , but you could probably use that for other things .
I found one in a vintage computer restoration thing .
They used baking soda and crazy glue , cyanoacrylate glue .
And basically you put a little bit of glue on and then you put the powder on and it solidifies to rock hard instantly .
But it ’s not so tough that you ca n’t just file it down .
So they basically restored like a commodore 64 part and painted it .
And I ’m like , crap .
That seems useful .

It ’s amazing how sociopaths are given guns and power in wartime , yet they get off with light sentences when they go bat - shit crazy , as if the people in charge expected it .
Coverage of the debate in both the House and the Senate on measures to endorse the current policy in Iraq , referred to a mysterious set of talking points , called the Iraq Floor Debate Prep Book .
The Washington Post wrote :
“ Their position was bolstered by a 74 - page document drafted by the White House and distributed by the Pentagon , replete with talking points , quotations and timelines to back administration policy .
Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - Wash . ) called the document “ an affront to the American people . ”
Some have raised questions about the legality of the document ( because of bans against using Executive branch funds to lobby Congress ) and it was formally withdrawn .
We asked Senator Lautenberg ’s office for a copy of the document , which it kindly provided , along with a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld .
Ancient Hawaiians started building their monumental temples at least three centuries earlier than previously thought , a new study suggests .
They also spent more time building them , renovating and constructing new temples in waves depending on the island 's political situation .
" This research provides conclusive evidence that the Maui temple network grew and expanded over a period at least five centuries , " said Michael Kolb , an anthropologist at Northern Illinois University and author of the study .
" It 's clear that the temple system evolved as part of a long trajectory of social and political change that also saw a shift from ancestral to sacrificial worship . "
Kolb spent more than a decade on the island of Maui gathering samples from the ruins of 40 separate temples , which Hawaiians call heiau .
Because the land under each temple was scorched to make way for building , Kolb was able to use radiocarbon dating to assert that the first stones were laid on the earliest around the beginning of the 13th century .
Previous research using fewer samples dated the first temples no earlier than 1600 A.D. Anthropologists in the past have had a hard time gathering as much data as he did because of the temples ' sacred quality and the fact that many are still in use today , Kolb said .
The results of his study will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Current Anthropology .
Four peaks in temple construction seem to coincide with tumultuous periods of social and political change in the Kingdom of Maui , according to known oral histories .
" Most of the building happens during formative phases , when you 're beginning to see the emergence of states , " Kolb told LiveScience .
" They relied on monumental architecture to consolidate rulership and as a show of force towards enemies . "
Similar patterns of construction linked to economic and political shifts are visible in Egypt and other ancient civilizations like the Maya , he noted .
The largest and most elaborate temples on Maui were adorned with towers , pits and sacrificial altars for making offerings to the Hawaiian gods of war .
Many were built into cliff - sides and one , the mammoth Pi'ilanihale complex , covered an area larger than a football field .
These sophisticated buildings also marked a significant change in the religious life of Maui 's ancient people , according to Kolb .
" The early monuments were typically open - aired temples for community ancestral worship , " he said .
" Many of the early structures were modified or new ones were built with enclosures on top .
Access was limited to reward loyal constituents , and sacrificial worship became more of the focus . "
The Hawaiian Islands have been occupied since about 300 A.D. , when Polynesian settlers made their way over in large voyaging canoes .
In 1778 , famous British explorer Captain James Cook was the first westerner to make contact with the islanders .
That 's nice .
Apparently the Washington
Post is now going for the all - important racist readership in Washington , DC .
You do have to love the Post .
Earlier this year they freak out when a bunch of liberal blog readers post mean comments on their blog , then they turn around and decide to re-enter the blogging fray by hiring a 24 year old kid with no journalism experience who 's a far - right , FAR right , Martin - Luther - King - hating Republican writing for a rather far - right Republican blog .
And this is going to help because ?
I think what the other bloggers , like Jane , are saying is correct - this is gonna be fun to watch .
The Washington Post is having its jump - the - shark moment .
They 're putting their credibility in the hands of a 24 year old kid with a proven record of being , well , a bit kooky .
The Post has two options , both of them bad .
Either the Washington Post is heavily editing what this guy writes , and in that case it 's no longer a real blog ( can you imagine a real red-stater , or any real blogger , letting a Washington Post editor rewrite their material ) .
Not to mention , if the Post edits what this guy writes then the Post OWNS what this guy writes as they 've obviously signed off on it .
Or , the kid is n't being edited at all , in which case the Post is trusting their credibility and the credibility of their real journalists , to Ann Coulter 's younger brother .
Because , in the end , the Post can play the game of claiming their .com does n't represent the " real " Washington Post , but that redstate herring is n't going to work - if it says " Washington Post " at the top of the screen , that 's all folks need to know .
The real irony is that right after having what they defined as a horrible experience with the blogs ( i.e. , people were mean ) , the Post decides to embrace " the blogs " by nuzzling up to its worst elements , right - winger bloggers .
If the Post thought left wing blogs can be tough , I truly can't wait until they realize how bad things are on the freeper side of the digital divide .
We at least actually do represent the mainstream of America - an angry mainstream , to be sure , but mainstream .
The right - wing blogs represent Idaho , on a good day .
This entire Washington
Post blogger experience , it 's like watching a puppy walk into the Coliseum .
You 're horrified by what you 're about to see , but at the same time , you really want to get some popcorn .
Let the games begin .
PS Don't be confused by the link I provide above , it IS the Washington Post guy who said this .
Best Practices for Object / Relational Mapping and Persistence APIs
Over the last decade there has been a lot of effort put into object / relational mapping , which refers to techniques for resolving the mismatches between the object - oriented world , with its encapsulation of data and behavior , and the relational world , with its tables and columns .
There ’s not only a difference in terms of data types ( and complexity of these data types ) but also in terms of relationship types .
The object world has a variety of relationships ( aggregation , composition , association , inheritance ) which cannot be mapped directly to the database world .
The general topic of object / relational ( O/R ) mapping can be divided into two areas of concern : the mapping itself and the persistence API .
The persistence API not only acts as an indirection layer for the database , but also hides the mechanics of mapping the objects to the database tables .
A good persistence API should do this while not constraining the object modeling in terms of data types and relationships .
In this article I will begin with a discussion of home - grown vs. off - the - shelf persistence solutions , including areas to consider when deciding between the two , and advice for choosing the best off - the - shelf solution to meet your needs .
I will also share suggestions and advice from my own experiences with O/R mapping and persistence APIs .
It is not my intention to explain all of the background details of these topics , but to focus on " best practices . "
Home - Grown Mapping
I have been directly involved with both home - grown ( custom built ) and commercial - off - the - shelf ( COTS ) mappers , and have also observed several other home - grown mapper implementations , each approaching the subject in a specific way .
In my experience , the primary drawback of " rolling your own " persistence mapping implementation is that limited resources do not allow for enough time to think everything through , to improve the framework over time , and to backtrack if you realize that design changes are needed .
Because an O/R mapper is a generic piece of software , it is typically hard to explicitly list which aspects are of the most importance to you ( and if you build your own , you will not be able to focus on all of them ) .
I do not mean to say that you could not envision a good design , but that it would take a lot of time and effort to fully implement a solution that meets all of your needs .
I observed the following limitations in just one home - grown O/R mapper :
It provided no support for association relationships ; only containment relationships were supported .
This was a serious constraint when defining the object model .
It offered no support for transactions .
It only supported one RDBMS .
The API was not type safe , which caused a lot of errors that could only be detected at run time .
Testing of the O/R mapper was underestimated .
Not only were there a lot of possible paths through the code , there were also stability and performance issues to be considered .
The designer had to create and maintain the object model by editing a plain text file without any special editor .
I know the saying " a fool with a tool is still a fool , " but not being able to visualize one ’s own object model is like walking around in the dark — you do n’t see where you are heading and you have difficulties in pointing the others in the correct direction .
In this case , the object model , which was like a red ribbon winding through the whole architecture , could not be clearly communicated to the team .
I hope these examples are enough to help you to avoid stepping into a home - grown solution .
Of course , a home grown O/R mapping project would be fun to do from a development point of view , but a COTS ( commercial - off - the - shelf ) O/R mapper will be cheaper — unless you consider O/R mapping as one of the core competencies of your business .
Selecting a COTS O/R Mapper Below I list some criteria you might want to consider when selecting an O/R mapper .
Consider whether the tool will restrict your modeling freedom too much .
For example , many tools do n’t support relationships on abstract classes .
A workaround for this is to duplicate relationships on concrete classes , which is less ‘ OO ’ , but works for these tools .
Consider whether the O/R mapper that allows you to model visually ( preferably using UML ) .
If UML is important to you , ensure that you can either import UML into the O/R mapper , or that you can export UML from the O/R mapper .
Take a close look at the programming model the O/R mapper imposes and see whether it is compatible with the things you want to get out of it .
Look at the range of mapping possibilities to ensure that the kinds of relationships you envision between your objects and tables will be supported .
Typically , most O/R mappers support a large range of features , but not every mapper supports every type of relationship .
Assess the performance , even if you think you do not have a lot of performance demands .
Testing the performance can also give you a chance to learn and assess the API .
If you prefer or need to start with an existing database schema and then map objects onto it , assess whether the O/R mapper supports the database system you want to use .
Selecting a Persistence API
The O/R mapping features are only part of the story .
The other part of the story is the selection of a good API for persisting objects , and this part has a lot more visibility to your development team than the O/R mapping part .
While the O/R mapping functionality will only be exposed to a few team members who are dedicated to maintaining the persistence layer , the persistence API defines the interface that the whole development team will use .
Persistence APIs can be divided into two categories : transparent and non-transparent .
Transparent Persistence APIs
A transparent persistence API hides the persistence completely .
A transparent API does not need to have a lot of methods ; a load and a save method is sufficient most of the time .
Typically , a lot is defined declaratively instead of procedurally .
Hibernate and JDO are examples of transparent persistence APIs .
Let me clarify with an example :
An Insurance object can contain 0 -n Warranty objects .
The client application updates an attribute of an Insurance object .
Semantically a Warranty is contained by an Insurance , so when you update an Insurance it is possible that you implicitly update its Warranties .
According to the requirements , this might be a correct design , but it could have a negative impact on performance , especially if I am not aware that the implicit update of the Warranty objects is happening .
When I only have modified an attribute of the Insurance object , I should be able to limit the persistence manager to this functionality .
The beauty of this is the " magic " way in which the persistence manager knows what to do .
The negative side is that the persistence manager is thinking in your place .
Non-Transparent Persistence APIs
A non-transparent persistence API has a lot less " magic " inside of it .
When compared to a transparent persistence API , it has a rich API , offering a lot of control to the user of the API .
Consider a transparent persistence API with a single method Persist ( ) .
This persistence method does all the magic behind the scenes , like checking whether there are associations that potentially need to be persisted as well .
Although this might sound attractive , when selecting a persistence API , ensure that you can optimize .
When touching associations , it is possible that the associated objects have n’t been persisted yet .
What should the Persist ( ) method do ?
Persist those objects first ?
I say that it is better to put the client in control .
To illustrate the power of a non-transparent persistence API , I ’ll use the SimpleORM API as an example .
Consider an insurance class with two methods .
The first method will explicitly load all of the children linked to this object : insurance.getAllChildren(insurance.Warranties )
The second method will only list those items that were added to the object in memory and the ones that are already retrieved from the database : insurance.getRetrievedChildren(insurance .Warranties )
The advantage here is that the user of the API can " see " what he is doing , and can make better decisions regarding performance costs .
( Also during code reviews this visibility can make life a lot easier . )
In contrast , due to the fact that a transparent persistence API has a very generic interface ( e.g. Save ( ) and Load ( ) ) , it also creates the illusion that database actions are cheap .
The cost for the non-transparent API is that the interface is more complex than a transparent persistence API .
However , if you are planning to write your own persistence API , I recommend a non-transparent persistence API .
It is not my intention to classify all transparent persistence APIs as " do not use . "
But if you are considering a transparent persistence API , I would advise you to assess its performance carefully .
In case you are not satisfied with the persistence API that is provided to you , you can also decide to wrap it such that it maps onto your needs .
In the next section , I ’ll elaborate on some good reasons to wrap a COTS persistence API .
Wrapping a COTS O/R Mapper ’s Persistence API
After you have selected a COTS O/R mapper , you should also decide whether to use its persistence API directly or to wrap it .
Good reasons for wrapping the O/R mapper ’s persistence API are :
You want to add some extra logic ( for example , field validation is not part of the O/R mapper , but you want it to be an inherent part of the persistent objects ) .
Some O/R mappers generate code for the persistent objects , others expose a generic API .
Typically , the generated persistent objects are type safe , while the generic API is not .
Type safety is a good reason for wrapping the O/R mapper ’s persistence API .
Apply the subsystem principle : you want to avoid a tight coupling with a specific O/R mapper .
Therefore you treat it as a subsystem and work interface - based .
You want to limit the features that your clients can use .
For example , your mapper might support the use of direct SQL while you do n’t want to expose such a feature .
You might want to expose certain services in a different way .
For example , you might want to introduce a query object rather than to expose an OQL query interface .
Of course you need to place everything in perspective : if you are creating a throw away application , you do n’t need to worry about aspects such as maintainability , extensibility , and resilience .
For strategic applications however ( commercial software products , product families , core business applications , etc. ) you really should spend some time evaluating the pros and cons of different approaches .
A bad reason to wrap a persistence API is that you think that you will be able to boost performance .
In general , you wo n’t be able to do this because the performance is inherent to the internal design of the COTS component .
Only in rare occasions you will be able to turn the performance to your advantage by wrapping the COTS component .
A better way to approach performance is to invest some time in seeking a usage pattern that is optimal for your situation .
Wrapping and Object Management Another way to discriminate between persistence APIs is the way objects are managed .
In one technique , the persistence manager is an object factory ( using the factory pattern ) : MyPersistenceManager mgr = MyPersistenceManager ( ) .
Instance ; Insurance insuranceObj = mgr.CreateInsurance ( ) ; mgr.Persist ( insuranceObj ) ;
An advantage of this approach is that the manager always knows the current state of the object ( new , retrieved , already saved ) .
The manager can use this information to its advantage , resulting in good performance .
In other APIs , such as JDO , the objects are not created within the context of the persistence manager .
The persistence manager takes an object in and determines what to do with it .
In this JDO example , the manager ( mgr ) does not know the current state of the insurance object ( unless perhaps it caches the information ) : PersistenceManager mgr = persistencemanagerFactory.getPersistenceManager( ) ; Insurance insurance = new Insurance ( ) ; insurance .
SetPolicyNumber ( " 2005001001 -110 " ) ; mgr.makePersistent( insurance ) ; Okay , by now I hear you saying " All of this is very interesting , but why is it of my concern ? "
Two reasons : First , consider object management when you want to wrap the persistence API .
Performing the wrapping without knowledge of the pros and cons of different persistence API approaches would be very dangerous .
Second , consider the performance implications .
In the case of the object factory mechanism , you can be quite sure of decent performance .
In the latter mechanism , it ’s advisable to assess the performance by means of some unit tests or architectural prototypes .
Disconnected Objects
A typical disconnected object scenario starts with the retrieval of the object from the database in the server app , then streaming it to the client app , then in - memory modification on the client app , and finally streaming it back and storing it to the database again in the server app .
The way the persistence framework handles disconnected objects has quite a big impact on the performance .
One way to improve the performance of disconnected object persistence is through merging , as in this JBoss example : Insurance insurance = Util.deserialize( input ) ; // Changes are monitored as of now . entityManager.merge(insurance ) ; insurance.setSubscriptionDate(d ) ; entityManager.persist( insurance ) ;
In the above example , only the change of the subscription date is stored in the DB .
Another area of performance concern is keeping track of changes vs. figuring out at the time of persistence what changes have occurred .
The latter technique is more dangerous for performance , especially when complete object trees are being saved .
The algorithm to find out the changes has to be fast , or the original data needs to be cached in order to achieve a good performance .
O/R Mapping Best Practices
I have distilled the following " best practices " from my experiences :
Do n’t work against the O/R mapper ’s persistence design .
Rather , take the O/R mapper ’s design principles as a constraint and exploit them .
If you do n’t , you ’ll have to pay in terms of efficiency , performance , etc .
Also , make sure that you know the basic concepts of the O/R mapper ’s design .
Wrap the O/R persistence API and treat it as a subsystem , such that you work interface - based , which eases the prospect of switching later .
I do n’t say that it wo n’t hurt to switch to another O/R mapper , but at least the pain can be isolated .
Check the querying capabilities of the O/R mapper ’s persistence interface .
Especially , check whether aggregate functions can be used and whether you can query for raw values rather than plain objects .
Objects can be too much of a good thing ( object bloat ) when , for instance , you just need a couple of values to fill a grid .
Implement field metadata wisely .
Generate field metadata ( such as size , etc. ) in - line in metadata classes instead of using reflection .
This improves performance , and also makes it easy to debug the code .
Put field validation at the level of the metadata .
Make sure to expose your field - level business rules such that you do n’t require a round - trip from your client to your server application in order to know whether or not the object is in a correct state to persist it .
Tools such as SimpleORM suffer from this ( typically field validation is foreseen internally , but not exposed ) .
Be careful when calling a field a " mandatory " field .
Typically , O/R mappers foresee the ability to tag certain fields as mandatory .
In my experience , I have seen that this construct is used too much .
Typically fields are mandatory dependent on the state of the object and such interdependencies can seldom be expressed .
Therefore , the best practice is to limit the mandatory fields only to those fields that make the object incorrect within the application domain .
When defining the persistence API , guard its consistency and ease of use .
When specifying the interface of your persistence API , make sure that the parameters of each persistence method are consistent with the rest of the interface .
As an example , the following dummy interface is not consistent because in one case an enumeration is used ( RelationshipName ) , and in the other case a string : SaveRelation ( RelationshipName name , object value ) SaveAttributeToObject ( string attributeName , object o) I would suggest to either go for a type - safe approach or for a generic approach , but not to mix them in one interface .
If you want both of them , then put the generic methods on a separate , more generic interface .
Do n’t make the interface more complex than it should be .
Make sure that the API can be used in a way that a client application can take advantage of its knowledge to optimize performance .

Most childhoods would be incomplete without an incident involving lost skin and a bicycle .
Indeed , given that the bicycle is the world ’s favourite means of transport ( more than 100 million bicycles are sold each year – double the number of cars ) and they all feature a highly - efficient but potentially dangerous chain drive , we ’d suspect that most people will have had an unfortunate recollection of an incident involving a de-railed chain , lost skin , grease and perhaps a destroyed garment or two .
So we like the idea of a bicycle without a chain .
US - based Dynacraft has introduced just such a beastie - the Dekra - D Drive bike has an internal drive shaft which offers less maintenance , greater safety and a cleaner solution than a conventional chain - driven bike by replacing the parts of the bike that cause the most problems and require the most maintenance - the chain and derailleur .
The Dekra D - Drive comfort bike retails for US$ 300.00 .

Washington GOP takes aim at PBS funding House panel backs budget reductions WASHINGTON -- House Republicans yesterday revived their efforts to slash funding for public broadcasting , as a key committee approved a $ 115 million reduction in the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that could force the elimination of some popular PBS and NPR programs .
On a party - line vote , the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees health and education funding approved the cut to the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which distributes money to the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio .
It would reduce the corporation 's budget by 23 percent next year , to $ 380 million , in a cut that Republicans said was necessary to rein in government spending .
The reduction , which would come in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 , must be approved by the full Appropriations Committee , and then the full House and Senate , before it could take effect .
Democrats and public broadcasting advocates began planning efforts to reverse the cut .
A similar move last year by Republican leaders was turned back in a fierce lobbying campaign launched by Public Broadcasting Service stations and Democratic members of Congress , in a debate that was colored by some Republicans ' frustration with what they see as a liberal slant in public programming .
Still , Republicans say they remain adamant that public broadcasting cannot receive funding at the expense of healthcare and education programs .
Republicans are looking for ways to save taxpayers ' dollars , amid fiscal conservatives ' concerns over the budget deficit .
`` We 've got to keep our priorities straight , " said Representative Ralph Regula , an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the appropriations panel that approved the cut .
``
You 're going to choose between giving a little more money to handicapped children versus providing appropriations for public broadcasting . "
Democrats accused Republicans of trying to gut a bastion of children - oriented television to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy that have been backed by the Bush White House .
``Dick Cheney and the Republicans have decided to go hunting for ` Big Bird ' and ` Clifford the Big Red Dog ' once again , " said Representative Edward J. Markey , a Malden Democrat who led the successful effort to reverse the cuts last year .
``PBS is right at the top of their hit list -- always has been and always will be , until they can destroy it . "
Most of the savings would come by eliminating subsidies for educational programs and grants for a number of technological upgrades .
Jan McNamara , a PBS spokeswoman , said the digital upgrade would have to be funded with money that is now being used for other programs , forcing almost all areas of public broadcasting to feel a pinch .
Paula Kerger , PBS 's president and chief executive , said in a statement that the cuts would force the network to ``drastically reduce the programming and services public television and public radio can provide to local communities . "
The literacy television program ``Ready to Learn " would be eliminated , she said , as would the online teachers ' resource ``Ready to Teach . "
The cuts could force smaller public - radio stations in rural areas -- which rely almost exclusively on federal money for operations -- to close altogether , said Kevin Klose , NPR 's president .
`` The impact of today 's decision could resonate in every community in America , " Klose said .
John Lawson , president of the Association of Public Television Stations , said Republican leaders are contradicting their own goal statements by seeking to cut funding for public broadcasting on the day the House voted to increase fines for indecent television content .
`` These cuts are targeted to inflict maximum damage , " Lawson said .
``I guess we 'll have to start ringing phones on [ Capitol ] Hill again . "
The cuts are included in a $ 142 billion spending bill covering domestic social programs in health , education , and labor .
Even with the cuts to public broadcasting , the bill would spend $ 1 billion more in total than is being spent this year on those programs , and $ 4 billion more than President Bush had requested for those areas of spending .
Student loans and research grants to local hospitals are among the areas that would see funding boosts .
The same appropriations subcommittee called last year for an even more drastic cut of $ 223 million from public broadcasting programs .
At the time , Republicans attacked the PBS for programming they said represented out - of - the - mainstream viewpoints , highlighting in particular a ``Postcards From Buster " episode that featured lesbian couples and their children in Vermont .
But , in a defeat for House leaders , 87 Republicans joined unanimous Democrats in bucking an attempt to cut funding from the stations .
Markey expressed confidence that supporters of public broadcasting would have more than enough votes to stop a cut again this year .
Their arguments will carry particular force in an election year in which moderate Republicans fear being portrayed as callous to the demands of their constituents , he said .
Regula also seemed resigned to seeing that sequence of events repeat itself , though he maintained that he was right ``on principle . "
`` They 've got a bigger megaphone than I do , " he said .
`` They 'll trot out Elmo and Mickey Mouse and Lord knows who else , and I 'll be out there kind of by myself . "

Der Bielefelder FoeBud e.V. hat gemeinsam mit dem Chaos Computer Club ein Internetportal eingerichtet , in dem Bürgerinnen und Bürger Akten einstellen und anderen zugänglich machen können , die sie zuvor über das neue Informationsfreiheitsgesetz ( IFG ) angefordert haben .
Damit können andere die hohe Gebühr ( bis zu 500 Euro ) für die Akteneinsicht sparen und die Behörden werden von doppelter Arbeit entlastet .
Die gemeinsame Aktensammelstelle ist ab sofort unter zu erreichen .
" Wir möchten den Bürgern das Informationsfreiheitsgesetz schmackhaft machen und zeigen , dass es tatsächlich genutzt wird " , erläutert Mitinitiator Frank Rosengart vom Chaos Computer Club , " zudem kritisieren wir die hohen Gebühren und möchten die Behörden ermuntern , die Akten von sich aus zu veröffentlichen " .
Auf der Internetplattform können Bürger , Journalisten oder Anwälte sehr einfach die Akten der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich machen , die per IFG von den Behörden " freigekauft " wurden .
So können die Kosten für eine Recherche minimiert werden und der Staat wird transparenter .
Akten , die bereits digital vorliegen , können direkt eingespielt werden .
Ansonsten gibt es auch eine Faxnummer , an die man die Akte schicken kann .
Auch der Postweg steht offen .
Die Aktensammelstellte fungiert als " Marktplatz " , wo sich Interessierte finden können , um die Kosten für eine Anfrage zu teilen .
" Es ist eigentlich die Aufgabe der Behörden , eine solche Plattform bereit zu stellen , aber das wir noch einige Jahre dauern " , bedauert Axel Rüweler vom FoeBuD e.V.
" Die hohen Gebühren kann sich kaum jemand leisten und stehen im krassen Gegensatz zu dem , was das Gesetz eigentlich bezwecken sollte .
Mit dem Portal versuchen wir , den Gebühren ein wenig entgegenzuwirken , aber der Gesetzgeber ist aufgefordert hier , für Abhilfe zu sorgen . "
Hintergrund :
Das " Gesetz zur Regelung des Zugangs zu Informationen des Bundes " oder kurz Informationsfreiheitsgesetz ( IFG ) ist seit dem 1.1.2006 in Kraft .
Das IFG regelt den Zugang zu Akten und Dokumenten und gibt jedem interessierten Bürger die Möglichkeit , beliebige Akten ohne Begründung anzufordern oder einzusehen , sofern nicht wichtige Gründe dagegen sprechen .
In den Bundesländern Berlin , Brandenburg , Nordrhein - Westfalen und Schleswig - Holstein gibt es vergleichbare Gesetze seit Jahren .
Das Auswärtige
Amt war zuletzt in die Kritik geraten , weil es für vier Seiten Fotokopien 106 Euro Gebühren verlangte .
Der FoebuD e.V. möchte Bürgerrechte und Demokratie stärken und auch bei der Einführung neuer Technologien bewahren .
Der Verein ist in der Vergangenheit vor allem durch die Organisation der Big Brother Awards in der Öffentlichkeit bekannt geworden .
Auch im Bereich RFID hat der FoeBuD e.V. richtungsweisende Impulse gesetzt und als erster in Deutschland auf die Risiken der Technologie mit der StopRFID - Kampagne hingewiesen .
Der Chaos Computer Club e.V. setzt sich seit Anfang der 80er Jahre kritisch - kreativ mit neuen Technologien auseinander und beleuchtet die politischen und sozialen Nebenwirkungen der Vernetzung .
Der Club als " Kommunikationsplattform für Hacker " ist durch Vorführungen von Sicherheitsproblemen bekannt geworden und setzt sich für freie Kommunikation in den Datennetzen ein .
Vereinssitz ist Hamburg , und der CCC ist bundesweit mit etwa 2000 Mitgliedern aktiv .
The directive applied to any non-government - issue armor , not just Dragon Skin , and it came from very high up :
The soldier said the order came down Friday morning from Headquarters , United States Special Operations Command ( HQ , USSOCOM ) , located at MacDill Air Force Base , Florida .
But evidently what 's good for the goose ( grunt ) is not good for the gander ( brass ) :
Currently nine U.S. generals stationed in Afghanistan are reportedly wearing Pinnacle Dragon Skin body armor , according to company spokesman Paul Chopra .
Chopra , a retired Army chief warrant officer and 20 + - year pilot in the famed 160th " Nightstalkers " Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( Airborne ) , said his company was merely told the generals wanted to " evaluate " the body armor in a combat environment .
It 's pretty well understood among active service personnel that the Interceptor and Second Chance body armor issued by the Pentagon for our soldiers is sorely lacking .
These soldiers are the ultimate " motivated consumers " when it comes to wanting a product that works well in real - life situations .
Throughout the literature , one can find many reports of the operational superiority of Dragon Skin over the government - issue Interceptor and Second Chance armors .
This article in Defense Review , and this transcript of a PBS story are just two examples ; a quick Googling of " dragon skin body armor " will pick up more .
Those inside the defense community closest to the soldiers on the ground have been talking for some time about alternatives to the woefully inadequate armor supplied to our troops .
This article posted on NavySEALS.com says , regarding the standard - issue Interceptor armor that has proven defective ,
As good as Interceptor armor is , numerous experts concluded , it is far less capable than another product sold on the open market .
- meaning , Dragon Skin .
What are some of the problems with Interceptor ?
Well , for starters ,
The so - called SAPI ( Small Arms Protective Inserts ) used in the Interceptor system are too fragile and incur about a 60 % loss / replacement rate in the field because the design is inherently brittle and fractures when dropped or slammed into solid objects such as the ground .
" Solid objects such as the ground " ????
Well , thank goodness soldiers would never come into contact with a solid object such as the ground .
Plus , the stuff does n't allow the wearer much in the way of mobility .
Think of it as the difference between a medieval knight wearing a suit of armor ( Interceptor ) and one wearing chain mail ( Dragon Skin ) .
To the soldier literally on the ground in Iraq or Afghanistan , that 's a vital consideration .
That 's why these soldiers are willing to lay out $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 of their own money for this equipment .
So - given that the Pentagon has been incompetent enough not to provide our combat troops with the best armor available - which in and of itself is inexcusable - why in the world would the U.S. military forbid our troops from supplying themselves with the best , most life - protective gear they can find ?
The answer is not as glib as Rumsfeld 's callous , " You go to war with the army you have . "
After reading the Soldiers for the Truth article , I did what I often do when it comes to the Bush administration : I asked myself , " Whenever something totally irrational threatens the safety of U.S. citizens , what is the underlying reason ? "
And , of course , the answer is simple : money .
Here 's a graph of the stock performance of Armor Holdings , Inc. , the company that has the exclusive contract to supply body armor to the Army and Marines ( NYSE trading symbol : AH ) , over the past three years , since the start of the Iraq war :
Not bad , huh ?
Now , if you had to hazard a guess as to who owns almost 6 % of the shares of Armor Holdings , Inc. - shares with a current market value of $ 88,000,000.00 - who would you guess ?
Maayybeeee - a company owned by a top Republican campaign donor ?
DING -DING -DING -DING DING !!!
What do we have for 'em , Johnny ?
Yes , that 's right - you 've won confirmation of your belief that the military procurement system in the U.S. armed forces is RIFE WITH CORRUPTION !!
Yep , it turns out that the company that has the exclusive contract to supply body armor to the Army and Marines is home to a very heavy - hitting Republican campaign donor .
Foster Friess , individually and through various family members , has contributed more than $ 575,000 to Republicans in the previous three campaign cycles , and has chunked in $ 51,000 so far for 2006 .
That $ 88,000,000 in Armor Holdings stock held by Friess Associates LLC ?
Before the Iraq war began , it would have been worth about $ 30,000,000 .
No wonder he 's throwing money the Republicans ' way .
I would like to believe that the fact that our soldiers have been forbidden from buying or wearing non-standard - issue body armor that will save their lives , has nothing to do with any of this .
But I 'm having a hard time shaking the thought .
UPDATE : Thanks to BarbinMD for this link , from defensereview.com , with the latest in the body - armor war :
Abu Hamza , 47 , who preached at Finsbury Park Mosque , London , was convicted of 11 of the 15 charges he faced .
He has already been in jail since May 2004 , and will appeal .
His lawyer said he considered himself " a prisoner of faith " subject to " slow martyrdom " .
US authorities are seeking the cleric 's extradition for terror - related matters .
He is wanted on charges of trying to set up a " terrorist training camp " in the state of Oregon .
Passing sentence at the Old Bailey , Mr Justice Hughes told Abu Hamza : " I do not make the mistake that you represent Islamic thinking generally .
No one can say now what damage your words may have caused - no one can say whether any of your audiences , present or wider , acted on your words
Mr Justice Hughes
" You are entitled to your views and in this country you are entitled to express them , but only up to the point where you incite murder or use language calculated to incite racial hatred .
That is what you did . "
Outside the court , the cleric 's solicitor , Muddassar Arani , confirmed his legal team will appeal against the conviction and fight the US extradition attempt .
A US Department of Justice said : " The United States stands ready to resume the extradition proceedings against Abu Hamza when British law allows . "
Under the current law , the cleric will not be extradited until he has finished serving his sentence in the UK .
It is understood he will be eligible for parole early in 2008 .
ABU HAMZA VERDICTS
Guilty of 6 charges of soliciting to murder Guilty of 3 charges related to " stirring up racial hatred " Guilty of 1 charge of owning recordings related to " stirring up racial hatred " Guilty of 1 charge of possessing " terrorist encyclopaedia "
Not guilty of 3 charges of soliciting to murder
Not guilty of 1 charge related to " stirring up racial hatred "
Charges in full
Abu Hamza was also found guilty of having audio and video tapes intended to encourage racial hatred and having a document for terror purposes .
He was jailed for seven years for the six charges of soliciting murder , 21 months for the three incitement to racial hatred charges , three years for possessing " threatening , abusive or insulting recordings " and three - and - a- half years for having a document useful to terrorists .
The judge said all the sentences would run concurrently .
Following the Egyptian - born preacher 's arrest , more than 3,000 audio cassettes and 600 videos were found of speeches intended for wider distribution .
He was demonised as the man with a hook or with one eye in a pantomime - like fashion
Massoud Shadjareh
Islamic Human Rights Commission
Muslims react to Hamza conviction
And a terror manual - an encyclopaedia of Afghani Jihad - found at his west London home listed Big Ben , the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty as possible targets for an attack .
A search of Finsbury Park Mosque , in north London , also led to the discovery of forged passports , CS gas , knives , guns , tents and guns capable of firing blanks .
BBC Home Editor Mark Easton said police believed the mosque , which is now under new management , was " linked to literally dozens of terrorist plots around Europe and beyond " .
Jurors watched around 20 hours of video tapes of the cleric 's sermons .
The court heard him describe Jews as the " enemy of Islam " , tell followers to " bleed " the enemies of Islam and they should not rest until they created a " Muslim state " .
In Abu Hamza 's numerous lectures and sermons , other targets included homosexual vicars , the royal family and women in bikinis .
His defence was that he was encouraging Muslims to stand up for themselves .
David Perry , prosecuting , told the court that Abu Hamza made clear encouragements to kill when he gave lectures and sermons at the Finsbury Park mosque and in Luton , Blackburn and Whitechapel , east London .
Abu Hamza will remain at Belmarsh high security prison , where he has been held since his arrest .
The Ice Age has returned to Luebeck in Germany with the start of the International Snow and Ice Sculpture Festival .
Around 45 artists have used chainsaws , chisels and blow - torches to carve a menagerie of ice creatures .
Netherlands sculptor Gideon Adema used a gas burner to put a shine on his tiger sculpture .
Organisers say the compressed snow that the artists work with has no chemicals added and is " fairly natural " .
All in all , around 350,000 kilos of ice and 150,000 kilos of snow will be processed for the festival .
This year 's theme is the Kingdom of Animals - including giant ice spiders and insects .
Russia 's Michail Fedotov is among sculptors from around the world taking part in the festival .
Ice World , which opens on Friday , is based in old harbour area of the town in northern Germany and runs until 29 January .

( Achieved ) .
Launch : July 16 , 1969 ; 09:32:00 am EDT .
Launch Complex 39 - A Kennedy Space Center , FL .
No launch delays .
The splashdown May 26 , 1969 , of Apollo 10 cleared the way for the first formal attempt at a manned lunar landing .
Six days before , the Apollo 11 launch vehicle and spacecraft half crawled from the VAB and trundled at 0.9 mph to Pad 39 - A .
A successful countdown test ending on July 3 showed the readiness of machines , systems , and people .
The next launch window ( established by lighting conditions at the landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis ) opened at 9:32 AM EDT on July 16 , 1969 .
The crew for Apollo 11 , all of whom had already flown in space during Gemini , had been intensively training as a team for many months .
The following mission account makes use of crew members ' own words , from books written by two of them , supplemented by space - to - ground and press - conference transcripts .
ALDRIN : At breakfast early on the morning of the launch .
Dr. Thomas Paine , the Administrator of NASA , told us that concern for our own safety must govern all our actions , and if anything looked wrong we were to abort the mission .
He then made a most surprising and unprecedented statement : if we were forced to abort , we would be immediately recycled and assigned to the next landing attempt .
What he said and how he said it was very reassuring .
We were up early , ate , and began to suit up - a rather laborious and detailed procedure involving many people , which we would repeat once again , alone , before entering the LM for our lunar landing .
While Mike and Neil were going through the complicated business of being strapped in and connected to the spacecraft 's life - support system , I waited near the elevator on the floor below .
I waited alone for fifteen minutes in a sort of serene limbo .
As far as I could see there were people and cars lining the beaches and highways .
The surf was just beginning to rise out of an azure - blue ocean .
I could see the massiveness of the Saturn V rocket below and the magnificent precision of Apollo above .
I savored the wait and marked the minutes in my mind as something I would always want to remember .
COLLINS : I am everlastingly thankful that I have flown before , and that this period of waiting atop a rocket is nothing new .
I am just as tense this time , but the tenseness comes mostly from an appreciation of the enormity of our undertaking rather than from the unfamiliarity of the situation .
I am far from certain that we will be able to fly the mission as planned .
I think we will escape with our skins , or at least I will escape with mine , but I would n't give better than even odds on a successful landing and return .
There arc just too many things that can go wrong .
Fred Haise [ the backup astronaut who had checked command - module switch positions ] has run through a checklist 417 steps long .
and I have merely a half dozen minor chores to take care of - nickel and dime stuff .
In between switch throws I have plenty of time to think , if not daydream .
Here I am , a white male , age thirty - eight , height 5 feet 11 inches , weight 165 pounds , salary $ 17,000 per annum , resident of a Texas suburb , with black spot on my roses , state of mind unsettled , about to be shot off to the Moon .
Yes , to the Moon .
At the moment , the most important control is over on Neil 's side , just outboard of his left knee .
It is the abort handle , and now it has power to it , so if Neil rotates it 30 counterclockwise , three solid rockets above us will fire and yank the CM free of the service module and everything below it .
It is only to be used in extremes .
A large bulky pocket has been added to Neil 's left suit leg , and it looks as though if he moves his leg slightly , it 's going to snag on the abort handle .
I quickly point this out to Neil , and he grabs the pocket and pulls it as far over to the inside of his thigh as he can , but it still does n't look secure to either one of us .
Jesus , I can see the headlines now : " MOONSHOT FALLS INTO OCEAN . "
Mistake by crew , program officials intimate .
Last transmission from Armstrong prior to leaving the pad reportedly was ` Oops . ' "
ARMSTRONG :
The flight started promptly , and I think that was characteristic of all events of the flight .
The Saturn gave us one magnificent ride , both in Earth orbit and on a trajectory to the Moon .
Our memory of that differs little from the reports you have heard from the previous Saturn V flights .
ALDRIN : For the thousands of people watching along the beaches of Florida and the millions who watched on television , our lift - off was ear shattering .
For us there was a slight increase in the amount of background noise , not at all unlike the sort one notices taking off in a commercial airliner , and in less than a minute we were traveling ahead of the speed of sound .
COLLINS : This beast is best felt .
Shake , rattle , and roll '
We are thrown left and right against our straps in spasmodic little jerks .
It is steering like crazy , like a nervous lady driving a wide car down a narrow alley , and I just hope it knows where it 's going , because for the first ten seconds we are perilously close to that umbilical tower .
ALDRIN : A busy eleven minutes later we were in Earth orbit .
The Earth did n't look much different from the way it had during my first flight , and yet I kept looking at it .
From space it has an almost benign quality .
Intellectually one could realize there were wars underway , but emotionally it was impossible to understand such things .
The thought reoccurred that wars are generally fought for territory or are disputes over borders ; from space the arbitrary borders established on Earth can not be seen .
After one and a half orbits a preprogrammed sequence fired the Saturn to send us out of Earth orbit and on our way to the Moon .

ARMSTRONG : Hey Houston , Apollo 11 .
This Saturn gave us a magnificent ride .
We have no complaints with any of the three stages on that ride .
It was beautiful .
COLLINS : We started the burn at 100 miles altitude , and had reached only 180 at cutoff , but we are climbing like a dingbat .
In nine hours , when we are scheduled to make our first midcourse correction , we will be 57,000 miles out .
At the instant of shutdown , Buzz recorded our velocity as 35,579 feet per second , more than enough to escape from the Earth 's gravitational field .
As we proceed outbound , this number will get smaller and smaller until the tug of the Moon 's gravity exceeds that of the Earth 's and then we will start speeding up again .
It 's hard to believe that we are on our way to the Moon , at 1200 miles altitude now , less than three hours after liftoff , and I 'll bet the launch - day crowd down at the Cape is still bumper to bumper , straggling back to the motels and bars .
ALDRIN : Mike 's next major task , with Neil and me assisting , was to separate our command module Columbia from the Saturn third stage , turn around and connect with the lunar module Eagle , which was stored in the third stage .
Eagle , by now , was exposed ; its four enclosing panels had automatically come off and were drifting away .
This of course was a critical maneuver in the flight plan .
If the separation and docking did not work , we would return to Earth .
There was also the possibility of an in - space collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin , so we were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn third stage .
Critical as the maneuver is , I felt no apprehension about it , and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking proceeded perfectly to completion .
The nose of Columbia was now connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we watched the Saturn third stage venting , a propulsive maneuver causing it to move slowly away from us .
Fourteen hours after liftoff , at 10:30 PM by Houston time , the three astronauts fasten covers over the windows of the slowly rotating command module and go to sleep .
Days 2 and 3 are devoted to housekeeping chores , a small midcourse velocity correction , and TV transmissions back to Earth .
In one news digest from Houston , the astronauts are amused to hear that Pravda has referred to Armstrong as " the czar of the ship . "
ALDRIN : In our preliminary flight plan I was n't scheduled to go to the LM until the next day in lunar orbit .
but I had lobbied successfully to go earlier .
My strongest argument was that I 'd have ample time to make sure that the frail LM and its equipment had suffered no damage during the launch and long trip .
By that time neither Neil nor I had been in the LM for about two weeks .
The Most Awesome Sphere COLLINS : Day 4 has a decidedly different feel to it .
Instead of nine hours ' sleep , I get seven -- and fitful ones at that .
Despite our concentrated effort to conserve our energy on the way to the Moon , the pressure is overtaking us ( or me at least ) , and I feel that all of us are aware that the honeymoon is over and we are about to lay our little pink bodies on the line .
Our first shock comes as we stop our spinning motion and swing ourselves around so as to bring the Moon into view .
We have not been able to see the Moon for nearly a day now , and the change is electrifying .
The Moon I have known all my life , that two - dimensional small yellow disk in the sky , has gone away somewhere , to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever seen .
To begin with it is huge , completely filling our window .
Second , it is three - dimensional .
The belly of it bulges out toward us in such a pronounced fashion that I almost feel I can reach out and touch it .
To add to the dramatic effect , we can see the stars again .
We are in the shadow of the Moon now , and the elusive stars have reappeared .
As we ease around on the left side of the Moon , I marvel again at the precision of our path .
We have missed hitting the Moon by a paltry 300 nautical miles , at a distance of nearly a quarter of a million miles from Earth , and do n't forget that the Moon is a moving target and that we are racing through the sky just ahead of its leading edge .
When we launched the other day the Moon was nowhere near where it is now ; it was some 40 degrees of arc , or nearly 200,000 miles , behind where it is now , and yet those big computers in the basement in Houston did n't even whimper but belched out super - accurate predictions .
As we pass behind the Moon , we have just over eight minutes to go before the burn .
We are super - careful now , checking and rechecking each step several times .
When the moment finally arrives , the big engine instantly springs into action and reassuringly plasters us back in our seats .
The acceleration is only a fraction of one G but it feels good nonetheless .
For six minutes we sit there peering intent as hawks at our instrument panel , scanning the important dials and gauges , making sure that the proper thing is being done to us .
When the engine shuts down , we discuss the matter with our computer and I read out the results : " Minus one , plus one , plus one . "
The accuracy of the overall system is phenomenal : out of a total of nearly three thousand feet per second , we have velocity errors in our body axis coordinate system of only a tenth of one foot per second in each of the three directions .
That is one accurate burn , and even Neil acknowledges the fact .
ALDRIN : The second burn to place us in closer circular orbit of the Moon , the orbit from which Neil and I would separate from the Columbia and continue on to the Moon , was critically important .
It had to be made in exactly the right place and for exactly the correct length of time .
If we overburned for as little as two seconds we'd be on an impact course for the other side of the Moon .
Through a complicated and detailed system of checks and balances , both in Houston and in lunar orbit , plus star checks and detailed platform alignments , two hours after our first lunar orbit we made our second burn , in an atmosphere of nervous and intense concentration .
It , too , worked perfectly .
- Michael Collins and Edwin E. " Buzz " Aldrin , Jr. ( Apollo Expeditions to the Moon , edited by Edgar M. Cortright , NASA SP ; 350 , Washington , DC , 1975 ) Asleep in Lunar Orbit We began preparing the LM .
It was scheduled to take three hours , but because I had already started the checkout , we were completed a half hour ahead of schedule .
Reluctantly we returned to the Columbia as planned .
Our fourth night we were to sleep in lunar orbit .
Although it was not in the flight plan , before covering the windows and dousing the lights , Neil and I carefully prepared all the equipment and clothing we would need in the morning , and mentally ran through the many procedures we would follow .
COLLINS : " Apollo 11 , Apollo 11 , good morning from the Black Team . "
Could they be talking to me ?
It takes me twenty seconds to fumble for the microphone button and answer groggily , I guess I have only been asleep five hours or so ; I had a tough time getting to sleep , and now I 'm having trouble waking up .
Neil , Buzz , and I all putter about fixing breakfast and getting various items ready for transfer into the LM .
[ Later ]
I stuff Neil and Buzz into the LM along with an armload of equipment .
Now I have to do the tunnel bit again , closing hatches , installing drogue and probe , and disconnecting the electrical umbilical .
I am on the radio constantly now , running through an elaborate series of joint checks with Eagle .
I check progress with Buzz : " I have five minutes and fifteen seconds since we started .
Attitude is holding very well . "
" Roger , Mike , just hold it a little bit longer . "
" No sweat , I can hold it all day .
Take your sweet time .
How 's the czar over there ?
He 's so quiet . "
Neil chimes in , " Just hanging on - and punching . "
Punching those computer buttons , I guess he means .
" All I can say is , beware the revolution , " and then , getting no answer , I formally bid them goodbye .
" You cats take it easy on the lunar surface .... "
" O.K. , Mike , " Buzz answers cheerily , and I throw the switch which releases them .
With my nose against the window and the movie camera churning away , I watch them go .
When they are safely clear of me , I inform Neil , and he begins a slow pirouette in place , allowing me a look at his outlandish machine and its four extended legs .
" The Eagle has wings ' " Neil exults .
It does n't look like any eagle I have ever seen .
It is the weirdest - looking contraption ever to invade the sky , floating there with its legs awkwardly jutting out above a body which has neither symmetry nor grace .
I make sure all four landing gears are down and locked , report that fact , and then lie a little , " I think you 've got a fine - looking flying machine there .
Eagle , despite the fact you 're upside down . "
" Somebody 's upside down , " Neil retorts .
" O.K. , Eagle .
One minute . . . you guys take care . "
Neil answers , " See you later . " I hope so .
When the one minute is up , I fire my thrusters precisely as planned and we begin to separate , checking distances and velocities as we go .
This burn is a very small one , just to give Eagle some breathing room .
From now on it's up to them , and they will make two separate burns in reaching the lunar surface .
The first one will serve to drop Eagle 's perilune to fifty thousand feet .
Then , when they reach this spot over the eastern edge of the Sea of Tranquility , Eagle 's descent engine will be fired up for the second and last time , and Eagle will lazily arc over into a 12 - minute computer - controlled descent to some point at which Neil will take over for a manual landing .
ALDRIN : We were still 60 miles above the surface when we began our first burn .
Neil and I were harnessed into the LM in a standing position .
[ Later ] at precisely the right moment the engine ignited to begin the 12 - minute powered descent .
Strapped in by the system of belts and cables not unlike shock absorbers , neither of us felt the initial motion .
We looked quickly at the computer to make sure we were actually functioning as planned .
After 26 seconds the engine went to full throttle and the motion became noticeable .
Neil watched his instruments while I looked at our primary computer and compared it with our second computer , which was part of our abort guidance system .
I then began a computer read - out sequence to Neil which was also being transmitted to Houston .
I had helped develop it .
It sounded as though I was chattering like a magpie .
It also sounded as though I was doing all the work .
During training we had discussed the possibility of making the communication only between Neil and myself , but Mission Control liked the idea of hearing our communications with each other .
Neil had referred to it once as " that damned open mike of yours , " and I tried to make as little an issue of it as possible .
- Michael Collins and Edwin E. " Buzz " Aldrin , Jr. ( Apollo Expeditions to the Moon , edited by Edgar M. Cortright , NASA SP ; 350 , Washington , DC , 1975 ) A Yellow Caution Light
At six thousand feet above the lunar surface a yellow caution light came on and we encountered one of the few potentially serious problems in the entire flight , a problem which might have caused us to abort , had it not been for a man on the ground who really knew his job .
COLLINS : At five minutes into the burn , when I am nearly directly overhead , Eagle voices its first concern .
" Program Alarm , " barks Neil , " It 's a 1202 . "
What the hell is that ?
I do n't have the alarm numbers memorized for my own computer , much less for the LM's .
I jerk out my own checklist and start thumbing through it , but before I can find 1202 , Houston says , " Roger , we 're GO on that alarm . "
No problem , in other words .
My checklist says 1202 is an " executive overflow , " meaning simply that the computer has been called upon to do too many things at once and is forced to postpone some of them .
A little farther along , at just three thousand feet above the surface , the computer flashes 1201 , another overflow condition , and again the ground is superquick to respond with reassurances .
ALDRIN : Back in Houston , not to mention on board the Eagle , hearts shot up into throats while we waited to learn what would happen .
We had received two of the caution lights when Steve Bales the flight controller responsible for LM computer activity , told us to proceed , through Charlie Duke , the capsule communicator .
We received three or four more warnings but kept on going .
When Mike , Neil , and I were presented with Medals of Freedom by President Nixon , Steve also received one .
He certainly deserved it , because without him we might not have landed .
ARMSTRONG :
In the final phases of the descent after a number of program alarms , we looked at the landing area and found a very large crater .
This is the area we decided we would not go into ; we extended the range downrange .
The exhaust dust was kicked up by the engine and this caused some concern in that it degraded our ability to determine not only our altitude in the final phases but also our translational velocities over the ground .
It 's quite important not to stub your toe during the final phases of touchdown .

HOUSTON : We copy you down , Eagle .
EAGLE : Houston , Tranquility Base here .
The Eagle has landed !
HOUSTON : Roger , Tranquility .
We copy you on the ground .
You 've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue .
We 're breathing again .
Thanks a lot .
TRANQUILITY : Thank you . . .
That may have seemed like a very long final phase .
The auto targeting was taking us right into a football - field - sized crater , with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about one or two crater - diameters around it , and it required flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area .
HOUSTON : Roger , we copy .
It was beautiful from here , Tranquility .
Over. TRANQUILITY : We 'll get to the details of what 's around here , but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape , angularity , granularity , about every variety of rock you could find .
HOUSTON : Roger , Tranquility .
Be advised there 's lots of smiling faces in this room , and all over the world .
TRANQUILITY : There are two of them up here .
COLUMBIA : And do n't forget one in the command module .
ARMSTRONG : Once [ we ] settled on the surface , the dust settled immediately and we had an excellent view of the area surrounding the LM .
We saw a crater surface , pockmarked with craters up to 15 , 20 , 30 feet , and many smaller craters down to a diameter of 1 foot and , of course , the surface was very fine - grained .
There were a surprising number of rocks of all sizes .
A number of experts had , prior to the flight , predicted that a good bit of difficulty might be encountered by people due to the variety of strange atmospheric and gravitational characteristics .
This did n't prove to be the case and after landing we felt very comfortable in the lunar gravity .
It was , in fact , in our view preferable both to weightlessness and to the Earth 's gravity .
When we actually descended the ladder it was found to be very much like the lunar - gravity simulations we had performed here on Earth .
No difficulty was encountered in descending the ladder .
The last step was about 31 / 2 feet from the surface , and we were somewhat concerned that we might have difficulty in reentering the LM at the end of our activity period .
So we practiced that before bringing the camera down .
ALDRIN : We opened the hatch and Neil , with me as his navigator , began backing out of the tiny opening .
It seemed like a small eternity before I heard Neil say , " That 's one small step for man . . . one giant leap for mankind . "
In less than fifteen minutes I was backing awkwardly out of the hatch and onto the surface to join Neil , who , in the tradition of all tourists , had his camera ready to photograph my arrival .
I felt buoyant and full of goose pimples when I stepped down on the surface .
I immediately looked down at my feet and became intrigued with the peculiar properties of the lunar dust .
If one kicks sand on a beach , it scatters in numerous directions with some grains traveling farther than others .
On the Moon the dust travels exactly and precisely as it goes in various directions , and every grain of it lands nearly the same distance away .
- Michael Collins and Edwin E. " Buzz " Aldrin , Jr. ( Apollo Expeditions to the Moon , edited by Edgar M. Cortright , NASA SP ; 350 , Washington , DC , 1975 ) The Boy in the Candy Store ARMSTRONG :
There were a lot of things to do , and we had a hard time getting , them finished .
We had very little trouble , much less trouble than expected , on the surface .
It was a pleasant operation .
Temperatures were n't high .
They were very comfortable .
The little EMU , the combination of spacesuit and backpack that sustained our life on the surface , operated magnificently .
The primary difficulty was just far too little time to do the variety of things we would have liked .
We had the problem of the five - year - old boy in a candy store .
ALDRIN : I took off jogging to test my maneuverability .
The exercise gave me an odd sensation and looked even more odd when I later saw the films of it .
With bulky suits on , we seemed to be moving in slow motion .
I noticed immediately that my inertia seemed much greater .
Earth - bound , I would have stopped my run in just one step , but I had to use three of four steps to sort of wind down .
My Earth weight , with the big backpack and heavy suit , was 360 pounds .
On the Moon I weighed only 60 pounds .
At one point I remarked that the surface was " Beautiful , beautiful .
Magnificent desolation . "
I was struck by the contrast between the starkness of the shadows and the desert - like barrenness of the rest of the surface .
It ranged from dusty gray to light tan and was unchanging except for one startling sight : our LM sitting there with its black , silver , and bright yellow - orange thermal coating shining brightly in the otherwise colorless landscape .
I had seen Neil in his suit thousands of times before , but on the Moon the unnatural whiteness of it seemed unusually brilliant .
We could also look around and see the Earth , which , though much larger than the Moon the Earth was seeing , seemed small -- a beckoning oasis shining far away in the sky .
As the sequence of lunar operations evolved , Neil had the camera most of the time , and the majority of pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me .
It was n't until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil .
My fault perhaps , but we had never simulated this in our training .
- Michael Collins and Edwin E. " Buzz " Aldrin , Jr. ( Apollo Expeditions to the Moon , edited by Edgar M. Cortright , NASA SP ; 350 , Washington , DC , 1975 ) Coaxing the Flag to Stand During a pause in experiments , Neil suggested we proceed with the flag .
It took both of us to set it up and it was nearly a disaster .
Public Relations obviously needs practice just as everything else does .
A small telescoping arm was attached to the flagpole to keep the flag extended and perpendicular .
As hard as we tried , the telescope would n't fully extend .
Thus the flags which should have been flat , had its own unique permanent wave .
Then to our dismay the staff of the pole would n't go far enough into the lunar surface to support itself in an upright position .
After much struggling we finally coaxed it to remain upright , but in a most precarious position .
I dreaded the possibility of the American flag collapsing into the lunar dust in front of the television camera .
COLLINS : [ On his fourth orbital pass above ]
" How 's it going ? " " The EVA is progressing beautifully .
I believe they 're setting up the flag now . "
Just let things keep going that way , and no surprises , please .
Neil and Buzz sound good , with no huffing and puffing to indicate they are overexerting themselves .
But one surprise at least is in store .
Houston comes on the air , not the slightest bit ruffled , and announces that the President of the United States would like to talk to Neil and Buzz .
" That would be an honor , " says Neil , with characteristic dignity .
The President 's voice smoothly fills the air waves with the unaccustomed cadence of the speechmaker , trained to convey inspiration , or at least emotion , instead of our usual diet of numbers and reminders .
" Neil and Buzz , I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Office at the White House , and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made . . .
Because of what you have done , the heavens have become a part of man 's world .
As you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility , it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth . . . "
My God , I never thought of all this bringing peace and tranquility to anyone .
As far as I am concerned , this voyage is fraught with hazards for the three of us - and especially two of us - and that is about as far as I have gotten in my thinking .
Neil , however , pauses long enough to give as well as he receives .
" It 's a great honor and privilege for us to be here , representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations , and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the future . "
[ Later ]
Houston cuts off the White House and returns to business as usual , with a long string of numbers for me to copy for future use .
My God , the juxtaposition of the incongruous - roll , pitch , and yaw ; prayers , peace , and tranquility .
What will it be like if we really carry this off and return to Earth in one piece , with our boxes full of rocks and our heads full of new perspectives for the planet ?
I have a little time to ponder this as I zing off out of sight of the White House and the Earth .
ALDRIN : We had a pulley system to load on the boxes of rocks .
We found the process more time - consuming and dust - scattering than anticipated .
After the gear and both of us were inside , our first chore was to pressure the LM cabin and begin stowing the rock boxes , film magazines , and anything else we would n't need until we were connected once again with the Columbia .
We removed our boots and the big backpacks , opened the LM hatch , and threw these items onto the lunar surface , along with a bagful of empty food packages and the LM urine bags .
The exact moment we tossed every thing out was measured back on Earth - the seismometer we had put out was even more sensitive than we had expected .
Before beginning liftoff procedures [ we ] settled down for our fitful rest .
We did n't sleep much at all .
Among other things we were elated - and also cold .
Liftoff from the Moon , after a stay totaling twenty - one hours , was exactly on schedule and fairly uneventful .
The ascent stage of the LM separated , sending out a shower of brilliant insulation particles which had been ripped off from the thrust of the ascent engine .
There was no lime to sightsee .
I was concentrating on the computers , and Neil was studying the attitude indicator , but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over . . .
Three hours and ten minutes later we were connected once again with the Columbia .
COLLINS : I can look out through my docking reticle and see that they are steady as a rock as they drive down the center line of that final approach path .
I give them some numbers .
" I have 0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second . "
We really are going to carry this off '
For the first time since I was assigned to this incredible flight , I feel that it is going to happen .
Granted , we are a long way from home , but from here on it should be all downhill .
Within a few seconds Houston joins the conversation , with a tentative little call .
" Eagle and Columbia , Houston standing by . "
They want to know what the hell is going on , but they do n't want to interrupt us if we are in a crucial spot in our final maneuvering .
Good heads !
However , they need n't worry , and Neil lets them know it .
" Roger , we 're stationkeeping . " ( Apollo Expeditions to the Moon , edited by Edgar M. Cortright , NASA SP ; 350 , Washington , DC , 1975 ) All Smiles and Giggles [ After docking ] it 's time to hustle down into the tunnel and remove hatch , probe , and drogue , so Neil and Buzz can get through .
Thank God , all the claptrap works beautifully in this its final workout .
The probe and drogue will stay with the LM and be abandoned with it , for we will have no further need of them and do n't want them cluttering up the command module .
The first one through is Buzz , with a big smile on his face .
I grab his head , a hand on each temple , and am about to give him a smooch on the forehead , as a parent might greet an errant child ; but then , embarrassed , I think better of it and grab his hand , and then Neil's .
We cavort about a little bit , all smiles and giggles over our success , and then it 's back to work as usual .
Excerpts from a TV program broadcast by the Apollo 11 astronauts on the last evening of the flight the day before splashdown in the Pacific : COLLINS : " . . .
The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery , every piece of which worked flawlessly .
This computer above my head has a 38,000 - word vocabulary , each word of which has been carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us .
The SPS engine , our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module , must have performed flawlessly or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit .
The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean .
We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly .
All this is possible only through the blood , sweat , and tears of a number of people .
First , the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory .
Second , the painstaking work done by various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly .
And finally , the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center , both in management , in mission planning , in flight control , and last but not least , in crew training .
This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine .
All you see is the three of us , but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others , and to all of those , I would like to say , ' Thank you very much . ' "
ALDRIN : " . . .
This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon ; more , still , than the efforts of a government and industry team ; more , even , than the efforts of one nation .
We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown .
Today I feel we 're really fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space .
In retrospect , we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our spacecraft , Columbia and Eagle .
We 've been pleased with the emblem of our flight , the eagle carrying an olive branch , bringing the universal symbol of peace from the planet Earth to the Moon .
Personally , in reflecting on the events of the past several days , a verse from Psalms comes to mind .
' When I consider the heavens , the work of Thy fingers , the Moon and the stars , which Thou hast ordained ; What is man that Thou art mindful of him ? ' "
ARMSTRONG : " The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort ; next with the American people , who have , through their will , indicated their desire ; next with four administrations and their Congresses , for implementing that will ; and then , with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft , the Saturn , the Columbia , the Eagle , and the little EMU , the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface .
We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft ; who did the construction , design , the tests , and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft .
To those people tonight , we give a special thank you , and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight , God bless you .
Good night from Apollo 11 . " ( Apollo Expeditions to the Moon , edited by Edgar M. Cortright , NASA SP ; 350 , Washington , DC , 1975 ) Click

Airport Screeners Still Are n't Any Good
They may be great at keeping you from taking your bottle of water onto the plane , but when it comes to catching actual bombs and guns they ’re not very good :
Screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport , one of the starting points for the Sept. 11 hijackers , failed 20 of 22 security tests conducted by undercover U.S. agents last week , missing concealed bombs and guns at checkpoints throughout the major air hub ’s three terminals , according to federal security officials . [… ]
One of the security officials familiar with last week ’s tests said Newark screeners missed fake explosive devices hidden under bottles of water in carry - on luggage , taped beneath an agent ’s clothing and concealed under a leg bandage another tester wore .
The official said screeners also failed to use handheld metal - detector wands when required , missed an explosive device during a pat - down and failed to properly hand - check suspicious carry - on bags .
Supervisors also were cited for failing to properly monitor checkpoint screeners , the official said .
“ We just totally missed everything , ” the official said .
As I ’ve written before , this is actually a very hard problem to solve :
Airport screeners have a difficult job , primarily because the human brain is n’t naturally adapted to the task .
We ’re wired for visual pattern matching , and are great at picking out something we know to look for — for example , a lion in a sea of tall grass .
But we ’re much less adept at detecting random exceptions in uniform data .
Faced with an endless stream of identical objects , the brain quickly concludes that everything is identical and there ’s no point in paying attention .
By the time the exception comes around , the brain simply does n’t notice it .
This psychological phenomenon is n’t just a problem in airport screening :
It ’s been identified in inspections of all kinds , and is why casinos move their dealers around so often .
The tasks are simply mind - numbing .
To make matters worse , the smuggler can try to exploit the system .
He can position the weapons in his baggage just so .
He can try to disguise them by adding other metal items to distract the screeners .
He can disassemble bomb parts so they look nothing like bombs .
Against a bored screener , he has the upper hand .
But perversely , even a mediocre success rate here is probably good enough :
Remember the point of passenger screening .
We ’re not trying to catch the clever , organized , well - funded terrorists .
We ’re trying to catch the amateurs and the incompetent .
We ’re trying to catch the unstable .
We ’re trying to catch the copycats .
These are all legitimate threats , and we ’re smart to defend against them .
Against the professionals , we ’re just trying to add enough uncertainty into the system that they ’ll choose other targets instead . [ … ]
What that means is that a basic cursory screening is good enough .
If I were investing in security , I would fund significant research into computer - assisted screening equipment for both checked and carry - on bags , but would n’t spend a lot of money on invasive screening procedures and secondary screening .
I would much rather have well - trained security personnel wandering around the airport , both in and out of uniform , looking for suspicious actions .
Remember this truism :
We ca n’t keep weapons out of prisons .
We ca n’t possibly keep them out of airports .

Airplane Security
My seventh Wired.com column is on line .
Nothing you have n’t heard before , except for this part :
I know quite a lot about this .
I was a member of the government ’s Secure Flight Working Group on Privacy and Security .
We looked at the TSA ’s program for matching airplane passengers with the terrorist watch list , and found a complete mess : poorly defined goals , incoherent design criteria , no clear system architecture , inadequate testing .
( Our report was on the TSA website , but has recently been removed — “ refreshed ” is the word the organization used — and replaced with an “ executive summary ” ( .doc ) that contains none of the report ’s findings .
The TSA did retain two ( .doc ) rebuttals ( .doc ) , which read like products of the same outline and dismiss our findings by saying that we did n’t have access to the requisite information . )
Our conclusions match those in two ( .pdf ) reports ( .pdf ) by the Government Accountability Office and one ( .pdf ) by the DHS inspector general .
That ’s right ; the TSA is disappearing our report .
I also wrote an op ed for the Sydney Morning Herald on “ weapons ” — like the metal knives distributed with in - flight meals — aboard aircraft , based on this blog post .
Again , nothing you have n’t heard before .
( And I stole some bits from your comments to the blog posting . )
There is new news , though .
The TSA is relaxing the rules for bringing pointy things on aircraft : .
The summary document says the elimination of the ban on metal scissors with a blade of four inches or less and tools of seven inches or less – including screwdrivers , wrenches and pliers – is intended to give airport screeners more time to do new types of random searches .
Passengers are now typically subject to a more intensive , so - called secondary search only if their names match a listing of suspected terrorists or because of anomalies like a last - minute ticket purchase or a one - way trip with no baggage .
The new strategy , which has been tested in Pittsburgh , Indianapolis and Orange County , Calif. , will mean that a certain number of passengers , even if they are not identified by these computerized checks , will be pulled aside and subject to an added search lasting about two minutes .
Officials said passengers would be selected randomly , without regard to ethnicity or nationality .
What happens next will vary .
One day at a certain airport , carry - on bags might be physically searched .
On the same day at a different airport , those subject to the random search might have their shoes screened for explosives or be checked with a hand - held metal detector .
“ By design , a traveler will not experience the same search every time he or she flies , ” the summary said .
“ The searches will add an element of unpredictability to the screening process that will be easy for passengers to navigate but difficult for terrorists to manipulate . ”
The new policy will also change the way pat - down searches are done to check for explosive devices .
Screeners will now search the upper and lower torso , the entire arm and legs from the mid- thigh down to the ankle and the back and abdomen , significantly expanding the area checked .
Currently , only the upper torso is checked .
Under the revised policy , screeners will still have the option of skipping pat - downs in certain areas “ if it is clear there is no threat , ” like when a person is wearing tight clothing making it obvious that there is nothing hidden .
But the default position will be to do the more comprehensive search , in part because of fear that a passenger could be carrying plastic explosives that might not set off a handheld metal detector .
I do n’t know if they will still make people take laptops out of their cases , make people take off their shoes , or confiscate pocket knives .
( Different articles have said different things about the last one . )
This is a good change , and it ’s long overdue .
Airplane terrorism has n’t been the movie - plot threat that everyone worries about for a while .
The most amazing reaction to this is from Corey Caldwell , spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants :
When weapons are allowed back on board an aircraft , the pilots will be able to land the plane safety but the aisles will be running with blood .
How ’s that for hyperbole ?
In Beyond Fear and elsewhere , I ’ve written about the notion of “ agenda ” and how it informs security trade - offs .
From the perspective of the flight attendants , subjecting passengers to onerous screening requirements is a perfectly reasonable trade - off .
They ’re safer — albeit only slightly — because of it , and it does n’t cost them anything .
The cost is an externality to them : the passengers pay it .
Passengers have a broader agenda : safety , but also cost , convenience , time , etc .
So it makes perfect sense that the flight attendants object to a security change that the passengers are in favor of .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/2 ) :
The SFWG report has n’t been removed from the TSA website , just unlinked .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/20 ) :
The report seems to be gone from the TSA website now , but it ’s available here .

Have you ever tried to learn Haskell ( haskell.org ) and hit a brick wall ?
Have you tried to read the main tutorial , " A Gentle Introduction to Haskell " ( www.haskell.org/tutorial), and found it to be about as gentle as a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster ) ?
Did you have to learn about monads before you could even write your first non-trivial Haskell program ?
Have you noticed that unless you already know Haskell , it 's even less readable than Shakespeare ?
Have you searched for an example of a nontrivial Haskell program only to find you can't understand it ?
In Expert C Programming : Deep C Secrets ( which , by the way , is a must read for anyone who ever uses the letter C ) , Peter van der Linden teaches the reader how to write a small program that translates C - type declarations into English .
It 's a great little exercise .
It 's beautiful because it works without relying on powerful tools like Lex and Yacc , yet it 's still small enough to be written in a couple hours .
I 've read stories about people writing Pascal compilers in Haskell , and there 's even a version of Perl 6 written in Haskell ( www.pugscode.org).
In my last article ( www.linuxjournal.com/article/8850), I gave readers an introduction to monads and why they should care about them as well as Haskell in general .
( Note : several readers of my last article wondered why I was interested in Haskell in contrast to other excellent languages such as OCaml , Dylan or Common Lisp .
Currently , I 'm fascinated by Haskell because it is a purely functional programming language , and because it has lazy evaluation .
As strange as it might sound , I 'm fascinated by Haskell because it 's harder for me to wrap my head around than those other languages . )
If you still do n't believe that Haskell is worthy of attention , read what Tim Sweeney , the founder of Epic , the video game company that created Unreal , said about it at beust.com/weblog/archives/000375.html.
Sweeney feels that Haskell may be the gateway to " The Next Mainstream Programming Language " .
Because video game developers are often on the cutting edge of our field simply out of necessity , his comments are noteworthy .
In this two - part series , starting with Peter van der Linden 's exercise , my hope is to give readers a glimpse of the Zen of Haskell , without requiring that they already be Haskell converts .
In this first part , I start by reviewing the C version , and I explain why translating imperative code into Haskell is n't an easy thing to do .
I finish by explaining the concept of a parse pipeline .
The C Version Let 's start by reviewing the C version : /* Translate C type declarations into English .

By and large , I 'll follow this closely in the Haskell version , so that the two versions can be compared .
Again , notice that Lex and Yacc are n't used .
Haskell has no shortage of powerful parsing libraries , but I 've decided not to use any of them .
After all , if I used a powerful parsing library in the Haskell version , trying to compare the C version to the Haskell version would be like trying to compare apples to peach cobbler .
Last of all , notice that the C version uses global variables for the token stack and so forth .
It also prints output wherever convenient .
This makes it easy to code , but it does n't make it easy to translate to Haskell .
This is the biggest difference between the C version and the Haskell version .
After all , in a purely functional programming language like Haskell , a function can only take inputs and produce outputs .
It ca n't update global state ( there are no global variables ) , and it can't just print a string whenever it is convenient .
However , staying purely functional has benefits that are hard to match in an imperative language .
For instance , Haskell is lazy and non-strict .
It evaluates expressions in whatever order it feels is necessary and only as necessary .
For instance , it does not evaluate the arguments to a function until they 're actually used in the function -- you can pass 1/0 to a function , and as long as the function never uses that parameter , there will be no error .
This style of programming can be hard to wrap your head around when you 're coming from an imperative and / or object - oriented background .
( The tutorial that really helped me finally understand " the Haskell way " was the " Haskell Tutorial for C Programmers " ( www.haskell.org/~pairwise/intro/intro.html.)
Welcome to Haskell I 'm going to work my way toward the complete program via a series of smaller programs .
Start by installing Hugs ( www.haskell.org/hugs), which is a friendly , easy - to - use interpreter for Haskell .
Let 's start with the obligatory " Hello , World ! " : main = do putStrLn " Hello , World ! "
The advanced Haskell programmer may note that the do is not strictly required here .
At this point , I 'm going to " hand waive " and say that the do is syntactically unnecessary ( I 'm not referring to style ) in the same way that the braces are unnecessary in the following C snippet : if ( n > 5 ) { n -= 3 ; } To run the program , simply execute the following at the command line : $ runhugs hello_world .hs Hello , World !
Translating the source into English , it 's simply :
The value of main is to do : Write " Hello , World !
" I like to think of Haskell programs as a bunch of mathematical equations pretending to act like a programming language .
After all , the following makes sense to a mathematician , but similar code most definitely wo n't work in most other languages : a = 1 main = do print c c = a + b b = 2
No matter which order those four lines are arranged , it still works .
In most languages , " a = 1 " is read " set a equal to 1 " , but in Haskell , it 's read as " a is defined to be 1 " .
The order of the definitions do n't really matter most of the time .
By the way , print c is the same as putStrLn ( show c ) .
show c converts c into a string ;
In Java , you 'd write c.toString ( ) .
This illustrates three points :
You do n't use parentheses for function calls in Haskell ( although you may sometimes have to wrap a particular argument in parentheses ) .
In general , what would be object. method ( ) in Java is written method object in Haskell .
Every call to print implicitly calls show .
Because Haskell is oriented toward functions , the idiom is to pass an object as the first argument to a function that acts like a method .
Before I get too carried away , let me show you one of the things I find most fascinating about Haskell 's type system .
( Haskell 's type system and this feature in particular are shared with other languages in the ML language family . )
Haskell 's compiler is smart enough to let you write a swap function that takes two values of any type and return a tuple of the two values reversed .
swap x y = ( y , x ) main = do print ( swap 3 4 ) This is possible because the types really do n't matter here .
However , it 's also smart enough to infer types if you do n't explicitly state them and even complain about type errors at compile time that you would think could be caught only at runtime .
For instance , the following is acceptable : -- an end - of - line comment add1 x = x + 1 -- x must support " + 1 " callAdd1 x = add1 x -- callAdd1 looks " harmless " main = do print ( callAdd1 1 ) -- pass a number to callAdd1 However , Haskell will complain about the following at compile time : add1 x = x + 1 callAdd1 x = add1 x main = do print ( callAdd1 'a ' ) -- pass a Char to callAdd1 $ runhugs add1.hs ERROR " add1.hs " : 3 - Unresolved top - level overloading *** Binding : main *** Outstanding context : Num Char
It 's complaining that I passed a Char to something that requires a Num .
Num is what 's called a type class , which is similar to an interface in Java .
There are many different types that " implement " the Num " interface " , but Char is not one of them .
Now , Pascal programmers might start feeling smug at this point until I remind them that nowhere in the code did I mention x is an int or a Num or anything like that .
Similarly , fans of scripting languages with duck typing ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing ) might also start feeling smug at this point until I remind them that this error was caught at compile time .
( Although Hugs is an interpreter , there is a traditional , native compiler for Haskell called the Glasgow Haskell Compiler ( www.haskell.org/ghc), and it could indeed detect this type error at compile time . )
Translating the State of the World To remain purely functional , Haskell makes a strong distinction between functions that do I/O , which is considered a side effect , and those that do n't , which is considered purely functional .
In Java , all non-runtime exceptions that are raised in a method must be declared in the signature .
( Whether or not checked exceptions are a good thing in Java is another subject . )
Similarly , in Haskell , all functions that do I /O must make use of the IO monad , which impacts the signature of the function .
Hence , the question is , as a programmer , where do you draw the line between functions that can do I/O and functions that live in the purely functional world ?
For most applications , actual I/O can be constrained to a very tiny portion of the program .
For instance , in cdecl , I /O can be limited to the main function .
The main function can read the C type declaration from the user and later write the English output to the user .
The rest of the program can be devoted to the logic necessary to convert C type declarations into English .
If you generalize this pattern , you might say that a small part of the program reads and writes the " state of the world " ( for instance , reading from STDIN , writing to STDOUT , manipulating files , talking to network sockets and so on ) , whereas the rest of the program can be composed of functions that are purely functional , that is , they take data and return data -- that 's it .
Comparing the situation to Star Trek , the purely functional part of the program is Captain Kirk - - you give him a question , and he 'll give you a decision .
The part of the program that does I/O is the ensign sitting at the controls , and for completeness , Haskell is the Enterprise !
If the " translator " at the heart of the Haskell program simply outputs whatever it is given as input , you arrive at a stripped - down version of the UNIX program cat ( or rather , the DOS program type ) , which is a nice place to start : main = do s <- getContents putStr s Note that getContents is a function that returns a string that reads from standard input as needed .
Here , the program is taking all of standard input and printing it back out .
You would think that would be hideously inefficient , but thanks to Haskell 's lazy nature , Haskell does n't have to be finished reading input before it can start writing output .
Now , ideally , it'd be nice to do something in the middle .
cat is interesting only for so long .
Ideally , it'd be nice to change the state of the world .
Consider : makeCool s = s ++ " is cool ! " main = do s <- getContents putStrLn ( makeCool s ) $ echo -n " Haskell " | runhugs makeCool .hs Haskell is cool !
makeCool is a function that takes an input string ( which happens to be all of standard input when it is called in main ) , translates it ( by appending " is cool ! " ) , and then returns it ( where it happens to get printed to STDOUT ) .
This is a suitable beginning for a " C to English " compiler .
Now , if only the makeCool function were a lot more intelligent !
Keeping an eye on the C version , let 's start by translating the token struct and token stack into Haskell .
As I mentioned earlier , there are no global variables in Haskell , so I 'll have to use a new data type to represent the state of the parser .
I 'll call it ParseContext .
This ParseContext can be passed to functions explicitly .
Later , I 'll show how the State monad can be used to pass the ParseContext to functions implicitly .
Let 's start with : data TokenType = Identifier | Qualifier | Type | Symbol Char deriving ( Show , Eq ) The data keyword creates a new data type in Haskell .
Hence , TokenType is a new type .
The data keyword replaces C's enum , struct and union in one shot .
Here , it 's acting as a cross between an enum and a union .
A value of the type TokenType might be an Identifier , a Qualifier , a Type or a Symbol that wraps a specific Char ( for instance , Symbol '+ ' ) .
deriving
Show tells the compiler that it can automatically figure out a suitable implementation for the show and read functions ( conceptually , toString ( ) and fromString ( ) ) .
deriving
Eq tells the compiler that it can figure out a suitable implementation for == .
For instance , it just makes sense that Symbol '+' == Symbol '+ ' should be True , but Identifier == Qualifier should be False .
Continuing : data Token = Token { tokenType :: TokenType , tokenValue :: String } deriving Show Token is a new type .
A value of that type is constructed using the constructor named Token .
( Note that sometimes the type and the constructor have the same name , but sometimes they do n't -- look at Token Type above ;
It has four different constructors . )
A Token has a member tokenType of type TokenType and a member tokenValue of type String .
The :: should be read aloud as " has type " or " of type " .
Notice that this data declaration is very much like a struct in C. Continuing : data ParseContext = ParseContext { input :: String , --
The input that has not been parsed yet .
output :: String , --
The output generated so far .
currTok :: Token , --
The current token , if defined .
stack :: [ Token ] --
A stack of tokens we have n't dealt with yet .
} deriving Show
It should start looking familiar now .
Notice that stack is a list of Tokens .
Now , let 's merge the makeCool .hs program from earlier with all of these data declarations to create a overly complicated version of the makeCool .hs program : data TokenType = Identifier | Qualifier | Type | Symbol Char deriving ( Show , Eq ) data Token = Token { tokenType :: TokenType , tokenValue :: String } deriving Show data ParseContext = ParseContext { input :: String , --
The input that has not been parsed yet .
output :: String , --
The output generated so far .
currTok :: Token , --
The current token , if defined .
stack :: [ Token ] --
A stack of tokens we have n't dealt with yet .
} deriving Show makeCool :: ParseContext -> ParseContext makeCool ParseContext {input = s} = ParseContext {input = " " , output = s ++ " is cool ! " } main = do s <- getContents let ctx = ParseContext {input = s , output = " " } in putStrLn $ output $ makeCool ctx Let 's start with makeCool :: ParseContext -> ParseContext .
This says makeCool is a function that takes a ParseContext as an argument and returns a ParseContext .
Declaring the signature for a function is usually optional in Haskell , so I could have left this line out .
However , it often aids readability .
Furthermore , it ensures that you and the compiler agree about what 's going on .
ParseContext {input = s} can be read as " I take a ' ParseContext ' as input , and I 'm going to call the value of the ' input ' field 's ' . "
The ParseContext that it returns has " " for the " input " field , but 's ++ " is cool ! " ' for the " output " field , which is really the core of the earlier makeCool function .
The main function has changed by the addition of a let statement .
A let statement is a way to create a sub-equation that 's usable by the lines nested within the " in " clause .
Here a new ParseContext is being created named ctx .
The " input " is " s " , and " output " is " " .
The next line , putStrLn $ output $ makeCool ctx , may cause the reader to have Perl flashbacks , but here , $ is actually used for readability .
( That 's a joke .
Perl programmers should avoid the urge to send me hate mail at this point ! )
The following lines are all equivalent : putStrLn ( output ( makeCool ctx ) ) -- Normal function calls .
( putStrLn . output . makeCool ) ctx -- Function composition : think " f of g " .
putStrLn $ output $ makeCool ctx -- A right to left pipeline .
I think it 's helpful to read the last line backwards : " Pass ' ctx ' to the ' makeCool ' function .
Then pass the result to the ' output ' function .
Then pass the result to the ' putStrLn ' function . "
Last of all , note that the makeCool function returns a ParseContext and the output function is how to get the output field from the ParseContext .
Remember , what would be ctx.output in Java is written output ctx in Haskell .
The $ leads me to my next point .
If you look at putStrLn $ output $ makeCool ctx , it 's sort of a pipeline that runs from right to left .
If you look at the makeCool function , it 's a function that takes a ParseContext and returns a ParseContext .
Whether or not the $ construct is used is n't all that important , but it leads me to the point that the main structure of the program can simply be : A main function that reads input from the outside world and writes output to the outside world .
A ton of functions that transform ParseContext objects , all tied together into a pipeline .
Hence , if the C version is written as : a ( ) ; b( ) ; c( ) ;
Where a , b and c each might modify some global state and print output to the user , in Haskell , one might write : c $ b $ a ctx Where each function takes a ParseContext and returns a new one .
A COMPUTER expert could make legal history when he challenges child pornography charges in court .
Lawyers acting for Sven Tudor - Miles will try next month to have the allegations of making indecent images of children thrown out - because the pictures are of adults .
Mr Tudor - Miles accepts that he created the images by scanning pornographic photographs into his computer and digitally manipulating them .
The 38 - year - old , from Teesside , used his technical know - how to reduce the breast sizes and alter the genitalia of the women .
He covered the modesty of some by adding school uniforms .
His barrister David Lamb describes the case as " strange " and will argue at Teesside Crown Court next month that Mr Tudor - Miles has not committed a criminal offence .
Details of the case emerged on Friday when a date was set for legal arguments between Mr Lamb and the Crown Prosecution Service in front of a senior judge .
The judge must decide whether Mr TudorMiles , of Bankfields Road , Eston , near Middlesbrough , has broken the law and if the prosecution can continue .
On Friday , the judge , Recorder Jeremy Richardson , said the issue should be considered by a more senior judge , but indicated that he thought the images would be classed as illegal .
He said : " My instinct is that it is a criminal offence but that 's without having the benefit of the argument on the point .
" I think this is exactly the sort of mischief Parliament intended when they brought in legislation for pseudoimages .
" At an earlier hearing , a different judge cast doubt on whether Mr Tudor - Miles had committed an offence and used the analogy of a " Tarts and Vicars " party .
He said a photograph of women dressed as schoolgirls at such an event could not be considered child pornography .
Mr Recorder Richardson said : " He has - by his skill on a computer - made more mature women look to be under the age of 18 .
" But Mr Lamb said : " At no stage does the image become that of a child - the face remains the same .
" He scanned the images of the females into his computer and then reduced the size of their breasts and altered their genitalia , and on some hand - drew a white blouse and stripey tie , and on another one , a short grey school skirt .
"
It is believed the Crown Prosecution Service will take the case - thought to be the only recorded one of its kind - to the Court of Appeal if Mr Tudor - Miles is successful in his bid to have the charges dismissed .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 27 — Corporate America is already thinking beyond Election Day , increasing its share of last - minute donations to Democratic candidates and quietly devising strategies for how to work with Democrats if they win control of Congress .
The shift in political giving , for the first 18 days of October , has not been this pronounced in the final stages of a campaign since 1994 , when Republicans swept control of the House for the first time in four decades .
Though Democratic control of either chamber of Congress is far from certain , the prospect of a power shift is leading interest groups to begin rethinking well - established relationships , with business lobbyists going as far as finding potential Democratic allies in the freshman class — even if they are still trying to defeat them on the campaign trail — and preparing to extend an olive branch the morning after the election .
Lobbyists , some of whom had fallen out of the habit of attending Democratic events , are even talking about making their way to the Sonnenalp Resort in Vail , Colo. , where Democrats are holding a ski getaway on Jan .

Ambitious plan surprises fellow space agencies .
Building plans : could a base appear on the Moon within decades ?
© NASA
Japan 's space agency has provoked surprise among other space experts by re-affirming its ambition to build a habitable base on the Moon within decades .
At a lunar exploration symposium in Tokyo this week , head of the country 's lunar and planetary exploration programme Junichiro Kawaguchi announced a deadline of 2020 for sending astronauts to the Moon , and 2030 for constructing the base .
The plan is n't yet official : the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) has not been allocated a budget for the project , which would be expected to cost up to 3 trillion yen ( US $ 26 billion ) .
But a vocal group of Japanese space scientists has called for the plan to become reality .
The dates and details presented by Kawaguchi build upon the country 's 20 - year vision for space exploration , released in the spring of 2005 , which began to consider far - flung ideas such as a Moon base .
The agency intends to kick - start the project next year by launching a satellite into lunar orbit .
This would be followed over the next decade by three unmanned spacecraft to collect samples and conduct research .
Once a base has been built , JAXA envisions a few astronauts manning the facility for 6 months in turn .
It has been almost four decades since man first walked on the Moon .
" The Apollo programme is old , so the technology to visit the Moon is there , " says Bruno Gardini , manager of the European Space Agency 's ( ESA ) Aurora project in Noordwijk , Netherlands .
" But in terms of the financial capacity to build a base , we are talking billions of dollars . "
Boldly go
Gardini says he is surprised by the boldness of the Japanese plan .
The Aurora project is investigating robotic technologies that could potentially be used on missions to Mars , but the ESA has no plan to pursue a manned Moon station , Gardini says .
" To go to the Moon would cost so much that I do n't think anyone could afford to , except possibly America , " he says .
" The financial effort associated with it is so high that it would have to be a joint global effort . "
Satoki Kurokawa , a JAXA spokesperson , told news@nature.com that it is n't yet decided whether Japan would try to go it alone to fulfil these ambitions , or enlist international involvement .

A unilateral move by any country to colonize the Moon does n't make sense , comments Louis Friedman of the Planetary Society in Pasadena , California .
" I do n't think you 'll see separate countries each with bases on the Moon — there 's not that much to do there , " he says .
" It 's not like Antarctica , " he notes , where countries do have the funding and political will to maintain independent bases .
NASA has made it clear that it wants to develop its own capacity to go to the Moon and back .
" It wants to be dependent on no one , " Gardini says .
" Japan 's level of commitment can't be compared to that of the United States , " a senior executive from JAXA , who wished to remain anonymous , told news@nature.com .

Sony and other manufacturers have been accused of asking online retailers for 10 - 15 per cent more for wholesale electronic goods than they charge their traditional counterparts , The Times reports .
This " dual pricing " strategy - designed to narrow the price differential between net and high street - was allegedly initiated by Sony and quickly adopted by other suppliers .
Big - name retail chains have exerted pressure on the CE giants at a time of falling high street sales in the face of cut - price internet offers .
Online retailers have naturally cried foul and will meet today to decide whether to " name and shame " the guilty parties .
Sony already faces Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) and European Commission examination of its pricing strategy .
Sony has a specific interest in supporting its branded Sony Centres , of which there are around 100 in the UK .
It has the clout to force the issue too , as one website 's MD told The Times : " If you are seen to be a troublemaker it can have a detrimental effect on supplies .
If they want to , they can just put you out of business .
We are struggling to stay in business and some companies have already gone to the wall . "
The manufacturers ' case was put this morning by Edward Whitefield of retail consultancy Management Horizons .
He told the BBC's Today programme that this " variable pricing " strategy was designed to create a " more even playing field between different channels of distribution " .
He noted : " The high street retailers are already suffering thin and declining margins .
It 's becoming very unprofitable to retail electrical goods on the high street . "
According to Whitefield , the cost of distribution through the internet is about 20 per cent of sales , compared with 45 per cent of sales for a bricks - and - mortar store , and consumers have greatly benefited as a result of online operations .
They 'll continue to benefit , too , added Whitefield : " Even after this 10 , 15 per cent , the internet price points will still be 15 to 20 per cent lower than comparable high street stores . "
Asked if it was legal to charge different wholesale prices to different retailers , Whitefield asserted : " Yes it is , and it recognises that there are actually different costs of distribution in running a market stall and an expensive high street store " .
He added that if internet retailers complain to the competition authorites " they will find that they that they are up against not only Sony but they 're up against the whole industry " .
Whatever the OFT decides in the matter , e-tailer spokesman James Roper , of the Independent Retail in Media Group , told The Times that manufacturers face a backlash from millions of online customers .
" For the major brand which has instigated this policy , this appears to be an extremely risky step which will upset a lot of consumers , " he warned . ®
CORVALLIS , Ore. , Nov. 7 ( UPI ) -- Research at Oregon State University shows that beer contains a micronutrient that inhibits cancer - causing enzymes .
The compound , xanthohumol , was first isolated by Oregon State 10 years ago and an increasing number of laboratories across the world have begun studying the compound , said Fred Stevens , an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry at Oregon State 's College of Pharmacy .

The substance comes from the hops plant used to give beer its aroma and flavor , ABC News reported .
Most beers made today are low on hops , however , and so do n't contain much xanthohumol .
But beers such as porter , stout and ales have much higher levels of the compound .
Mice studies show that the compound is metabolized quickly by the body , so it 's hard to get a large amount in the body at one time , Stevens said .
" It clearly has some interesting chemo - preventive properties , and the only way people are getting any of it right now is through beer consumption , " he said .
FSB : Startups on fire     NEW YORK ( Fortune Small Business ) - Google , Yahoo ! and Dell were all famously founded on college campuses .
So it 's a good bet that the next generation of paradigm - shifting entrepreneurs is lurking in dormitories as well .
That 's why luminaries such as legendary venture capitalist Ann Winblad , co-founding partner of Hummer Winblad , and Koplovitz & Co. principal Kay Koplovitz agreed to judge the FORTUNE Small Business student startup competition .
Read on to see what 's so special about all three winners .
All six prizewinners in our past two contests are still thriving , so this year 's top teams should be worth watching as they make their way out of the starting gate .

By Elaine Pofeldt , with Brandi Stewart First place : PrepMe Date launched : January 2005 Startup capital : $ 20,000 in prize money from a business plan competition at the University of Chicago Goal :
To become the world 's premier test - preparation provider When Joseph Jewell took the SATs , he decided to treat the intimidating test as a game .
" I looked at it as a challenge to accumulate as many points as I could , " he says .
His strategy worked .
He scored a perfect 1600 , enrolled at the California Institute of Technology in 2001 , and that same year co-wrote a book , " Up Your Score : The Underground Guide to the SAT . "
Jewell decided that other students could profit from his approach .
In January he launched an online SAT - preparation service called PrepMe , along with partners Avichal Garg , a Stanford grad , and Karan Goel , an MBA student at the University of Chicago .
To gain an edge over industry giants Kaplan and the Princeton Review , which both teach a single test - taking methodology , PrepMe provides a personalized approach for each student .
It also offers 20 to 60 hours more preparation material for about the same price as its competitors , as well as live coaching via e-mail , instant messaging , and phone .
There is room for new players :
The $ 6 billion online education market is growing by 25 percent to 30 percent annually , and the number of students taking the SAT is up 17 percent over the last five years .
But getting beyond a few million dollars in annual revenues will be tough .
Still , PrepMe already has almost 60 clients , and co-founder Goel notes that PrepMe 's young team has a powerful advantage over its more established rivals : " We do n't sleep . " -- Maggie Overfelt Second place : NeuroLife Date founded : December 2004 StartUp capital : $ 7,500 from business - plan competitions Goal :
To be acquired As a flight surgeon for the Air Force , Ernest Braxton was frustrated by the dangers involved in monitoring brain pressure in patients with head injuries .
Neurosurgeons must insert a catheter into the brain through a hole bored in the skull �a procedure that often causes grave complications .
Braxton -- who has his MD from the University of Pennsylvania and is earning an MBA at Carnegie Mellon 's Tepper School of Business -- teamed up with fellow MD and Tepper MBA Daniel McChesney .
The two launched NeuroLife , which is creating a medical device for detecting elevated brain pressure .
NeuroLife 's monitor , called iScan , uses fiber optics and proprietary software to measure changes in the eye 's blood supply .
The tool borrows from an ophthalmological technique that measures eye pressure .
Because of the close relationship between the eye and the brain , small changes in the blood supply to the eye correlate with brain pressure , says McChesney .
If the iScan finds the brain pressure to be normal , patients can avoid the dangers of a traditional monitor .
NeuroLife still has to build a prototype , and then prove iSCAN 's effectiveness in FDA trials , which will take years .
But the fact that the current method of gauging brain pressure is very expensive could work in NeuroLife 's favor .
The iScan will sharply reduce those costs , says McChesney .
If NeuroLife succeeds , McChesney will have given up a career in medicine for one in business .

To be acquired Harlan Beverly has won his share of tournaments in online games , but as a hard - core gamer for the past 15 years he has also suffered the agony of losing .
" And it 's not my fault , " he groans .
The culprit , he says , is a technical lag that slows many games when the servers that they are running on bog down with traffic .
In online baseball , for instance , this might cause a delay when a batter swings .
A chip architect at Intel until 2004 , Beverly developed a computer card that communicates with servers , downloading some of the processes that they perform online and allowing them to run faster , thus speeding up online games .
Enrolled at McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin , Beverly teamed with classmates Michael Cubbage and Bob Grim to form Bigfoot Networks .
Their gaming accelerator card , called NetBlazer , eliminates disruptions caused by server lags .
If Bigfoot can raise more money , it hopes to begin selling NetBlazer by July for $ 300 .
David Cole , founder of the San Diego gaming research firm DFC Intelligence , estimates that Bigfoot could easily attract 100,000 customers for the NetBlazer card in the U.S. Although PC makers like Dell are luring online gamers with ultrafast processors , none , says Cole , has offered a solution for lag disruptions .
And if companies such as Broadcom or Intel do want to create a product similar to NetBlazer , Bigfoot is well - positioned .
" One of those companies will probably acquire us , " says Beverly .
In the meantime , he says he 's doing better in online tournaments now that he is testing NetBlazer .

Separate groups of hackers are releasing a barrage of worms in a battle to seize control of Windows PCs that remain vulnerable to the now infamous Windows Plug - and - Play vulnerability .
The Bozori worm attempts to remove infections by earlier versions of the Zotob worm and other malware , so it can take control of a compromised computer for itself .
A family of IRC bots that exploit the same Microsoft ( MS05 - 039 ) Plug and Play vulnerability likewise try to remove competing PnP bots , as explained in a diagram by Finnish anti-virus firm F - Secure here .
It reckons 11 different types of malware are exploiting the vulnerability .
The upswing in malware creation - and competition between various PnP worms - echoes the competition between NetSky and Bagle worms for control of vulnerable Windows PCs that first flared up in March 2004 .
Then , as now , it 's all about turning Windows PCs in zombie spam bots .
" Once one of these worms has control over your computer , it can use your PC for sending spam , launching an extortion denial - of - service attack against a website , stealing confidential information or blasting out new versions of malware to other unsuspecting computer users , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .
" Organised criminal gangs are behind attacks like these and their motive is to make money .
Owning a large network of compromised computers is a valuable asset to these criminals , and every business needs to take steps to ensure they are not the next victim on their list . "
The worms are affecting computers which are not properly patched against Microsoft security holes such as the MS05 - 039 Plug and Play vulnerability , disclosed by Microsoft last week .
Windows 2000 systems are particularly at risk of exploit .
Many organisations have already been hit including CNN , ABC , The Financial Times , and the New York Times .
General Electric , United Parcel Service , Caterpillar and the US Congress have also been affected by PnP worm infestation .
Security firms at odds over seriousness of outbreak
This sounds bad but according to Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky Labs the seriousness of the outbreak has been exaggerated by the media .
" There has not been any noticeable increase in network activity which could be ascribed to this worm [ outbreak ] .
During the Sasser epidemic in May 2004 , which some publications are using as a comparison for Bozori-A , Sasser caused an increase in network traffic of approximately 20 per cent to 40 per cent .
At the moment , there are no signs of a similar increase , " it said .
Kaspersky 's argument has been bolstered by a lowering of the alert status at Internet Storm Centre ( ISC ) , which runs a well respected vendor - independent syber threat monitoring and alert system .
However security firm Arbor Networks takes the opposite line and said that , if anything , the Zotob Worm is being underestimated .
" Arbor Networks has received calls from a number of large companies that have been devastated by Zotob .
Because there have been an additional seven variants of the worm released and the most recent one is through email , this has the potential to become a much bigger problem for companies , " it said .
" This worm is picking up new tricks along the way , leveraging old exploits and has become a multi-vector , blended threat .
This is an indication of the amount of code sharing that takes place among worm and malware authors . "
Although vendors differ over the scope of the attack there 's general agreement over remedial actions : block traffic on port 445 at least at the internet perimeter , patch systems quickly , apply anti-virus signature updates .
Tin - foil hats may not go amiss either . ®
WASHINGTON , Oct. 20 ( UPI ) --
The Iraq conflict is not stabilizing , it is rapidly getting worse .
And current U.S. policies are not helping .
It is less than a year since Iraq held full - scale parliamentary elections .
Bush administration policymakers and their pundit allies in the media were genuinely confident that those elections would prove a historic turning point in Iraq and they were absolutely correct :
The only trouble was that the turning point plunged the country into hell , not heaven .
Advertisement
For it was those elections so eagerly pushed and hyped by the White House that gave the Sunni insurgents in central Iraq the great strategic goal for which they had previously been striving in vain for more than two - and - a - half years .
It was those elections that transformed the Iraq conflict from a limited insurgency supported by a relatively small minority within an ethnic minority of only 5 million Sunni Iraqis -- less than 20 percent of the total population -- into a burgeoning full scale civil war between the two largest religious groups in the country comprising 80 percent of the population , or 22.4 million people between them .
For the elections led to a consolidation of Shiite political power in Baghdad and then to the empowering of Shiite militias by Shiite political parties dominating the new parliament .
Shiite militia influence within the new Iraqi police and army rapidly grew .
Less than three months after the elections , on Feb. 22 , 2006 , Sunni insurgents bombed the al - Askariya , or Golden Mosque in Samara , one of the holiest Shiite shrines in Iraq .
Enraged Shiite militias lost no time in flexing their new - found power and confidence .
They launched campaigns of terror and ethnic cleansing and random mass killings against Sunni communities .
The general Sunni population rallied to their own insurgents in response .

The 130,000 to 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq proved far too few to prevent the collapse into chaos and civil war .
Besides , the Bush administration and U.S. military commanders in Iraq were focusing on trying to minimize American military casualties in the year - long run up to the November congressional elections in the United States .
U.S. civilian policymakers and military commanders had both signed on to the delusion that the new Iraqi security forces could prove effective in reining in the Shiite militias as well as the Sunni insurgents .
It is now abundantly clear that they have failed to do so .
U.S. policymakers also assumed that the new Shiite - dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki that they laboriously cobbled together this spring would prove simultaneously effective , credible with the Iraqi people , and an obedient , compliant partner for American military policies .
Every one of those assumptions has now also been shown to be a pipe dream .
The al - Maliki government remains entirely ineffectual -- even in its own capital Baghdad -- outside the heavily guarded enclave of the Green Zone .
It can not protect its own key personnel from either Sunni insurgents on the one hand or the pressures of the Shiite militias on the other .
The New York Times reported Wednesday that the government has fired the nation 's two top police commanders this week in a desperate bid to try and reduce and end the operation of Shiite death squads from within the ranks of the special police services themselves .
Only two days earlier , on Monday , USA Today reported that Prime Minister al - Maliki was openly defying U.S. pressure to use the Iraqi army and security forces to disarm the Shiite militias .
He said there was no question of taking such action either for the rest of this year or at the very least early into next year , despite violence against Sunnis that is escalating by the day .

Al - Maliki is trying to walk a tightrope between his dependence on U.S. military support and his desperate need to try and establish some independent credibility primarily within his own Shiite constituency .
Most of all , al - Maliki knows that he cannot rely on the Shiite - dominated Iraqi army to act against Shiite militias that have already heavily infiltrated it .
The number of Iraqi Shiite soldiers who owe their primary allegiance to these militias , especially Moqtada al - Sadr 's ever more formidable Mahdi Army , rather than to the Iraqi Army , is unknown , either by the Iraqi authorities or by U.S. military commanders .
This was a predictable outcome of the crazed rush with which the U.S. government and military commanders in Iraq encouraged the Iraqis to create their new army and security forces at breakneck speed from scratch over the past two years .
Given the paucity of U.S. troops and resources in the country and the chaotic anarchy of the environment within which they were operating , no serious attempt was made to seriously check the backgrounds of most recruits .
For the past seven months we have been warning in these columns that no effective government or indigenous security forces existed in Iraq , nor will they in the foreseeable future .
We have repeatedly warned that what we described as " Belfast Rules " or " Beirut Rules " operate in Iraq : a state of chaos in which local militias exercise real power , usually brutally , through most of the country .
The grim developments of the past two weeks further confirm this assessment .

Gore calls for elimination of payroll taxes , CO2 freeze RAW STORY
Published : Monday September 18 , 2006 Print This Email This Former Vice President Al Gore has called for the end of the payroll tax and a freeze on CO2 emissions to " solve the climate crisis , " RAW STORY has learned .
" My purpose , " Gore told a crowd at NYU , " is not to present a comprehensive and detailed blueprint , for that is a task for our democracy as a whole . "
Gore is calling on lawmakers to " expand the limits of what is politically possible " and take major action to halt global warming .
" We should start by immediately freezing CO2 emissions , " Gore indicated , " and then beginning sharp reductions . "
Gore also called for a ratification of the Kyoto Treaty .
" Third , a responsible approach to solutions would avoid the mistake of trying to find a single magic ' silver bullet , ' " he elaborated , " and recognize that the answer will involve what Bill McKibben has called ' silver - buckshot ' -- numerous important solutions , all of which are hard , but no one of which is by itself the full answer for our problem . "
The former Vice President also called for a " revenue - neutral tax - swap , " eliminating all payroll taxes in exchange for pollutant taxes .
" For the last fourteen years , " he claimed , " I have advocated the elimination of all payroll taxes -- including those for social security and unemployment compensation -- and the replacement of that revenue in the form of pollution taxes , principally on CO2 . "
But Gore said it 's up to the American people to demand action .
" When the politicians are paralyzed in the face of a great threat , " he explained , " our nation needs a popular movement , a rallying cry , a standard , a mandate that is broadly supported on a bipartisan basis . "
The former Presidential candidate plans to spend the next year campaigning for the cause .
Past Constitution Avenue , towards the Margala hills , lies the oldest part of Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad .
Construction of the new city began in the early 1960s , to the designs of a Greek urban planner , Constantinos Doxiadis ; but the shrine of Shah Abdul Latif was built two centuries earlier , on the orders of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb .
Inside is the tomb of this mystic and it is reached through a busy square full of small shops with crates of Pepsi and 7 Up piled up outside , far removed from the smart boutiques , ice cream parlours and burger joints of the capital itself .
As you walk towards the shrine , young children tug at your clothes offering to sell you a deig - literally , a pot , usually of rice or meat , which is then distributed free to other pilgrims .
Every May , the site fills to capacity as the followers of the shah arrive to commemorate the anniversary of his death .
Famously , women put on dozens of cheap bangles and smash them on stones , drawing blood , in a ritual act of devotion .
What 's surprising about the shrine is that the Islam practised here is considered profane by the fundamentalists who are said to dominate Pakistan .
People who visit the shrine pray to the shah , rather than directly to Allah .
Wine and cannabis are frequently used by pilgrims striving for a state of religious ecstasy .
But not only do similar shrines exist throughout Pakistan , this shrine and the village surrounding it are one of the few remains of the people who lived here before Islamabad began .
Many other villages were relocated to create room for the new , pristine capital , but no one dared to move the shrine of the shah .
This folk religion has also been transplanted into Pakistani communities abroad .
Even the pages of Urdu- language newspapers in Britain run advertisements from latter - day mystics who offer to help people with problems ranging from infertility to possession .
In one sense , more orthodox Muslims are right to criticise these practices ; they are based on superstition and on an older - fashioned belief in the authority of the " wise man " rather than that of an impersonal god .
But the popularity of these practices also helps us to understand the nature of modern Pakistan .
For a start , Islam is surprisingly weak as a political force .
Even though Pakistan was created explicitly as a state for Muslims , there is no agreed version of what Islam is .
These mystical practices are widespread and there is also tension , which frequently grows into sectarian violence , between the Sunni and Shia communities .
This creates a dilemma for Islamic parties in Pakistan .
They can't claim to speak for all Pakistanis on doctrinal issues - those are divisive .
On the other hand , all Pakistanis can agree on the oppression of the Muslim population in Kashmir and on other , more distant injustices .
Islamic politics in Pakistan therefore focuses disproportionately on those issues and helps to create the impression that Pakistan is part of a global Muslim ummah
This is far from the reality .
The focus of the lives of most Pakistanis is obviously domestic .
Pakistan is a poor , corrupt country struggling to develop economically .
What I find saddest are stories of people who die because of the lack of sanitation .
One man , whose children had died of cholera and other water - borne illnesses , was quoted in a Pakistani newspaper as saying his last remaining desire in life was " a clean , cold drink of water " .
There is little room in such a hand - to - mouth existence for talk of a global politics of jihad , but it 's easy to see why it can become a consoling distraction .
Alongside the poverty though , there is also an emerging middle class .
And its values too , like those of the pilgrims at the shrine of Shah Abdul Latif , are far removed from those of the Islamic traditionalists .
The middle class has embraced developments in the banking sector and consumer credit is booming .
There is little talk of whether or not interest is haram .
Western culture is also being sought out with energy and enthusiasm .
Internet cafes are popular and are typically used to view pornography ; they 're even set up with that in mind , all the seats against the wall , all the screens surrounded by a wooden box to deter peeping toms .
Pirated CDs and DVDs are available everywhere - uncensored and cheap .
But while much of this may be superficial , it is easy to see how broader social changes are also on the horizon .
TV drama serials , with massive audiences , are tackling issues such as the education of women and forced marriage .
It 's facile to assume that what 's seen on screen is a direct reflection of social change , but it's also hard to deny that these fictional dramas will provide scripts and role models for real domestic struggles .
Equally , politicians can draw comfort or inspiration from these other facets of Pakistani life .
The culture is not as devout or puritanical as the tradi-tionalists pretend and this means that politicians from other parties should appeal openly to other constituencies .
It should be clear that there are votes in broadening access to education for women , as in improving water supplies and sewage .
Pakistan may continue to be critical in the struggle against radical Islam for years to come , but there are domestic struggles that are equally , if not more , important .

The police officers were allowed access to the racks where the [ The Pirate Bay ] servers and other servers are hosted .
All servers in the racks were clearly marked as to which sites run on each .
The police took down all servers in the racks , including the non-commercial site Piratbyrån , the mission of which is to defend the rights of [ The Pirate Bay ] via public debate .
According to police officers simultaneously questioning the president of Rix|Port80 , the purpose of the search warrant is to take down [ The Pirate Bay ] in order to secure evidence of the allegations mentioned above .
The necessity for securing technical evidence for the existence of a web - service which is fully official , the legality of which has been under public debate for years and whose principals are public persons giving regular press interviews , could not be explained .
Asked for other reasoning behind the choice to take down a site , without knowing whether it is illegal or not , the officers explained that this is normal . ”
Now , I am not making any statements regarding whether sharing or downloading files should be legal or not .
I personally do n’t consider the downloading of files a crime , and consider the ruckus made by the media corporations nothing more than an unwillingness to adapt its product to a new market .
Instead of looking to their product as a cause for dropping sales , they are blaming it on the consumers .
It is roughly the equivalent to sitting in a debate and defending the salaries of IT personnel the day after the IT bubble burst .
The market has changed , and the media companies need to adopt .
I believe the reason the media industry is losing money is because of the higher availability of their product .
The higher the availability and the bigger the quantity of a good , the lower the market price will tend to be .
Since more music has been made more available to more people , it is no longer considered worth paying , for instance , 20 dollars for a CD .
Failure to adapt to these new conditions has made the media companies lose money , and has in fact helped propagate file sharing .
Also , the police raid was allegedly performed by 50 police officers , in order to seize some servers and bring three people to the police station to be interrogated .
This was an absurd demonstration of state force .
After all , these people were hardly terrorists , and the servers could hardly be considered weapons of mass destruction .
In fact , the founders of The Pirate Bay have , unlike many other bit torrent trackers and file sharing sites , held a high profile and made no secret of what they were doing .
But wait , it gets even more absurd .
One of the accused , Mikael Viborg , who is the legal advisor of The Pirate Bay and Piratbyrån , was forced to give a DNA sample to the police ( Swedish only ) !
When asked why he had to give a DNA sample , he received no answer other than that the police had the right to do so .
Do the Swedish police intend to show that he has in fact been in contact with one of the allegedly illegal servers by showing that his DNA can be found on it ?
I strongly doubt it , but it makes you wonder what the DNA sample is to be used for .
I do n’t know , but I do know that there is something rotten in the state of Sweden .
Notes in the margin :
Piratbyrån is now up and running as a blog on blogger.com .

I apologize in advance for all of the " 2.0 " posts recently — but I could n't help myself .
My recent " Geek Dinner " experience impacted me more than I anticipated .
Sure it was cool that I got to rub elbows ( literally ) with Robert Scoble and some other Silicon Valley shakers — but what really got my gears turning was the notion of what passes for as a " Geek " these days .
Geekdom , is nothing like what I remember it to be from High school .
Today , it seems that the most cutting edge , tech savvy and just plain " cool " people around proudly wear a " Geek badge " .
But to me , it seems like it's an evolution of " Geek culture " .
Geeking out in the classic sense means going gaga over our gadgets .
Learning how to tweak them to their highest potential .
And if you think of it , most of the " 2.0 " Web applications out there that are fueling this whole movement are created and designed by ...
Geeks .
But these are n't your parents Geeks .
These are the Geeks that invent the Facebook 's Firefoxes and Flickr 's of the world .
These are the Geeks that have taken Silicon Valley by storm .
They are also the Geeks who are coveted and sought after by smart companies such as Google .
And here is the kicker .
Though the comfort level with technology is a pre-requisite , Geeks can be anyone .
You can be a Design Geek , a Writer Geek — heck , you can even be a Marketing Geek .
In fact , maybe you should .
In marketing , when we look at how Web applications like You Tube have totally interrupted the Advertising model — maybe it makes sense to " Geek out " and really grasp how these emerging media technologies are feeding the appetite of consumers at ease with their digital lifestyles .
Maybe we 're all really Geeks in the end ( or need to be ) .
And if that 's the case — we better figure out how to create the right kinds of experiences and tell the most compelling stories to our own Geeky selves .
We 're Giving Up Privacy and Getting Little in Return
Better to Put People , Not Computers , in Charge of Investigating Potential Plots
Collecting information about every American ’s phone calls is an example of data mining .
The basic idea is to collect as much information as possible on everyone , sift through it with massive computers , and uncover terrorist plots .
It ’s a compelling idea , and convinces many .
But it ’s wrong .
We ’re not going to find terrorist plots through systems like this , and we ’re going to waste valuable resources chasing down false alarms .
To understand why , we have to look at the economics of the system .
Data mining works best when you ’re searching for a well - defined profile , a reasonable number of attacks per year , and a low cost of false alarms .
Credit - card fraud is one of data mining ’s success stories :
All credit - card companies mine their transaction databases for data for spending patterns that indicate a stolen card .
Many credit - card thieves share a pattern — purchase expensive luxury goods , purchase things that can be easily fenced , etc. — and data mining systems can minimize the losses in many cases by shutting down the card .
In addition , the cost of false alarms is only a phone call to the cardholder asking him to verify a couple of purchases .
The cardholders do n’t even resent these phone calls — as long as they ’re infrequent — so the cost is just a few minutes of operator time .
Terrorist plots are different ; there is no well - defined profile and attacks are very rare .
This means that data - mining systems wo n’t uncover any terrorist plots until they are very accurate , and that even very accurate systems will be so flooded with false alarms that they will be useless .
Just in the United States , there are trillions of connections between people and events — things that the data - mining system will have to “ look at ” — and very few plots .
This rarity makes even accurate identification systems useless .
Let ’s look at some numbers .
We ’ll be optimistic — we ’ll assume the system has a one in 100 false - positive rate ( 99 percent accurate ) , and a one in 1,000 false - negative rate ( 99.9 percent accurate ) .
Assume 1 trillion possible indicators to sift through : that ’s about 10 events — e-mails , phone calls , purchases , Web destinations , whatever — per person in the United States per day .
Also assume that 10 of them actually indicate terrorists plotting .
This unrealistically accurate system will generate 1 billion false alarms for every real terrorist plot it uncovers .
Every day , the police will have to investigate 27 million potential plots in order to find the one real terrorist plot per month .
Clearly ridiculous .
This is n’t anything new .
In statistics , it ’s called the “ base rate fallacy , ” and it applies in other domains as well .
And this is exactly the sort of thing we saw with the National Security Agency ( NSA ) eavesdropping program :
The New York Times reported that the computers spat out thousands of tips per month .
Every one of them turned out to be a false alarm , at enormous cost in money and civil liberties .
Finding terrorism plots is not a problem that lends itself to data mining .
It ’s a needle - in - a - haystack problem , and throwing more hay on the pile does n’t make that problem any easier .
We ’d be far better off putting people in charge of investigating potential plots and letting them direct the computers , instead of putting the computers in charge and letting them decide who should be investigated .
By allowing the NSA to eavesdrop on us all , we ’re not trading privacy for security .
We ’re giving up privacy without getting any security in return .

Google Inc. is testing a service called Google Base that could put it squarely in competition with eBay Inc. , newspapers and other sellers of classified ads .
Google Base would let users submit information , including classified - like listings of items for sale , to a searchable Google database , according to Web pages from Google 's test that were intermittently available to the public .

The internet has revolutionised the way we distribute music .
When I wrote Between the Wars in the middle of the 1984 miners ' strike , the process of recording , designing , marketing and finding a place in my record company 's release schedule meant the song was n't available until the strike was almost over .
Now , thanks to the internet , it is possible to write a song , record it and make it available for download within the space of 24 hours .
The new technology also brings into question the role of record companies in the new media .
In the past , if they wanted to sell records , artists were obliged to sign to a big label .
Only they had the muscle to ensure that your record got into all the shops and , crucially , that you got paid .
Even the independent labels , who made a great show of standing apart from the majors , often relied on them for distribution and revenue collection .
Artists paid a high price for this service , signing away ownership of their recordings for the full life of copyright , effectively until no more could be earned from them .
Sure , the artists made some money , but seldom more than 10 - 15 % of what the record company kept from the retailers to cover manufacturing , marketing , promotion and distribution .
Unsurprisingly , the music industry has simply carried over this arrangement into the age of the mp3 .
iTunes charges 79 p a track , of which it keeps around 29 p , passing on the rest to the record companies who then give the artist - you guessed it - 10 - 15 % .
With back catalogue material , that 's all profit for the labels .
All they have to do is drag and click the relevant file on to iTunes .
Now that physical production and distribution are no longer necessary , the question arises as to whether new artists need to sign their rights away to record companies at all .
A band which records and promotes its own music via the internet could sign a deal directly with iTunes , keeping all of the profits and retaining ownership of copyright .
Although the task of breaking an artist should not be underestimated , the financial incentives are so great that it can surely be only a matter of time before the first truly independent artist breaks through via the internet without relying on a record company to market them .
With a potential shift in power away from the labels and towards the artists , it becomes crucial that new talent coming into the industry retains the right to exploit the material that it creates .
The rise of social networking sites offers unknowns the opportunity to build a career via the new medium .
Artists no longer wait to be discovered , short - circuiting the old routes by posting their songs and videos up on to sites like MySpace and Bebo where they can gain a following through peer - to - peer recommendation .
Already , the vast majority of those uploading their work on to the net have no contractual agreements with anybody : no publishing deal , no record contract , no lawyer or manager advising them and that is as it should be in the spirit of the internet - let a thousand flowers bloom .
However , some social networking sites are making claims of ownership on the material that users make available through their services .
When challenged recently about this practice , both MySpace and Bebo swiftly changed their terms of use to reflect the view that ownership of content posted on their sites resides solely with the artists who originated it .
Others have not been so conscientious .
On August 1 , MTV launched a new social networking site called MTV Flux and invited users to post songs and videos to share with other members .
Those clips which are the most popular will be aired on the MTV Flux TV channel , which comes on air on September 6 , giving unsigned artists access to a medium that has previously been the sole preserve of the record companies and their stars .
Artists wanting to see themselves on MTV are unlikely to read the terms and conditions with which they are required to agree before joining the service .
That is unfortunate ; a close reading suggests that MTV wants to own their work .
In order to get on to MTV Flux , users have to grant MTV the right to transmit their material on the network " in perpetuity and gratis " .
They also claim " the right to commercially exploit , host , store , copy , distribute , modify , edit , incorporate into other material , and / or otherwise treat in any way your Material at ( MTV's ) discretion without any payment " to the artist .
It seems that MTV Flux will be a TV channel comprising solely user - generated content , the commercial exploitation rights of which are owned by MTV .
Just so no one should be in any confusion about what such an agreement might involve , MTV 's content submission conditions states : ' In particular , you agree to waive all moral rights to the Material . '*
Such terms are unprecedented in the music industry and could have serious long - term implications .
It may be that any artist who breaks via the MTV Flux set - up might find that , years later , MTV has some claim to residual rights in their material or else have the use of it for life of copyright , without any payment to the artist , " in perpetuity and gratis " .
The demand that users waive all moral rights to their material in order to join a service brings into question the role of social networking sites .
Will they usher in a revolution in the music industry by allowing self - promoted artists to circumvent the major record companies who have stood as gatekeepers of public taste for so long ?
Or will they simply be the means by which the industry keeps its monopoly on copyright ownership and earnings through the silent harvesting of intellectual property rights ?

Aircraft carrier sunk in Gulf of Mexico to create artificial reef IN THE GULF OF MEXICO ( AP ) 
As hundreds of veterans looked on solemnly , Navy divers blew holes in a retired aircraft carrier and sent the 888 - foot USS Oriskany to the bottom of the sea Wednesday , forming the world 's largest deliberately created artificial reef .
Clouds of brown and gray smoke rose in the sky after more than 500 pounds of plastic explosives went off .
The rusted hulk took about 45 minutes to slip beneath the waves , about four hours faster than predicted .
VIDEO : Navy ship sunk to create reef Korean and Vietnam War veterans aboard charter boats watched from beyond a one - mile safety perimeter as the " Mighty O " went down in 212 feet of water , about 24 miles off Pensacola Beach .
Lloyd Quiter of North Collins , N.Y. , who served four tours on the ship in Vietnam , wept .
" I 'm a little stunned .
It 's a little hard to take , " he said .
The aircraft carrier went down stern first , the bow lifting up into the air and creating one final spray of water as it sank .
The water churned a foamy white as the deck slid under .
Hundreds of surrounding boats blew their horns in tribute .
The Oriskany became the first vessel sunk under a new Navy program to dispose of old warships by turning them into reefs that can attract fish and other marine life .
Over the years , other ships have been turned into reefs , including the warship USS Spiegel Grove , a cargo vessel that was scuttled in 2002 off Key Largo .
But that was a civilian project , paid for with a combination of county and private money .
The Oriskany , commissioned in 1950 and named after an American Revolutionary War battle , saw duty during the Korean War and was home to John McCain when the Navy pilot and future senator served in Vietnam .
It was also among the ships used by President Kennedy in a show of force during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis .
It was decommissioned in 1976 .
McCain was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 after taking off from the Oriskany and was held as a prisoner of war for five years .
" It was a small , old carrier that fought very valiantly , and I 'm very proud to have been a part of the air wing that served with great courage and distinction , " McCain told CNN on Wednesday .
McCain said he had hoped the ship would be turned into a museum , but the artificial reef will " provide a lot of recreation and a lot of good times for people . "
The Environmental Protection Agency in February approved the sinking of the ship , which had toxins in its electrical cables , insulation and paint .
EPA officials said the toxins will slowly leach out over the estimated 100 years it will take the carrier to rust away , and should pose no danger to marine life .
Marine wildlife experts planned to monitor the waters .
Local leaders hope the reef brings a long - awaited economic infusion from sport divers and fishermen .
A 2004 Florida State University study estimated Escambia County would see $ 92 million a year in economic benefits from an artificial reef .

The USS Oriskany heads Wednesday toward its new home on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico .
MarketWatch reports on a Wall Street Journal article saying that Alain Levy , CEO of EMI Music , expects Apple to end the one - price - fits - all pricing in the iTunes Music Store within a year , increasing prices for popular songs and cutting prices for music by unknown artists .
Levy reportedly discussed the issue with Steve Jobs , although the details of those discussions were not given and it was not claimed that Jobs made specific statements about iTMS pricing himself .
From a Levy press conference :
There is a common understanding that we will have to come to a variable pricing structure .
The issue is when .
There is a case for superstars to have a higher price .
Have u ever seen the calendar for September 1752 ???
If you are working in Unix , try this out .
At $ prompt , type : cal 9 1752 Surprised ????
See the explanation for what you see .
Is n't the output queer ?
A month with whole of eleven days missing .
This was the time England shifted from Roman Julian Calendar to the Gregorian Calendar , and the king of England ordered those 11 days to be wiped off the face of the month of September of 1752 .
( What could n't a King do in those days ? ! )
And yes , the workers worked for 11 days less , but got paid for the entire 30 days .
And that 's how " Paid Leave " was born .
Hail the King !!
One of the things I like about working as a Business Analyst is that , in the right environment , there is quite a bit of variation in the actual work I do .
So much so , that when people ask me “ what does a BA do ? ” my usual answer is “ it depends on who ’s hiring me . ”
Depending on the nature of the contract , I might be involved in some early stage requirements gathering , researching options for new software or a website , putting together a tender , writing up Business Requirements and / or Functional Specifications or maybe coming in towards the end of a project to write user documentation and / or help with implementation .
One of the things I am often called on to do is run workshops or meetings to work with users to develop business requirements .
The internet is a wealth of information for running effective meetings ( Google is my co-pilot ) and I frequently search out new ideas .
My current contract was no exception so when I was planning some meetings I looked online for some ideas on how to structure the sessions .
I found one particular guide on a number of UK government websites .
It seemed aimed more at community groups than corporate bodies but there were some useful tips .
The full guide ran to about 10 pages and as I worked my way through it I started to notice something a little odd about the tone that was developing .
It seemed to have been written by a passive - aggressive hippy .
There was a lot of the expected touchy - feely , positive atmosphere , support everyone vibe .
But every now and then I think the author let a little more of their inner psyche show than they intended .
There were recurring warnings about trouble makers ( “ watch body language ” , “ Note digressions and remind members to stay on task ” , “ Guide members who speak a great deal to be briefer ” ) .
And every time the author gave a suggestion for what to say to a troublemaker , the comment was always directed at a female .
I ’m sure the author would say they were simply being gender inclusive but I could n’t help thinking there might be some … issues behind this .
Then we come to the part that made me really think the author was a hippy : make everything FUN !
This is n’t a completely terrible idea but it ended up getting more than a little overdone .
Apparently , if you start each meeting with something fun , people will come on time because they do n’t want to miss the fun part of the meeting .
Silly me , I try to make meeting relevant and concise to encourage people to come .
This advice was followed up with some real doozies .
The “ ideas for launches and fun ” went like this :
Sing your name and have the group sing it back to you .
I stared at this suggestion for a full minute .
Seriously .
If I ever do this in a meeting , someone stab me in the eye , please .
Because I ’ll sure as hell do it to anyone who sings their name at me .
Break into small groups and do a mime skit about an agenda item .
Oh my god .
All I could think of was that the group would be more likely to be plotting ways to murder the meeting presenter .
Become someone else , mime it and have people guess .
“ You ’re a moron . ” “ You ’re an escapee from a mental institution . ”
“ No , I ’ve got it , you ’re a brain damaged weasel . ”
Sing and dance the song , the hokey pokey
Personally , I ’d start a conga line right out the door at this point .
Do a weather report on how you are feeling .
“ Sunny and warm .
Cloudy with chance of grumpiness … ”
I am a tornado .
You are a trailer park .
Dress up in costume and make a story about the history of an agenda item .
What the hell ?
If I get a meeting request asking me to bring along a costume , I ’m staying the hell away .
Have everyone write their middle name on a piece of paper then try to guess what name belongs to whom .
I would conspire with the others so that everyone wrote “ dildo ” and then every time we ’d guess it was the presenter ’s middle name .
Have everyone write something about themselves nobody knows then try and guess who wrote what .
Again , I would conspire with the group .
This time we would all write “ I ’m going to kill the presenter before the end of the meeting . ”
So much for fun .
Another good piece of advice was “ praise people twice as much as you criticise them . ”
My previous , obviously misguided , strategy was to not criticise people at all if I could avoid it but with this advice under my belt I was free to go “ Excellent point Bob , thanks for sharing …
Wonderfully illustrated Bob , thanks for that …
Shut the hell up Bob , you ’re a moron . ”
If anyone is looking for serious advice on running meetings , here ’s mine .
Plan it out .
Know what you need to achieve .
Set an agenda and stick to it .
Make sure everyone attending knows ahead of time what ’s expected from them and what you ’re aiming to get out of the meeting .
There are times when you need to get creative to keep people engaged , particularly with longer sessions ( anything over two hours needs serious planning and some variety ) .
But whenever possible , keep it simple .
Cut the bullshit and people will thank you for it .
A GOP ad against Senate candidate Harold Ford -- featuring a white seductress who says she met the black lawmaker at a Playboy party and that he should call her -- is so odious and racially tinged that Ford 's Republican opponent , Bob Corker , denounces it .
Republican Wyoming congresswoman Barbara Cubin tells a wheelchair - bound Libertarian candidate after a debate : " If you were n't sitting in that chair , I 'd slap you in the face . "
Hillary Clinton 's opponent says she used to be ugly -- and why did Bill marry her , anyway ? -- but now looks okay thanks to millions in plastic surgery .
Rush Limbaugh says Michael J. Fox is exaggerating his Parkinson 's in political ads .
A John Kerry spokesman calls carping liberal bloggers " cowards . "
One of the most unfortunate aspects has been that we have been diverted for talking about the issues Virginians care about .
Campaigns are supposed to be about a robust discussion of the issues so that voters can make educated and informed choices .
I have said that I brought some of this on myself , but much of this is baseless allegations .
It seems that those who are scared about running on issues try to change the subject because they know that if this election is decided on issues , we ’ll win .
UPDATE
Howard Kurtz , media critic for CNN and The Washington Post , wanted to write a column about what he calls the " rather low state of this campaign season , " and these are the five examples he provided to support his claim :
As we all learned to inquire from Sesame Street -- which of those examples does not belong on that list ?
The column is about mud-slinging in order to win political campaigns ( the headline is " Down in the Mud " ) , and Kurtz 's first four examples , appropriately enough , are ones in which partisan political figures spew repugnant personal insults against their political opponents in order to win elections -- which is the topic of Kurtz 's column .
But then he tacks on an example at the end in which some spokesman for John Kerry , who is n't on any ballot , calls an anonymous blogger whose identity nobody knows a " coward " for insisting that Kerry donate more of his horded cash to Democratic candidates .
That has nothing to do with Kurtz 's topic , nor does it have anything to do with the lowly state of political campaigns or dirty ads .
That incident might be an interesting example to illustrate the tensions between establishment politicians and bloggers , or to examine the competing views of Internet anonymity .
But the Kerry - blogger exchange has nothing to do with the slimy , insult - driven state of political ads or the midterm campaigns , nor does it even arguably compete in the slime department with the other examples he provides .
The reason Kurtz added that incident is painfully and depressingly obvious -- it 's because he had no examples of Democratic campaigns doing anything remotely equal to the acts of Rush Limbaugh , Barbara Cubin and Hillary Clinton 's opponent , but he was afraid to point out that fact .
So , instead , he cowardly strove to contrive the appearance of superficial " balance " and decorative nonpartisan objectivity , even at the expense of actual objectivity and factual reporting .
Under the rules of the type of vapid and corrupt " journalism " which Kurtz practices , the overriding mandate is to criticize both sides equally and blindly even if only one side is guilty of the crime in question .
And therein lies the gravest illness of modern journalism -- the refusal on the part of people like Kurtz to report on matters honestly and factually .
When reporters have as their central mandate that they must criticize each side equally -- even if doing so causes them to report on matters dishonestly -- it encourages one side to sink as low as possible , to be as deceitful , corrupt and dishonorable as possible , because the media will never report that fact and will never identify the guilty side as doing anything different than the other side .
In the world of Howie Kurtz , both sides are always equal and identical and the same , even when they are n't .
It is just objectively true -- verifiably , demonstrably true -- that Republicans are running far more personal and scurrilous attack ads than Democrats are in this election cycle .
Michelle Malkin went on John Gibson 's
Fox show yesterday -- let 's repeat that : Michelle Malkin , John Gibson , Fox -- to discuss the repugnant state of political ads and they discussed only Republican examples , because those are the most glaring and abundant , by far .
That Michelle Malkin and John Gibson can honestly confront an anti-Republican fact that Howard Kurtz is afraid to acknowledge and thus actively conceals speaks volumes about our national media .
There is no journalistic justification to avoid acknowledgment of this fact .
It does n't necessarily mean that Republicans are craven and evil and Democrats are angelic and noble .
It is just a fact of political life that whichever political party which has the disadvantage concerning the most significant political issues will have more of an incentive to drag races into the gutter and have them focus on slimy personal assaults .
In this case , Republican policies ( particularly Iraq ) and Republican political figures ( starting with the President ) happen to be deeply unpopular , and Republicans -- rationally enough -- are therefore seeking to have the election decided on less substantive grounds .
Even George Allen , ironically enough , described this dynamic in his interview this week with Captain Ed :
The fact that Allen delivered this sermon at the same time that his campaign was urging reporters for weeks to write stories on Jim Webb 's novels -- finally settling on Matt Drudge to do the dirty work -- is as good an example as any of the lowly state of our political system .
But Allen 's abstract point is nonetheless correct -- candidates whose views on the issues ( such as the Iraq War ) are deeply unpopular will seek to have the election focus on other things , such as filthy personal assaults .
And in this election , it is the Republicans who are deeply unpopular on the issues and political substance , and they are therefore driven to drag the campaigns into the personal gutter because that is their only hope for winning .
It also happens to be true that Republicans -- through the carousel of Lee Atwater , Rush Limbaugh , Newt Gingrich , the Clinton sex scandals , and Karl Rove -- have perfected the art of personal assaults as a campaign device , but they have extra incentive to use such tactics now .
None of that is to say that Democrats are innocent , just that , for whatever reasons , Republicans in this campaign are far more active in the mud and filth department than Democrats are .
That 's just a fact ( a fact which Michael Grunwald , Kurtz 's colleague at the Post , honestly reported the day after Kurtz 's column , in an article noteworthy because of how honest it was :
" The result has been a carnival of ugly , , where operatives are trying to counter what polls show is a hostile political environment by casting opponents as fatally flawed characters " ) .
But establishment journalists like Howard Kurtz will actively work to obscure and distort facts if those facts reflect too poorly on one side -- and , given their particular fear of being labelled part of the " liberal media , " the fear is heightened substantially when the fact reflects poorly on the Bush movement .
They would rather present a false and inaccurate ( though superficially " balanced " ) account than a factual and accurate version , because they think that 's what journalistic objectivity requires .
False , dishonest " balance " is prioritized over accurate reporting .
Howard Kurtz is the perfect person to serve as the referee for the way journalism is practiced in this country because he has such a deep understanding of its truth - distorting , shallow rules and adheres to them as diligently as anyone . :

THE winner takes all , it is widely supposed in computing circles .
Indeed , geeks have coined a word , “ Googlearchy ” , for the way in which search engines encourage web traffic towards the most popular sites .
The belief that search engines make popular websites ever more popular , at the expense of other pages , is now being challenged by research .
The apparently magical ability of search engines such as Google to return relevant websites even when given the sketchiest of clues by the person entering a query relies on the use of mathematical recipes or algorithms .
Google works by analysing the structure of the web itself .
Each of its billions of pages can link to other pages and can also , in turn , be linked to by others .
If a page is linked to many other pages , it is flagged up as being important .
Furthermore , if the pages that link to this page are also important , then that page is even more likely to be important .
The algorithm has been made increasingly complex over the years , to deter those who would manipulate their pages to appear higher in the rankings , but it remains at the heart of Google 's success .
Google is not alone in this .
Many search engines take account of the number of links to a website when they return the results of a search .
Because of this , there is a widespread belief among computer , social and political scientists that search engines create a vicious circle that amplifies the dominance of established and already popular websites .
Pages returned by search engines are more likely to be discovered and consequently linked to by others .
Not so , according to a controversial new paper that has recently appeared on arXiv , an online collection of physics and related papers .
In it , Santo Fortunato and his colleagues at Indiana University in America and Bielefeld University in Germany claim that search engines actually have an egalitarian effect that increases traffic to less popular sites .
The researchers developed a model that described two extreme cases .
In the first , people browsed the web only by surfing random links .
In the second , people only visited pages that were returned by search engines .
The researchers then turned to the real world .
They plotted the traffic to a website — measured as the fraction of all page views made in a three - month period — against the number of incoming links made to that website .
To their surprise , they found that the relationship between the two did not lie between the extremes suggested by their model but somewhere completely different .
It appears to show that the supposed bias in favour of popular pages is actually mitigated by the combination of search engines and people following random links .
The paper , which was posted on arXiv for comment , has now come under attack .
Matthew Hindman , a political scientist at Arizona State University , says that the data used in the research are pretty shoddy .
Moreover , he says , the discrepancy between the model and the real world does not necessarily come from the role of the search engine .
Whether Dr Fortunato's thesis stands the test of time remains to be seen .
That it is tested must be a good thing .

Tragic events and Google Earth - a new kind of fascination
Monday , August 28 , 2006
fas·ci·na·tion n .
The capability of eliciting intense interest .
From the comfort of your home office or the peaceful setting in your backyard many people today have found a new way to immerse themselves today 's news .
Most notably tragic events combined with Google Earth which give users around the world a new kind of way to view the scene .
Google Earth launched November 17 2005 as a downloadable program residing on a users computer .
You point and zoom to any place on the planet that you want to explore .
Satellite images and local facts zoom into view .
Tap into Google search to show local points of interest and facts .
Zoom to a specific address to check out an apartment or hotel .
View driving directions and even fly along your route .
Google also incorporated satellite imagery into it 's Google Maps mapping service on the internet .
Hurricane Katrina was an event that really made me take note of Google Maps .
When Google scrambled to take updated satellite pictures of the New Orleans after the flood their decision seem perfect .
Millions of users were able to view the devastation and the enormous problem that was taking shape in downtown New Orleans .
Members of the NGA ( National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ) presented the " Hurricane Katrina Recognition Award " to the Google Earth team , as well as the Google Enterprise and Global Support groups , for their direct support during the Katrina disaster .
This past Sunday I found myself looking at Google Maps satellite imagery and the Blue Grass Airport in Kentucky .
Comair Flight 5191 had crashed shortly after takeoff and I had seen some pictures at the NY Times online .
I wanted to try to find the crash site , I knew details like the runway number and sure enough found runway number 26 using Google satellite imagery .
Before I found that runway number I figured the plane tookoff using the large runway and never even considered the smaller number 26 runway .
I later learned that the pilot had indeed used the incorrect number 26 runway and that is probably the reason he crashed .
Other people have incorporated Google maps into applications such as WikiMapia which lets users tag sites using google maps .
In closing these new tools will be used for years to come to get up close to an area of the world that has news happening .
It allows users of the service to develop a sense of feel for what has happened and where it happened all from the comfort of your home .
Last week , a review of the top five people - powered or community news websites generated a lot of interest and questions about other players in that space .
We review some of the players and find the top sites are well ahead of the pack while many others have already failed .
Here is an updated analysis after undertaking extra research .
Digg inspired a lot of competition .
But are any of these sites successful ?
There are literally hundreds of digg - like sites that have jumped on the people - powered news bandwagon .
Yet , my analysis shows almost all have failed to achieve critical mass , and many have already closed up shop .
That said , a few do appear to be on their way to success .
Which are the most successful people - powered news sites ?
# 1 Digg # 2 Reddit # 3 Care2 News Network # 4 Shoutwire # 5 Netscape
This analysis is based on the average number of votes the stories have on the front page , along with the number of votes for the most popular stories for the past month .
Digg is the clear leader , with Reddit showing some impressive numbers as well .
The one that will probably surprise a lot of people is Care2 .
They launched their version of Digg for progressive / green news back in January .
Time to market seems to be one of the keys to success here – particularly for Digg and Reddit .
Care2 was n’t the third to launch ( maybe the fourth ? ) , but they had the advantage of being an existing community of six million activists .
They also have a clear niche ( progressive news ) which Shoutwire lacks .
There ’s been a lot of talk that it only takes a relatively small number of super users to get one of these sites going , but clearly that ’s not enough to be successful .
It ’s not clear yet what a site needs to achieve critical mass in this space , but based on my observations over the past several months the top 5 all appear to be growing ( with the exception perhaps of Shoutwire ) while the rest of the competition appear to be steady or declining .
I ’m sure Netscape will do well given their existing traffic , but so far they seem to be running a distant fifth place in the race .
They appear to get a relatively high number of comments though , which is an indication of a successful news community ( and perhaps a result of their Anchors - as - facilitators strategy ? )
I suspect there will be a few other successful niche news sites that will make it , but the general take away seems to be that the game is over – you either need to be one of the first to market and / or have a lot of traffic to make it sustainable .
This part of the Web 2.0 bubble has already popped .
Pligg / Meneame .
The list below contains another 50 + sites that are dead or nearly so – and most appear to be using Pligg / Meneame or something similar .
These are open source systems , based on Digg .
Memeame was first , in Spanish and Pligg used their code base and then split off on its own path .
I have contributed a small amount of code to Pligg and experimented with it myself .
It ’s interesting to see that all of the top 5 rolled their own app .
I ’m not sure whether that indicates sites need to use a more custom solution to be successful , or if it ’s just another reflection that time to market was key ( Netscape excepted ) .
Here ’s some data to back up my analysis ( data from : Tue , PM , Aug 22 , 2006 )
Average number of front page votes ( for top 20 stories ) of the day :
# 1 Digg 447
# 2 Reddit 157
# 3 Care2 51
# 4 Shoutwire 40
# 5 Netscape 21
Median number of homepage votes ( for top 20 stories ) :
# 1 Digg 392
# 2 Reddit 139
# 3 Care2 44
# 4 Shoutwire 36
# 5 Netscape 18
Additional sites among the top 25 and average number of votes for top 20 Front Page stories :

There are a number of other sites that no longer even exist , which would have made the “ dead list ” even longer , but the above is grim enough to demonstrate the perils of trying to be a me - too site .
Many of these sites have some activity , but it seems to be mostly from the owner of the website .
To make it in any meaningful way , they need a compelling story to tell and some fanatical belivers to participate and spread the word .
Note that I did n’t rely on Alexa because of the webmaster bias ( which would penalize a non- techie site like Care2 ) and for certain sites it ’s hard to determine where the traffic is actually going ( such as Netscape ) .
Velocity of stories hitting the front page matters too , but based on my observations there does n’t appear to be a huge difference between the top five sites , though stories appear to stay on Shoutwire the longest , and Digg the shortest time .
My analysis therefore probably somewhat under - represents the lead that Digg has over the other services .
Note that some of the sites listed above as “ dead ” actually show some high vote counts on their front pages , but the stories appear to have been sitting there for weeks or longer .
The other compounding challenge in analyzing the numbers is that it ’s possible to down - vote on Reddit and some others , but it ’s highly unlikely that would push it past Digg for the top slot or make much of a difference in the other rankings .
I did n’t include other models in this analysis , such as newsvine or machine - powered - aggregators given the obvious differences in approach and the higher costs of entry versus a fully community powered model .
I also did n’t include the grand - daddy of them all , Slashdot , because moderators select the stories , not members .
Although Slashdot does n’t have votes , it has comments .
An average of 133 comments per story , against Digg ’s average of 80 comments and 447 diggs per story , at the time of writing .
I could n’t draw any conclusions from this because it is easier to digg a story than to comment on it , there is no easy way to tell the number of unique commenters and digg has many more stories per day than slashdot .
All I can say is they are both popular sites , each with their own niche audience and a different enough model and vibe , fans and foes – that they will likely continue along their separate paths , unaffected by each other .
Digg definitely has the capacity for much more growth because it appeals to a much wider audience , while slashdot is almost exclusively for nerds .
This space definitely needs to be watched .
It will be interesting to see how the top five fare over the next few months and to see activity in the the 5 to 25 space .
Care2 , with its green niche and a large membership , and Netscape with its big name and big following could be contenders .
It will be especially instructive to see what Netscape can do , because they had a very late start .
I know of one big audience player considering an entry to the market early next year , so if they learn the right lessons , there could be more shake - ups coming .
No matter what brands enter the people - powered news arena , Digg is by far the clear leader and it will take much more than a “ me too ” application to even get close to them .
Paticipation is the key .

Sam Penrod reporting A cardboard sign is hanging in a tree , directed at a boy with developmental disabilities , and the boy 's mother is n't happy .
Neighbor : " I 'm not taking the sign down , last night was the first night of peace we 've got in a long ----- time . "
Carrie Heaton , Colton 's Mother : " They 've put up this sign now , that we feel is very discriminatory against my son . "
The cardboard sign is hanging in a tree in the Central Utah town of Nephi .
It is also being denounced tonight by advocates for the disabled .
The boy 's family noticed the sign pointed at their home on Wednesday night , and tonight it is still there .
That 's despite our visit to the neighbors who put it up .
Advocates for the disabled are outraged , calling it insensitive and in the same category as a racial slur .
Carrie Heaton , Nephi Resident : " You are a good guy . "
Colton Heaton : " Yes I 'm a good guy
Carrie Heaton , Nephi Resident : " Yes you are ... Pats "
13 - year - old Colton Heaton is developmentally delayed .
His mother says he is more like a three year old .
Carrie Heaton , Nephi Resident : " He looks normal but once you start talking to him , you can see he has these problems and he 's just a loving little guy , he thinks we 're just a great big family . "
But now a cardboard sign is hanging in their neighbor 's tree -- spray painted with the words : " Caution -- Retards in Area . "
His mother says it is fortunate Colton can't read the words .
As we were filming the sign , we could see the neighbors who put it up were outside , so we approached them for their side of the story .
Sam Penrod , Eyewitness News : " Why did you put that sign up ?
Neighbor : " I 've been harassed for six months , my daughter has been assaulted . "
Sam Penrod , Eyewitness News " By who ? "
Neighbor : " The young boy , we got pictures and everything and they would not press charges because he is handicapped . "
The neighbor claims Colton threw a rock at his young daughter .
Other neighbors told us they have frequently found Colton wandering onto their property .
Still , the Disability Law Center says using offensive words is the wrong way to handle a difficult situation .
Fraser Nelson , Executive Director , Disability Law Center : " People with disabilities are probably the last group for whom we continue to use language that is hurtful and offensive .
Instead of being someone who is mentally retarded , you are a person with a developmental disability and that means really what we are valuing is the person . "
Tom Brownlee , Advocate for those with Disabilities : " When I was growing up , people always used that word in front of me and called me retarded . "
Someone who knows how hurtful that word can be is Tom Brownlee , who today is an advocate for those with disabilities .
Tom Brownlee , Advocate for those with Disabilities : " I hate that word , it was very offensive and I just want them to see that people with disabilities deserve the respect that they are entitled to . "
Both Brownlee and Nelson are hoping the community will stand up against any behavior that lessens the role of people with disabilities in society .
Fraser Nelson , Executive Director , Disability Law Center : " Regardless of cognitive disability I may have , I 'm a person and people do not deserve to have signs pointed at them , making fun of them , scaring them , harassing them . "
We contacted Nephi Police and they are working with the Juab County Attorney -- who told me tonight -- he finds it distasteful and derogatory and is researching what legal options may be available , since the neighbors still refuse to take the sign down .
The Disability Law Center is planning to meet with local officials to offer sensitivity training there in Nephi .
MORT KONDRACKE : Well , as to that human rights watch spokesperson , it 's just false that this is — you can lock them up and throw away the key is not correct .
I mean , these detainees have a right to go to a military — they have been tried in a military tribunal .
The case goes on appeal to the U.S. district — the Circuit Court of appeals for the District of Columbia , second highest court in the land , which reviews the evidence .
And so there is judicial review of a conviction , at least , and so , you know , it 's just flatly false .
UPDATE
The so - called Military Commissions Act of 2006 ( .pdf ) , signed into law yesterday by President Bush , is replete with radical provisions , but the most dangerous and disturbing is that it vests in the President the power to detain people forever by declaring them an " unlawful enemy combatant , " and they then have no ability to contest the validity of their detention in any tribunal .
The President now possesses a defining authoritarian power -- to detain and imprison people for life based solely on his say - so , while denying the detainee any opportunity to prove his innocence .
But for those who rely on Fox News for their information about what the government is doing , not only do they not know that , they think the opposite is true .
This is what Mort Kondracke said yesterday about the Military Commissions Act , while he sat next to Fox News anchor Brit Hume and Fred Barnes , neither of whom contested what he said : What is " flatly false " is what Kondracke told Fox viewers about the Military Commissions Act .
It is true that the Act creates military commissions and establishes rules for those commissions in the event that the President wants a certain detainee tried , convicted and punished ( almost certainly execution ) .
Not even the Bush - led U.S. will openly execute detainees without a finding that they are guilty of terrorism .
The commissions exist so that the Executive branch can impose sentence ( such as the death sentence ) on detainees who are found guilty of engaging in terrorism ( or some other war crime ) .
But there is no right for detainees to be tried before a commission , and there is no obligation for the President to bring any detainee before a military commission .
If the President does not want to obtain a finding of guilt and impose punishment , he has no reason to bring them before a military commission .
He can just keep them detained forever without any finding of guilt and without any punishment being imposed ( just as many of the Guantanamo detainees , and even U.S. citizens , have been kept in cages for years with no finding of any kind of guilt ) .
The Act even allows U.S. citizens to be subjected to this treatment ( though the Supreme Court 's decision in Hamdi likely requires for U.S. citizens some opportunity to challenge the detention ) because even American citizens can be declared to be " unlawful enemy combatants " under the statute ( see Sec. 3 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ) .
All anyone has to do is read the Act and it is immediately and undeniably apparent that it does not provide the right to be tried that Kondrake told the Fox audience it provides .
I frequently encounter sentiments along the lines of : " how can any Americans , even Bush supporters , think that it 's acceptable for the President to have the power to imprison people for life with no process of any kind ? "
A significant reason why things of this sort do not provoke more protest is because large segments of the Bush supporting public rely on the likes of Mort Kondracke and Fox News to tell them what is going on with their government , and the reports they receive are often extremely incomplete , misleading , or -- as in this case -- outright false , propagandistic defenses of the Bush administration .
They simply do n't know what the Bush administration is doing because the individuals on whom they rely -- including those , like Brit Hume , who hold themselves out as objective journalists -- are themselves ignorant or actively mislead them .
This is not some obscure mistake on Mort Kondracke 's part .
As he himself pointed out , the power to detain people indefinitely with no process is one of the principal objections made by opponents of the bill .
How can he -- along with Brit Hume and Fred Barnes -- not know that the bill provides the President precisely that power ?
Yet Kondrake told the Fox audience that the bill gives the President no such power , while Hume and Barnes sat there and never corrected it ( I do n't know if some pseudo - " balance " person like Mara Liasson was there or not ) .
That our so - called " journalists , " even on Fox , are looking into the camera and giving such emphatic , false assurances to millions of Americans about one of the most critical issues of our time explains a lot about our current political predicament .* * * * * * * * Next Monday , October 23 , The Center for American Progress is hosting an event in Washington called " Perspectives on Presidential Power from Inside and Outside the Beltway . "
The panelists will be myself and former Clinton advisor Sidney Blumethal , and it will be moderated by CAP Senior Fellow Mark Agrast .
It is free and open to the public .
Lunch begins at 12:00 p.m. and the panel discussion goes from 12:30 - 2:00 p.m .
Most of the discussion will be interactive with those who attend , so if you are in or near D.C. and can attend , it should interesting .
It is being held at CAP -- 1333 H St. NW , Washington , DC 20005 . :
Nobody in comments is disputing that Mort Kondracke was clearly and unquestionably wrong in claiming that the Act gives detainees the right to a military tribunal .
That is simply not in reasonable dispute .
The President has the power under the Act to detain all detainees indefinitely ( other than , arguably , U.S. citizens ) without providing any access to any court , tribunal or commission .
What Kondracke so emphatically told Fox viewers about the Act was wrong .
Exactly the objection which he said was " flatly false " is , in fact , entirely true .
But there is some dispute over the scope of the powers vested in the President with regard to U.S. citizens .
Some say that the Act does not clearly expand the President 's detention powers with regard to U.S. citizens and others claim it does .
I believe it does , for reasons I set forth in this comment ( the entire discussion in the comment section on this issue is excellent -- with many knowledgeable people participating -- and should be read by anyone interested in the issue ) .
Google has just launched another project in its bid to rule the world organize the world 's information .
The Google News Archive Search allows users to find news accounts up to 200 years old from selected sources , and while that sounds incredible , the service is n't yet a compelling tool .
You can think of the new search in one of two ways : a more specialized version of a regular Google search , or a much broader version of a Google News search .
Queries to the News Archive search magazines , newspapers , and some Web - only publications for content , and can return results in a standard format or a new " timeline " view that makes it easy to follow the progression of a story over time .
Searches can be limited by date if you want only early 20th - century coverage of the Titanic sinking , for instance .
Just as we 've come to expect from Google , searches are fast , the interface is clean — and Google has no current plans to make any money from the project .
While this sounds like a fantastic resource , it has one substantial limitation : many ( if not most ) of the older articles cost money .
Archived articles from papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post are only available to users who pay a fee .
In the sample searches that we ran at the site , most pre-1990 results came from pay sites ( though much interesting content from Time and from the UK's Guardian newspaper was available for free ) .
In essence , this makes Google into a news database frontend of the kind that students and academics have used for years to track down articles .
Since Google does not provide any sort of payment system of its own , however , users who want to view the results will have to set up accounts and make payments at several different sites .
While this is no deterrent to someone pursuing serious research , it 's likely to put off the average Web surfer , who in most cases could just go to her local library or college and access more complete information from proprietary databases , usually at no direct cost ( your tax dollars at work ) .
Still , the site is intriguing for the promise that it holds .
Few of the academic databases mentioned above are used outside of the library , and few have the potential that Google does to integrate disparate kinds of information .
What other database can you go to in order to search for text in magazines , newspapers from around the world , out - of - print books ( with complete text available for viewing ) , in - print books ( with limited snippets available ) , and the Web ?
The obvious question here is what might happen to the burgeoning academic database market if Google starts handling payments and makes it simple for users to apply their credit to any type of search material ?
The many databases that provide access to newspapers and magazine archives would immediately feel the pinch , and users would probably have no objection to using Google 's clean interface and excellent results to further their own work , if the price was right ( Google could sell unlimited access to universities , libraries , and other institutions , much as databases do now ) .
That would leave only the databases which index academic journals , and you can bet that Google has already turned its collective brainpower to the challenge .

Examine them .
Be completely conscious of all the standard questions plus acceptable responses to each .
Research cards can be very helpful .
Utilize them .

To acquire listed in the Pink Bedsheets a company needs a broker dealer companies to be able to quote the stock .
The sole requirement is that the broker is part of the National Association regarding Securities Dealers ( NASD ) .
After listing , the company remains inside Pink Sheets as long as this stock is quoted .
It may happen that a stock of which no longer exists still is quoted within the Pink Sheets a situation the fact that highlights the need for researching any business that lists here .
My partner and i still want to make it very clear the fact that although I have been able to choose a website that I feel great , you should always follow up any and all investment tips / picks you receive from the internet or maybe elsewhere , with some of your own Research , and most definitely speak to a new broker dealer difference advisor about what looking at before you invest a dime .
I suggest to you that OTC shells are generally ugly .
These are failed organizations or they may perhaps possess minimal operations .
The cover is just not worth a lot as being a running organization but it will be worth one thing for a reverse merging car or truck .
A strong acquisition can adjust this kind of ugly ducklings straight into swans overnight .
Vern :
So far we have been able to make it through the 2nd worst downturn in a century .
That ’s pretty remarkable by itself .
During that period we ’ve been identified by MorningStar as a standout supervisor .
They awarded us their particular 4 - star rating .
That is significant .
We are one of just two managers in our class that can make that state over the past three years .
Within a statement , the Federal Hold said that it is expected how the U .
S economy can recover little by little in spite of sluggish pace of economic restoration in the near term .
Who do they will answer to ?
Is the firm for yourself or publicly held ?
Would you get a sense that the company considers the advisor because of their client ?
Do they have the mission ?
Core values ?
In that case , take the time to actually read all of them and determine if they speak out loud with you .
If their mission or even core values that they spent the time and money to connect to the masses do n’t line up with your thinking , there is a thin chance that they are in business for the similar reasons you are .
Along these types of lines , if they do n’t have the mission or core ideas , that shows you pretty obviously those things are not important to who they actually are and how they run their particular business .
Ask the immediate question : why are you in operation ?
And make sure it , when calculated , resonates with YOU .
And for you hard guys - it ’s not cheesy in order to ask ;
It ’s a smart company .
Often in every area of your life , we get a curve tossed at us and the outcome is possible repossession of our cellular home .
It is important to understand how this particular works .
The first thing to understand , just how did you finance the particular mobile home , was this a personal loan or a real mortgage .
Each one is handled in different ways than the other depending in case you were renting a lot or perhaps you owned the lot in which the mobile home is located .
Your initial details , with which you asked the particular quotes , was partly constructed as a result of the therapist meeting .
Maybe you also obtained recommendations about the brokers .
You can now turn to the counselor and inquire , whether these brokers are usually high classic companies plus whether you are safe if you can make an agreement with some of these .
The question is , can you be eligible for a function of mortgage bank ?
In reality , banking institutions and mortgage lenders are not quite accommodating .
Even if you have great credit , applying for a financial loan can still be a time - consuming plus complicated process .
You can imagine just how much more challenging it would be if you have an issue with your credit .

Book review Bruce
Tate is not a happy Java bunny , and has n’t been for some time .
In a previous book , ‘ Better , Faster , Lighter Java ’ ( O’ Reilly , 2004 ) , he advocated the use of a number of popular open - source frameworks as alternatives to the perceived heavyweight bloat of J2EE using EJBs .
Rather than be bogged down in layers of code and XML configuration for EJBs , he argued convincingly that frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate meant programmers could concentrate on ‘ plain old Java objects ’ ( POJOs ) and achieve results that were fully functional , easy to deploy and easier to code .
Now , given the subsequent release of Java 5.0 , he is going much further .
In this slim little volume , he puts forward the proposition that Java itself that is now holding back productivity .
It ’s not just the whole J2EE edifice that ’s at fault ; it ’s the Java platform itself that is the barrier to results .
And , if this is true , ( and it ’s a big if ) ; he follows up by asking what it is that will replace Java .
As you would expect , a polemical little tract like this mixes technical argument , hyperbole and more than a dash of value judgement to persuade the reader that Java has lost its way and it ’s time to look for alternatives .
More than that , Tate also surveys the lay of the land and attempts to pick up some of the likely contenders for the Java crown .
There are some compelling arguments that Java is at a crossroads .
The Java platform is becoming increasingly complex , the JVM has an obesity problem , the addition of generics has added complexity to the previously clean syntax , the layers of XML configuration required to plumb a full J2EE stack are weighing developers down .
Tate puts a lot of this down to the fact that the big players ( starting with Sun and IBM ) are focused on large - scale enterprise development projects .
This drives the evolutionary direction that Java has taken .
What this means is that those developers working in other domains are finding things increasingly hard to do .
Even simple problems , like putting a web front - end on a relational database are too hard to do , according to Tate .
Furthermore , according to the book , there are plenty of Java leading - lights looking elsewhere for inspiration and excitement .
And , feeling constrained by Java , they are increasingly looking for dynamically typed languages rather than Java ’s static typing .
Chief amongst these languages is Ruby , and it ’s the Ruby on Rails framework that seems to be generating most of the excitement .
Having given a potted history of Java ’s development and its status , ( none too healthy according to a number of the experts that Tate quotes ) , he then looks at the contenders for the title of ‘ next big thing ’ .
The aforementioned Ruby gets most of the attention , but Python , Groovy and even Smalltalk all get some consideration .
C# is dismissed as Java ’s evil twin , and .
Net itself does n’t merit much attention because of its proprietary nature .
Whether you agree that Java has had its day or not , this is an interesting read and gives plenty of food for thought . ®

UNIXだってFLASHムービーを作りたい
FLASHムービーを作成するためには、Mingというフリーのライブラリを用います。
このライブラリは、元もとPHPから利用するものでしたが、PHP以外にもPerl , Ruby , Pyhton , C , C++からも利用できるようになっています。
これを読んで 「 そうか、rubyで『移動するスプライトのクラス』を書いて、
そのインスタンスに画面を跳ねさせたりできるんだな」と思ったあなた、
残念でした。 できません。 これ はMingではなくFLASHの仕様と言っても良いのですが、
FLASHムービーで動的な軌道計算や対話的な処理を行なうためには、ActionScript というスクリプトを記述しなければなりません。MingにはActionScriptのコンパイラ
が含まれていて、コンパイルしてムービーに埋め込みます。つまり、
Ruby ( または Perl , PHP , etc. ) のスクリプトの中に、ActionScriptが混在する という、今一つ ぐっとこないプログラムを書かなければなりません。言い替えると、Ruby(または
Perl , PHP , etc. ) とMingの知識の他に、ActionScriptの知識もないと凝ったFLASH
ムービーは作成できません。
というわけで、私自 身Mingを使いつつActionScriptの資料をいくつか読んでみた
のですが、ほとんどに共通している点が、プログラミング言語の解説としては
極めて未熟なものばかりであるという点でした。ActionScriptの説明を書いている
本人がオブジェクト指向プログラミングやそもそもの「プログラミングとはなにか 」
を理解していないとしか思えない記事ばかりだったのです。 これはWebページだけでなく、出版されている書籍についても同様でした。
ActionScriptとFLASHが歴史的なしがらみを引きずって、
整理されていない設計になっているという問題もあるのでしょうが、それにしても
理解しづらい資料ばかりで非常に苦労しました。まず悩んだのは
「 ActionScriptというのは 、 要するにプロトタイプベースのOOスクリプト処理系なのか」という
ことでした。説明を読むとそうとしか理解できないのですが、そう明記してある ものがないのです。試しにgoogleで「 ActionScript プロトタイプベース 」 を 検索してみたところ、私が検索した時( 2003年4月頃)には、
MacroMedia のFlash MXの説明資料一件しか該当しません でした。これは( 少なくとも日本語 のWebページのうち ) FLASH の 説明を書いている人でプロトタイプベースとクラスベースの違いを理解している人が 存在していない可能性を指唆しています。 正直、唖然としました。 ちゃんとした技術者のための解説資料が必要だと思いました。 これがこのページを作成した動機の一つです 。
このページで はMingを扱うスクリプトとして、Rubyを採用します。Rubyについての 説明は行なわないので、Rubyの基礎は知っている必要があります。
このページが対象としている読者は「Rubyはだいたい知っている」「 Mingはこれから 勉強する 」 「 FLASHはなんとなく知っているけれど作ったことはない 」 「 オブジェクト指向プログラミングはちゃんと理解している」という人です。
FLASHの概要に始まり、Mingだけで何が作れるのかを説明し、ActionScriptと Mingを組み合わせた例を示しつつ解説し、最後にはCGIとの連携についても 言及します。
注意 ) この文書では 、Ming-0.2aを対象とします。Ming-0.2aではFLASH
5 の ムービーしか作成できませんので、ActionScriptについてもFLASH 5のActionScript を前提として説明します。また、rubyはruby-1.6.8を用います。
注意そ の2 ) 上の方で偉そうなことを書いていますが、まだActionScriptの解説
の部分は書いていません。ごめんなさい。許してください。

When bouncers refused to admit the daredevil past the exclusive velvet rope , Steve - O did what any huge star would do .
He name dropped , saying " I 'm supposed to meet Lindsay Lohan here ! "
Apparently , the bouncers were n't amused .
After management instructed him to hit the road , Steve - O began texting Lohan , begging for her to help with the situation .
Before the club drama even began , Steve - O gave a staunch defense of Lohan for TMZ 's cameras , blasting Paris Hilton and Brandon Davis for their infamous anti-Lindsay rant .

Gene expression could help forensics to pinpoint the cause of death .
Body of evidence : the activity of various genes could help unpick the cause of death .
© Punchstock
A murderer could leave a telltale genetic fingerprint in their victim 's genes , say researchers in Japan , helping forensic sleuths to identify how they were killed .
Experts often struggle to diagnose whether someone died by strangulation or suffocation , rather than by some other means .
In some cases , the crime scene or marks on the body make the case clear cut ; in others there are no such clues .
Now a team at Nagasaki University has shown that a person 's own genes might help to reveal how they met their end .
Kazuya Ikematsu and his colleagues anaesthetized and then killed two small groups of mice , by either strangulation with a string , or by decapitation .
They dissected skin samples from the animals ' necks and compared the activity of a broad spectrum of genes inside the skin cells , by looking at the amount of RNA pumped out by those genes .
The researchers found four genes that were more active in the strangled animals than those that had died suddenly .
Their findings are accepted for publication in the journal Legal Medicine1 .
The study adds to emerging evidence that gene activity could be a useful clue in pinpointing the time or cause of death .
It 's a direction that could prove very useful in forensics , says pathologist and molecular biologist Edward Gabrielson of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland .
" The concept of using molecular markers in forensic pathology is interesting and potentially very powerful , " he says .
Under pressure
Future studies could identify a battery of genes or proteins whose levels of activity are consistently boosted or cut when the skin is under pressure or deprived of oxygen , Gabrielson suggests .
In human cases , pathologists could screen tissue for this molecular signature and use it , alongside more traditional techniques , to help pin down the cause of death .
Such a technique would be particularly valuable in cases of sudden infant death syndrome , says Greg G. Davis , a medical examiner and forensic pathologist at the University of Alabama , Birmingham .
It could help to reveal whether a child suffocated on their bedding or died for other reasons .
" That alone would be extraordinarily useful , " he says .
Presently , forensic pathologists rely largely on case histories , including the situation in which a body is found , plus gross examinations and scrutiny of the tissues .
In the case of suffocation , examiners look for bruises , damage to delicate neck cartilage and tiny burst blood vessels in the eyes .
But because these signs can be subtle or missing entirely , some cases of suffocation and strangulation " can be an extremely difficult or subtle diagnosis , " Davis says .
" People have been searching for a magic test for asphyxiation for decades . "
Body of evidence
ADVERTISEMENT
Davis and Gabrielson caution that far more extensive studies must be done before molecular methods can be routinely used on human bodies .
One obstacle is that they must deal with the natural variations in gene activity between each person and those caused by genetic or protein material decaying since the time of death .
" I do n't see anyone being put in jail based just on this , " Davis says .
And medical examiners may be reluctant to adopt new techniques if they think old ones will suffice .
" It takes effort to start moving a field in new directions , " Gabrielson adds .

The Federal Election Comm ...
An evangelical acquaintance recently wrote me a letter arguing that the pro-stem cell research proposal ( Missouri Amendment 2 ) A ) is geared to financially enrich its sponsors , B ) that it will invite reproductive cloning and C ) that poor women will result in poor women selling their eggs .
She urged me to oppose the Amendment and oppose various promising forms of stem cell research .
For information on the proposed amendment , see here .
Even before receiving this letter , I knew that my acquaintance believed that a one - minute old fertilized human egg in a Petri dish is a baby that deserved full legal protection and priority over the children with horrible illnesses who occupy hospital beds .
My acquaintance indicated that she was part of an organized effort to defeat Missouri Amendment 2 .
I am not thrilled with my response ( see below ) , but I could n’t think of anything better .
If anyone has any ideas as to a more effective way to deal with those who oppose stem cell research on religious grounds , I ’m all ears .
—
Dear [ Acquaintance ]
I realize that you feel hurt and attacked by my previous email .
In this e-mail , I will attempt to put our recent exchange of e-mail in perspective .
The technology for making insulin is currently based on recombinant DNA techniques ; the human gene which codes for the insulin protein is cloned and then inserted in bacteria .
I want you to assume for a moment , though , that my religion holds that both the cloning of genes and recombinant DNA techniques are morally and spiritually repugnant .
Let ’s assume further that one of your daughters has diabetes and she needs insulin in order to live ( assume that insulin obtained through older methods — derived from pigs and cows–causes a dangerous reaction in your daughter and is the thus un-usable ) .
Assume further that one fine day I proudly send you an e-mail announcing that I am sponsoring legislation across the entire state , legislation that will make artificial insulin illegal .
The legislation I am pushing will put your daughter ’s health at great risk , but I have nonetheless inserted myself into your family ’s most personal medical decision - making process .
The legislation I am pushing will deny you medical treatment that has been saving your daughter ’s life .
I forge ahead , though , because I am certain that God has sent me on this mission .
In other words , I am doing the equivalent of forcing my way into your house , raiding your medicine cabinet and throwing away your daughter ’s insulin .
How would you feel if I did that under those circumstances ?
Assume some additional background .
Assume that I have long claimed to be absolutely certain that I am correct regarding numerous aspects of morality based on my reading of my version of the Bible , which I repeatedly declare to be inerrant ( that is , absolutely literally true ) , despite the fact that my Bible contains hundreds of statements that conflict with common sense and reality ( for instance , the Bible claims that the mustard seed is the smallest seed when it is actually not the smallest seed ) .
Assume further that you know from talking with me that I refuse to question the highly - questionable origins of the Bible .
Further assume that I refuse to consider overwhelming evidence that several key stories in my English translation Bible conflict with the earliest known reliable manuscripts .
Assume further that my e-mail contains an attachment that disparages the lifetime dedication of medical professionals who have done laudable work developing new sources of insulin using medical techniques that , several decades earlier , were severely criticized by many religious conservatives .
The above closely resembles what you have done to me by sending me an e-mail that proudly announces that you are attempting to fight the passage of Missouri Proposed Amendment 2 , thereby narrowing the range of medical treatments available to people close to me , including my daughters .
I would ask you : what kind of parent would you think I was if I did not severely question your knowledge and motives ?
Now , I am extremely fortunate that my daughters are not stricken with a horrible disease .
But someday they might .
It that ever happens , I insist on having available every possible means of restoring their health .
I have a hard time believing that you have made the alleged financial greed of the Stowers family a centerpiece of your argument .
I would dare you to stand up in front of the world - class researchers of the Stowers Institute ( see their photos here ) and announce to them that they are a bunch of money - grubbing self - centered lackeys .
Same point for John Danforth and William Danforth .
Take a look at what these people have done for our community and the self - sacrifice involved in doing it , then ask your God and your self whether you are really sufficiently informed to cast the aspersions that you are casting .
Yes , I was angry when I read the baseless indictments in the attachment to your letter .
You know , I have often dealt with people who put their own hopes for Heaven ahead of the lives of real live human beings .
That was not the main reason I was angry this time .
What angered me was your blithe willingness to propagate slander toward venerable community leaders .
Just because my tone was not “ more gentle and respectful ” does not mean that I was n’t correct .
I would highly recommend that you do serious research into the characters and accomplishments of the people you have slandered before further impugning them .
You have attempted to further impugn William Danforth by referring to one of his letters that was published in Science .
The full text of his letter can be found here .
That letter recognizes the following undeniable facts :
Before implantation , [ stem ] cells can become any type of cell .
If separated into two parts , they can yield two embryos ; if cells from two different blastocysts are merged , they can result in a single embryo ; if cells from two different blastocysts are merged , they can result in a single embryo .
You will not find a single early stem cell in a real baby .
Human embryonic stem cells are derived from fertilized embryos less than a week old .
Early stem cells ( sometimes called “ embryonic stem cells ” ) are thus long gone by the time any organs develop .
The clumps of early stem cells that can be used to research medical cures have no brain–not even a single neuron .
That is why I disagree with you that microscopic clumps of stem cells in Petri dishes are “ babies . ”
The belief that unimplanted stem cells constitute “ a baby ” can only be a religious belief .
You ’ve repeatedly asserted that I just do n’t “ understand ” many things .
I think I do understand the issues raised by your email .
If I sound “ insulting ” or “ demeaning ” or overconfident , it is because I base my entire worldview on periodically attacking my own most cherished beliefs .
I embrace the naturalistic method .
I work hard to frame my beliefs as testable working assumptions ; they are always prone to being disapproved .
My beliefs that have survived have been repeatedly tested .
On the other hand , I know that your most cherished beliefs are never questioned .
You ’ve told me this .
The Bible is the word of God and that is that .
When we had lunch last year , you were surprised to hear that there were two versions of creation contained in Genesis .
You were surprised to learn that the New Testament contains two contradictory genealogies leading from David to Joseph .
You urged me not to “ dwell ” on the genocidal God of the Old Testament despite your claim that the entire Bible was absolutely true .
This is the context of my frustration with the religious foundation for your political positions .
Can you blame me ?
I attended two church services at your evangelical church in order to better understand why you and I see the things so differently .
Your spiritual leader told everyone in the church to trust only him .
He told the church - goers to read no books about Christianity but only to return for more lectures by him .
They were repeatedly told to not think for themselves .
[ see here ]
He threatened them with eternal torture of hell if they fell out of line .
In threatening them to self - censor , he thus restricted the flock ’s access to neutral sources of information regarding Bible interpretation .
This is a tried and true method of brainwashing .
If you think my tone could be more gentle or respectful , I challenge you to go back to your church and pay particular attention to the condescending tone of your spiritual leader .
I urge you to then get enough distance from your church to see it from a neutral perspective .
Ideas have consequences .
Your participation in the organized resistance to Amendment 2 , if successful , will put horribly sick people at risk , many of them children .
But somehow , out of all of this , you characterize me as the ignorant and arrogant one .
I am the arrogant one even though I am the one who refuses to give up on developing all possible medical cures for all severely sick people .
You have argued , contrary to all medical evidence , that a microscopic clump of undifferentiated cells in a Petri dish ( without a single brain cell or heart cell ) is more deserving of protection under the law than a 6 - year - old girl stricken with leukemia , a walking , talking little girl fighting for her life .
You are the one that is arguing that a microscopic clump of undifferentiated stem cells is more deserving of our care than a nine - year - old boy with third - degree burns over 60 % of his body .
Or that that an acquaintance of mine must forever remain a quadriplegic , unable to lift a cracker to his own lips for the rest of his life .
Or that my friend [ I ’ll call him George here ] must be denied any chance to regain some of the tissue he lost in a quadruple amputation resulting from meningitis that nearly killed him five years ago .
All of this must simply be so , in your view , so that a microscopic clump of un-implanted cells entirely lacking in neurons can live .
Or even worse , it must be so , in your view , that each of these victims must simply suffer and die so that a frozen embryo at a fertility clinic will be thrown away rather than donated to research to give hope to these tragic victims .
Love is sometimes not about communicating with a gentle tone .
Sometimes love is about shooting straight and letting other people know that you are concerned about them and their views .
If you find my method of communicating too difficult , I sincerely recommend that you do n’t write e-mails to me about your political positions .
I promise that I will not torment you in writing if do n’t promulgate your political or religious views to me in writing .

I might not always be correct , but I take every serious issue seriously .

The 19 - year - old is being tried as a minor behind closed doors
Sven Jaschan is charged with computer sabotage , disrupting public services and illegally altering data .
The 19 - year - old is being tried as a minor behind closed doors as he was 17 when he wrote the worm .
Sasser wrought havoc in many companies when the Windows worm struck in May 2004 , swamping net links and making computers unusable .
As the day 's legal proceedings started , Mr Jaschan " admitted to the alleged offences in every detail , " said a court spokeswoman .
Defendants under German law do not enter formal pleas so the trial continues despite Mr Jaschan 's confession .
The trial in Verden in northwest Germany is expected to last three days , with a possible verdict on Thursday .
He is likely to escape the maximum sentence of five years in prison since he is being tried as a juvenile .
He now works for a German security software company called Securepoint .
Worldwide disruption
A $ 250,000 bounty offered by Microsoft produced a tip - off that led German police to Sven Jaschan in May 2004 .
The German authorities have called a public broadcaster and three German city councils as witnesses to describe the disruption that the worm caused .
Sven Jaschan is being tried as a juvenile
Check - in for some British Airways flights was also delayed thanks to Sasser .
Around the world , the Australian Railcorp trains stopped running because computer problems caused by Sasser made it impossible for drivers to talk to signalmen .
In Taiwan , more than 400 branches of the post office were forced to use pen and paper because Sasser crashed desktop PCs .
Soon after being arrested in May 2004 at his home in Waffensen , Mr Jaschan reportedly confessed that he was the creator of Sasser and some versions of the Netsky virus .
Anti-virus firm Sophos estimates that 70 % of all the virus infections in the first half of 2004 could be blamed on Mr Jaschan 's creations .
Statistics gathered by Sophos show that in the first six months of 2005 there were four variants of Netsky in the top 10 viruses and they accounted for 25.5 % of all infections .
Unlike many other viruses , Sasser made its way from computer to computer without help from users .
It got into Windows computers by exploiting a programming bug in the operating system .
Although Microsoft had released a patch for this loophole on 13 and 28 April 2004 , many companies had not applied this protection before Sasser struck .

As in : " Dude , she was literally smoking hot !!" Unless she was perched atop a lit barbeque , this sentence is WRONG .
" Literally " means " in a literal sense " .
Dumb fucks have now taken over this word , and in their misguided efforts to sound literary ( how ironic ) , they end up coming across as fools .
And worse yet , they drag normally intelligent people into the tractor beam of their Grammatic Death Star .
The most common and proper use of " literally " is to distill the actual meaning of a normally figurative phrase or idiom .
As in : " I tried to escape through the window , but her husband literally caught me with my pants down .
"
In this case , the philanderer was n't simply caught unprepared , as the common idiom " with my pants down " might suggest .
Rather , thanks to the handy use of the word " literally " , we are able to discern that he was ACTUALLY caught with his pants down , leaving him unable to escape undetected from his lusty fucking and sucking session with his nubile , undersexed secretary .
As a side point , the husband took no offense to the intrusion , but rather found himself quite intrigued by the scenario .
In fact , he stood there looking at the two of them , calmly loosening his tie , while experiencing a long - forgotten tightening in his pants .
Meanwhile , the secretary and her boss stood frozen like Cheemo perogies in the back section at IGA .
After a long moment of silence , the boss slowly reached down to pull up his pants and underwear in order to cover his sex- covered , dripping member .
He had n't bothered to remove his pants in the first place , he knew they were on the clock .
" Stop there " , whispered the husband , while the boss was bent over at his most vulnerable angle .
Still in shock , the boss did as he was told .
" What goes around , comes around , would n't you say , Arthur ? " asked the husband , obviously not expecting an answer .
The tightness in his pants had reached an exploding point , his 10 - inch lovesnake stressing the seams of his Calvin Pro-Stretch briefs to the point of breaking .
The husband strode slowly and confidently across the room towards the hunched over figure , dropped his pants with a gentle flick of his fingers , then ripped off his overworked briefs .
He grabbed the cowering boss firmly by the hips , and shoved his rock hard manhood between the shaking , sweaty cheeks of his fuck - victim .
Finally realizing what was happening , the boss attempted to stand up and break free , only to realize that the husband , literally , had him by the balls .
Needless to say , the next 1/ 2 hour contained a potent mix of pain and gratification , yet surprisingly culminated in a magnificent explosion of three simulatneous orgasms .
They were all three , quite literally , fucked .

The typical human mouth contains a writhing orgy of bacteria .
Most of these microscopic organisms are benign , and some are even beneficial , but one particular variety is a conspicuous troublemaker : Streptococcus mutans .
These ubiquitous bacteria thrive on sugars in the mouth , which they consume while excreting lactic acid .
This acid is responsible for the great majority of tooth decay in humankind because it erodes the enamel and dentin of the teeth .
A Florida - based company called Oragenics may have found a way to rid our mouths of these acid-excreting organisms for good .
This would make cavities a thing of the past , and put no small number of dentists out of business .
But despite the obvious benefits , there is potential for disaster .
Oragenics ’ approach to stopping tooth decay is straightforward : they have used recombinant DNA technology to produce a new variety of S. mutans which does not excrete lactic acid .
Instead , it excretes tiny amounts of an agent called Mutacin 1140 which is deadly to other strains of S. mutans , giving these new bacteria an edge over the existing organisms .
Once the modified bacteria get a toehold in the mouth , the existing population of S. mutans will be methodically wiped out , leaving the non-acid - producing bacteria in its place .
In the absence of acid- producing bacteria , the teeth have little to fear .
Oragenics calls this new treatment Replacement Therapy .
If approved as a treatment , a single visit to the dentist would be all that is necessary .
The patient ’s teeth would be swabbed with the modified bacteria for five minutes , allowing it to begin its work .
Over the following months , the entire population of the unmodified S. mutans in the mouth would be completely supplanted .
The new organisms ’ ability to muscle out the old riffraff should theoretically allow the new bacteria to reside indefinitely once it is established in the mouth⁠ — so it is possible that a single treatment will last for an individual ’s lifetime .
On the surface it seems like an elegant solution , but clearly there is the potential to upset delicate systems in nature , resulting in possible larger - scale side effects .
If S. mutans is present in the ecosystem outside of mouths , there is a chance that the artificial strains might be accidentally introduced into those systems , possibly destroying the natural strains .
The acidity in those environments might then be drastically reduced , resulting in unpredictable and irreversible changes .
This is a risk shared with many genetically modified organisms .

After extensive laboratory testing and animal trials with no observed side - effects , Oragenics has begun some early human trials .
The first strains tested on humans have been deliberately crippled to require a daily “ feeding ” of a particular amino acid in order to survive .
Using this method , researchers are confident that any of the bacteria which escape into the wild will not long survive .
Also , the first people to be infected with the improved strain are denture wearers , which allows the subjects to remove their teeth at any time in case of trouble .
The spouses of the subjects are also cooperating with the study , so researchers can reinforce their confidence that the bacteria is not horizontally transmissible , such as through kissing .
There is no doubt that eliminating cavities from humankind would improve our quality of life .
But in a complex system such as the environment it is impossible to predict what will happen when a tiny segment of the ecosystem is replaced .
Hopefully further research will provide a reliable ability to determine whether such concerns are valid , or whether they are merely the offspring of technology - stifling fear of the new and unfamiliar .
Chicago - THE
Internal Revenue Service filing deadline is almost upon us , forcing us once again to fill out exasperating tax forms .
Spurred on by the grumbling , Congress will most likely make noises about introducing tax reforms that never come about .
Experts will again bemoan the deductions and loopholes of the system and the complexity of the alternative minimum tax .
Rather than rehash the same old debates , though , we would do better to aim at the middle and ask why most Americans have to do their taxes at all .
You see , many people do not have a complex tax situation .
They do n't itemize .
They get income only from simple places -- like wages from their job and interest from their bank .
And here 's the kicker : this information is already sent directly to the Internal Revenue Service by taxpayers ' employers and banks .
Indeed , for many Americans , literally every line they fill out on their tax return is information the I.R.S. already has .
( If you do n't believe it , try not filling out the " wages " line on your tax return next year and see what happens .
You 'll receive a notice that states your wages -- and assesses a penalty for not reporting them . )
By September 2002 every would - be mover and shaker in our nation ’s capital knew that Gulf War II would begin shortly after President Bush could claim , however implausibly , that international “ diplomacy ” had failed to get Saddam Hussein to give up his pursuit of nuclear weapons .
Many of them knew that Saddam had given up his pursuit of nukes a decade earlier .
Worse , many of them knew that Gulf War II had already secretly begun , months before , with Operation Southern Focus , a massive preemptive , “ suppressive ” air assault against more than 400 “ key ” targets in Iraq , some of them military .
That massive air assault  a war crime , if unauthorized  began before Bush even sought the “ fig leaf ” protection of a congressional or Security Council authorization to use U.S. armed forces if necessary to “ disarm ” Saddam .
Now , September 2006 , every would - be mover and shaker in our nation ’s capital knows that Gulf War III will begin shortly after President Bush can claim , however implausibly , that international “ diplomacy ” has failed to get the Iranian mullahs to give up their pursuit of nuclear weapons .
Many of them know that there is no “ indication ” that the mullahs have ever had a nuclear weapons program .
Worse , many  perhaps all  of them know that Gulf War II was never about nukes .
Gulf War II was , and Gulf War III will be , about “ regime change . ”
But , the Cheney Cabal discovered early on that the only rationale acceptable to you soccer moms for invading Iran , Iraq , Syria , North Korea , et al. would be ( a ) their developing nukes and ( b ) giving them to terrorists .
So the Cheney Cabal and their media sycophants launched an unrelenting propaganda campaign , falsely claiming that Iran , Iraq , Syria , and North Korea had illicit nuke - development programs .
Unfortunately , at the time , according to inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency , there was no “ indication ” that any of them did .
So the Cheney Cabal and their media sycophants launched another unrelenting propaganda campaign , attacking the competency and honesty of IAEA officials .
In the process , the Cheney Cabal corrupted the IAEA Board of Governors , resulting in the passage of several resolutions by the Board that violated the IAEA Statute , the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons , and the UN Charter itself .
Next , the Cheney Cabal corrupted the Security Council , resulting in at least one resolution that also violated the UN Charter .
Now comes Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad to address the UN General Assembly for the second time .
Well , it ’s barely possible that Ahmadinejad ’s televised performance before the UN General Assembly last Tuesday ( excerpted below )  in conjunction with his half - dozen televised interviews  may put a hitch in the Cheney Cabal ’s gitalong .
You see , although the movers and shakers in our nation ’s capital claim to have viewed Ahmadinejad ’s address as very helpful to the Cheney Cabal , and disastrous to Iran ’s cause , that does not seem to be the view of the rest of the world .
" Excellencies ,
" Apparently , the Security Council can only be used to ensure the security and the rights of some big powers .
" When the oppressed [ Lebanese , Palestinians ] are crushed by bombardment , the Security Council must remain aloof and not even call for a cease - fire .
Is this not a tragedy of historic proportions for the Security Council , which is charged with maintaining security for all countries ?
" The question needs to be asked :
If the governments of the United States or the United Kingdom , who are permanent members of the Security Council , commit aggression , occupation , and violation of international law , which of the organs of the UN can take them to account ?
" Can a Council in which they are privileged members address their violations ?
Has this ever happened ?
" In fact , we have repeatedly seen the reverse .
If they have differences with a nation or state , they drag it [ Iran ] to the Security Council and as claimants arrogate to themselves simultaneously the roles of prosecutor , judge , and executioner .
Is this a just order ?
" Can there be a more vivid case of discrimination and more clear evidence of injustice ?
" How long can such a situation last in the world ?
It is evident that the behavior of some powers constitutes the greatest challenge before the Security Council , the entire organization , and its affiliated agencies .
" Today , it is undeniable that the Security Council , most critically and urgently , needs legitimacy and effectiveness .
It must be acknowledged that as long as the Council is unable to act on behalf of the entire international community in a transparent , just , and democratic manner , it will neither be legitimate nor effective . "

Indigenous tribes will have an unprecedented say in land use
The forest is home to a rare white bear species and is the ancestral land of several indigenous Canadian tribes .
The deal will save a vast area of forest for wildlife , while allowing sustainable logging in other parts .
The settlement between tribes , loggers and environmentalists is being hailed as an example for other countries .
The land covered by the Great Bear Rainforest is huge .
At 64,000 sq-km ( 25,000 sq- mile ) , it is about twice the size of Belgium .
It stretches 400 km ( 250 miles ) up the Pacific Coast from Vancouver Island all the way north to Alaska .
Past clashes
It has seen frequent disputes in recent years between the lumber industry and environmental groups .
Under the new agreement , about a third of the land is being preserved completely to protect wildlife in the region , including the Kermode bear - a sub-species of black bear with white fur , found only in this region - wolves , grizzly bears and wild salmon .
Local aboriginal groups have given their backing to the agreement .
They have been fighting for a much greater say in land use around their traditional territories for decades .
Provincial Premier Gordon Campbell , announcing the agreement alongside native Indian drummers , said : " The result is a strong marriage that balances the needs of the environment with the need for sustainable jobs and a strong economic future for coastal communities . "
The BBC's Ian Gunn in Vancouver says this is all a far cry from just a few years ago , when environmental groups and the logging industry clashed in the same forests with blockades and frequent arrests .
Now both sides say they have an agreement that should settle the matter for good .

Yet doing ' brain exercises ' such as these can make us all up to 40 per cent cleverer within seven days , according to research by a BBC programme this week .
The tests conducted for Get Smarter in a Week appear to bear out the growing belief among scientists that making simple changes to our lifestyle can lead to significant improvements in how well our brains function .
The programme found that a combination of techniques based on healthy eating , physical activity , sound sleep and stimulating your mind through solving puzzles and remembering lists makes people sharper , more confident and better at making decisions .
The usefulness of such methods will be tested on 100 volunteers from around the UK in an experiment that will get two hours of prime time television on BBC1 on Saturday night .
' IQ has traditionally been thought of as a fixed measure of someone 's intelligence , ' said Philip Morrow , the show 's executive producer .
' But an increasing body of scientific opinion holds that you can take steps in your life to actually improve your brainpower by , for example , enhancing your memory , working on your spatial awareness , doing things differently to normal and eating healthily .
Scientists say you will see noticeable improvements within a week .
Our show is seeing if the science works . '
When the production team did trial runs among 15 volunteers , who each followed a ' get smarter ' regime for a week , they expected their guinea pigs would be about 10 per cent cleverer at the end of it .
What they found was that some performed up to 40 per cent better than in the initial assessment .
However , one man who had gone out on a stag night the evening before the second test found his score 20 per cent down - proving that alcohol damages mental function .
The 100 contestants on Saturday 's show spent last week following as much of the advice in a 50 - page Get Smarter Guide as they could manage .
Its recommendations include moving around your home blindfolded , using your computer mouse with your ' wrong ' hand for an hour a day , and playing games such as Scrabble and charades .
The results will be unveiled when the programme airs .
But early indications are that the volunteers had benefited from taking part .
' Some of them were ringing up and saying that this had totally transformed their lives or that they had had their first good night 's sleep in five years , ' said Morrow .
' A lot of people feel they are under - performing in their life , that they are letting themselves down , in terms of their ability to handle events or thinking that people at work are cleverer than them .
This programme shows everyone can get smarter , and feel better , if they do these things . '

A war of the future is being waged right now in the sprawling desert region of northeastern Africa known as Sudan .
The weapons themselves are not futuristic .
None of the ray - guns , force - fields , or robotic storm troopers that are the stuff of science fiction ; nor , for that matter , the satellite - guided Predator drones or other high - tech weapon systems at the cutting edge of today ’s arsenal .
No , this war is being fought with Kalashnikovs , clubs and knives .
In the western region of Sudan known as Darfur , the preferred tactics are burning and pillaging , castration and rape — carried out by Arab militias riding on camels and horses .
The most sophisticated technologies deployed are , on the one hand , the helicopters used by the Sudanese government to support the militias when they attack black African villages , and on the other hand , quite a different weapon : the seismographs used by foreign oil companies to map oil deposits hundreds of feet below the surface .
This is what makes it a war of the future : not the slick PowerPoint presentations you can imagine in boardrooms in Dallas and Beijing showing proven reserves in one color , estimated reserves in another , vast subterranean puddles that stretch west into Chad , and south to Nigeria and Uganda ; not the technology ; just the simple fact of the oil .
This is a resource war , fought by surrogates , involving great powers whose economies are predicated on growth , contending for a finite pool of resources .
It is a war straight out of the pages of Michael Klare ’s book , Blood and Oil ; and it would be a glaring example of the consequences of our addiction to oil , if it were not also an invisible war .
Invisible ?
Invisible because it is happening in Africa .
Invisible because our mainstream media are subsidized by the petroleum industry .
Think of all the car ads you see on television , in newspapers and magazines .
Think of the narcissism implicit in our automobile culture , our suburban sprawl , our obsessive focus on the rich and famous , the giddy assumption that all this can continue indefinitely when we know it ca n’t — and you see why Darfur slips into darkness .
And Darfur is only the tip of the sprawling , scarred state known as Sudan .
Nicholas Kristof pointed out in a New York Times column that ABC News had a total of 18 minutes of Darfur coverage in its nightly newscasts all last year , and that was to the credit of Peter Jennings ; NBC had only 5 minutes , CBS only 3 minutes .
This is , of course , a micro-fraction of the time devoted to Michael Jackson .
Why is it , I wonder , that when a genocide takes place in Africa , our attention is always riveted on some black American miscreant superstar ?
During the genocide in Rwanda ten years ago , when 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in 100 days , it was the trial of O.J. Simpson that had our attention .
Yes , racism enters into our refusal to even try to understand Africa , let alone value African lives .
And yes , surely we ’re witnessing the kind of denial that Samantha Power documents in A Problem from Hell : America and the Age of Genocide ; the sheer difficulty we have acknowledging genocide .
Once we acknowledge it , she observes , we pay lip - service to humanitarian ideals , but stand idly by .
And yes , turmoil in Africa may evoke our experience in Somalia , with its graphic images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets by their heels .
But all of this is trumped , I believe , by something just as deep : an unwritten conspiracy of silence that prevents the media from making the connections that would threaten our petroleum - dependent lifestyle , that would lead us to acknowledge the fact that the industrial world ’s addiction to oil is laying waste to Africa .
When Darfur does occasionally make the news — photographs of burned villages , charred corpses , malnourished children — it is presented without context .
In truth , Darfur is part of a broader oil - driven crisis in northern Africa .
An estimated 300 to 400 Darfurians are dying every day .
Yet the message from our media is that we Americans are “ helpless ” to prevent this humanitarian tragedy , even as we gas up our SUVs with these people ’s lives .
Even Kristof — whose efforts as a mainstream journalist to keep Darfur in the spotlight are worthy of a Pulitzer — fails to make the connection to oil ; and yet oil was the driving force behind Sudan ’s civil war .
Oil is driving the genocide in Darfur .
Oil drives the Bush administration ’s policy toward Sudan and the rest of Africa .
And oil is likely to topple Sudan and its neighbors into chaos .
The Context for Genocide
I will support these assertions with fact .
But first , let ’s give Sudanese government officials in Khartoum their due .
They prefer to explain the slaughter in Darfur as an ancient rivalry between nomadic herding tribes in the north and black African farmers in the south .
They deny responsibility for the militias and claim they can’t control them , even as they continue to train the militias , arm them , and pay them .
They play down their
Islamist ideology , which supported Osama bin Laden and seeks to impose Islamic fundamentalism in Sudan and elsewhere .
Instead , they portray themselves as pragmatists struggling to hold together an impoverished and backwards country ; all they need is more economic aid from the West , and an end to the trade sanctions imposed by the U.S. in 1997 , when President Clinton added Sudan to the list of states sponsoring terrorism .
Darfur , from their perspective , is an inconvenient anomaly that will go away , in time .
It is true that ethnic rivalries and racism play a part in today ’s conflict in Darfur .
Seen in the larger context of Sudan ’s civil war , however , Darfur is not an anomaly ; it is an extension of that conflict .
The real driving force behind the North - South conflict became clear after Chevron discovered oil in southern Sudan in 1978 .
The traditional competition for water at the fringes of the Sahara was transformed into quite a different struggle .
The Arab - dominated government in Khartoum redrew
Sudan ’s jurisdictional boundaries to exclude the oil reserves from southern jurisdiction .
Thus began Sudan ’s 21 - year - old North - South civil war .
The conflict then moved south , deep into Sudan , into wetter lands that form the headwaters of the Nile and lie far from the historical competition for water .
Oil pipelines , pumping stations , well - heads , and other key infrastructure became targets for the rebels from the South , who wanted a share in the country ’s new mineral wealth , much of which was on lands they had long occupied .
John Garang , leader of the rebel Sudan People ’s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , declared these installations to be legitimate targets of war .
For a time , the oil companies fled from the conflict , but in the 1990s they began to return .
Chinese and Indian companies were particularly aggressive , doing much of their drilling behind perimeters of bermed earth guarded by troops to protect against rebel attacks .
It was a Chinese pipeline to the Red Sea that first brought Sudanese oil to the international market .
Prior to the discovery of oil , this dusty terrain had little to offer in the way of exports .
Most of the arable land was given over to subsistence farming : sorghum and food staples ; cattle and camels .
Some cotton was grown for export .
Sudan , sometimes still called The Sudan , is the largest country in Africa and one of the poorest .
Nearly a million square miles in area , roughly the size of the United States east of the Mississippi , it is more region than nation .
Embracing some 570 distinct peoples and dozens of languages and historically ungovernable , its boundaries had been drawn for the convenience of colonial powers .
Its nominal leaders in the north , living in urban Khartoum , were eager to join the global economy — and oil was to become their country ’s first high - value export .
South Sudan is overwhelmingly rural and black .
Less accessible from the north , marginalized under the reign of the Ottoman Turks in the nineteenth century , again under the British overlords during much of the twentieth , and now by Khartoum in the north , South Sudan today is almost devoid of schools , hospitals , and modern infrastructure .
Racism figures heavily in all this .
Arabs refer to darker Africans as “ abeed , ” a word that means something close to “ slave . ”
During the civil war , African boys were kidnapped from the south and enslaved ; many were pressed into military service by the Arab - dominated government in Khartoum .
Racism continues to find expression in the brutal rapes now taking place in Darfur .
Khartoum recruits the militias , called Janjaweed — itself a derogatory term — from the poorest and least educated members of nomadic Arab society .
In short , the Islamist regime has manipulated ethnic , racial , and economic tensions , as part of a strategic drive to commandeer the country ’s oil wealth .
The war has claimed about two million lives , mostly in the south — many by starvation , when government forces prevented humanitarian agencies from gaining access to camps .
Another four million Sudanese remain homeless .
The regime originally sought to impose shariah , or Islamic , law on the predominantly Christian and animist South .
Khartoum dropped this demand , however , under terms of the Comprehensive Peace Treaty signed last January .
The South was to be allowed to operate under its own civil law , which included rights for women ; and in six years , southerners could choose by plebiscite whether to separate or remain part of a unified Sudan .
The all - important oil revenues would be divided between Khartoum and the SPLA - held territory .
Under a power - sharing agreement , SPLA commander John Garang would be installed as vice president of Sudan , alongside President Omar al - Bashir .
Darfur , to the west , was left out of this treaty .
In a sense , the treaty — brokered with the help of the U.S. — was signed at the expense of Darfur , a parched area the size of France , sparsely populated but oil rich .
It has an ancient history of separate existence as a kingdom lapping into Chad , separate from the area known today as Sudan .
Darfur ’s population is proportionately more Muslim and less Christian than southern Sudan ’s , but is mostly black African , and identifies itself by tribe , such as the Fur .
( Darfur , in fact , means “ land of the Fur . ” )
The Darfurian practice of Islam was too lax to suit the Islamists who control Khartoum .
And so Darfurian villages have been burned to clear the way for drilling and pipelines , and to remove any possible sanctuaries for rebels .
Some of the land seized from black farmers is reportedly being given to Arabs brought in from neighboring Chad .
Oil and Turmoil
With the signing of the treaty last January , and the prospect of stability for most of war - torn Sudan , new seismographic studies were undertaken by foreign oil companies in April .
These studies had the effect of doubling Sudan ’s estimated oil reserves , bringing them to at least 563 million barrels .
They could yield substantially more .
Khartoum claims the amount could total as much as 5 billion barrels .
That ’s still a pittance compared to the 674 billion barrels of proven oil reserves possessed by the six Persian Gulf countries — Saudi Arabia , Iraq , the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Iran , and Qatar .
The very modesty of Sudan ’s reserves speaks volumes to the desperation with which industrial nations are grasping for alternative sources of oil .
The rush for oil is wreaking havoc on Sudan .
Oil revenues to Khartoum have been about $ 1 million a day , exactly the amount which the government funnels into arms — helicopters and bombers from Russia , tanks from Poland and China , missiles from Iran .
Thus , oil is fueling the genocide in Darfur at every level .
This is the context in which Darfur must be understood — and , with it , the whole of Africa .
The same Africa whose vast tapestry of indigenous cultures , wealth of forests and savannas was torn apart by three centuries of theft by European colonial powers — seeking slaves , ivory , gold , and diamonds — is being devastated anew by the 21st century quest for oil .
Sudan is now the seventh
biggest oil producer in Africa after Nigeria , Libya , Algeria , Angola , Egypt , and Equatorial Guinea .
Oil has brought corruption and turmoil in its wake virtually wherever it has been discovered in the developing world .
Second only perhaps to the arms industry , its lack of transparency and concentration of wealth invites kickbacks and bribery , as well as distortions to regional economies .
“ There is no other commodity that produces such great profit , ” said Terry Karl in an interview with Miren Gutierrez , for the International Press Service , “ and this is generally in the context of highly concentrated power , very weak bureaucracies , and weak rule of law . ”
Karl is co-author of a
Catholic Relief Services report on the impact of oil in Africa , entitled
Bottom of the Barrel .
He cites the examples of Gabon , Angola and Nigeria , which began exploiting oil several decades ago and suffer from intense corruption .
In Nigeria , as in Angola , an overvalued exchange rate has destroyed the non-oil economy .
Local revolts over control of oil revenues also have triggered sweeping military repression in the Niger delta .
Oil companies and exploration companies like Halliburton wield political and sometimes military power .
In Sudan , roads and bridges built by oil firms have been used to attack otherwise remote villages .
Canada ’s largest oil company , Talisman , is now in court for allegedly aiding Sudan government forces in blowing up a church and killing church leaders , in order to clear the land for pipelines and drilling .
Under public pressure in Canada , Talisman has sold its holdings in Sudan .
Lundin Oil AB , a Swedish company , withdrew under similar pressure from human rights groups .
Michael Klare suggests that oil production is intrinsically destabilizing :
“ When countries with few other resources of national wealth exploit their petroleum reserves , the ruling elites typically monopolize the distribution of oil revenues , enriching themselves and their cronies while leaving the rest of the population mired in poverty — and the well - equipped and often privileged security forces of these ‘ petro- states ’ can be counted on to support them . ”
Compound these antidemocratic tendencies with the ravenous thirst of the rapidly growing Chinese and Indian economies , and you have a recipe for destabilization in Africa .
China ’s oil imports climbed by 33 % in 2004 , India ’s by 11 % .
The International Energy Agency expects them to use 11.3 million barrels a day by 2010 , which will be more than one - fifth of global demand .
Keith Bradsher , in a New York Times article ,
2 Big Appetites Take Seats at the Oil Table , observes :
“ As Chinese and Indian companies venture into countries like Sudan , where risk - aversive multinationals have hesitated to enter , questions are being raised in the industry about whether state - owned companies are accurately judging the risks to their own investments , or whether they are just more willing to gamble with taxpayers ’ money than multinationals are willing to gamble with shareholders ’ investments . ”
The geopolitical implications of this tolerance for instability are borne out in Sudan , where Chinese state - owned companies exploited oil in the thick of fighting .
As China and India seek strategic access to oil — much as Britain , Japan , and the United States jockeyed for access to oil fields in the years leading up to World War II — the likelihood of destabilizing countries like Sudan rises exponentially .
Last June , following the new seismographic exploration in Sudan and with the new power - sharing peace treaty about to be implemented , Khartoum and the SPLA signed a flurry of oil deals with Chinese , Indian , British , Malaysian , and other oil companies .
Desolate Sudan , Desolate World
This feeding frenzy may help explain the Bush administration ’s schizophrenic stance toward Sudan .
On the one hand , Secretary of State Colin Powell declared in September 2004 that his government had determined that what was happening in Darfur was “ genocide ” — which appears to have been a pre-election sop to conservative Christians , many with missions in Africa .
On the other hand , not only did the President fall silent on Darfur after the election , but his administration has lobbied quietly against the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act in Congress .
That bill , how in committee , calls for beefing up the African Union peacekeeping force and imposing new sanctions on Khartoum , including referring individual officials to the International Criminal Court ( much hated by the administration ) .
The White House , undercutting Congressional efforts to stop the genocide , is seeking closer relations with Khartoum on grounds that the regime was “ cooperating in the war on terror . ”
Nothing could end the slaughter faster than the President of the United States standing up for Darfur and making a strong case before the United Nations .
Ours is the only country with such clout .
This is unimaginable , of course , for various reasons .
It seems clear that Bush , and the oil companies that contributed so heavily to his 2000 presidential campaign , would like to see the existing trade sanctions on Sudan removed , so U.S. companies can get a piece of the action .
Instead of standing up , the President has kept mum — leaving it to Secretary of State
Condoleezza
Rice to put the best face she can on his policy of appeasing Khartoum .
On July 8 , SPLA leader John Garang was sworn in as vice president of Sudan , before a throng of 6 million cheering Sudanese .
President Oman Bashir spoke in Arabic .
Garang spoke in English , the preferred language among educated southerners , because of the country ’s language diversity .
Sudan ’s future had never looked brighter .
Garang was a charismatic and forceful leader who wanted a united Sudan .
Three weeks later , Garang was killed in a helicopter crash .
When word of his death emerged , angry riots broke out in Khartoum , and in Juba , the capital of South Sudan .
Men with guns and clubs roamed the streets , setting fire to cars and office buildings .
One hundred and thirty people were killed , thousands wounded .
No evidence of foul play in his death has been uncovered , as of this writing .
The helicopter went down in rain and fog over mountainous terrain .
Nevertheless , suspicions are rampant .
SPLA and government officials are calling for calm , until the crash can be investigated by an international team of experts .
All too ominously , the disaster recalls the 1994 airplane crash that killed Rwandan president , Juvenal Habyarimana , who was trying to implement a power - sharing agreement between Hutus and Tutsis .
That crash touched off the explosive Rwandan genocide .
What Garang ’s death will mean for Sudan is unclear .
The new peace was already precarious .
His chosen successor , Salva Kiir Mayardit , appears less committed to a united Sudan
Nowhere is the potential impact of renewed war more threatening than in the camps of refugees — the 4 million Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) , driven from their homes during the North - South civil war , several hundred thousand encamped at the fringes of Khartoum as squatters or crowded into sprawling ghetto neighborhoods .
Further west , in Darfur and Chad , another 2.5 million IDPs live in the precarious limbo of makeshift camps , in shelters cobbled together from plastic and sticks — prevented by the Janjaweed from returning to their villages , wholly dependent on outside aid .
In short , Sudan embodies a collision between a failed state and a failed energy policy .
Increasingly , ours is a planet whose human population is devoted to extracting what it can , regardless of the human and environmental cost .
The Bush energy policy , crafted by oil companies , is predicated on a far different future from the one any sane person would want his or her children to inherit — a desolate world that few Americans , cocooned by the media ’s silence , are willing to imagine .

Israelâ€™s war on Lebanon is a warm - up for the U.S. war on Iran .
That is the message of Seymour Hershâ€™s latest superb article in the New Yorker .
Hersh reveals that the Bush administration was â€œclosely involvedâ€ in planning Israelâ€™s attacks on Lebanon .
Â
A former senior intelligence official informed Hersh that , beginning this Spring , â€œplanners from the U.S. Air Forceâ€ ” under pressure from the White House to develop a war plan for a decisive strike against Iranâ€™s nuclear facilitiesâ€ ” began consulting with their counterparts in the Israeli Air Force.â€ 
Hersh notes :
The surprising strength of Hezbollah ’s resistance , and its continuing ability to fire rockets into northern Israel in the face of the constant Israeli bombing , the Middle East expert told me , “ is a massive setback for those in the White House who want to use force in Iran .
And those who argue that the bombing will create internal dissent and revolt in Iran are also set back . ”
Israel is following its own agenda .
Â
But a Pentagon consultant informed Hersh that the Bush White House â€ œhas been agitating for some time to find a reason for a preÃ«mptive blow against Hezbollah.â€ Â
Hezbollahâ€™s capture of two Israeli soldiers last month provided the pretext for a massive bombing campaign than had been planned long before .
The Bush team is chomping at the bit to use the â€œlessonsâ€ from Israelâ€™s war for its own on Iran .
Â
A former intelligence officer told Hersh : â€ œWe told Israel , â€ ˜Look , if you guys have to go , weâ€ ™re behind you all the way .
But we think it should be sooner rather than laterâ € ” the longer you wait , the less time we have to evaluate and plan for Iran before Bush gets out of office .
â€™â€ 
The Bush team apparently believes that they are entitled to create a few more catastrophes before Bushâ€™s time runs out .
Hersh highlights the harebrained notion underlying the Israeli bombing campaign : â€ œIsrael believed that , by targeting Lebanonâ€™s infrastructure , including highways , fuel depots , and even the civilian runways at the main Beirut airport , it could persuade Lebanonâ€™s large Christian and Sunni populations to turn against Hezbollah , according to the former senior intelligence official.â€  Â
This has backfired massively .
Â Â And yet the Bush administration appears to still believe that a U.S. bombing campaign in Iran would turn the Iranian people against the Iranian government .
Â Â
There is no evidence that Bush or Cheney have yet recognized any drawbacks , political or otherwise , from sending Americans off to die for damnfool ideas .

Four amateur cave explorers in Sequoia National Park have discovered a vast cave formed 1 million years ago , a labyrinth that stretches more than 1,000 feet into a mountain and features some of the most beautiful rock formations ever seen .
Millions of crystals along its walls shimmer like diamonds .
Translucent mineral " curtains " hang from the ceiling .
Flowstones that resemble spilled paint dot the floor .
A lake that might be 20 feet deep fills one of the cave 's five known rooms , and passages leading into darkness suggest there is still much more to see .
The discovery has excited geologists and cave explorers nationwide because although caves are discovered with almost mundane regularity -- 17 of the 240 caves in Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks have been found since 2003 -- it is rare to find one so grand .
The cave , named Ursa Minor , has been called one of the most significant finds in a generation .
" There are things in this cave that could really open windows into our knowledge of geologic history and the formation of caves throughout the West , " said Joel Despain , the parks ' cave manager .
" We 're just beginning to understand the scientific ramifications of this . "
Park officials will not pinpoint the cave 's location , saying only that it is in the Kaweah River watershed and will probably never be open to the public .
Explorers from the nonprofit Cave Research Foundation discovered it on Aug. 19 .
Through good luck and better eyesight , they happened upon Ursa Minor while headed to lunch .
While most people envision caves as big holes in the ground , cave mouths are usually quite small -- in this case , about the size of a softball .
Scott McBride , an explorer from San Andreas ( Calaveras County ) who has discovered 50 caves since 1994 , spotted it , loosely filled with dirt and rock .
Fissures around the opening , something a casual observer would miss but a seasoned caver knows might suggest a cave entrance , suggested it was worth a closer look .
" It looked interesting to me , so I broke out my flashlight , " he said .
" Sure enough , I could see darkness in the hole , which is a good sign . "
He kept digging , and when the mouth was just big enough , he poked his head inside .
The hole kept going , so he called out to his colleagues to bring shovels .
Within a couple of hours , they 'd opened up a hole big enough for McBride to squeeze through .
He scooted 25 feet or so down a slight incline , his headlamp lighting the way .
He landed in a room so big he could n't see the other side .
" By that point , I could see that it went back at least 35 feet , and I thought , ' OK , this is a cave , ' " he said .
" I knew pretty quickly that this was significant . "
McBride climbed out to tell his friends .
They went for lunch and returned with climbing gear .
After 90 minutes of digging , they 'd opened up a bigger hole .
McBride went first , followed by Mike White .
They made it to the room McBride had already seen , turned a corner and discovered the passage descended 90 feet straight down .
Excited , they rappelled into the void , their headlamps lighting the way .
They called back to their colleagues , Allen Hager and Tom LeFrank , from the bottom .
No one heard them .
They were too far down .
" They 'd been yelling at us for 10 minutes , and we could n't even hear them , " said Hager , a caver from Los Angeles .
When they finally got the word , they too went into the hole .
The four men spent about an hour exploring the cave in awe before climbing out to alert park officials .
" I was absolutely floored , " Hager recalled .
" Stunned . "
Cavers have a tradition of allowing the person who discovers a cave to name it , and McBride chose " Ursa Minor " because they found a bear skeleton inside and because the cave shimmers like the stars of the Little Dipper .
" I 've never seen a cave sparkle like this one , " McBride said .
" When you shine your light around the room , all the facets reflect your light like a million diamonds . "
The four explorers have joined Despain and other geologists in mapping the cave , but they have n't found the end .
The cave features five rooms -- the biggest is about 200 feet wide and 50 feet tall -- and at least five leads , or passages , leading farther underground .
" We think we 've seen about 1,000 feet of cave passage , but there are areas we can see but have n't explored , " Despain said .
" We do n't know how big this cave is or how much more there might be . "
Those who have seen Ursa Minor -- only a dozen people have been allowed in -- said the most impressive thing about it is n't its size but its features .
The floor is covered with stalagmites and flowstones that Despain said look " like someone poured taffy on the floor . "
Thin , hollow stalactites called soda straws hang from above ; the longest are 6 feet .
There are long , thin blades of rock called cave curtains , which are formed by water flowing from overhangs .
Some are translucent ; others are red , orange or brown .
Here and there are piles of cave pearls , calcified balls of sand as large as cherry tomatoes .
" You stand in one of these rooms and it 's just jaw - dropping , " Despain said .
" It 's just beautiful . "
The cave is littered with animal skeletons and teems with spiders , centipedes , millipedes and other invertebrates .
Experts believe Ursa Minor will feature unique species found nowhere else , adding to the 27 never - before - seen species discovered during a recent study of invertebrates in the park 's 239 other caves .
Park officials are inviting experts in various fields from throughout the West to help explore the cave , and many are jumping at the chance to visit a pristine cave and see a portion of the Sierra Nevada from the inside .
" Ursa Minor is a very important discovery that likely will help us to understand how caves in the Sierra Nevada form , and perhaps even tell us something about the mountain range itself , " said Greg Stock , a geologist at Yosemite National Park who is among those invited to tour the cave .
For now , the top priority is thoroughly mapping the cave and installing a gate at its mouth to keep sightseers and vandals at bay .
No more than a few dozen people will ever see Ursa Minor , and those who have said they 'll never forget it .
" It was exhilarating and overwhelming , " McBride said .
" You constantly look for these things , and cavers always joke about finding the big one .
To find the one we always joked about is just amazing .
This is the creme de la creme of finding caves . "

Traditional DNS Howto
Version 1.0
Authors : Tom Adelstein < tom [ dot ] adelstein [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com >

Linux system administrators should learn traditional DNS .
Front-ends and quick templates to setup domain records have a place in managing sites .
When confronted with DNS configurations already in existence , nothing can substitute for knowing and using the fundamentals .
The vast majority of users on the Internet have no clue about DNS .
They may have seen the term when they set up their ISP connection , but they do not realize its connection to their lives .
Simply put , DNS servers allow you to use friendly names in your browser , email or other Internet applications to perform tasks which require IP addresses .
The Internet uses TCP / IP protocol to send and receive everything on the Internet .
When you type Google.com in your browser to do a search , you use DNS .
Otherwise , you would have to use this numeric value : 64.233.187.99 .
Click on each one and see what you get .
You see Google.com is an name in a database that your browser consults to find the IP address of the Google web site .
But that 's transparent to the user .
How would you like to keep a notebook of IP addresses to manually look up and find web sites you wish to visit ?
Well , the Domain Name System does that for you automatically .
If you 're sitting there reading this and going , " Oh yeah , I already know about that " , then hold on a minute or two .
Working with DNS requires considerable knowledge and discipline .
The system administrators I know can do many tasks , yet few can handle DNS .
Almost without exception , they get lost because they do n't understand the fundamentals .
The Domain Name System of the Internet makes up the largest distributed database on the planet and it's quite ingenious .
In theory , it has no flaws .
In practice , people kludge it up all the time .
People make DNS entries in their part of the database that are n't formatted correctly or have inherent deficiencies which result in errors .
Internet surveys of DNS records have shown incidents of errors as high as 72 % .
We know the majority of those errors come from lame delegations .
Lame delegations include domains registered with DNS servers assigned to them when no one is actually hosting the domain .
Other causes include the failure to provide zone files , errors in resource records , expired domain registrations .
If you attempt to learn DNS jargon , you will find that it is not intuitive .
At first it just does n't make sense .
In many ways , the jargon reminds me of a foreign language .
You just have to work with it for a period of time before it makes sense .
Linux uses BIND to perform DNS functions .
Rather than attempt to use another program , system administrators should start with BIND because it runs almost all the DNS servers in the world .
I 'm not going to offer a history lesson on BIND because this subject will put you to sleep anyway .
So , if you want to go forth and learn all about BIND please do .
It wo n't help you do much DNS with one exception .
Some people still use BIND version 4 .
You want to upgrade from BIND 4 to BIND 8 or 9 .
It 's just my luck that you 'll go out to create DNS configuration files and they wo n't make any sense .
That 's because a lot of people still run BIND 4 .
Tell Me About Configuration Files
BIND comes with three components .
The first components we called named or name - dee .
It 's a daemon that runs the server side of DNS .
That will make sense in a little while .
The second component of BIND we call the resolver library .
People think of a resolver as the client side of BIND .
The resolver code makes queries of DNS servers in an attempt to translate a friendly name to an IP address .
This component uses the resolv.conf file .
Does that sound like a UNIX abbreviation .
It should because it is .
The third component of BIND provides tools for testing you DNS server .
We call them tools but they are really a set of command line utilities like dig .
Go to your console and type dig yahoo.com and see what happens .
We will look at this later .
What 's My Responsibility In The DNS System ?
As stated earlier , DNS is a distributed data base .
When you pay a fee to register a domain one of the questions you answer deals with your Name Servers .
You have to list two and they have to be registered in the DNS system .
The domain name system database has three levels .
The first group of servers we call " root " servers .
The second we call Top Level Domains or ( TLDs ) .
When your resolver needs to find the address for a web site , it makes a query .
Let 's say you want to find Google.com .
Your resolver asks the Root servers to identify Google.com 's IP .
The Root server replies , I do n't know but I do now where you can find the answer .
Start with the TLD servers for COM .
Advertisement Advertisement
So , Root sends your query to a COM server .
It says , OK .
I do n't have that information but I know a Name Server that does .
It has an address of 64.233.167.99 and the name ns1.google.com .
So , go to that address and it will tell you the web site address of google.com
Your resolver takes the information from ns1.google.com and returns with an IP address .
If Google 's name server gave your resolver the correct name , you 'll get a web page .
The path traveled looks like Figure 1 .
Figure 1 - From Root to your Domain .
In the upper left of Figure 1 , we have depicted a set of servers with the annotation of Root .
In the jargon of DNS , these servers represent the beginning of the DNS path .
You will see them represented by a period or dot ( " . " ) .
In your configuration files , your IP address to name mapping will end with a period .
When we look at some of those files in a few minutes this will become clearer .
The Root servers are the top of the distributed DNS database .
They have information about the Top Level Domains ( TLDs ) .
TLDs include com , net , org , mil , gov , edu , etc .
When you contract to use a domain name , you chose which TLD you want .
In my case , I have a domain in the org name space called centralsoft.org .
Advertisement
When I registered my name servers , I gave the name of server1.centralsoft.org and ns0.centralsoft.org to my registration agent .
In the TLD servers for org , you will find my name servers .
The org servers know where you should find information on centralsoft .
When I registered , I told the agent that I would take responsibility for maintaining a database of IP addresses and friendly names and map them to one another .
So , we made an agreement and the Domain Name System said , " OK , now you have authority for the data on centralsoft.org .
When someone wants to find the services you offer on the Internet , we will point them to you . "
France rejects ' war on terror '
( Reuters )
Updated : 2006-09-07 21:56
PARIS - France issued an implicit criticism of US foreign policy on Thursday , rejecting talk of a " war on terror . "
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , speaking in parliament , expressed these views on global terrorism , while President Jacques Chirac backed France 's claims to the international front rank with a fresh defense of his country 's nuclear arsenal .
France 's Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin delivers a speech during a debate on the Lebanon crisis at the National Assembly in Paris September 7 , 2006 .
[ Reuters ]
Villepin noted Chirac 's strong opposition to the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and said the Arab state had now sunk into violence and was feeding new regional crises .
" Let us not forget that these crises play into the hands of all extremists , " the prime minister said in a debate on the Middle East .
" We can see this with terrorism , whether it tries to strike inside or outside our frontiers , " he added .
" Against terrorism , what 's needed is not a war .
It is , as France has done for many years , a determined fight based on vigilance at all times and effective cooperation with our partners .
" But we will only end this curse if we also fight against injustice , violence and these crises , " he said .
Villepin 's remarks , which came a day after US President George Bush admitted that the CIA had interrogated dozens of terrorism suspects in secret foreign locations , did not explicitly mention the United States .
But his rejection of language employed by Bush , who often uses the expression " war on terror " underlined the longstanding differences between Paris and Washington .
In separate remarks , Chirac stressed that France was committed to maintaining a nuclear arsenal of its own .
" In an uncertain world , facing constantly evolving threats , nuclear dissuasion guarantees our vital interests , " Chirac said on a visit to France 's Atomic Energy Commission nuclear simulation facility at Bruyeres - le - Chatel near Paris .
He stressed that France was committed to funding continuing research and development into nuclear weapons technology .
" There can be no great ambition without adequate means , that 's clear , " he said .
" The position of countries is never guaranteed .
In the 21st century , only those which make science a genuine priority will stay ahead . "
Both France and the United States have played down splits opened by the Iraq war , pointing especially to cooperation on attempts by the West to contain Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
But differences in tone and style have often resurfaced , notably during the Lebanon crisis , where France initially offered to send just 400 peacekeepers to Lebanon despite vigorously backing calls for an international force .
Villepin 's speech in parliament made much of France 's leading role in securing a peace agreement in Lebanon backed by the United Nations , which he said had shown the virtues of " listening and dialogue . "
" It is the duty of France and Europe to show that the clash of civilizations is not inevitable , " he said .
" No one retains this wisdom , inherited from our history , as we , French and Europeans , do , " he said .
The Peak of World Oil Production and the Road to the Olduvai Gorge

Summit 2000

November 13 , 2000
Abstract
The Olduvai theory has been called unthinkable , preposterous , absurd , dangerous , self - fulfilling , and self - defeating .
I offer it , however , as an inductive theory based on world energy and population data and on what I ’ve seen during the past 30 years in some 50 nations on all continents except Antarctica .
It is also based on my experience in electrical engineering and energy management systems , my hobbies of anthropology and archaeology , and a lifetime of reading in various fields .
The theory is defined by the ratio of world energy production ( use ) and world population .
The details are worked out .
The theory is easy .
It states that the life expectancy of Industrial Civilization is less than or equal to 100 years : 1930 - 2030 .
World energy production per capita from 1945 to 1973 grew at a breakneck speed of 3.45 % / year .
Next from 1973 to the all - time peak in 1979 , it slowed to a sluggish 0.64 % / year .
Then suddenly — and for the first time in history — energy production per capita took a long - term decline of 0.33 % / year from 1979 to 1999 .
The Olduvai theory explains the 1979 peak and the subsequent decline .
More to the point , it says that energy production per capita will fall to its 1930 value by 2030 , thus giving Industrial Civilization a lifetime of less than or equal to 100 years .
Should this occur , any number of factors could be cited as the ' causes ' of collapse .
I believe , however , that the collapse will be strongly correlated with an ' epidemic ' of permanent blackouts of high - voltage electric power networks — worldwide .
Briefly explained : " When the electricity goes out , you are back in the Dark Age .
And the Stone Age is just around the corner . "
The Olduvai theory , of course , may be proved wrong .
But , as of now , it cannot be rejected by the historic world energy production and population data .

Collapse , if and when it comes again , will this time be global .
No longer can any individual nation collapse .
World civilization will disintegrate as a whole .
Competitors who evolve as peers collapse in like manner .
Joseph A. Tainter , 1988
1. Introduction
The Olduvai theory deals neither with the geology or the paleontology of the Olduvai Gorge .
Nor is it prescriptive .
Rather , the theory simply attempts to explain the historic world energy production ( and use ) and population data in terms of overshoot and collapse .
I chose the name " Olduvai " because ( 1 ) it is justly famous , ( 2 ) I 've been there , ( 3 ) its long hollow sound is eerie and ominous , and ( 4 ) it is a good metaphor for the ' Stone Age way of life ' .
In fact , the Olduvai way of life was ( and still is ) a sustainable way of life - local , tribal , and solar - and , for better or worse , our ancestors practiced it for millions of years .
No doubt that the peak and decline of Industrial Civilization , should it occur , will be due to a complex matrix of causes , such as overpopulation , the depletion of nonrenewable resources , environmental damage , pollution , soil erosion , global warming , newly emerging viruses , and resource wars .
That said , the Olduvai theory uses a single metric only , as defined by " White 's Law . "
But now it comes with a new twist - ( ( ( a will - o' - the - wisp ) ) ) - electricity .
Most of my industrial experience is in electric power networks and the energy management systems ( EMS ) that control them .
Electricity is not a primary energy source , but rather an " energy carrier " : zero mass , travels near the speed of light , and , for all practical purposes , it can't be stored .
Moreover , electric power systems are costly , complex , voracious of fuel , polluting , and require 24h - 7d - 52w maintenance and operations .
Another problem is that electricity is taken for granted .
Just flip the switch and things happen .
In short : Electricity is the quintessence of the ' modern way of life ' , but the electric power systems themselves are demanding , dangerous , and delicate .
All this suggests that permanent blackouts will be strongly correlated with the collapse of Industrial Civilization - the so - named " Olduvai cliff , " discussed later .
This paper is the backup for the accompanying slide show titled " The Olduvai Theory : An Illustrated Guide " ( see Duncan , 2000c ) .
Definitions : " Oil " ( O ) means crude oil and natural gas liquids .
' Energy ' ( E ) means the primary sources of energy - specifically oil , gas , coal , and nuclear & hydropower .
' Pop ' means world population .
' ô ' means oil production per capita . ' ê ' means energy production per capita .
" G " means billion ( 10^9 ) . " b " means barrels of oil .
' boe ' means barrels of oil equivalent ( energy content , not quality ) .
' J ' means joule .
' Industrial Civilization ' and ' Electrical Civilization ' , as we shall see , mean the same thing .
Industrial Civilization is shown as a pulse - shaped curve of world average energy - use per capita ( ê ) .
The ' life expectancy ' ( i.e. ' duration ' ) of Industrial Civilization is defined as the time ( in years ) between the upside point when ê reaches 30 % of its peak value and the corresponding downside point when ê falls to the same value ( Figure 4 ) .
The new twist is that the Olduvai theory now focuses on the mounting problems with the high - voltage electric power networks - worldwide .
Civilization and Ready Kilowatt : Although the fossil fuels are still very important , electricity is the indispensable end - use energy for Industrial Civilization .
To determine its importance , it is essential to distinguish between the primary energy consumed to generate electricity versus the primary energy consumed for all other ( i.e. non-electric ) end -uses , such as work and heat .
Consider the following .
We estimate that 42 % of the world 's primary energy in 1999 was consumed to generate electricity .
This compares to oil 's contribution to all non-electric end -uses of 39 % ; gas ' contribution of 18 % ; and coal 's contribution of a mere 1 % .
Moreover :
When energy quality is accounted for , then the importance of electricity becomes very , VERY clear .
For example , if you want to heat your room , then 1 joule ( J ) of coal is ' equal ' to 1 J of electricity .
However , if you want to power up your TV , then 1 J of electricity is ' equal ' to 3 J of coal !
So if you 're going to worry about energy , then do n't loose sleep over oil , gas , and coal .
Worry about the electric switch on the wall !
2. Energy And Civilization
Other factors remaining constant , culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased , or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased .
We may now sketch the history of cultural development from this standpoint .
Leslie White , 1949 " White 's Law "
Oil is liquid , power packed , and portable .
It is the major primary source of energy for Industrial Civilization .
( But not the major end - use source ! )
We have developed a new method of modeling and simulation and then used it to make a series of five forecasts of world oil production - one new forecast every year .
Figure 1 shows the main results of our most recent forecast , i.e. Forecast # 5 . ( Duncan , 2000 b )
Figure 1 . World , OPEC , and Non-OPEC Oil Production
Notes : ( 1 ) World oil production is forecast to peak in 2006 .
( 2 ) The OPEC / non-OPEC crossover event occurs in 2008 .
( 3 ) The OPEC nations ' rate of oil production from 1985 to 1999 increased by 9.33 times that of the non-OPEC nations .
Figure 1 shows the historic world oil production data from 1960 to 1999 and our forecasts from 2000 to 2040 .
Note that the overall growth rate of oil production slowed from 1960 to 1999 ( curve 1 ) .
In detail : The average rate of growth from 1960 to 1973 was a whopping 6.65 % / year .
Next , from 1973 to 1979 growth slowed to 1.49 % / year .
Then , from 1979 to 1999 , it slowed yet further to a glacial 0.75 % / year .
Moving beyond the historic period , Forecast # 5 predicts that world oil production will reach its all - time peak in 2006 .
Then from its peak in 2006 to year 2040 world oil production will fall by 58.8 % - an average decline of 2.45 % / year during these 34 years .
The OPEC / non-OPEC crossover event is predicted to occur in 2008 ( Figure 1 , curves 2 & 3 ) .
This event will divide the world into two camps : one with surplus oil , the other with none .
Forecast # 5 presents the following scenario .
( 1 ) Beginning in 2008 the 11 OPEC nations will produce more than 50 % of the world 's oil .
( 2 ) Thereafter OPEC will control nearly 100 % of the world "s oil exports .
( 3 ) BP Amoco ( 2000 ) puts OPEC 's " proved reserves " at 77.6 % of the world total .
( 4 ) OPEC production from 1985 to 1999 grew at a strong average rate of 3.46 % / year .
In contrast , non-OPEC production grew at sluggish 0.37 % / year during this same 14 - year period .
The oil forecasting models , the application program to run them , and a User 's Guide are all available free at www.halcyon.com/duncanrc/. ( Duncan , 2000a )
The peak of world oil production ( 2006 ) and the OPEC / non -OPEC crossover event ( 2008 ) are important to the ' Olduvai schema ' , discussed later .
But first let 's have a look at the ratio of world oil production and world population .
Figure 2 shows the historic data .
Figure 2 . World Average Oil Production per Capita : 1920 - 1999
Notes : ( 1 ) World average oil production per capita ( ô ) grew exponentially from 1920 to 1973 .
( 2 ) Next , the average growth rate was near zero from 1973 to the all - time peak in 1979 .
( 3 ) Then from its peak in 1979 to 1999 , ô decreased strongly by an average of 1.20 % / year .
( 4 ) Typical response : " I did n't know that ! "
( 5 ) The little cartoons emphasize that oil is by far the major primary source of energy for transportation ( i.e. about 95 % of the oil produced in 1999 was used for transportation ) .
Figure 2 shows the world average oil production per capita from 1920 to 1999 .
The curve represents the ratio of world oil production ( O ) and world population ( Pop ) : i.e. ô = O / ( Pop ) in barrels per capita per year ( i.e. b / c/ year ) .
Note well that ô grew exponentially from 1920 to 1973 .
Next , growth was negligible from 1973 to the all - time peak in 1979 .
Finally , from its peak in 1979 to 1999 , ô decreased at an average rate of 1.20 % / year ( i.e. from 5.50 b/ c in 1979 to 4.32 b/ c in 1999 ) .
" You 've gotta be kidding ! "
The 1979 peak and decline of world oil production per capita are shown on page 11 of BP Amoco ( 2000 ) , www.bpamoco.com/worldenergy/.
Not to be missed .
Bottom Line : Although world oil production ( O ) from 1979 to 1999 increased at an average rate of 0.75 % / year ( Figure 1 ) , world population ( Pop ) grew even faster .
Thus world oil production per capita ( ô ) declined at an average rate of 1.20 % / year during the 20 years from 1979 to 1999 ( Figure 2 ) .
The main goals in this study , as was mentioned , are to describe , discuss , and test the Olduvai theory of Industrial Civilization against historic data .
Applying White 's Law , our metric ( i.e. indicator ) is the ratio of world total energy production ( E ) and world population ( Pop ) : i.e. ê = E / ( Pop ) .
Figure 3 shows ê during the historic period .
Figure 3 . World Energy Production per Capita : 1920 - 1999
Notes : ( 1 ) World average energy production per capita ( ê ) grew significantly from 1920 to its all - time peak in 1979 .
( 2 ) Then from its peak in 1979 to 1999 , ê declined at an average rate of 0.33 % / year .
This downward trend is the " Olduvai slope " , discussed later .
( 3 ) The tiny cartoons emphasize that the delivery of electricity to end - users is the sin quo non of the ' modern way of life ' .
Not hydrocarbons .
Observe the variability of ê in Figure 3 .
In detail : From 1920 to 1945 ê grew moderately at an average of 0.69 % / year .
Then from 1945 to 1973 it grew at the torrid pace of 3.45 % / year .
Next , from 1973 to the all - time peak in 1979 , growth slowed to 0.64 % / year .
But then suddenly - and for the first time in history - ê began a long - term decline extending from 1979 to 1999 .
This 20 - year period is named the " Olduvai slope , " the first of the three downside intervals in the " Olduvai schema . "
Bottom Line : Although world energy production ( E ) from 1979 to 1999 increased at an average rate of 1.34 % / year , world population ( Pop ) grew even faster .
Thus world energy production per capita ( ê ) declined at an average rate of 0.33 % / year during these same 20 years ( Figure 3 ) .
See White 's Law , top of this section .
Acknowledgments :
As far as I know , credit goes to Robert Romer ( 1985 ) for being first to publish the peak - period data for world energy production per capita ( ê ) from 1900 to 1983 .
He put the peak ( correctly ! ) in 1979 , followed by a sharp decline through 1983 , the last year of his data .
Credit is also due to John Gibbons , et al. ( 1989 ) for publishing a graph of ê from 1950 to 1985 .
Gibbons , et al. put the peak in 1973 .
But curiously , neither of the above studies made any mention whatever about the importance of the peak and decline of world energy production per capita .

3. Evolution of an Idea
And what a glorious society we would have if men and women would regulate their affairs , as do the millions of cells in the developing embryo .
Hans Spemann , 1938
The seeds of the Olduvai Theory were planted long ago .
For example , the Greek lyric poet Pindar ( c. 522-438 BCE ) wrote , " What course after nightfall ?
Has destiny written that we must run to the end ? " ( Eiseley , 1970 )
Arabic scholar Ibn Khaldun ( 1332-1406 ) regarded " group solidarity " as the primary requisite for civilization .
" Civilization needs the tribal values to survive , but these very same values are destroyed by civilization .
Specifically , urban civilization destroys tribal values with the luxuries that weaken kinship and community ties and with the artificial wants for new types of cuisine , new fashions in clothing , larger homes , and other novelties of urban life . "
( Weatherford , 1994 )
Joseph Granvill in 1665 observed that , although energy - using machines made life easier , they also made it more dependent .
" For example , if artificial demands are stimulated , than resources must be consumed at an ever - increasing pace . "
( Eiseley , 1970 )
But , as far as I know , it was the American adventurer and writer Washington Irving ( 1783 - 1859 ) who was first to realize that civilization could quickly collapse .
Nations are fast losing their nationality .
The great and increasing intercourse , the exchange of fashions and uniformity of opinions by the diffusion of literature are fast destroying those peculiarities that formerly prevailed .
We shall in time grow to be very much one people , unless a return to barbarism throws us again into chaos .
( Irving , 1822 )
The first statement that I 've found that Industrial Civilization is likely to collapse into a primitive mode came from the mathematical biologist Alfred Lotka .
The human species , considered in broad perspective , as a unit including its economic and industrial accessories , has swiftly and radically changed its character during the epoch in which our life has been laid .
In this sense we are far removed from equilibrium - a fact that is of the highest practical significance , since it implies that a period of adjustment to equilibrium conditions lies before us , and he would be an extreme optimist who should expect that such adjustment can be reached without labor and travail .
While such sudden decline might , from a detached standpoint , appear as in accord with the eternal equities , since previous gains would in cold terms balance the losses , yet it would be felt as a superlative catastrophe .
Our descendants , if such as this should be their fate , will see poor compensation for their ills and in fact that we did live in abundance and luxury .
( Lotka , 1925 )
Polymath Norbert Wiener ( 1894 -1964 ) wrote in 1950 that the best we can hope for the role of progress is that " our attempts to progress in the face of overwhelming necessity may have the purging terror of Greek tragedy . "
[ America 's ] resources seemed inexhaustible [ in 1500 ]
However , the existence of the new lands encouraged an attitude not unlike that of Alice 's Mad Tea party .
When the tea and cakes were exhausted at one seat , the natural thing was to move on and occupy the next seat .
As time passed , the tea table of the Americas had proved not to be inexhaustible
What many of us fail to realize is that the last four hundred years are a highly special period in the history of the world .
This is partly the result of increased communication , but also of an increased mastery of nature which , on a limited planet like the earth , may prove in the long run to be an increased slavery to nature .
( Wiener , 1950 )
Sir Charles Galton Darwin wrote in 1953 :
The fifth revolution will come when we have spent the stores of coal and oil that have been accumulating in the earth during hundreds of millions of years .
It is to be hoped that before then other sources of energy will have been developed , but without considering the detail [ here ] it is obvious that there will be a very great difference in ways of life .
Whether a convenient substitute for the present fuels is found or not , there can be no doubt that there will have to be a great change in ways of life .
This change may justly be called a revolution , but it differs from all the preceding ones in that there is no likelihood of its leading to increases of population , but even perhaps to the reverse .
( Darwin , 1953 )
Sir Fred Hoyle in 1964 put it bluntly .
It has often been said that , if the human species fails to make a go of it here on the Earth , some other species will take over the running .
In the sense of developing intelligence this is not correct .
We have or soon will have , exhausted the necessary physical prerequisites so far as this planet is concerned .
With coal gone , oil gone , high - grade metallic ores gone , no species however competent can make the long climb from primitive conditions to high - level technology .
This is a one - shot affair .
If we fail , this planetary system fails so far as intelligence is concerned .
The same will be true of other planetary systems .
On each of them there will be one chance , and one chance only .
( Hoyle , 1964 )
4. World Models , etc .
Perhaps the most widespread evil is the Western view of man and nature .
Among us , it is widely believed that man is apart from nature , superior to it ; indeed , evolution is a process to create man and seat him on the apex of the cosmic pinnacle .
He views the earth as a treasury that he can plunder at will .
And , indeed , the behavior of Western people , notably since the advent of the Industrial Revolution , gives incontrovertible evidence to support this assertion .
Ian McHarg , 1971
Jay Forrester of MIT in 1970 built a world model " to understand the options available to mankind as societies enter the transition from growth to equilibrium . "
What happens when growth approaches fixed limits and is forced to give way to some form of equilibrium ?
Are there choices before us that lead to alternative world futures ?
Exponential growth does not continue forever .
Growth of population and industrialization will stop .
If man does not take conscious action to limit population and capital investment , the forces inherent in the natural and social system will rise high enough to limit growth .
The question is only a matter of when and how growth will cease , not whether it will cease .
( Forrester , 1971 )
The basic behavior of Forrester 's world model was overshoot and collapse .
It projected that the material standard of living ( MSL ) would peak in 1990 and then decline through the year 2100 .
Moreover , measured by the MSL ( i.e. the leading and lagging 30 % points ) , the life expectancy of Industrial Civilization was about 210 years .
( Forrester , 1971 , Figure 4 - 2 ) .
He used the world model to search for social ( i.e. cultural , " conscious action " ) policies for making the transition to sustainability .
In our social systems , there are no utopias .
No sustainable modes of behavior are free of pressures and stresses .
But to develop the more promising modes will require restraint and dedication to a long - range future that man may not be capable of sustaining .
Our greatest challenge now is how to handle the transition from growth into equilibrium .
The industrial societies have behind them long traditions that have encouraged and rewarded growth .
The folklore and the success stories praise growth and expansion .
But that is not the path of the future .
( ibid. , 1971 )
He found that sustainability could be achieved in the modeled world system when the following five social policies were applied together in 1970 :
Natural - resource - usage - rate reduced 75 %
Pollution generation reduced 50 %
Capital - investment generation reduced 40 %
Food production reduced 20 %
Birth rate reduced 30 % ( ibid. , 1971 )
Critics ( mostly economists ) argued that such policies were e.g. " blue sky " and " unrealistic " .
Fortunately , the project team was just then completing a two - year study using the more comprehensive ' World3 ' model .
They too searched for social policies that might achieve sustainability in the world system .
However , the World3 ' reference run ' ( like Forrester 's in 1971 ) also projected overshoot and collapse of the world system .
This is the World3 reference run , .
Both population POP and industrial output per capita IOPC grow beyond sustainable levels and subsequently decline .
The cause of their decline is traceable to the depletion of nonrenewable resources .
( Meadows , et al , 1972 , Figure 35 )
The World3 ' reference run ' ( 1972 , above ) projected that the industrial output per capita ( IOPC ) would reach its all - time peak in 2013 and then would steeply decline through 2100 .
Moreover , the duration of Industrial Civilization ( as measured by the leading and lagging IOPC 30 % points ) came out to be about 105 years .
I first presented the Olduvai theory to the public in 1989 .
The broad sweep of human history can be divided into three phases .
The first , or pre-industrial phase was a very long period of equilibrium when simple tools and weak machines limited economic growth .
The second , or industrial phase was a very short period of non-equilibrium that ignited with explosive force when powerful new machines temporarily lifted all limits to growth .
The third , or de-industrial phase lies immediately ahead during which time the industrial economies will decline toward a new period of equilibrium , limited by the exhaustion of nonrenewable resources and continuing deterioration of the natural environment .
( Duncan , 1989 )
In 1992 , twenty years after the first World3 study , the team members re-calibrated the model with the latest data and used it to help " envision a sustainable future . "
But -
All that World3 has told us so far is that the model system , and by implication the " real world " system , has a strong tendency to overshoot and collapse .
In fact , in the thousands of model runs we have tried over the years , overshoot and collapse has been by far the most frequent outcome .
( Meadows , et al. , 1992 )
The updated World3 ' reference run ' , in fact , gave almost exactly the same results as it did in the first study in 1972 !
For example : Industrial output per capita ( IOPC ) reached its all - time peak in 2014 ( v. 2013 previously ) and the duration of Industrial Civilization came out to be 102 years ( v. 104 years previously ) .
Australian writer Reg Morrison likewise foresees that overshoot and collapse is where humanity is headed .
In his scenario ( i.e. no formal model ) , the world population rises to about 7.0 billion in the 2036 .
Thence it plunges to 3.2 billion in 2090 - an average loss of 71.4 million people per year ( i.e. deaths minus births ) during 54 years .
Given the current shape of the human population graph , those indicators also spell out a much larger and , from our point of view , more ominous message : the human plague cycle is right on track for a demographically normal climax and collapse .
Not only have our genes managed to conceal from us that we are entirely typical mammals and therefore vulnerable to all of evolution 's customary checks and balances , but also they have contrived to lock us so securely into the plague cycle that they seem almost to have been crafted for that purpose .
Gaia is running like a Swiss watch .
( Morrison , 1999 )
The foregoing discussions show that many respected professionals have reached conclusions that are consistent with the Olduvai theory , to which we now turn .
5. The Olduvai Theory : 1930 - 2030
The earth 's immune system , so to speak , has recognized the presence of the human species and is starting to kick in .
The earth is attempting to rid itself of an infection by the human parasite .
Richard Preston , 1994
The Olduvai theory , to review , states that the life expectancy of Industrial Civilization is less than or equal to one hundred years , as measured by the world average energy production person per year : ê = E / ( Pop ) .
Industrial Civilization , defined herein , began in 1930 and is predicted to end on or before the year 2030 .
Our main goals for this section are threefold : ( 1 ) to discuss the Olduvai theory from 1930 to 2030 , ( 2 ) to identify the important energy events during this time , and ( 3 ) to stress that Industrial Civilization = Electrical Civilization = the ' modern way of life . '
Figure 4 depicts the Olduvai theory .
Figure 4 . The Olduvai Theory : 1930 - 2030
Notes : ( 1 ) 1930 => Industrial Civilization began when ( ê ) reached 30 % of its peak value .
( 2 ) 1979 => ê reached its peak value of 11.15 boe / c. ( 3 ) 1999 =>
The end of cheap oil .
( 4 ) 2000 =>
Start of the " Jerusalem Jihad " .
( 5 ) 2006 =>
Predicted peak of world oil production ( Figure 1 , this paper ) .
( 6 ) 2008 =>
The OPEC crossover event ( Figure 1 ) .
( 7 ) 2012 =>
Permanent blackouts occur worldwide .
( 8 ) 2030 =>
Industrial Civilization ends when ê falls to its 1930 value .
( 9 ) Observe that there are three intervals of decline in the Olduvai schema : slope , slide and cliff - each steeper than the previous .
( 10 ) The small cartoons stress that electricity is the essential end - use energy for Industrial Civilization .
Figure 4 shows the complete Olduvai curve from 1930 to 2030 .
Historic data appears from 1930 to 1999 and hypothetical values from 2000 to 2030 .
These 100 years are labeled " Industrial Civilization . "
The curve and the events together constitute the " Olduvai schema . "
Observe that the overall curve has a pulse - like waveform - namely overshoot and collapse .
Eight key energy events define the Olduvai schema .
Eight Events : The 1st event in 1930 ( see Note 1 , Figure 4 ) marks the beginning of Industrial Civilization when ê reached 3.32 boe / c .
This is the " leading 30 % point " , a standard way to define the duration of a pulse .
The 2nd event in 1979 ( Note 2 ) marks the all - time peak of world energy production per capita when ê reached 11.15 boe / c .
The 3rd event in 1999 ( Note 3 ) marks the end of cheap oil .
The 4th event on September 28 , 2000 ( Note 4 ) marks the eruption of violence in the Middle East - i.e. the " Jerusalem Jihad " .
Moreover , the " JJ " marks the end of the Olduvai " slope " wherein ê declined at 0.33 % / year from 1979 to 1999 .
Next in Figure 4 we come the future intervals in the Olduvai schema .
The Olduvai " slide " , the first of the future intervals , begins in 2000 with the escalating warfare in the Middle East .
The 5th event in 2006 ( Note 5 ) marks the all - time peak of world oil production ( Figure 1 , this paper ) .
The 6th event in 2008 ( Note 6 ) marks the OPEC crossover event when the 11 OPEC nations produce 51 % of the world 's oil and control nearly 100 % of the world 's oil exports .
The year 2011 marks the end of the Olduvai slide , wherein ê declines at 0.67 % / year from 2000 to 2011 .
The " cliff " is the final interval in the Olduvai schema .
It begins with the 7th event in 2012 ( Note 7 ) when an epidemic of permanent blackouts spreads worldwide , i.e. first there are waves of brownouts and temporary blackouts , then finally the electric power networks themselves expire .
The 8th event in 2030 ( Note 8 ) marks the fall of world energy production ( use ) per capita to the 1930 level ( Figure 4 ) .
This is the lagging 30 % point when Industrial Civilization has become history .
The average rate of decline of ê is 5.44 % / year from 2012 to 2030 .
" The hand writes , then moves on . "
Decreasing electric reliability is now .
The power shortages in California and elsewhere are the product of the nation 's long economic boom , the increasing use of energy - guzzling computer devices , population growth and a slowdown in new power - plant construction amid the deregulation of the utility market .
As the shortages threaten to spread eastward over the next few years , more Americans may face a tradeoff they would rather not make in the long - running conflict between energy and the environment : whether to build more power plants or to contend with the economic headaches and inconveniences of inadequate power supplies .
( Carlton , 2000 )
The electricity business has also run out of almost all - existing generating capacity , whether this capacity is a coal - fired plant , a nuclear plant or a dam .
The electricity business has already responded to this shortage .
Orders for a massive number of natural gas - fired plants have already been placed .
But these new gas plants require an unbelievable amount of natural gas .
This immediate need for so much incremental supply is simply not there .
( Simmons , 2000 )
As we have emphasized , Industrial Civilization is beholden to electricity .
Namely : In 1999 , electricity supplied 42 % ( and counting ) of the world 's end - use energy versus 39 % for oil ( the leading fossil fuel ) .
Yet the small difference of 3 % obscures the real magnitude of the problem because it omits the quality of the different forms of end - use energy .
With apologies to George Orwell and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics - " All joules ( J ) of energy are equal .
But some joules are more equal than others . "
Thus , if you just want to heat your coffee , then 1 J of oil energy works just as well as 1 J of electrical energy .
However , if you want to power up your computer , then 1 J of electricity is worth 3 J of oil .
Therefore , the ratio of the importance of electricity versus oil to Industrial Civilization is not 42:39 , but more like 99:1 .
Similar ratios apply to electricity versus gas and electricity versus coal .
Au Courant King Kilowatt !
Question :
Where will the Olduvai die - off occur ?
Response : Everywhere .
But large cities , of course , will be the most dangerous places to reside when the electric grids die .
There you have millions of people densely packed in high - rise buildings , surrounded by acres - and - acres of blacktop and concrete : no electricity , no work , and no food .
Thus the urban areas will rapidly depopulate when the electric grids die .
In fact we have already mapped out the danger zones .
( e.g. See Living Earth , 1996 . )
Specifically :
The big cities stand out brightly as yellow - orange dots on NASA 's satellite mosaics ( i.e. pictures ) of the earth at night .
These planetary lights blare out " Beware " , " Warning " , and " Danger " .
The likes of Los Angeles and New York , London and Paris , Bombay and Hong Kong are all unsustainable hot spots .
6. Summary and Conclusions
The theory of civilization is traced from Greek philosophy in about 500 BCE to a host of respected scientists in the 20th century .
For example :
The ' reference runs ' of two world simulation models in the 1970s put the life expectancy of civilization between about 100 and 200 years .
The Olduvai theory is specifically defined as the ratio of world energy production and world population .
It states that the life expectancy of Industrial Civilization is less than or equal to 100 years : from 1930 to 2030 .
The theory is tested against historic data from 1920 to 1999 .
Although all primary sources of energy are important , the Olduvai theory postulates that electricity is the quintessence of Industrial Civilization .
World energy production per capita increased strongly from 1945 to its all - time peak in 1979 .
Then from 1979 to 1999 - for the first time in history - it decreased from 1979 to 1999 at a rate of 0.33 % / year ( the Olduvai ' slope ' , Figure 4 ) .
Next from 2000 to 2011 , according to the Olduvai schema , world energy production per capita will decrease by about 0.70 % / year ( the ' slide ' ) .
Then around year 2012 there will be a rash of permanent electrical blackouts - worldwide .
These blackouts , along with other factors , will cause energy production per capita by 2030 to fall to 3.32 b/ year , the same value it had in 1930 .
The rate of decline from 2012 to 2030 is 5.44 % / year ( the Olduvai ' cliff ' ) .
Thus , by definition , the duration of Industrial Civilization is less than or equal to 100 years .
The Olduvai ' slide ' from 2001 to 2011 ( Figure 4 ) may resemble the " Great Depression " of 1929 to 1939 : unemployment , breadlines , and homelessness .
As for the Olduvai ' cliff ' from 2012 to 2030 - I know of no precedent in human history .
Governments have lost respect .
World organizations are ineffective .
Neo-tribalism is rampant .
The population is over six billion and counting .
Global warming and emerging viruses are headlines .
The reliability of electric power networks is falling .
And the instant the power goes out , you are back in the Dark Age .
In 1979 I concluded , " If God made the earth for human habitation , then He made it for the Stone Age mode of habitation . "

USING THE HIGGS FIELD , SCIENTISTS THEORIZE IT IS POSSIBLE TO CAUSE A 'BABY UNIVERSE ' TO BREAK OFF FROM OUR OWN , SAFELY
2 August 2006
A radical new project could permit human beings to create a " baby universe " in a laboratory in Japan .
While it sounds like a dangerous undertaking , the physicists involved believe that if the project is successful , the space - time around a tiny point within our universe will be distorted in such a way that it will begin to form a new superfluid space , and eventually break off , separate in all respects from our experience of space and time , causing no harm to the fabric of our universe .
The project takes as its starting point two basic theories about the foundations of our universe : the big bang and inflation theory .
The big bang theory , as many readers are well aware , observes that all objects in the known universe appear to be moving away from one another , suggesting that the universe was jump - started when all matter and energy were concentrated in an inconceivably tiny space , allowing them to overcome binding forces and causing a cosmic explosion .
It is well - tested and consistent with all currently accepted models for general cosmology , as tested against advanced theoretical and observational physics .
But it is only one piece of the puzzle .
Inflation is a key theory , developed in 1981 , when MIT physicist Alan Guth observed that there appeared to have been a period immediately following the big bang when the universe " inflated " rapidly , allowing distinct regions of matter and energy to function comfortably free from any forces that might cause them to collapse against each other or disrupt each other 's evolution .
This project is not exactly theoretical physics at work .
It is closer to a physical application of observed phenomena , in combination , with the aim of achieving an as yet untested physical effect .
Inflation theory helps provide the means of understanding how that effect might be brought about .
As reported by the New Scientist : " Inflation theory , subsequently modified by Linde , relies on the fact that the ' vacuum ' of empty space - time is not a boring , static place .
Instead , it is subject to quantum fluctuations that cause strange bubbles to appear at random times .
These bubbles of ' false vacuum ' contain space - time with different — and very curious — properties . "
The space - time inside these false vacuums is organized and kept constant by a phenomenon known as the ' Higgs field ' .
It is believed that with the constant provided by the Higgs field , these bubbles of ' false vacuum ' can be induced to withstand contact with the high pressure exterior vacuum and subsequently to expand through a kind of cosmic inflation like the one which followed the big bang at the beginning of our universe .
The key is a monopole , a unique sperical particle with only a north or south pole , only one charge .
Adding mass and energy to this already extremely dense particle , could cause it to expand " eternally " , providing the trigger needed to make the bubble of false vacuum into an ever - expanding universe , akin to our own , but entirely separate and likely to develop its own physical properties , laws and materials .
Here is the key to the " new universe " paradigm for the project .
It would not be simply an extension of our own universe , a space where strange things happen .
The New Scientist reports physicist Nobuyuki Sakai 's discoveries regarding this process as follows :
" [ T ] he baby universe has its own space - time and , as this inflates , the pressure from the true vacuum outside its walls continues to constrain it .
As these forces compete , the growing baby universe is forced to bubble out from our space - time until its only connection to us is through a narrow space - time tunnel called a wormhole ... "
Eventually , the " umbilical " connection between our space - time and the baby universe would be effectively cut , and the baby universe would enter into its own unique process of unending expansion .
From our perspective , it would be lost inside a microscopic " black hole " , which will not appear to expand into our space - time .
Hawking radiation will be emitted and the tiny black hole will " evaporate " , sealing the separation between the two universes .
Ultimately , this evaporation is what makes the project possible , but is also , perhaps , its most serious obstacle .
It is expected that the separation between our space - time and the baby universe would occur so quickly , it might be impossible — within the limitations of our physical universe — to observe its having been created . [ s ]

IS OUR UNIVERSE " ONE BUBBLE FLOATING IN A SEA OF OTHER BUBBLES " ?
19 July 2006
The ' universe ' we know as all - encompassing , the vague , probably never to be finally defined concept of the structure of physical reality , may actually be one of many such distinct self - contained , self - sustaining phenomena , with distinct physical properties and corresponding physical laws and tendencies , unified membrane cosmologies adrift in a ' superfluid ' soup , at times colliding with incredible energy diffusion , creating whole new universes .

The global environment is , of course , a global issue , one that touches every life on the planet , and the science about it should be open and available to all .
Past government policy and existing federal law mean that such scientific evidence should be readily available to the public .
But now , it appears that several agencies are laboring to silence scientists who are researching climate trends and alterations .

SCIENCE SAYS EVOLUTION WORKS
3 February 2006
The journal Science , in selecting its breakthrough of the year , decided to feature a series of scientific advances demonstrating how evolution works .
At the end of a year that has seen a growing marginal movement in the US to displace evolution as mere conjecture in favor of the untested , religiously based " intelligent design " argument , Science intends to proactively defend science , as such .

The juvenile specimen is wonderfully preserved
The female Australopithecus afarensis bones are from the same species as an adult skeleton found in 1974 which was nicknamed " Lucy " .
Scientists are thrilled with the find , reported in the journal Nature .
They believe the near - complete remains offer a remarkable opportunity to study growth and development in an important extinct human ancestor .
Juvenile Australopithecus afarensis remains are vanishingly rare .
The skeleton was first identified in 2000 , locked inside a block of sandstone .
It has taken five years of painstaking work to free the bones .
" The Dikika fossil is now revealing many secrets about Australopithecus afarensis and other early hominins , because the fossil evidence was not there , " said dig leader Zeresenay Alemseged , of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
Delicate bones
The find consists of the whole skull , the entire torso and important parts of the upper and lower limbs .
CT scans reveal unerupted teeth still in the jaw , a detail that makes scientists think the individual may have been about three years old when she died .
This puts afarensis in a special position to play a pivotal role in the story of what we are and where we come from
Zeresenay Alemseged , Max Planck Institute
Judging by how well it was preserved , the skeleton may have come from a body that was quickly buried by sediment in a flood , the researchers said .
" In my opinion , afarensis is a very good transitional species for what was before four million years ago and what came after three million years , " Dr Alemseged told BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh .
" [ The species had ] a mixture of ape - like and human - like features .
This puts afarensis in a special position to play a pivotal role in the story of what we are and where we come from . "
Climbing ability
This early ancestor possessed primitive teeth and a small brain but it stood upright and walked on two feet .
There is considerable argument about whether the Dikika girl could also climb trees like an ape .
The lower limbs show the Dikika girl could walk upright
But the question is whether such features indicate climbing ability or are just " evolutionary baggage " .
The Dikika girl had an estimated brain size of 330 cubic centimetres when she died , which is not very different from that of a similarly aged chimpanzee .
However , when compared to the adult afarensis values , it forms 63 - 88 % of the adult brain size .
This is lower than that of an adult chimp , where by the age of three , over 90 % of the brain is formed .
This relatively slow brain growth in the Dikika girl appears to be slightly closer to that of humans .
Slow , gradual development in an extended childhood is regarded as a very human trait - probably to enable our higher functions to develop .
Professor Fred Spoor of University College London said the find would give scientists a " detailed insight into how our distant relatives grew up and behaved ... at a time of human evolution when they looked a good deal more like bipedal chimpanzees than like us . "
Dr Jonathan Wynn of the University of St Andrews , UK , and colleagues at the University of South Florida dated the sediments surrounding the remains and came up with an age of 3.3 million years .
The " Lucy " skeleton , discovered in Hadar , Ethiopia , in 1974 belongs to the same species as the Dikika girl .
For more than 20 years it was the oldest human ancestor known to science .

I can see it coming in handy during the holidays ... and getting a good , solid shakedown at the same time .
People will be clamoring for coupon codes to do their online holiday shopping ; and I wonder how it 'll pan out .
I do echo fanboy 's concerns though .
I 've seen sites like http://www.dealcoupon.com/
that do the same thing except without the benefit of user - submission , and they do a good job with keeping up to date on the expiration and validity of the coupons and deals they track .
But at the same time , the folks at the dealnews / dealmac / dealram / dealcoupon sites all work at least part time running those sites and managing its content , while this is totally community reliant .

EE UU ofrecerá " asistencia prioritaria a un Gobierno cubano de transición que organice elecciones multipartidarias libres e imparciales " después de la muerte de Fidel Castro , que cumple 80 años en agosto .
Mientras , se dedicarán 80 millones de dólares ( 63 millones de euros ) en los dos próximos años a " apoyar a los cubanos que quieren el cambio " .
Pese a que el embargo ha dado escasos resultados , " se mejorará la aplicación de las sanciones para mantener la presión económica sobre el régimen y limitar su capacidad de mantenerse en el poder y reprimir a los cubanos " .
El informe de la Comisión para la Asistencia a una Cuba Libre , demuestra , según el presidente , George W. Bush , que Estados Unidos " está trabajando activamente a favor del cambio en Cuba , no simplemente esperando " .
El presidente Bush celebró el trabajo de la Comisión que copresiden la secretaria de Estado , Condoleezza Rice , y el secretario de Comercio , Carlos Gutiérrez , y llamó a " aliados y amigos a unirse en el apoyo a la libertad para el pueblo cubano " .
El informe - que tiene 90 páginas de recomendaciones y propuestas - arranca proponiendo " una transición , no una sucesión " en Cuba .
Para acelerarla , se sugiere " dar más medios a los cubanos para robustecer la sociedad civil , romper el bloqueo informativo impuesto por el régimen , desarrollar una estrategia diplomática contra la sucesión e impedir que el régimen use su fuerza represiva contra el cambio " .
Los 80 millones de dólares ( 63 millones de euros ) en los dos próximos años -y 20 millones de dólares anuales después - se dedicarán a proporcionar " información no censurada a través de emisiones convencionales y vía satélite e Internet , y a reforzar los movimientos democráticos " para " sostener el impulso creado por los propios cubanos para lograr un auténtico cambio democrático en su país " .
El papel de Chávez
Para contrarrestar el proyecto de sucesión de Fidel Castro -" pasar el poder a su hermano Raúl y a la élite que le rodea " - , el régimen venezolano , dice el informe , jugará un papel vital .
Pero " el flanco débil del eje Cuba - Venezuela es la propia Cuba " , según el documento , porque , a diferencia del presidente Hugo Chávez " el régimen de Castro no tiene legitimidad electoral " .
El informe -el segundo de la Comisión - está acompañado por una declaración llamada Compromiso con los cubanos , en la que se envía el mensaje de que " pueden contar con la amistad y la ayuda concreta del Gobierno de Estados Unidos en el proceso hacia una transición democrática , incluyendo ayuda humanitaria y asistencia para la recuperación económica y para la celebración de elecciones libres " .
Esta ayuda incluiría el envío inmediato de agua , comida , combustible y equipos médicos ; mejora del funcionamiento de la red de energía eléctrica ; y reconstrucción de la economía y fomento de la asistencia de otros países , asociaciones y empresas privadas .
' Listas de esbirros '
Aunque se rechaza que deba haber una caza de brujas , se recomienda la elaboración de listas de esbirros con los violadores de derechos humanos y los organizadores de los actos de repudio contra la oposición .
Para Caleb McCarry , coordinador encargado de Cuba en el Departamento de Estado , las señales que indicarán que hay una transición son " la libertad de los presos políticos , la convocatoria de elecciones libres y el seguimiento de propuestas democráticas emanadas del pueblo " .
" Esto va dirigido a varios públicos " , analiza Eusebio Mujal - León , profesor de la Universidad de Georgetown : " A los cubanos de Estados Unidos , a los de Cuba , a las élites cubanas , a los países europeos y latinoamericanos ... y en cada uno tiene un impacto diferente y abre una perspectiva distinta " .
Con este documento y el anterior , añade , " Estados Unidos trata de demostrar que tiene cosas que decir sobre el futuro de la democracia en Cuba " ; " el gran tema es cómo Washington lidia con el nacionalismo cubano y da señales de confianza para que la gente vea que aunque haya un cambio político , no tiene por qué haber una ruptura social " .
Okay , okay , okay .
Since many of my dear readers are clamoring to hear my stories of entrepreneurial intrigue , adventure , and discovery , I will tell them .
Be forewarned that given the blog format , which goes against how we traditionally read stuff , it will be somewhat of a challenge to tell stories in installments .
I ’ll try to break them up into bite - sized portions that can stand on their own .
We ’ll see how I fare .
So buckle your seat belts , here we go :
Once upon a time ( actually it was 1979 ) I moved to Fairfield , Iowa from the east coast where I had been teaching Transcendental Meditation .
I relocated because I wanted to participate in the advanced meditation programs that were being offered at the then - named Maharishi International University .
( The university ’s name has since been changed to Maharishi University of Management . )
Teaching TM was my livelihood , however being a TM teacher in Fairfield was like being a Toyota in Tokyo .
Several hundred TM teachers lived there .
And , on the other side of the coin , it being rural Iowa where hogs out - numbered humans , there were very few humans to teach .
( Plenty of pigs but I did n’t speak Snort . )
Basically it meant I needed to find a new way of supporting myself .
The thought of getting a job never fluctuated a single brain neuron .
In the past , I responded to jobs and work in the exact same way a cat responds when you try to put it in water .
I ’d run out screaming , usually in a matter of days , and that ’s assuming I was n’t fired first .
My resume has gaping chasms of time between a couple of weeks of employment here and there .*
To give you some idea of how work - adverse I am , I was even fired from a civil service job .
So , unless I wanted to starve , there was only one viable choice for me – become an entrepreneur .
( The definition of an entrepreneur – someone who will do absolutely anything to avoid getting a job . )
I had no business experience .
I had no knowledge .
I had no skills .
I had no education .
( I was an art major in college . )
I had no money .
I had no direction .
And I had no clue .
We ’ve all heard the expression that the key to a successful business is to find a need and fill it .
The need I noticed was strictly personal .
Having come from the east coast where there was great ice cream , I could n’t find anything comparable in Iowa .
In fact , the ice cream in Iowa was hideous .
I called it cow snot .
As much as I loved TM , the thought of living anywhere without great ice cream was simply intolerable .
If I wanted to stay in Iowa I knew I had to fix that problem .
This is a good place to stop for today .
Tomorrow , or whenever I get around to it , I ’ll write Act 1 Scene 2 .
*( By the way , my record for holding a job is two months .
That ’s when I was a lifeguard at a private beach on the Jersey shore .
Every day I ’d arrive late , sleep , read , sun - bathe , body - surf , hustle girls for lunch , and leave early .
Since it was a private beach , not many of the rich people ever went in the ocean so I never really had to stay alert .
Plus I got enough tips beyond my salary to pay my college tuition . )

Holiday tipping is an exacerbated exercise in misery for those already ambivalent about their doorman .
And for others , the need to make conversation is so annoying that it alone is enough to drive them into nondoormen buildings .
" I had one young guy who moved from a fancy condo doorman building in California where he had a very cheery doorman , " said Hy Rosen , a senior vice president at Bellmarc Realty .
" He wanted a building without a doorman , and his biggest reason seemed to be he did n't want to have to say hello to someone twice a day . "
Michele Golden , another broker for Bellmarc , lived in two luxury buildings before buying a Chelsea loft that came with just a full - time superintendent .
She does n't miss the constant socializing , which she found cloying .
" It 's like a really good restaurant -- the lower key the service , the more I like it , " she said .
" When they 're fawning all over me , I 'm not enjoying that .
I do n't want service to be intrusive in my life . "
According to the conventional wisdom , doormen make buildings safer .
Many people believe that to go without is practically an invitation to being menaced -- or even dispatched -- on one 's very doorstep .
And is n't it a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman would sooner give up her colorist than her doorman ?
Sort of , said Edward Herson , a vice president at Halstead Property .
" If they come in from out of town , from anywhere west of the Hudson River , they definitely want a doorman , " he said .
But once they live here for a while , " if they are price conscious they want to give it up , because they feel safer in the city . "
In fact , " Doormen " reports that while doormen and residents emphatically cite security as a major benefit , few could recall any security incidents at their buildings .
( Of course , as the book points out , it is possible that the mere presence of a doorman deters miscreants before trouble breaks out . )
Able defenders or not , doormen add as much as 10 to 15 percent to the value of an apartment , according to Miller Samuel , a Manhattan appraisal firm .
But the annual cost -- around $ 80,000 per doorman ( $ 37,315 in salary , plus overtime , benefits , training and other expenses ) , according to the Service Employees International Union Local 32 BJ -- can put a disproportionate burden on smaller buildings , which have fewer units to share the expense .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 3 - Representative Tom DeLay asked the lobbyist Jack Abramoff to raise money for him through a private charity controlled by Mr. Abramoff , an unusual request that led the lobbyist to try to gather at least $ 150,000 from his Indian tribe clients and their gambling operations , according to newly disclosed e-mail from the lobbyist 's files .
The electronic messages from 2002 , which refer to " Tom " and " Tom 's requests , " appear to be the clearest evidence to date of an effort by Mr. DeLay , a Texas Republican , to pressure Mr. Abramoff and his lobbying partners to raise money for him .
The e-mail messages do not specify why Mr. DeLay wanted the money , how it was to be used or why he would want money raised through the auspices of a private charity .
" Did you get the message from the guys that Tom wants us to raise some bucks from Capital Athletic Foundation ? "
Mr. Abramoff asked a colleague in a message on June 6 , 2002 , referring to the charity .
" I have six clients in for $ 25 K .
I recommend we hit everyone who cares about Tom 's requests .
I have another few to hit still . "
The e-mail was addressed to Tony Rudy , who had been Mr. DeLay 's chief of staff in the House before joining Mr. Abramoff 's lobbying firm .
Mr. Abramoff said it would be good " if we can do $ 200 K " for Mr. DeLay .
Established in 2001 , Newegg has quickly become a household name among AnandTech readers .
They originally won the hearts of many readers by offering extremely competitive prices and keeping customer service a top priority .
Since their humble beginnings the company has grown tremendously , with net sales in 2005 of approximately $ 1.3 billion , a 30 % increase over the prior year .
Newegg currently stocks over 60,000 different products and ships up to 25,000 orders per day , 98 % of them within 24 hours .
On a recent trip to Los Angeles we were given the opportunity to take a tour of one of Newegg 's warehouses .
While we 've been able to tour Newegg 's facilities in the past , this time they let us publish pictures and take you on a virtual tour of their facilities - effectively letting us follow the path of an order after it is placed online .
Newegg sweetened the deal even more by working with us to give away some of their product to you all , but more on that later .

Hamas has made a major political climbdown by agreeing to sections of a document that recognise Israel 's right to exist and a negotiated two - state solution , according to Palestinian leaders .
In a bitter struggle for power , Hamas is bowing to an ultimatum from the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , to endorse the document drawn up by Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails , or face a national referendum on the issue that could see the Islamist group stripped of power if it loses .
But final agreement on the paper , designed to end international sanctions against the Hamas government that have crippled the Palestinian economy , has been slowed by wrangling over a national unity administration and the question of who speaks for the Palestinians .
Yasser Abed Rabbo , a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation 's executive committee and a lead negotiator on the prisoners ' document , said Hamas had agreed to sections which call for a negotiated and final agreement with Israel to establish a Palestinian state on the territories occupied in 1967 , including East Jerusalem .
" Hamas is prepared to accept those parts of the document because they think it is a way to get rid of a lot of its problems with the international community .
That 's why it will accept all the document eventually , " he said .
Hamas , facing a deep internal split over recognition of the Jewish state , declined to discuss the negotiations in detail .
If it formally approves the entire document , it will represent a significant shift from its founding goal of replacing Israel with an Islamic state and its more recent position of agreeing a long - term ceasefire , over a generation or more , if a Palestinian state is formed on the occupied territories but without formally recognising the Jewish state .
Mr Abed Rabbo said he expected an agreement in the coming days , but that important differences still had to be settled , particularly over the document 's call for the formation of a national unity government .
He described that as " the major issue that will determine the fate of two nations for decades " because a unity administration , built around a common policy of negotiations with Israel , would be the only way to combat its plans to unilaterally impose its final borders and annex parts of the occupied territories .
More immediately , this was also the only way to restore foreign aid .
But Mr Abed Rabbo added it would be a mistake to see the approval of the prisoners ' document as sufficient , in itself , to end international sanctions against the Palestinian Authority .
" The document calls for the foundation of a national unity government as the basis of a new programme that will approach the world , " he said .
" But the document is part of a package .
It should be accompanied by an agreement on policies for a new government .
The document wo n't change conditions and relations on its own . "
Mr Abed Rabbo said the July 26 referendum would be called off if there was agreement on the document , but that a ballot could be held later if Hamas blocked the formation of a new government or failed to agree on a negotiations policy .
Abdullah Abdullah , a Fatah MP and chairman of the parliamentary political committee , said other differences remained over the document , including Fatah 's insistence that the PLO continues to be recognised as the sole representative of the Palestinian people in negotiations with Israel , and that all existing agreements between the PLO and Israel be recognised .
Israel has dismissed the prisoners ' document as changing little because , among other things , it advocates continued resistance .
But a complete renunciation of violence is unlikely to come while Israeli attacks continue to claim the lives of innocent Palestinians .
Yesterday , a women was killed and six children injured in an Israeli missile attack in Gaza .
On Tuesday , an Israeli air force rocket killed three children , two boys aged five and 16 , and a seven - year - old girl .
In both cases , Israel said it was targeting militants who escaped injury .
Israel has killed 13 civilians , most of them children , in four air strikes this month .
It is also probably responsible for the killing of a family of seven during a shell barrage against a Gaza beach two weeks ago .
Confirming what the Beatles always knew , astronomers have actually found a diamond in the sky - directly above Australia .
It is the biggest known diamond in the universe , in fact .
According to American astronomers at the Harvard - Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics , a white dwarf star in the constellation of Centaurus , next to the Southern Cross , has been found to have a 3000 - kilometre - wide core of crystallised carbon , or diamond .
It weighs 2.27 thousand trillion trillion tonnes - that 's 10 billion trillion trillion carats , or a 1 followed by 34 zeroes .
The biggest earthly jewel is one of the British crown jewels , the 530 - carat Star of Africa .

Even still I am oddly obsessive about using words correctly .
I wo n't even use the word if I think I could be wrong .
Your tip for proper use of these two words is perfect for me !
I believe it 's actually the first I 've read that I fully understood .
I love words and so I greatly appreciate this information !
I can't wait to confidently use ' whom ' in conversation now since I 've always avoided it or unfortunately spoken incorrectly .
MaxGax on October 24 , 2011 :
Your sentence sounds like a poor translation from German .
You can't simply have " the " all on its own .
Here are some alternatives .
The person from whom I sought help has let me down .
The person whose help I was seeking has let me down .
The person who I was hoping would help me has let me down .
sharon on October 23 , 2011 :
Please check if this sentence is grammatically correct .
Checking to see if whom is used correctly .
The from whom I looked for help has failed me .
Lisa on September 24 , 2011 :
My little girl said " I made him " talking about a girl .
She is 3 years when will she use the correct terminology - her ?
Elizabeth on August 22 , 2011 :
What about when to use " who " or " and who " ?
MaxGax on March 18 , 2011 :
In the interesting example " The person who I thought was the senator turned out to be a television newscaster . " " who " is actually the subject of " was the senator " .
The verb " think " is a verb of interpolation .
You can prove this with the sentence " The person whom I held to be the senator turned out to be a television newscaster . "
im so confused ! on March 01 , 2011 :
help me i do n't get it at all !
rubigenous on February 12 , 2011 :
Oh , so sad that it 's ( it has ) been published here for almost 2 years without correction .
' Jerry ' noted : " My gosh !
" It 's " means it is or its was !
" Its " is the possessive case . "
Jerry !
Please note that the apostrophe version is a contraction of ' it is ' or ' it has ' , not ' it was ' .
Or , as I like to tell people :
It 's " it 's " when it is n't " its " . :-)

Hi
I like grammar
Fred on January 10 , 2011 :
Hi Ralph .
you are so wrong about your comment regarding Spanish " No hay que ensenar orthographia en las escuelas ... "
Let me tell you that I studied Spanish grammar since grade 3 until grade 11 ( 9 years ) , and believe me that many people never learned it .
Spanish is not different than in English in terms of grammar and it is not as easy as many people think .
I would say that for Spanish speakers English pronunciation is more difficult than English grammar , and for English speakers learning Spanish is the opposite : easier to pronounce , more difficult in terms of grammar .
Mr. Fastidious on December 11 , 2010 :
Is n't " Who am I ? " kind of like a predicate nominative rather than an accusative ?
And if StuartJ still thinks " her hit he " is ever going to find its way into everyday conversation through usage , after 4 years of reflection on the matter , I 'm going to get on his case .
Mr. Fastidious on December 11 , 2010 :
Tell Ralph that " ph " changes to " f " for Spanish spelling and that the names of languages are not capitalized .
We are finally catching up to the European languages in our use of " there 's " for both singular and plural , at least in spoken language .
In French , German and Spanish there 's only one word or expression .
" There are " must be too long or cumbersome and therefore " there 's " is more efficient .
As for the ' who vs whom ' rule , it seems very stilted if we use whom to replace a direct object , as in " Whom do you love ? "
However , it just sounds intelligent to say , " To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ? " instead of , " Whom am I speaking to ? "
Besides , a preposition is something we should never end a sentence with .
As for Bo Diddly , he did n't know or care diddly about grammar , but whom cares ?
cuong & ny on September 09 , 2010 :
as was asked before , is this question correct : " who did you vote for ? "
Jose M. Blanco on July 23 , 2010 :
Michelle , it seems extreme , a bit too " descriptivist " for my tastes , to say that " English is really whatever is commonly used . "
Over the long run , yes .
But in practical terms , teachers , editors , etc. must serve work as a conservative , " prescriptivist " force in language .
Steff on July 22 , 2010 :
Please , no " s " on the word anyway .
Since when is it " anyway " ?
It 's never anywhos , anyhows ??
Michelle on July 04 , 2010 :
To correct anub ( sorry ) -
If you are going by the he / him rule , it would be ' Whom am I ? ' , as ' whom ' is replacing ' me ' ( both in accusative case - object ) .
HOWEVER , Lydia , you have brought up a good point - ' Whom am I ? ' sounds odd .
And it is odd .
It is therefore ungrammatical .
Along with the fact that so many native English speakers have to ask how to use it , this shows that it is not a natural , instinctive part of the grammar .
In fact it is governed by something called a ' Grammatical Virus ' - something extra to the grammar that we are told to say , but for which the rules do n't always work .
There is a good article on this called " The who / whom puzzle " for any linguists .
Also , it is interesting that there were no replies by the author to the very relevant points that English is really whatever is commonly used .
Furthermore , in most situations ' who ' can be used equally well as ' whom ' , so you really do n't need to bother with it .
I do personally find it annoying though when I see ' whom ' used in the wrong context , so fair enough .
anub on June 26 , 2010 :
@ Lydia , I think ...:
I am myself .
' myself ' , in this case , is the object .
Pretend the object is me instead .
I am me .
Who am I ?
I am me .
I is a pronoun , like him and her .
To answer ' Whom am I ? ' , you would say ' I am I ' .
In this case , I 'm using the second I as an object ( incorrect ) because that is our strategy in choosing between who & whom ( using the pronouns him / her ) .
Anyway , ' I am I ' would n't work , so ' Who am I ? ' is the correct way to ask whom you are .
;D
anub on June 26 , 2010 :
" Who is the newscaster ? "
He is the newscaster .
" Whom is the newscaster ? "
The newscaster is him .
I know the latter is wrong , but I always confuse them anyway , because I make the question / answer backwards ...
Could you help ?
x3
Lydia on December 01 , 2009 :
What about a question like , " who am I ? "
That confuses me .
Could it be , " whom am I ? " I do n't think so but , I 'm not too sure .
Ann on July 21 , 2009 :
From a fellow kiwi .
I have just happened upon this site & immediately picked up on Jerry 's post of 5 months ago ( 3 posts back ) , & had to agree with him .
But I reckon you knew that already .
I know that often in haste , mistakes slip in , do n't they ?
I do it all the time , and I 'm sure I have made heaps of grammatical & other errors in this post alone and will see them after I have clicked ' post comment ' .
I 'm not an English teacher so do n't really care , but still like to know basics so that I can help my children & grandchildren .
See ya .
Heath on April 16 , 2009 :
How would you use the substitution in this case :
Could you forward me the contact information of the attorney , whom you mentioned , might be able to offer pro bono legal services ?
Tiffany , the commas around ' whom you mentioned ' are needless - and ' whom can be left out entirely :
Could you forward me the contact information of the attorney you mentioned might be able to offer pro bono legal services ?
harsha on April 03 , 2009 :
Good Article Robin .
Hits the point directly .

Jerry on February 18 , 2009 :
The top post says :
That trick seems a bit simplified to me .
What about an example like this one : " Assign that task to Whomever / Whoever is available . "
Here the correct answer is " whoever " because it's not the pronoun 's role in the sentence as a whole that matters , but it 's role in it 's own clause .
So " whoever " here is the subject of " is " .
My gosh !
" It 's " means it is or its was !
" Its " is the possessive case .

Hi Robin .
I just wandered back here to brush up on my who or whom usage .
I need a reminder now and then .

I 'm looking for clarification in the following sentence .
" She sees the parent and their children for who she knows them to be , not by who they are being . "
Dan on December 23 , 2008 :
A big thanks for the who / whom trick .
I have referenced numerous grammar texts on this subject , but found that the level of detail in such reference manuals was impeding my ability to comprehend the actual rules regarding the usage of who vs whom .
Thanks to this hub , I can now properly use who / whom in my entrance essay that is a required portion of my application to graduate school .
Who would 've thunked it ? ( or is it whom would have thunked it ??? )
Well , back to the hub for further study ....

One of the most frequent mistakes .
I still have trouble with it after looking it up many times !
William F Torpey from South Valley Stream , N.Y. on April 10 , 2008 :
Thanks for the cute who / whom trick .
I always have trouble with these tricky English constructions even after I look them up in a reference book -- or now on the computer .
I do n't know about you , but speaking grammatically correct English often sounds stilted when I 'm speaking to my friends and " associates " ( an example of stilted language . )
In my opinion , changes in language must be made over a relatively long period of time if we expect to communicate effectively .
Dennis Clark on April 02 , 2008 :
I rarely see the word " enable " used these days .

CMH on March 13 , 2008 :
Robin ,
What about when the subject is plural rather than singular ?
Example : They supported the fundraiser .
So would the correct conversion to who / whom be , " who supported the fundraiser ? "
How dies that work ?
Any tips would be helpful .
Thanks for your site .

Raj on February 13 , 2008 :
In response to the reality that the proper use of grammar is declining to the point of blurring the distinctions , I can't help but quote Churchill :
" That is something up with which I will not put ! "
Alec on January 08 , 2008 :
Lori ,
It 's the second one .
" He had been previously uncommunicative . "
You are replacing the who with he , not client liasons with him .
lori on January 07 , 2008 :
Maby I am making this more difficult than it really is but it the following sentence :
I Advanced communications with client liaisons who had previously been uncommunicative .
Would the question be :
" I advanced communications with him ? "
- OR -
" He had been previously uncommunicative ? "
in order to figure out if who or whom should be used ?
It is critical that I get this correct , as I am using this sentence in my resume !
Ashok Rajagopalan from Chennai on December 24 , 2007 :
I think , ' Whom does that refer to ? ' or ' To whom does that refer ? ' are both right .
But you have to say ' whom ' not ' who . '
Andy on December 23 , 2007 :
Would it be incorrect to say , " Who is that referring to ? " or do you need always have to say , " To whom is that referring ? " ?
Jordan Q on December 06 , 2007 :
Actually , StuartJ , " Her hit he " means that the boy hit the girl .
Since we have these cases , it means we are free to change word order around in poetry and what have you .
Of course , such flipping of the usual syntax is rare , but , even in modern English , " Her hit he " and " He hit her " do mean the same thing , not different things .
And of course , even in modern English , " Her hit he " and " She hit him " do really mean different things .
In the latter , as we would agree , the girl is doing the hitting , and in the former , it is the boy , not the girl , who is laying the smack down .
If we eliminated cases we would n't necessarily have problems with ambiguity , but we would lose some of the freedom we have with where we want to place words in a sentence .
mj on November 07 , 2007 :
Read " The Mother Tongue " by Bill Bryson .
It 's a really great history lesson on the English language , and , as one comment already pointed out , it correctly addresses the fact that the English language continues to evolve .
Many arbitrary grammatical rules are just that - arbirtrary .
Judy on November 05 , 2007 :
I think " whom to call list " is grammatically accurate but when one googles , one finds just as many , if not more , instances where people use ' who to call list ' .
Does this mean the latter is now the norm and therefore acceptable usage ?
Ponta on November 04 , 2007 :
Oh thank you so much for this clarification piece .
The who / whom thing has been killing my lately , and I 'm glad to see that there is such an easy trick to remembering which one to use .
This is yet another step in perfecting my grammar ! :)

jerezano on October 14 , 2007 :
Hello robin :
You aaked : >> I learned many of the English rules from studying Spanish .
I wonder if those who speak more than one language are more aware of grammar in their native tongue .
What do you think ?
I 'd love to hear your thoughts .
Quit wondering .
You are definitely right .
When I started learning Spanish and then teaching English I found that learning Spanish not only makes one more aware of how we use English but also why we use it the way we do .
And Grammar is nothing more than an explanation of how the majority of us use English or Spanish or French .
Grammar is not a set of rules , it is a compendium of what the majority of us are speaking
jerezano .
Matt Prater on September 14 , 2007 :
Good contribution .
In response to some of the comments , let me say that I believe that language is a means to an end .
If enough people use a word incorrectly , it is no longer incorrect to use that word as such .
If someone knows an obscure rule , and seeks to employ that rule only for the sake of propagation of the rule , while a majority does not use that rule , it is that person who is wrong , imho .
Thanks ,
Matt
reash on September 14 , 2007 :
Hi
Great hub .
I like hubs that are giving away knowledge to other hubbers .
It is sad that people nowadays do n't care about their grammar .
You should create more hubs like this .
graff on July 24 , 2007 :
hi , I think this is a nice way to learn English .
But you should add an example like this one :
" The man who / whom you met was my brother "
In this sentence , if you want a formal sentence you shod say whom .
However , they are both correct .
Kowgirl on July 19 , 2007 :
Which is used with they or them , like in this part of a sentence whoever / whomever they may be ?
This is great .
I too have a hubpage about misused words .
Was just about to add this ( who , whom ) to my hubpage when I saw yours .
Great way to teach the kids , just keep it simple so they can understand ..

mushi on June 19 , 2007 :
I 'm a teacher in Japan , and your site has been helpful for when I need a quick reference , so thanks !
I 've studied French , Italian , Japanese , Tibetan , and a little Nepali and Hindi .
I definitely became more aware of English grammar rules after I studied more languages , but I also had an awesome English teacher my freshman year of high school , so I really owe it to both .
My friends that have studied other languages also tend to have pretty good grammar , but they do n't always choose to use it .
You mentioned that a lot of people that are highly educated use incorrect grammar , but I think that that is more a reflection of how adaptable the English language is .
I have about 4 or 5 different ways that I use English , depending on the situation .
If I 'm talking with friends or sending a text , I do n't use " proper " English grammar , but I do recognize that my grammar is incorrect .
I just do n't care , and I know that my listener will understand me even if I 'm lazy .
My favorite thing about the English language is that there are so many variations of it .
There really is n't a " proper " English language anymore .
Unfortunately , countries were colonized and forced to use English , but every single country adapted it to their culture in a different way .
There 's different slang , there are slight variations in what is " acceptable " grammar , there are different pronunciations and spelling .
But it 's still undeniably English .
I 'm sure it 's frustrating for new learners of English to have so many rules regularly broken , but , on the other hand , it means that the language is more flexible , too .

Hi Cyber Coyote ,
I think you are correct about the English language being dynamic .
It 's no wonder second language learners have such a difficult time .
I have had disagreements on a few of my topics , particularly farther vs. further .
I always prefer to err on the side of being more specific and finding distinctions in meaning / spelling .
Thanks for the comment !

Hi Ezra ,
" He turned out to be a television newscaster . "
He could be substituted in the sentence , so " who " is correct , e.g. , the person who I thought was the senator turned out to be a television newscaster .
( He / who and him / whom ) Thanks !
Ezra Ginder on April 24 , 2007 :
How do you determine who / whom in the following sentence :
The person who / whom I thought was the senator turned out to be a television newscaster ?
I originally thought it was whom , but now I am leaning toward who .
How would you substitute he / him in this sentence ?

Hi Chitra , thanks for the comment !
" Might " and " maybe " are often used interchangeably to indicate a probability or possiblility .

Hope this helps . ;)

Who is available ?
He is .
Cyber Coyote on September 20 , 2006 :
Hi Robin ,
It 's natural to feel that " someone " is in charge of English .
It is the case for some languages , but no one controls English .
English is simply the language that English speaking people use .
The key word is " use " .
If useage changes , well then English has changed -- grammar teachers not withstanding .
:-)
BTW , my best grammar teacher was a Sergeant who taught a course for the US Army .
Seriously .

StuartJ from Christchurch , New Zealand on September 08 , 2006 :
Hi Ralph ,
Your comment about the usage of pronouns declining to the point of " blurring the distinctions " is interesting .
I believe this is true but that it is also inevitable because it is part of a major change that has taken place in the English language .
Take the explanation , say , that " whom " is the objective case of " who " .
To someone whose native language is German , this makes a lot of sense , but to most English speakers it seems to be a purely academic distinction .
The fact is that English is no longer a case based language -- English , although it once used cases , now uses word order and prepositions to distinquish between the subject and the object , or the doer and the doee .
And since nouns are no longer inflected or altered to indicate case , the different cases of pronouns are really no longer necessary .
For example , if we say " Jane hit John " , it is the word order , not the case of the nouns , that tells us who is the subject and who is the object .
Similarly , since " She hit him " , and " Her hit he " , ( despite the latter being bad grammar ) mean the same thing , do we need the different cases of pronouns at all ?
I think not , and that eventually they will disappear .
Ralph Deeds from Birmingham , Michigan on September 08 , 2006 :
Es posible .
Pero creo que todos los lenguajes cambian .

Robin Edmondson ( author ) from San Francisco on September 06 , 2006 :
Ralph , that is probably true .
It 's very sad .
It 's amazing how many highly educated people are incorrect in their grammar .
Do you think this is true of those who speak other languages ?
I learned many of the English rules from studying Spanish .
I wonder if those who speak more than one language are more aware of grammar in their native tongue .
What do you think ?
I 'd love to hear your thoughts .
Ralph Deeds from Birmingham , Michigan on September 06 , 2006 :
It seems to me that correct usage of pronouns is declining almost to the point of blurring the distinctions .
Robin Edmondson ( author ) from San Francisco on September 06 , 2006 :
The purpose of these hubs is to make grammar as simple as possible .
I think the problem most people have with grammar is it becomes too complicated , and they give up on being correct .
Good feedback , I was going to add whoever and whomever to this hub .
Once again , you need to understand who and whom to understand whoever and whomever .
Thanks for the comments !
StuartJ from Christchurch , New Zealand on September 06 , 2006 :
That trick seems a bit simplified to me .
What about an example like this one :
" Assign that task to Whomever / Whoever is available . "
Here the correct answer is " whoever " because it's not the pronoun 's role in the sentence as a whole that matters , but it 's role in it 's own clause .
So " whoever " here is the subject of " is " .
If you search for the name “ Harold Thurman Whitman ” on Google you will find about 900 references to his quote :
“ Do not ask yourself what the world needs .
Ask yourself what makes you come alive , and then go do that .
Because what the world needs is people who have come alive . ”
Yet try as you might , you will not find any historical information about this great man .
That is because he does n’t exist .
This quote has been copied over and over on many websites , even to quotation websites !
The sheer number of citations now obscures the fact that the quote is properly attributed to Howard Thurman .
It shows how easy it is to assume that something is correct simply because of it ’s prevalence in a search result .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Google Larry Page and Sergey Brin , the two former Stanford geeks who founded the company that has become synonymous with Internet searching , and you ’ll find more than a million entries each .
But amid the inevitable dump of press clippings , corporate bios , and conference appearances , there ’s very little about Page ’s and Brin ’s personal lives ; it ’s as if the pair had known all along that Google would change the way we acquire information , and had carefully insulated their lives — putting their homes under other people ’s names , choosing unlisted numbers , abstaining from posting anything personal on web pages .
That obsession with privacy may explain Google ’s puzzling reaction last year , when Elinor Mills , a reporter with the tech news service cnet , ran a search on Google CEO Eric Schmidt and published the results : Schmidt lived with his wife in Atherton , California , was worth about $ 1.5 billion , had dumped about $ 140 million in Google shares that year , was an amateur pilot , and had been to the Burning Man festival .
Google threw a fit , claimed that the information was a security threat , and announced it was blacklisting cnet ’s reporters for a year .
( The company eventually backed down . )
It was a peculiar response , especially given that the information Mills published was far less intimate than the details easily found online on every one of us .
But then , this is something of a pattern with Google :
When it comes to information , it knows what ’s best .
From the start , Google ’s informal motto has been “ Do n’t Be Evil , ” and the company earned cred early on by going toe - to - toe with Microsoft over desktop software and other issues .
But make no mistake .
Faced with doing the right thing or doing what is in its best interests , Google has almost always chosen expediency .
In 2002 , it removed links to an anti-Scientology site after the Church of Scientology claimed copyright infringement .
Scores of website operators have complained that Google pulls ads if it discovers words on a page that it apparently has flagged , although it will not say what those words are .
In September , Google handed over the records of some users of its social - networking service , Orkut , to the Brazilian government , which was investigating alleged racist , homophobic , and pornographic content .
Google ’s stated mission may be to provide “ unbiased , accurate , and free access to information , ” but that did n’t stop it from censoring its Chinese search engine to gain access to a lucrative market ( prompting Bill Gates to crack that perhaps the motto should be “ Do Less Evil ” ) .
Now that the company is publicly traded , it has a legal responsibility to its shareholders and bottom line that overrides any higher calling .
So the question is not whether Google will always do the right thing — it has n’t , and it wo n’t .
It ’s whether Google , with its insatiable thirst for your personal data , has become the greatest threat to privacy ever known , a vast informational honey pot that attracts hackers , crackers , online thieves , and — perhaps most worrisome of all — a government intent on finding convenient ways to spy on its own citizenry .
It does n’t take a conspiracy theorist to worry about such a threat .
“ I always thought it was fertile ground for the government to snoop , ” CEO Schmidt told a search engine conference in San Jose , California , in August .
While Google earned praise from civil libertarians earlier this year when it resisted a Justice Department subpoena for millions of search queries in connection with a child pornography case , do n’t expect it will stand up to the government every time :
On its website , Google asserts that it “ does comply with valid legal process , such as search warrants , court orders , or subpoenas seeking personal information . ”
What ’s at stake ?
Over the years , Google has collected a staggering amount of data , and the company cheerfully admits that in nine years of operation , it has never knowingly erased a single search query .
It ’s the biggest data pack rat west of the NSA , and for good reason : 99 percent of its revenue comes from selling ads that are specifically targeted to a user ’s interests .
“ Google ’s entire value proposition is to figure out what people want , ” says Eric Goldman , a professor at Silicon Valley ’s Santa Clara School of Law and director of the High Tech Law Institute .
“ But to read our minds , they need to know a lot about us . ”
Every search engine gathers information about its users — primarily by sending us “ cookies , ” or text files that track our online movements .
Most cookies expire within a few months or years .
Google ’s , though , do n’t expire until 2038 .
Until then , when you use the company ’s search engine or visit any of myriad affiliated sites , it will record what you search for and when , which links you click on , which ads you access .
Google ’s cookies can’t identify you by name , but they log your computer ’s IP address ; by way of metaphor , Google does n’t have your driver ’s license number , but it knows the license plate number of the car you are driving .
And search queries are windows into our souls , as 658,000 AOL users learned when their search profiles were mistakenly posted on the Internet : Would user 1997374 have searched for information on better erections or cunnilingus if he ’d known that AOL was recording every keystroke ?
Would user 22155378 have keyed in “ marijuana detox ” over and over knowing someone could play it all back for the world to see ?
If you ’ve ever been seized by a morbid curiosity after a night of hard drinking , a search engine knows — and chances are it ’s Google , which owns roughly half of the entire search market and processes more than 3 billion queries a month .
And Google knows far more than that .
If you are a Gmail user , Google stashes copies of every email you send and receive .
If you use any of its other products — Google Maps , Froogle , Google Book Search , Google Earth , Google Scholar , Talk , Images , Video , and News — it will keep track of which directions you seek , which products you shop for , which phrases you research in a book , which satellite photos and news stories you view , and on and on .
Served up à la carte , this is probably no big deal .
Many websites stow snippets of your data .
The problem is that there ’s nothing to prevent Google from combining all of this information to create detailed dossiers on its customers , something the company admits is possible in principle .
Soon Google may even be able to keep track of users in the real world :
Its latest move is into free wifi , which will require it to know your whereabouts ( i.e. , which router you are closest to ) .
Google insists that it uses individual data only to provide targeted advertising .
But history shows that information seldom remains limited to the purpose for which it was collected .
Accordingly , some privacy advocates suggest that Google and other search companies should stop hoarding user queries altogether : Internet searches , argues Lillie Coney of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , are part of your protected personal space just like your physical home .
In February , Rep. Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) introduced legislation to this effect , but Republicans have kept it stalled in committee .
Google , which only recently retained a lobbying firm in Washington , is among the tech companies fighting the measure .
When I first contacted Google for this story , a company publicist insisted I provide a list of detailed questions , in writing ; when I said that I had a problem with a source dictating the terms for an interview , he claimed that everyone who covers Google — including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal — submits advance questions .
( A Times spokeswoman told me the paper sees no ethical problems with such a procedure , though individual reporters ’ decisions may vary ; an editor in charge of editorial standards at the Journal said the same thing . )
The Google flack assured me that this was so he could find the best person for me to talk to — more information for Google , so that Google could better serve me .
Eventually he agreed to put me in touch , sans scripted questions , with Nicole Wong , Google ’s associate corporate counsel .
I asked her if the company had ever been subpoenaed for user records , and whether it had complied .
She said yes , but would n’t comment on how many times .
Google ’s website says that as a matter of policy the company does “ not publicly discuss the nature , number or specifics of law enforcement requests . ”
So can you trust Google only as far as you can trust the Bush administration ?
“ I do n’t know , ” Wong replied .
“ I ’ve never been asked that question before . ”
UK TV viewers will not get to see an episode of South Park which shows Nicole Kidman and fellow Scientologist John Travolta attempting to coax a fictional Tom Cruise character out of a closet , with Kidman saying : " Do n't you think this has gone on long enough ?
It 's time for you to come out of the closet .
You 're not fooling anyone . "
Naturally , the robustly heterosexual Top Gun star took exception to this when Trapped in the Closet aired in the US .
The episode also showed Stan - believed by the Cruise character to be the reincarnation of Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard - having a pop at Cruise 's acting abilities , and Cruise reportedly waved the legal big stick at Paramount and threatened to sue if the offending programme was ever shown again .
An insider said : " Tom is famously very litigious and will go to great lengths to protect his reputation .
Tom was said not to like the episode and Paramount just did n't dare risk showing it again .
It 's a shame that UK audiences will never see it because it 's very funny . " ®
Campaign promises are a literal joke that repeats every political season .
Self - limiting terms , fiscal responsibility , and tax returns the size of postcards , to name a few .
Within hours of election , the newly minted official has already forgotten the promises that put them over the top .
In differentiating my candidacy from the others , making campaign pledges are important .
Talk is cheap .
Instead of tossing these pledges into the wind and nobody taking them seriously , I will cement my commitment to my word .
Today I held a press conference where I detailed the following pledges .
I have signed twenty notarized copies which are being sent to the press and to prominent Republican leaders throughout Utah .
If you are in Republican leadership and would like a signed copy , please contact me directly or my campaign .
Once the twenty are distributed , I will post a list of individuals possessing signed copies on the website .
CAMPAIGN PLEDGES
Democracy â€ “ I will actively strive for broad public collaboration , equally weighing and considering the input and advice of the American people with those alongside me in Washington .

If you want to get a home loan , it will be necessary to make an adequate down payment .
It is pretty standard to put down 20 % when getting this type of loan , but not everyone can afford to .
If you need help getting your down payment together , it is important to know your options .
There are numerous ways that you can get this money to buy your new home .
This article will go through some of the best options for doing this so you know what your choices are like .
Down Payment Assistance Programs
The whole purpose of down payment assistance programs is to help prospective home buyers with getting the money they need for their down payment .
These programs also sometimes provide assistance with closing costs .
There are numerous state , federal , city , county and even nonprofit agencies that offer this type of help .
The three types of assistance you can get include down payment grants , matched savings programs , and forgivable second mortgage programs .
Down Payment Grants
A down payment grant can help you get the money necessary for your down payment .
If you qualify for one of these grants , you wo n’t have to worry about paying back the money .
This form of assistance sometimes extends to closing costs , but not always .
Certain nonprofit agencies like the National Homebuyers Fund can provide you with the financial help you need .
You could get up to $ 7,000 with one of these grants .
Matched Savings Programs
With a matched savings program , you will put money into a savings account specifically for your down payment .
A bank or nonprofit agency will then match the contribution you make .
Many states offer these programs for those who want to buy a home but just do n’t have the money for their down payment .
The size of the contribution depends on the program , so you will need to keep that in mind .
When you are looking for the best agency to help you , this is something you should pay close attention to .
How to Qualify for Down Payment Assistance
Not everyone who applies for down payment assistance is going to qualify , but it ’s still something worth looking into .
You should check with one of the realtors in your area to see if they can point you in the right direction for this sort of help .
These professionals often have certain connections that can work to your advantage .
You will need to keep in mind that there are certain standards and limits when it comes to qualifying for this sort of financial assistance .
Whether or not you approved depends on many factors , including your income and the number of people in your household .
A majority of people who get approved for down payment assistance are first - time home buyers .
While repeat buyers can get this sort of help as well , you are much better off if you have never bought a home before .
Other factors that will affect your chances of getting this assistance include your credit score , debt - to - income ratio , military status and employment .
Those who are active military or a veteran have a better chance of approval .
Limits
There are certain types of down payment assistance that do n’t come with any limits when it comes to how much of your down payment you could get .
A loan from the Federal Housing Administration or Department of Veterans Affairs could potentially give you the full 20 % down payment , depending on your situation .
These are the options that you should look into first .
Private Lenders
You should also think about getting the money you need for a down payment from a private lender .
A private money loan could be the perfect solution to this particular problem .
There are tons of online - based lenders that can give you a loan for a few thousand dollars .
It could be enough to get you a home loan right now .
One of the best things about these loans is that they are very quick and convenient .
If you are approved for a private money loan , you could get the funds you need within as little as one business day .
It is very important to find out what the terms and requirements are for each type of assistance before filling out any applications .
This can help you to save quite a bit of time and effort .
Every single one of these options will have certain requirements that you need to meet for approval , and you can typically find out what they are online .
Make sure that you take the time to fill out each application carefully so you do n’t make any mistakes .
You also need to be completely honest with the information you submit , because otherwise your chances of approval will shrivel .
This information could help you get the home loan you need as soon as possible .
A senior curator at the Melbourne Museum , Mark Norman , who recently found a living specimen on the Great Barrier Reef , said that until now the male had only been discovered dead in trawls and plankton nets .
His achievement in capturing and photographing a live one has been documented in a recent paper for the New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research .
According to the article , the male blanket octopus is , technically speaking , " the most extreme example of sexual size - dimorphism in a non-microscopic animal ... such dimorphism is not seen in any other animal remotely as large " .
Dr Norman said : " There 's no other critters on that scale that have such a significant difference between the male and female . "
The two - metre female weighs at least 10,000 times as much as the male , sometimes up to 40,000 times as much .
This could make the question of position rather delicate , but as it turns out it does n't matter .
The male , it seems , relies on its arm as much as its penis to have sex .
This reproductive arm , known as a hectocotylus , is tucked away in a white spherical pouch between its other arms .
When males mate , the pouch ruptures , the penis injects sperm into the tip of the arm , the arm is severed , and passed to the female .
It stays there until used to fertilise the female 's eggs , which can be weeks later .
And while the human post - orgasm is sometimes referred to as " the little death " , for the male blanket octopus the term takes on literal meaning .
The male dies , but the female carries on , free to have sex with more males .
" It 's kamikaze sex , effectively , " said Dr Norman .
" They 've found females with up to six male arms in the gill cavity . "
But how did it get that way ?
Males compete with each other to fertilise the female , explained Dr Norman .
Being small allows the male to mature earlier , and allows for better protection using its tentacle segments .
After years of taking on debt , forgiving their neighbors and hiding the scars of civil war , the people of Lebanon are watching with dread as their carefully rebuilt country splinters around them .
The last four days of Israeli airstrikes have shattered bridges , bloodied children and wasted roads .
But they also mark another cycle of destruction for this seaside city , forcing some to wonder whether their country is cursed to live in perpetual violence and others to gird defiantly for another round of death and destruction .
“ We feel raped , ” intoned Camille Younis , a burly man with bags under his eyes and reddish hair giving way to gray .
“ We never , never , never expected anything like this . ”
It was Saturday afternoon , the city smothered in sticky heat .
The deep rumbles of explosions from the south shook the floor under Younis ’ feet .
His car rental agency was the only shop on a strip of newly rebuilt downtown real estate that had bothered to open its doors under Israeli bombardment .
The place was deserted .

Younis , 50 , sat glumly in his office , a bottle of Stolichnaya vodka and an ashtray brimming with Gitanes butts sitting before him .
He had invested all of his money in the business , he said .
He borrowed money and invested that , too .
When the fighting started , his livelihood began to melt away .
Younis was disgusted with Israel and angry with Hezbollah .
“ My God , we had a dream , ” he said , pointing out his window to the mosque and church that rose side by side across the street .
“ We had a dream of Lebanon , and I ’m sorry it did n’t work . ”
The torrent of airstrikes has cut down a national wish that has sometimes seemed on the verge of coming true :
That the people of Lebanon , with its mountains and cedar forests and sparkling beaches , could have a peaceful , prosperous country .
“ We are in shock .
Nobody is ready to go through this war , ” said Nayla Mouawad , the minister of social affairs .
Like most Lebanese , she has been scarred by her country ’s cycles of bloodshed .

Her husband , President Rene Mouawad , was assassinated just days after taking office in 1989 .
She was an outspoken critic of neighboring Syria ’s tampering in Lebanese affairs .
And now she is facing a fresh round of violence .
“ People are depressed and more than depressed , ” she said .
“ They are desperate . ”
The history of this tiny seaside country is a tapestry of betrayal , assassination and patronage .
Lebanon has been repeatedly divided .
Animosity among its many religious sects and a shaky central government exposed it to foreign meddling .

The civil war that dragged on from the mid-1970s until 1990 split the capital in half and pitted Lebanese against one another amid intrusions by Americans , Iranians , Syrians and Israelis .
Israel ’s presence did n’t end until 2000 , when it pulled its troops from southern Lebanon .
The years of fighting left a bleak inheritance :
The nation was physically destroyed , nearly drained of citizens , deep in debt and known internationally as a haven for warlords and terrorists .
The war also left Lebanon under the absolute control of Damascus .
Syria sent its soldiers to control the countryside , backed Hezbollah and exercised a puppeteer ’s control over the government in Beirut .
It took violence , too , to drive Syria out of Lebanon .
When charismatic former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated last year , enraged Lebanese blamed Syria and thronged the streets in mass protests .
Under heavy international pressure , Syria finally withdrew from Lebanon in the spring of 2005 .

A weak and fractious government was left to sort out its considerable political differences , including the fate of Hezbollah .
The movement kept its weapons and became a partner in the new government .
A raid into Israel by Hezbollah guerrillas provoked the massive attacks last week .
“ We have paid a price for this homeland with our blood and our souls , ” a grim - faced Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora told his country Saturday night .
“ We will rebuild what the enemy has destroyed , as we did in the past .
Lebanon has bled before , and today it is bleeding anew . ”
Just a few months ago , Lebanon seemed to be rising from the wreckage of its past .
The sun-splattered maze of shops and cafes , mosques and churches , plazas and pedestrian walkways in the heart of the capital had been rebuilt , limestone block by limestone block .
For the first time in years , there was no war or occupation .
Tourists came pouring in to explore the hillside city at the lip of the Mediterranean Sea .

When Beirut rose from the ashes , it did so with flair .
Racing to outdo one another , Lebanese built gourmet restaurants , gleaming boutiques and pulsing nightclubs .
The city became fashionable again , particularly among wealthy Arabs looking for a place to escape the oppressive summers of the Persian Gulf .
But Lebanon never decided what to do about Hezbollah .
When the explosions of Israeli airstrikes echoed off the hills of Beirut on Saturday afternoon , 18 - year - old Nancy Abi Aad ’s cellphone rang .
Her father ’s voice was urgent .
“ He said , ‘ Come home right now .
You do n’t understand .
You do n’t remember the war , ’ ” Aad said a few hours later , sitting at a metal table in a fast - food restaurant in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Achrafieh .

“ My parents say there ’s going to be another war .
They ’ve forbidden me to go anywhere . ”
She paused , absentmindedly twisting her long , dark curls around her fingers .
She and her family have watched the bombings from their hilltop home , she said .
They are miles from the bombing sites , but the house shudders with every attack .
“ My parents do n’t speak about the war , ” she said , “ but they often say , ‘ You were n’t here .
You do n’t understand . ’ ”
Skeletons of the civil war still clutter the country :
The old , abandoned buildings with their walls laced by decades - old bullet holes , the dead family members , and the things that are n’t said .

Still , many Lebanese youth were accustomed to speaking of war as a strange and dark national memory .
Now they wonder whether they , too , are destined to watch Lebanon buckle in war .
“ It is n’t so much that we are scared , but that we are scared for the future , ” said Maya Boutros , a 21 - year - old education student who sat on a cement bench , staring over the empty streets .
“ I ’m studying now , but for what ?
We do n’t have a future . ”
In Beirut ’s southern suburbs , mainly Shiite neighborhoods controlled by Hezbollah , a spirit of fatalism reigns as people gird for more violence .
In streets that had borne the brunt of the attacks , the acrid odors of smoke and garbage hung in the air .
Craters had been blasted into intersections ; highway overpasses had snapped in two ; broken glass glittered on the pavement .
Advertisement
Behind the fresh wreckage and rubble rose the buildings damaged in bygone wars , their sides peeling off like old wallpaper , their floors collapsed on one another .
“ They still have n’t been fixed because the government was supposed to compensate us , and they did n’t , ” said Ali Zeatar , a 34 - year - old car salesman and Hezbollah supporter .
“ These are financial losses , and we can handle it , ” he said of the fresh round of bombings .
“ As long as our dignity is n’t lost . ”
In the midst of the bombing in Beirut ’s southern suburbs , when the streets were empty of civilians , a pair of sisters hauled plastic chairs to their front door and settled in with a tub of garlic between them .
A songbird whistled in a nearby tree .
The women bent their veiled heads together , one sister peeling the bulbs , the other mincing them with a small knife .

It was a portrait of equanimity under fire , long a Lebanese trademark .
But when they spoke , the women were tense .
The bombings had gone on all night , shattering the windows along their street .
Living in the shadow of Hezbollah ’s radio station , a likely target for Israeli missiles , they expected more to come .
“ We are really afraid , ” said Fatma Hajima , 40 .
“ We hope there ’s a resolution , because it ’s not easy to live here and hear the Israeli jets . ”
As she spoke , the warplanes roared overhead .
Back in his car rental agency downtown , Younis mulled a life spent fighting .
He fought in the civil war , and then he fought to establish his agency .
He drove the same road from his village to Beirut for years , and watched the faces and uniforms on the soldiers change -- all the different armies that have sent their young men into Lebanon .
His car service was the best , he boasted .
He gave his customers a CD to listen to , snacks and road maps .
“ Who else does that ? ”
He blinked away tears .

“ It seems everything we ’ve worked for has been destroyed , ” he said .
“ I feel betrayed . ”

Sept. 4 , 2005  --
The theory of intelligent design , the purportedly more scientific descendant of creation science , rejects Darwin 's theory of evolution as being unable to explain the complexity of life .
How , ask supporters of intelligent design , can biological phenomena like the clotting of blood have arisen just by chance ?
A key supporter of intelligent design likens what he terms the " irreducible complexity " of such phenomena to the irreducible complexity of a mousetrap .
If just one of the trap 's pieces is missing -- whether it be the spring , the metal platform , or the board -- the trap is useless .
The implicit suggestion is that all the parts of a mousetrap would have had to come into being at once , an impossibility unless there were an intelligent designer .
Design proponents argue that what 's true for the mousetrap is all the more true for vastly more complex biological phenomena .
If any of the 20 or so proteins involved in blood clotting is absent , clotting does n't occur , and so , the creationist argument goes , these proteins must have all been brought into being at once by a designer .
But the theory of evolution does explain the evolution of complex biological organisms and phenomena , and the above argument from design , which dates from the 18th century , has been decisively refuted .
Rehashing the latter explanation and refutation is not my goal , however .
Those who reject evolution are usually immune to such arguments anyway .
Rather , my intention here is to develop some loose analogies between these biological issues and related economic ones and to show that these analogies point to a surprising crossing of political lines .
The Complexity of the Modern Economy
How is it that modern free market economies are as complex as they are , boasting amazingly elaborate production , distribution , and communication systems ?
Go into almost any drug store and you can find your favorite candy bar .
Every supermarket has your brand of spaghetti sauce , or the store down the block does .
Your size and style of jeans are in every neighborhood .
And what 's true at the personal level is true at the industrial level .
Somehow there are enough ball bearings and computer chips in just the right places in factories all over the country .
The physical infrastructure and communication networks are also marvels of integrated complexity .
Oil and gas supplies are , by and large , where they 're needed .
Your e-mail reaches you in Miami as well as in Milwaukee , not to mention Barcelona and Bangkok .
The natural question , discussed first by Adam Smith and later by Friedrich Hayek and Karl Popper among others , is who designed this marvel of complexity ?
Which commissar decreed the number of packets of dental floss for each retail outlet ?
The answer , of course , is that no economic god designed this system .
It emerged and grew by itself , a stunningly obvious example of spontaneously evolving order .
No one argues that all the components of the candy bar distribution system must have been put into place at once , or else there would be no Snickers at the corner store .
Different Reactions to Spontaneous Order in Biology and Economics
So far , so good .
What is more than a bit odd , however , is that some of the most ardent opponents of Darwinian evolution -- for example , many fundamentalist Christians -- are among the most ardent supporters of the free market .
These people accept the natural complexity of the market without qualm , yet they insist that the natural complexity of biological phenomena requires a designer .
They would reject the idea that there is or should be central planning in the economy .
They would rightly point out that simple economic exchanges that are beneficial to people become entrenched and then gradually modified as they become part of larger systems of exchange , while those that are not beneficial die out .
They accept that Adam Smith 's invisible hand brings about the spontaneous order of the modern economy .
Yet , as noted , some of these same people refuse to believe that natural selection and " blind processes " can lead to similar biological order arising spontaneously .
These ideas are not new .
As mentioned , Smith , Hayek , Popper , and others have made them more or less explicitly .
Recently , there have appeared several more mathematical echoes of these analogies invoking network , complexity , and systems theory .
These include an essay by Kelley L. Ross as well as briefer comments by Mark Kleiman and Jim Lindgren .
Two Questions
There are , of course , quite significant differences and disanalogies between biological systems and economic ones ( one being that biology is a much more substantive science than economics ) , but these should n't blind us to their similarities nor mask the obvious analogies .
These analogies prompt two final questions .
What would you think of someone who studied economic entities and their interactions in a modern free market economy and insisted that they were , despite a perfectly reasonable and empirically supported account of their development , the consequence of some all - powerful , detail - obsessed economic law - giver ?
You might deem such a person a conspiracy theorist .
And what would you think of someone who studied biological processes and organisms and insisted that they were , despite a perfectly reasonable and empirically supported Darwinian account of their development , the consequence of some all - powerful , detail - obsessed biological law - giver ?
-- Professor of mathematics at Temple University , John Allen Paulos is the author of best - selling books , including " Innumeracy " and " A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market . "
His " Who 's Counting ? " column on ABCNews.com appears the first weekend of every month .
A team of Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists , in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , Colo. , and Albion College , in Albion , Mich. , have achieved quantum key distribution ( QKD ) at telecommunications industry wavelengths in a 50 - kilometer ( 31 mile ) optical fiber .
The work could accelerate the development of QKD for secure communications in optical fibers at distances beyond current technological limits .
In research published recently in Applied Physics Letters , the team describes the use of new superconducting transition - edge sensors ( TES ) to distribute cryptographic key material at wavelengths of 1,550 nanometers through 50 kilometers of optical fiber .
TES could provide increases in range and performance over current QKD photon detection schemes .
Unlike the single - photon sensitive avalanche photodiodes ( APD ) that are typically used in optical fiber QKD systems , TESs detect photons by measuring minute temperature increases in a superconducting material caused by the absorption of individual photons .
“ The enhancements we ’ve made , ” said Los Alamos quantum physicist Danna Rosenberg , “ center around a new method of detecting single photons , which can be one of the most challenging aspects of QKD .
The TESs provide significantly higher detection efficiencies and lower dark count rates than those of typical APDs .
The high efficiency and low probability of dark counts , coupled with the relatively short recovery time of TESs , should permit higher secret key transmission rates at longer distances than APD - based systems . ”
In addition to employing TESs , the team experimented with bright optical pulse and electrical signal synchronization schemes .
One method of synchronization involved sending a bright 1,310 nanometer pulse just before sending a 1,550 nanometer pulse .
Using a bright pulse reduced transmission errors that might occur due to changes in the length or optical properties of the fiber link .
An electrical synchronization scheme used a rubidium atomic clock to synchronize information senders and receivers .
When used with electrical synchronization schemes , the TESs have the potential to increase distances that optical fibers could be used for QKD .
Using the current system , the maximum transmission distances for data with bright pulse and electrical synchronization are 83 kilometers ( 51.57 miles ) and 138 kilometers ( 85.75 miles ) , respectively .
More sophisticated methods of filtering photons than the experimenters employed , might someday allow users to send quantum keys securely over distances in excess of 270 kilometers ( 167.77 miles ) , compared to the current record of 122 kilometers ( 75.8 miles ) .
In addition to Rosenberg , who was formerly with the National Institute of Standards and Technology , the TES QKD team includes Sae Woo Nam , Adriana Lita and Aaron Miller at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , and Philip Hiskett , Glen Peterson , Richard Hughes , and , the team ’s leader , Jane Nordholt at Los Alamos .

Not really any surprises there  when it 's 90 ºF outside I 'd rather be on the couch with the PS2 or Xbox than whacking a ball with a stick .
But according to a report in the New York Times , the video game culture is n't just affecting sports participation .
Viewing figures for sporting events are dropping , and video game sales are taking up the slack .
Since 2000 , television broadcast ratings for almost all major sports have fallen among male viewers between 12 and 34 .
Even Nascar , whose ratings have generally been hailed by the industry as healthy , has suffered a modest decline , according to Nielsen Media Research .
Over the same period , sales of sports video games in the United States have risen by about 34 percent , to more than $ 1.2 billion last year from slightly less than $ 900 million in 2000 , according to the NPD Group , a market research firm .
Young men are also the core market for video games .
As technology increases to the point where video games are looking more and more realistic , the immersion factor increases , and the ability to take part in the action rather than simply watch it passively is highly appealing .
The World Rally Championship , it 's popularity boosted in recent years by games such as Colin McRae 's Rally , introduced a new telemetry system in recent years , with an eventual goal of allowing game players online to compete virtually against the real stars .
Obivously without the risk to life and limb that hurtling through a Swedish forest in the dark entails .
Now , I 'm aware that correlation is not the same as causation , and that the decline in sports figures may well have other causes , but there 's something tempting about playing as the Chicago Cubs and winning the World Series , rather than have a guy in the stands snatch defeat from the jaws of victory to continue nine decades of heartbreak .
And after wasting my time and money at Indianapolis this past weekend , I 'd love an opportunity to take to the track in a virtual F1 car , if only to repeatedly run down Max Mosely .
How do I take / edit great photographs ?
6:30 AM Subscribe July 9 , 2005
Okay , so everyone loves DaShiv 's photographs of SF Meetups , and for good reason .
They are incredible .
I can take decent photos , but they 're obviously amateurish .
Here 's my question :
How do I take it to the next level ?
How can I get the colors to look as brilliant as DaShiv's , for instance ( just an example ; I 'm sure that there are many other styles of photography that I am not aware of ) ?
What equipment do I need ?
What software do I need ?
What type of training is required ?
BTW , I run a Mac and have a little cash to burn .
Thanks in advance .
Daniel Gross : November 27 , 2005 - December 03 , 2005 Archives : DEBT BE NOT PROUD :
This is scary .
Allan Hubbard , President Bush 's top economic adviser , professes not to know the size of the national debt .
From yesterday 's White House press briefing .
Q Al , can I ask you one ?
I can't remember the last time the President spoke about the national debt , which is now over $ 8 trillion .
Is that something you guys worry about ?
DIRECTOR HUBBARD :
Well , I do n't know where your $ 8 trillion comes from , but we --
Q The public website .
DIRECTOR HUBBARD :
Well , I guess it really depends on what you 're including , but let me -- again , the President is most concerned about the economy and the budget .
And a key component of that , as I have spoken earlier , is the budget deficit .
And , you know , that 's what contributes to the overall budget debt , the country 's debt , and that 's why it 's so important to reduce the budget deficit and , hopefully , ultimately , eliminate the budget deficit .
Q Does the magnitude of the national debt disturb you ?
DIRECTOR HUBBARD : Actually , again , I do n't know what numbers you 're using , but the current budget debt is not a problem , but we do not want it to grow as a percentage of the GDP .
That 's the way you want to look at it , is the debt as a percentage of GDP .
And our budget debt is lower than many other developed countries .
The President is committed to keeping it low ; that 's why he wants to cut the budget deficit in half by 2009 .
. . . .
Q Check the Bureau of Public Debt website , you 'll see the number there .
DIRECTOR HUBBARD : Okay , thank you .
Eight barriers to effective listening
More attention is usually paid to making people better speakers or writers ( the " supply side " of the communication chain ) rather than on making them better listeners or readers ( the " demand side " ) .
The most direct way to improve communication is by learning to listen more effectively .
Nearly every aspect of human life could be improved by better listening -- from family matters to corporate business affairs to international relations .
Most of us are terrible listeners .
We 're such poor listeners , in fact , that we do n't know how much we 're missing .
The following are eight common barriers to good listening , with suggestions for overcoming each .
# 1 - Knowing the answer
" Knowing the answer " means that you think you already know what the speaker wants to say , before she actually finishes saying it .
You might then impatiently cut her off or try to complete the sentence for her .
Even more disruptive is interrupting her by saying that you disagree with her , but without letting her finish saying what it is that you think you disagree with .
That 's a common problem when a discussion gets heated , and which causes the discussion to degrade quickly .
By interrupting the speaker before letting her finish , you 're essentially saying that you do n't value what she 's saying .
Showing respect to the speaker is a crucial element of good listening .
The " knowing the answer " barrier also causes the listener to pre-judge what the speaker is saying -- a kind of closed - mindedness .
A good listener tries to keep an open , receptive mind .
He looks for opportunities to stretch his mind when listening , and to acquire new ideas or insights , rather than reinforcing existing points of view .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
A simple strategy for overcoming the " knowing the answer " barrier is to wait for three seconds after the speaker finishes before beginning your reply .
Three seconds can seem like a very long time during a heated discussion , and following this rule also means that you might have to listen for a long time before the other person finally stops speaking .
That 's usually a good thing , because it gives the speaker a chance to fully vent his or her feelings .
Another strategy is to schedule a structured session during which only one person speaks while the other listens .
You then switch roles in the next session .
It 's worth emphasizing that the goal of good listening is simply to listen -- nothing more and nothing less .
During the session when you play the role of listener , you are only allowed to ask supportive questions or seek clarification of the speaker 's points .
You may not make any points of your own during this session .
That can be tricky , because some people 's " questions " tend to be more like statements .
Keeping the mind open during conversation requires discipline and practice .
One strategy is to make a commitment to learn at least one unexpected , worthwhile thing during every conversation .
The decision to look for something new and interesting helps make your mind more open and receptive while listening .
Using this strategy , most people will probably discover at least one gem -- and often more than one -- no matter whom the conversation is with .
# 2 - Trying to be helpful
Another significant barrier to good listening is " trying to be helpful " .
Although trying to be helpful may seem beneficial , it interferes with listening because the listener is thinking about how to solve what he perceives to be the speaker 's problem .
Consequently , he misses what the speaker is actually saying .
An old Zen proverb says , " When walking , walk .
When eating , eat . "
In other words , give your whole attention to whatever you 're doing .
It 's worth emphasizing that the goal of good listening is simply to listen -- nothing more and nothing less .
Interrupting the speaker in order to offer advice disrupts the flow of conversation , and impairs the listener 's ability to understand the speaker 's experience .
Many people have a " messiah complex " and try to fix or rescue other people as a way of feeling fulfilled .
Such people usually get a kick out of being problem - solvers , perhaps because it gives them a sense of importance .
However , that behavior can be a huge hurdle to good listening .
Trying to be helpful while listening also implies that you 've made certain judgments about the speaker .
That can raise emotional barriers to communication , as judgments can mean that the listener does n't have complete understanding or respect for the speaker .
In a sense , giving a person your undivided attention while listening is the purest act of love you can offer .
Because human beings are such social animals , simply knowing that another person has listened and understood is empowering .
Often that 's all a person needs in order to solve the problems on his or her own .
If you as a listener step in and heroically offer your solution , you 're implying that you 're more capable of seeing the solution than the speaker is .
If the speaker is describing a difficult or long - term problem , and you offer a facile , off - the - cuff solution , you 're probably forgetting that he or she may have already considered your instant solution long before .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
Schedule a separate session for giving advice .
Many people forget that it 's rude to offer advice when the speaker is n't asking for it .
Even if the advice is good .
In any case , a person can give better advice if he first listens carefully and understands the speaker 's complete situation before trying to offer advice .
If you believe you have valuable advice that the speaker is n't likely to know , then first politely ask if you may offer what you see as a possible solution .
Wait for the speaker to clearly invite you to go ahead before you offer your advice .
# 3 - Treating discussion as competition
Some people feel that agreeing with the speaker during a heated discussion is a sign of weakness .
They feel compelled to challenge every point the speaker makes , even if they inwardly agree .
Discussion then becomes a contest , with a score being kept for who wins the most points by arguing .
Treating discussion as competition is one of the most serious barriers to good listening .
It greatly inhibits the listener from stretching and seeing a different point of view .
It can also be frustrating for the speaker .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
Although competitive debate serves many useful purposes , and can be great fun , debating should be scheduled for a separate session of its own , where it wo n't interfere with good listening .
Except in a very rare case where you truly disagree with absolutely everything the speaker is saying , you should avoid dismissing her statements completely .
Instead , affirm the points of agreement .
Try to voice active agreement whenever you do agree , and be very specific about what you disagree with .
A good overall listening principle is to be generous with the speaker .
Offer affirmative feedback as often as you feel comfortable doing so .
Generosity also entails clearly voicing exactly where you disagree , as well as where you agree .
# 4 - Trying to influence or impress
Because good listening depends on listening just for the sake of listening , any ulterior motive will diminish the effectiveness of the listener .
Examples of ulterior motives are trying to impress or to influence the speaker .
A person who has an agenda other than simply to understand what the speaker is thinking and feeling will not be able to pay complete attention while listening .
Psychologists have pointed out that people can understand language about two or three times faster than they can speak .
That implies that a listener has a lot of extra mental " bandwidth " for thinking about other things while listening .
A good listener knows how to use that spare capacity to think about what the speaker is talking about .
A listener with an ulterior motive , such as to influence or impress the speaker , will probably use the spare capacity to think about his " next move " in the conversation -- his rebuttal or what he will say next when the speaker is finished -- instead of focusing on understanding the speaker .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
" Trying to influence or impress " is a difficult barrier to overcome , because motives usually can't just be willed away .
Deciding not to have a motive usually only drives it beneath your awareness so that it becomes a hidden motive .
One strategy is to make note of your internal motives while you 're listening .
As you notice your motives in progressively closer and finer detail , you 'll eventually become more fully conscious of ulterior motives , and they may even unravel , allowing you to let go and listen just for the sake of listening .
# 5 - Reacting to red flag words
Words can provoke a reaction in the listener that was n't necessarily what the speaker intended .
When that happens the listener wo n't be able to hear or pay full attention to what the speaker is saying .
Red flag words or expressions trigger an unexpectedly strong association in the listener 's mind , often because of the listener 's private beliefs or experiences .
Technology is often seen as the driver of improved communications , but technology , in itself , creates noise and discord as much as it melds minds .
Good listeners have learned how to minimize the distraction caused by red flag words , but a red flag word will make almost any listener momentarily unable to hear with full attention .
An important point is that the speaker may not have actually meant the word in the way that the listener understood .
However , the listener will be so distracted by the red flag that she will not notice what the speaker actually did mean to say .
Red flag words do n't always provoke emotional reactions .
Sometimes they just cause slight disagreements or misunderstandings .
Whenever a listener finds himself disagreeing or reacting , he should be on the lookout for red flag words or expressions .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
When a speaker uses a word or expression that triggers a reflexive association , you as a good listener can ask the speaker to confirm whether she meant to say what you think she said .
When you hear a word or expression that raises a red flag , try to stop the conversation , if possible , so that you do n't miss anything that the speaker says .
Then ask the speaker to clarify and explain the point in a different way .
# 6 - Believing in language
One of the trickiest barriers is " believing in language " -- a misplaced trust in the precision of words .
Language is a guessing game .
Speaker and listener use language to predict what each other is thinking .
Meaning must always be actively negotiated .
It 's a fallacy to think that a word 's dictionary definition can be transmitted directly through using the word .
An example of that fallacy is revealed in the statement , " I said it perfectly clearly , so why did n't you understand ? " .
Of course , the naive assumption here is that words that are clear to one person are clear to another , as if the words themselves contained absolute meaning .
Words have a unique effect in the mind of each person , because each person 's experience is unique .
Those differences can be small , but the overall effect of the differences can become large enough to cause misunderstanding .
A worse problem is that words work by pointing at experiences shared by speaker and listener .
If the listener has n't had the experience that the speaker is using the word to point at , then the word points at nothing .
Worse still , the listener may quietly substitute a different experience to match the word .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
You as a good listener ought to practice mistrusting the meaning of words .
Ask the speaker supporting questions to cross-verify what the words mean to him .
Do n't assume that words or expressions mean exactly the same to you as they do to the speaker .
You can stop the speaker and question the meaning of a word .
Doing that too often also becomes an impediment , of course , but if you suspect that the speaker 's usage of the word might be slightly different , you ought to take time to explore that , before the difference leads to misunderstanding .
# 7 - Mixing up the forest and the trees
A common saying refers to an inability " to see the forest for the trees " .
Sometimes people pay such close attention to detail , that they miss the overall meaning or context of a situation .
Some speakers are what we will call " trees " people .
They prefer concrete , detailed explanations .
They might explain a complex situation just by naming or describing its characteristics in no particular order .
Other speakers are " forest " people .
When they have to explain complex situations , they prefer to begin by giving a sweeping , abstract , bird 's - eye view .
Good explanations usually involve both types , with the big- picture " forest " view providing context and overall meaning , and the specific " trees " view providing illuminating examples .
When trying to communicate complex information , the speaker needs to accurately shift between forest and trees in order to show how the details fit into the big picture .
However , speakers often forget to use " turn indicators " to signal that they are shifting from one to another , which can cause confusion or misunderstanding for the listener .
Each style is prone to weaknesses in communication .
For example , " trees " people often have trouble telling their listener which of the details are more important and how those details fit into the overall context .
They can also fail to tell their listener that they are making a transition from one thought to another -- a problem that quickly shows up in their writing , as well .
" Forest " people , on the other hand , often baffle their listeners with obscure abstractions .
They tend to prefer using concepts , but sometimes those concepts are so removed from the world of the senses that their listeners get lost .
" Trees " people commonly accuse " forest " people of going off on tangents or speaking in unwarranted generalities .
" Forest " people commonly feel that " trees " people are too narrow and literal .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
You as a good listener can explicitly ask the speaker for overall context or for specific exemplary details , as needed .
You should cross-verify by asking the speaker how the trees fit together to form the forest .
Having an accurate picture of how the details fit together is crucial to understanding the speaker 's thoughts .
An important point to remember is that a " trees " speaker may become confused or irritated if you as the listener try to supply missing context , and a " forest " speaker may become impatient or annoyed if you try to supply missing examples .
A more effective approach is to encourage the speaker to supply missing context or examples by asking him open - ended questions .
Asking open - ended questions when listening is generally more effective than asking closed - ended ones .
For example , an open - ended question such as " Can you give me a concrete example of that ? " is less likely to cause confusion or disagreement than a more closed - ended one such as " Would such - and - such be an example of what you 're talking about ? "
Some speakers may even fail to notice that a closed - ended question is actually a question .
They may then disagree with what they thought was a statement of opinion , and that will cause distracting friction or confusion .
The strategy of asking open - ended questions , instead of closed - ended or leading questions , is an important overall component of good listening .
# 8 - Over-splitting or over - lumping
Speakers have different styles of organizing thoughts when explaining complex situations .
Some speakers , " splitters " , tend to pay more attention to how things are different .
Other speakers , " lumpers " , tend to look for how things are alike .
Perhaps this is a matter of temperament .
If the speaker and listener are on opposite sides of the splitter - lumper spectrum , the different mental styles can cause confusion or lack of understanding .
A listener who is an over - splitter can inadvertently signal that he disagrees with the speaker over everything , even if he actually agrees with most of what the speaker says and only disagrees with a nuance or point of emphasis .
That can cause " noise " and interfere with the flow of conversation .
Likewise , a listener who is an over - lumper can let crucial differences of opinion go unchallenged , which can lead to a serious misunderstanding later .
The speaker will mistakenly assume that the listener has understood and agreed .
It 's important to achieve a good balance between splitting ( critical thinking ) and lumping ( metaphorical thinking ) .
Even more important is for the listener to recognize when the speaker is splitting and when she is lumping .
Strategy for overcoming this barrier
An approach to overcoming this barrier when listening is to ask questions to determine more precisely where you agree or disagree with what the speaker is saying , and then to explicitly point that out , when appropriate .
For example , you might say , " I think we have differing views on several points here , but do we at least agree that ... ? " or " We agree with each other on most of this , but I think we have different views in the area of .... "
By actively voicing the points of convergence and divergence , the listener can create a more accurate mental model of the speaker 's mind .
That reduces the conversational noise that can arise when speaker and listener fail to realize how their minds are aligned or unaligned .
Quadrant of cognitive / explanatory styles
More than one barrier may often be present at once .
For example , a speaker might be an over - splitter who has trouble seeing the forest , while the listener is an over - lumper who can see only the forest and never the trees .
They will have even more difficulty communicating if one or both also has the habit of " knowing the answer " or " treating discussion as competition " .
. . .
Good listening is arguably one of the most important skills to have in today 's complex world .
Families need good listening to face complicated stresses together .
Corporate employees need it to solve complex problems quickly and stay competitive .
Students need it to understand complex issues in their fields .
Much can be gained by improving listening skills .
When the question of how to improve communication comes up , most attention is paid to making people better speakers or writers ( the " supply side " of the communication chain ) rather than on making them better listeners or readers ( the " demand side " ) .
More depends on listening than on speaking .
An especially skillful listener will know how to overcome many of the deficiencies of a vague or disorganized speaker .
On the other hand , it wo n't matter how eloquent or cogent a speaker is if the listener is n't paying attention .
The listener arguably bears more responsibility than the speaker for the quality of communication .
Technology is often seen as the driver of improved communications .
In terms of message transfer , technology certainly does play an essential role .
However , communications is much more than just transferring messages .
To truly communicate means to learn something about the interior of another person 's mind .
Much has been said about the emergence of a " global mind " through technology .
Of course , we 've noticed that technology , in itself , creates noise and discord as much as it melds minds .
A deeper commitment to better listening is essential in order for technology to fulfill its promise of bringing the world together in real terms .
We can make a difference in the world by learning to listen better and by telling others about better listening .
But only if they listen .

Hidden among the brilliant stars of NGC 6397 are very faint stars
Stars that do not have enough mass never shine , dying billions of years before their bigger counterparts .
But astronomers have never been able to measure the exact mass limit , because the lightest stars that do shine can be simply too faint to detect .
Now , new images show for the first time how big a star must be to avoid impending doom .
Reporting in the journal Science , astronomers have viewed high quality pictures of some of the faintest stars in our galaxy .
The images come from the dimmest members of the NGC 6397 cluster - a close - knit group of ancient stars that orbit the Milky Way 's centre .
" The light from these faint stars is so dim that it is equivalent to that produced by a birthday candle on the Moon , as seen from Earth , " said lead author Harvey Richer , from University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada .
The Hubble Space telescope 's advanced camera was focused on the stars for five days to detect the tiny pinpricks of light .
Although the telescope would have been able to detect fainter stars , none could be found - so it appears that they simply do n't exist .
" We checked the instruments over and over again , " said Professor Richer , " but we do n't see any stars fainter than this . "
By calculating the mass of the faintest ancient stars , researchers can work out the minimum mass needed for a star to survive .
Potential stars that fall just short of the limit die before they are even born .
Survival of the fattest
Almost everything about a star 's fate is determined by the mass of the gas cloud from which it is formed .
Gravity pulls the gas into a giant ball , or protostar .
As the ball gets bigger and denser , its centre becomes extremely hot .
For large protostars , the heat becomes so intense that the star begins to burn hydrogen by fusion , and so starts to shine .
Inside the blue circle is an ancient cooling white dwarf
So , a small difference in mass can therefore mean the difference between a long life and an untimely death .
But how big is big enough ?
The problem has been that those stars that do start to shine - but have only just enough mass - burn very faintly and are nearly impossible to see .
The long - awaited new images finally lay this question to rest , say the authors .
The dimmest stars were measured as being 8.3 % of the Sun 's mass .
All protostars that are smaller than this are headed for life as a brown dwarf .
Star death
The pictures also provide a spectacular new record of the end of a star 's life .
Large stars , which burn out more quickly , can become white dwarfs - glowing cinders which slowly fade with age .
Astronomers had predicted that these should turn blue as they move towards death .
The new findings provide the first images of this signature colour change , confirming expectations .
These ancient white dwarfs , which have never been seen before , are amongst the Universe 's oldest stars .
Now that astronomers can work out how long they have lived , they can refine estimates of the age of the Universe .
On programming and programming languages : because there has got to be a better way .
transubstantiation .
© 2005 Jamie Zawinski < jwz@jwz.org >
I 've been thinking about transubstantiation , the belief of many branches of Christianity that when you take communion , the bread and wine transform physically into the flesh and blood of Christ .
According to the Catholic Church as late as 1965 , this is literally true , not just symbolism : the flesh is present , the bread is gone .
So let 's run some numbers .
The Roman Catholic Church says that there are around 1.1 billion baptized Catholics in the world today .
The current world population is 6.3 billion ( 17 % Catholic . )
The world population in A.D. 1930 was around 1 billion .
The world population in A.D. 1 was around 300 million .
If we assume an average lifespan of 50 years ( which is probably low , since the curve is so steep at the modern end ) that gives us 40 non-overlapping " generations " .
So if we put 1 , 2 , and 6 in the last three buckets , and .4 in every previous bucket , that gives 23 billion as a guess at how many people have been alive during the last two thousand years .
( I 'm not sure this is a valid generalization to make ; do you have a better guess ? )
I 'm not sure how quickly Christianity grew , but let 's guess that 12 % of all those people were Christian , of a variety that believed in transubstantiation .
( I think this is probably a reasonable guess because Christianity was very widespread by the 10th century or so , and by the numbers above , 83 % of the population came after that . )
How often do these folks take the Eucharist , on average ?
For the devout , it will be once a week , or maybe even more frequently .
But we do n't know how many of the total number of baptized Catholics above are practicing , so let 's guess that the average is 4 × / year .
At a 50 year lifespan , that 's 200× .
By my measure , one " sip " is 1/4 fl. oz .
One serving of Ritz crackers is 5 crackers at 100 grams , or 20 grams per cracker .
However , modern communion wafers are significantly thinner than crackers .
So let 's be conservative and call this 2 grams per cracker .
An adult male contains about six quarts of blood .
The current average weight for an American male is 180 pounds , but Americans are fatties and people used to be smaller , so let 's call the two - millennium average 120 pounds .
Which gives us :
23,000,000,000 people ×
12 % × 200 communions = 552,000,000,000 servings × 0.25 fl. oz .
= 138,000,000,000 gallons of blood × 2 grams = 2,433,903,400 pounds of flesh = 1,216,952 tons of flesh
So how big is Jesus ?
If you conservatively assume that these are the End Times and that Jesus will soon be completely consumed ( a detail that I do not believe is a part of mainstream Christian dogma ) , then he weighs twenty million times more than you , and contains ninety - two billion times as much blood .
( 20,282,528 × and 92,000,000,000× ) .
( If you assume that only the priest drinks the wine instead of every supplicant having a sip , then the blood ratio is smaller by around two orders of magnitude , depending on the priest / non - priest ratio . )
By comparison , the largest living animal on Earth is the Blue Whale , at a paltry 150 tons ( a mere 2,500 × bigger than you ) .
It is believed that the largest dinosaur , the Argentinosaurus , weighed only 90 tons .
However , perhaps Jesus , like Wolverine , has amazing regenerative powers ( in which case , it 's surprising it took him three days to return from the dead .
But maybe he was just taking a little time - out . )
I 'm told that the average person sheds 40 pounds of skin in a lifetime , and that 70 % of household dust is dessicated human .
I will leave further research along this line of thinking to others .
Update :
I have been informed of prior related research along these lines at everything2 : " How many atoms of Jesus do you eat every day ? "
The bones are said to display modern and Neanderthal features
The research team has dated six bones found in the Pestera Muierii cave , Romania , to 30,000 years ago .
The finds also raise questions about the possible place of Neanderthals in modern human ancestry .
Details of the discoveries appear in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
We 've known for some time that the earliest modern humans in Europe are a funny - looking bunch
Professor Clive Gamble
Interesting mix
Only a handful of modern human remains older than 28,000 years old are known from Europe .
Erik Trinkaus from Washington University in St Louis and colleagues obtained radiocarbon dates directly from the fossils and analysed their anatomical form .
The results showed that the fossils were 30,000 years old and had the diagnostic features of modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) .
But Professor Trinkaus and his colleagues argue , controversially , that the bones also display features that were characteristic of our evolutionary cousins , the Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis ) .
Neanderthals appear in the European fossil record about 400,000 years ago .
At their peak , these squat , physically powerful hunters dominated a wide range , spanning Britain and Iberia in the west to Israel in the south and Uzbekistan in the east .
Modern humans are thought to have entered Europe about 40,000 years ago , and within 10,000 years , the Neanderthals had largely disappeared from the continent .
By 24,000 years ago , the last survivors vanished from their refuge in the Iberian Peninsula .
Ice Age liaisons ?
While many researchers think Neanderthals were simply driven to extinction - either by climate change or competition with the moderns - a handful of scientists believe they interbred with the incomers and contributed to the modern human gene pool .
The Neanderthals occupied Europe for hundreds of thousands of years
Professor Trinkaus and his co-researchers point to several anatomical features of the Romanian bones that are either primitive - looking or characteristic of Neanderthals .
These include a large " occipital bun " , a bump or bulge at the back of the skull , as well as other features of the lower jaw and shoulder blade .
" These data reinforce the mosaic nature of these early modern Europeans and the complex dynamics of human reproductive patterns when modern humans dispersed westward across Europe , " Professor Trinkaus and his colleagues wrote in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Strict population replacement of the Neanderthals is no longer tenable . "
Rugged looks
Dr Katerina Harvati , a palaeoanthropologist from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , said the finds would further the understanding of early moderns in Europe .
She added that some traits in the fossils were either " archaic " , which means they were characteristic of the ancestors both of modern humans and Neanderthals , or that their evolution , presence and absence in modern humans was poorly understood .
" Both the author 's description and the few photographs provided in the article show a multitude of derived modern human traits and an overwhelmingly modern morphology of the described remains , " she explained .
Professor Clive Gamble , from Royal Holloway in London , UK , said the discoveries would yield valuable information about early modern humans in Europe ; but he was cautious about the evidence for interbreeding with Neanderthals .
" We 've known for some time that the earliest modern humans in Europe are a funny - looking bunch .
They are a distinctive looking lot - very heavily built , particularly in the skulls , " he told the BBC .
" The question is whether these robust features show that they were up to no good with Neanderthal women behind boulders on the tundra , or whether they were just a very rugged population .
" I think , really , the only way to tell would be to look at their ancient DNA .
When DNA was extracted from the classic Neanderthal skeleton , the last ancestor between modern humans and Neanderthals turned out to have lived 600,000 years ago . "
Similar claims have also surrounded early human skulls from Mladec in the Czech Republic and the skeleton of a male child unearthed in 1998 at the Abrigo do Lagar Velho rockshelter in Portugal .
The Lagar Velho boy , who died about 25,000 years ago , has been described as a " hybrid " , with a mixture of modern and Neanderthal features .

When one of their own lies , " This is just a partisan stunt ... perjury is a technicality . "
When Office crashes , I swear at it .
When InDesign crashes , I empathize with it .
Having passionate users is almost like a get - out - of - jail - free card .
I say almost , because if you abuse your position as the object of someone 's passion , they 'll eventually figure it out , and the sense of betrayal will make them angrier about your transgression ( crashing , lying , running slow , being incomplete , etc. ) than if they 'd never loved you at all .
But there 's no getting around it -- we all have double standards .
We are all cutting one side some slack while holding the other to our ruthless , concrete expectations .
And of course we will all screw up .
We are n't perfect .
Neither is our software , our hardware , our service , our support , our employees , our policies , our products and services and ideas .
But that 's the beauty of passion -- if you can inspire it , by helping your user kick ass -- they WILL cut you some slack .
They 'll forgive you when you screw up .
And even their very definition of " screw up " is fluid .
Like I said , when I reboot my Mac , it is n't Apple that screwed up .
It 's either me ( what did I expect trying to hook those three things up together ? ) or just the nature of doing anything so sophisticated , superior , and cutting edge .
A small , small price to pay .
When I have to reboot my Windows machine , come on ... rebooting is such a perfect metaphor for everything that 's just so wrong with Microsoft .
True Apple fans know that the Nano screen only appears to have a problem with scratches because :
A ) The screen scratches ...
DUH !
The new users are just too stupid to take proper care of it .
and
B ) The normal to - be -expected scratches are simply more noticeable now because of the increased screen resolution .
The perceived " scratch problem " is actually an artifact of the Nano 's superiority .
A feature , not a bug .
Most of us stroll happily along never acknowledging the double standards we apply .
We do n't recognize that our specific level of forgiveness ( and indeed , what we even decide needs forgiveness ) is based almost entirely on whether we love something ( we 'll forgive almost anything ) , hate something ( we 'll forgive nothing ) , or do n't care about it at all ( we 'll forgive based on whatever seems " reasonable " ) .
But sometimes our double - standards bite us in the ass and we 're forced to face it , as Phil Ringnalda did a few months back .
When O'Reilly appeared to have search - engine - gaming ads , Phil slammed him in this blog entry .
But when his friend Shelley Powers does it , the conversation got very interesting .
It was fun ( and impressive ) to see Phil acknowledge and wrestle with the ambiguity of it all .
A couple quotes from the comments :
" Unfortunately , I ca n’t extend that absolution to you , and deny it to Tim O’Reilly ... I do n’t like this answer either .
Is n’t there one where I can get back up on my high horse , and take a nice absolute moral position ? "
I love the discussions that force us into grey , fuzzy , squirming positions where we must " hold two opposing thoughts simultaneously . "
But the point of my post is this -- would n't you rather be the one most likely to be forgiven than the one who can never " catch a break " ?
And again , I 'm not talking about areas where you really do have serious problems that you 'd rather sweet - talk your way out of than fix .
I 'm talking about the inevitable problems you just can't avoid .
The " stuff just happens " events .
So , we have to ask ourselves ... what can we do to put ourselves on the side of forgiveness ?
What can we do to help protect us from the times when we will screw up ?
What would it take in our product , company , service , whatever -- to get users to have a glass - half - full attitude about whatever it is we do ?
If " rebooting " is a metaphor , I 'd rather be Apple than Microsoft .
( And that 's another question to ponder ... why are we so willing to diss Microsoft yet give Apple a break for some of the same things ?
More importantly , what -- if anything -- could Microsoft do to turn that around ? )

Very good points , but , believe it or not , some of us have exactly the opposite point of view about Microsoft .
We will cut Microsoft slack because of the " nature of problem " ( I 'm messing with device drivers , or trying to run more applications that my RAM will support , or .... ) , while thinking of Macs as nothing more than extremely expensive " pretty " toys . ;)
I mean , come on , how can you do any * real * work with only a single mouse button . :) ( j/k )

We all like to root for the underdog , for MS to get a little empathy , I think it 's going to come w/ a loss of market share .
If that 's the case ... I 'd rather be MS ;)
Posted by : Darren | Nov 11 , 2005 4:00:40 PM
See , now posts like this are why I read this blog so regularly ( as in I check for updates several times a day ) .
I notice these types of double standards in myself , as I 'm sure many do , but I so quickly and easily dismiss them that they fail to disturb my calm .
And I HATE it when I have one of those thrown back into my face .
For example , when my step brother and I pulled out our new laptops and for a few hours of geektastic fun .
He had a Dell , and I had my iBook .
Every time he had a problem ( and initially he did , mostly with getting online ) , I would utter under my breath " it just works " .
Of course , not ten minutes later my iBook puked while transfering some files and I had to reboot .
It was totally my fault for trying to transfer such a huge number of files all at once ( see , there I go ) .
I agree that I 'd rather be Apple in that situation than Dell ( or MS , whoever was to blame for the problems he had ) .
His did n't work and he cursed it , mine did n't work and I apologized for asking so much .
As a further example , that iBook died the other day for unexpectedly , and within two days I 'd ordered a new iBook to replace it .
Problems or not , I 'm willing to overlook all of that to have the experience of using one again .
Apple 's doing something right , that 's for sure .
Posted by : JClark | Nov 11 , 2005 4:03:01 PM
Awesome post .
I think it does have a whole heck of a lot to do with being the underdog , so I consider this a sort of balance in the universe .
The little guy gets the benefit of the doubt while the big guy is held to a higher standard .
In addition , there 's an element of newness at play .
I put up with more annoyances for a new experience than I would for an old experience .
This fits right in with the underdog situation , because the underdog typically is offering a new experience .
Combine these , and we have today 's Microsoft held to a higher standard both for being the 800lb gorilla and for not offering anything new .
The solution ?
Lose market share or offer new products .
Specifically , I think Windows Power Toys where mishandled .
Such small , easy to release customizations can help keep people interested without requiring a 4 year OS dev cycle .
Ultimately , decoupling the release schedules of all the things that go into a current Microsoft product can lead to a steadier state of customer excitement rather than the peaks and valleys they currently engender .

Another great post , Kathy .
Is n't this just linked to that process the psychologists call ' cognitive dissonance ' .
Once we 've bought something , then we 're almost bound to say it 's better than other competitive products .
How could we have made a wrong decision ?
It 's almost as if we were a ball bearing sitting in a little cup shaped depression .
Small shocks cause us to move around a little but we roll back down to the bottom of the cup .
It takes a big shock before we 're bounced out of the cup and decide that we really should have bought something else .

A few points ...
Contrary to popular belief ... passion can often be far from ' blind ' and have a rational basis based firmly upon logical ( albeit emotional ) triggers .
>... what can we do to put ourselves on the side of forgiveness ?
What can we do to help protect us from the times when we will screw up ?
Why is ' protection ' appropriate ?
I say it 's not - and further , if we 've been genuinely authentic and decent in our dealings , those flaws add to our character and strengthen relationships .
> More importantly , what - if anything - could Microsoft do to turn that around ?
The answer to that is ' effectively zero ' .
Key is the pre-flight mindset with which we approach and conduct the enterprise - this is something which cannot be faked , tweaked or in - any - way altered after - the - fact .
Examples of three points on a line here are Zeldman 's A List Apart , 37 Signals and 9Rules .
The former is very different from the latter and clearly , I favor the Zeldman line ( real talent , understated ) .
There again , much of commerce operates on the opposite - overstatement .

I remember a specific time and market segment in which Windows was very much the underdog .
In 1987 I worked for a small computer integrator doing desktop publishing .
The solution of choice in those days was a Mac system , which we would have loved to sell in spite of its $ 12,000 price tag ( for computer , laser printer , and software ) .
But Apple was very choosy about who could resell Apples , and we did n't qualify .
So I learned ( and then taught ) desktop publishing using Windows 1.0 and Ventura Publisher 1.0 , then Aldus Pagemaker 1.0 .
It was incredibly slow and painful compared to the Mac , as I well knew - god knows I would have preferred working with Macs , and I bought one for myself for home use as soon as I could afford it .
But we did n't have a choice at work .
Neither did some of our customers , e.g. government departments , who could get a full Windows DTP system for under $ 5000 - much easier to budget for on the public dollar .
So I worked with the underdog , helping underdogs , and we all made the best of it .
It was n't sexy , it was n't sleek , and no one loved it , but it got the job done .
In the end , a Fiat will get you to work just as surely as a Ferrari .
Perhaps Apple 's snobbish attitudes on pricing and distribution contributed to their eventual loss of market share against Windows , even in areas where Macs were clearly technically superior .
I have never forgiven Apple for that early snub ( okay , so I bear grudges ) , and nowadays I find the smugness of many Mac users equally irritating , especially since Macs are still pretty expensive .
Windows is no longer the underdog in the OS market , but it 's the OS for us underdogs who can't afford Apple hardware , or are n't technical enough to deal with Linux .
We do n't love it , but it does the job , and sometimes you have to settle for that .

Creating Passionate Users + Passion is blind = Creating Blindness in Users ?
I think this gets at the vague discomfort I 've had with many of your posts .
It 's not so much what you say as what you leave out .
One of the struggles of web accessibility is how to create sites that work for blind people without requiring that people be blind to enjoy the sites .
I think the same struggle is equally , if not more , common in the work of creating passionate users .
I assume you 're not aiming to make users blind , but I do n't imagine it would hurt to discuss that risk a bit more .

I familiarity breeds contempt then the question you missed was " what are Apple going to do to keep it this way ? "
If you are cool and funky you can cover up many issues , as you get more mainstream the problems get worse .
From what I hear , because I have no first hand experience , Apple have a huge Customer Service issue to overcome .
Posted by : Graham Chastney | Nov 14 , 2005 8:36:46 AM
This might be really unpopular , but I actually expect a whole lot more from Apple .
I do not use one , but my fiancé does .
Every time he has to reboot his Mac , I count it against Apple .
I believe for the extra money it costs ( which is a whole bunch since I build my PC ’s myself ) , that thing should be rock solid , the customer service should freakin rock , etc .
Basically it should be near perfect .
So I have a double standard against Apple .
I ’ll forgive my Windows PC for a lot , but I wo n’t forgive that Mac for much of anything .

One time I was in heavy traffic and someone nearly clipped me pulling into my lane .
I was about to select some expletives when I noticed it was a friend of mine .
All of a sudden I was smiling , and I did not feel one trace of contempt .
I was thinking , " Hey , it 's hard to be a perfect driver .
Everyone loses focus now and then . "
That taught me a big lesson about the fluidity of perception .
Posted by : Zach Thomas | Nov 14 , 2005 10:39:25 AM
" From what I hear , because I have no first hand experience , Apple have a huge Customer Service issue to overcome . "
My personal experience with Apple 's Customer Service has been nothing short of delightful .
I had to send my old PowerBook in at one point , two days after I called a prepaid shipping box showed up , and two days after I mailed it out I had it back all fixed .
I literally mailed it on a MOnday and had it back by that Wednesday night .
Another time I bought an accessory from the Apple store that was faulty , I called up and they immediately refunded the money to my card and told me I could do whatever I wanted with the item .
I have heard horror stories about Apple 's service , but I 've never been less than thrilled with it personally .
I 'm sure at least some of those stories are true , but I 'm also sure that Apple 's service is better than most I 've dealt with ( especially Gateway and Microsoft , hours and hours of pointless phone calls with no results ) .
Posted by : JClark | Nov 14 , 2005 2:45:37 PM
I think it all comes down to this :
We humans do n't like to admit that we were wrong .
Once I make a stand for something , I will try to ignore its faults because , if I do n't , then I will be admitting that my original decision is wrong .
It works the other way as well .
Once I go against something , I will ignore its successes because I do not want to be wrong .
This builds up momentum - the longer I stand for something , the harder it is to admit its faults .

Something I do that is a ' shortcut ' into this forgiveness ( although for a shortcut , it 's much more work ) : I write games , and like all software , there are problems that need patches to fix .
But when I make a patch , rather than just fixing the bugs , I throw in new features - minigames , extra levels , new tools you can use in the level editor .
There are threads on my forum of people posting ideas they 'd like to see in a new patch - they 're not even thinking about bugs they might find , they just want more cool stuff !
So it turns that patch moment of " great , I have to go through extra work to get the game to WORK " into " oh , I 'm gonna download this for the extras ! " .
A side effect is that while I sometimes have to tell a customer " oh , you 'll need to download the latest patch for that to work right " , I more often have to say " Sorry , that add - on world was made with a more recent patch , you 'll need to download the patch to play it ! " ( implied : because of the amazing new features it uses ) so I 'm basically telling them " Oh , did n't you know ?
There 's more game than you thought , go get it for free ! "
Instead of being seen as an incompetent who can't seem to get it right , I 'm seen as a great guy who keeps adding new stuff for free ( or so I hope ) .

Hell hath no fury like a computer geek scorned .
I was as bad an apple snob as any that exist today , until they cut my nose off to spite my face ... by discontinuing the //GS .
I love that machine ... still have my Woz signature machine with an overclocked processor .
However , when they killed that machine ... 6 months after celebrating " Apple // forever " , I swore at and off apple for good .
Windows may crash ... I can recover from that .
Windows is n't sexy ... I have a wife for that .
At least I can still run programs from four iterations back .
Can macs do that with OSX ?
Without running an emulator ?
Is there an upgrade path for Macs ?
I can slap a new motherboard into my PC and have it back up and running in 20 minutes .
Can you do that with a mac ?
For these , and many more reasons , I 'll never own another Apple product .

I know quite a few current Mac and IPod users , and very , very few fit the " True Apple fans know that the Nano screen only appears to have a problem with scratches because : " mold you describe .
I have been using Apple gear for a number of years , as well as Linux and Windows systems .
The Apple ones work better , for now .
That was not the case in the late OS 9 days , when I needed a Java 1.2 VM , and Apple did not have one .
I used a machine that did what I needed , quite happily .
Built it myself , too , and upgraded it several times as new Athlon cpus came out that ran better .
OS X came out , and by the 10.1 release , I had switched back .
As time passed the OS got enough better that I stopped needing to really run Windows or Linux .
I did not , though , completely lose touch .
All three systems have improved , but I believe that Apple has the superior product , at least for my needs .
Is Apple perfect ?
No .
Do they make boneheaded decisions ?
Yep .
Do they seem to make fewer than Microsoft ?
Seems to be the case .
Put another way - I have seen windows crash rarely in recent XP releases , and I have not had a single crash from my Mac since the 10.2 days .
( Beta OS releases of both notwithstanding . )
I still find Windows clunkier , and less likely to do what I want .
More , Windows is less likely to be customizable the way I want it to be , and more likely to waste my time .
All three systems could improve a bunch , but Apple seems ahead of the pack .
Any serious and honest Apple user knows at least one or two areas that Apple has screwed up over the years .
The thing is , Apple seems more interested in improving my user experience than the competition .
They get the passionate users because they care more , for the moment .
The iPod might change that - when your big device only costs $ 300 , it is hard to support a lot of customer contact and warm fuzzies .
Still , that is a risk , not a certainty .
Recognizing that you have a superior platform _FOR YOUR NEEDS_ is not a double standard .
It is only a problem when you forget that needs change , or fail to recognize that yesterday 's solution is not right for today .

The comments to this entry are closed .
Kevin Turner , Microsoft 's chief operating officer , fired a shot across Google 's bows yesterday , warning the company to steer clear of enterprise search .
" Enterprise search is our business , it 's our house and Google is not going to take that business , " Turner told 7,000 delegates attending Microsoft 's Worldwide Partner Conference .
" Those people are not going to be allowed to take food off our plate , because that is what they are intending to do . "
His tough talk followed chief executive Steve Ballmer 's less confrontational , but somewhat outlandish , claim that everything is converging on search .
" We are entering into a set of new markets [ over the next 12 months ] , new for us , " Ballmer said .
" Business intelligence , the portal , workflow , content management , collaboration market .
Everybody likes to call it something different , but that 's really now one category , one market that we 're entering in full force this year . "
What 's that market , Steve ?
" Search from the desktop to the enterprise to the internet is a business of great importance and a market of great importance to us . "
Microsoft tackling the market by first re-branding its long awaited , and much - hyped , Windows Vista search feature to avoid confusion with Microsoft 's internet property .
Windows Live Search , for the desktop , is now Windows Live Search Center and will allow Windows Vista users to search data in Office and desktop system files .
Microsoft used WPC to wow partners with improved search in the upcoming Office SharePoint Portal Server 2007 .
Microsoft plans a set of connectors in a so - called Business Data Catalogue that enable users to search Microsoft 's Dynamics customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning applications , plus software from rivals SAP and Siebel - now owned by Oracle .
Microsoft will expect partners to expand the catalogue with additional connectors to other applications .
Microsoft used its conference to demonstrate a strangely familiar capability of exporting customer names and addresses from these business applications for mapping and display using Windows Live Virtual Earth - either a re-branded Windows Live Local , previously MSN Virtual Earth , or just a presentational slip .
Salesforce.com already enables integration between customers ' CRM data and Google Maps through the AppExchange service launched in January .
Microsoft demonstrated the ability to combine search of data with information about people who may be relevant to searches .
SharePoint Server will achieve this by crawling through information about people in emails , Microsoft 's ActiveDirectory , and links to SharePoint MySites .
The combination led chief Ballmer to enthusiastically comment that search and SharePoint Server 2007 are " kind of like a MySpace for real business use . "
Kind of , Steve , but not really . ®
So , by pure chance I ended up looking at the reverse - complement benchmark of the Computer Language Shootout , and the SBCL ( 0.9.4 ) implementation of the benchmark was not doing very good .
Back then , it was listed at almost 14 seconds , with the best implementation in C doing the same job in 0.69 seconds , and even python doing considerably better at around 3 seconds .
Plus , the SBCL implementation used gobs of memory .
Time for some golfing !
A closer look at the benchmark reveals that we are actually measuring I/O speed , and memory speed , as the benchmark is supposed to read in a ~ 25 MiB FASTA ( text ) file via standard input , essentially reverse it chunk - wise , and print it out formatted again .
There is half an explanation in there why the SBCL implementation fares so badly : depending on the locale it would assume input data is in UTF - 8 format and try to decode it , plus internally , SBCL CHARACTER s are 32 - bit wide .
Also , interpreters like python do relatively well , because they do not actually spend much time in the interpreter , as the python code and perl code undoubtedly show .
To cut a long story short : I provided a revcomp entry which beat every other implementation save the gcc implementation , and even there it came quite close .
It is also quite ugly .
With SBCL 0.9.4 , the shootout benchmarking program measured RAM usage to be 35 MB , showing that my version consed quite less , for what it 's worth .
Then , several languages were upgraded ( among them SBCL and Digital Mars D ) , and now my entry resides on the third place , behind the D and gcc entry .
Oh well .
Lessons learnt ( in no particular order ) :
Lisp can be as fast as C! ( News at 11 )
Unfortunately , the optimizations come at a price : complexity , ( our own buffer management , no READ - LINE , etc ) .
Approaching the speed of C seems to force use to more or less write C in Lisp .
Fortunately , most of the time , we do n't have to .
Note however , that contrary to other languages , we did not have to drop down to use FFI , this is still all standard Common Lisp functionality , and unless we lie to the compiler , we are still safe from buffer overruns and other nastiness .
Note however , that contrary to other languages , we did not have to drop down to use , this is still all standard Common Lisp functionality , and unless we lie to the compiler , we are still safe from buffer overruns and other nastiness .
When optimizing an I/ O bound application we may consider using block operations ( READ - SEQUENCE , WRITE - SEQUENCE ) with element type ( UNSIGNED - BYTE 8 ) , thus bypassing most of the stream functionality .
, ) with element type , thus bypassing most of the stream functionality .
Listen to your compiler ( notes ) , it has important things to tell !
I just wished the compiler would also reveal why it determined that , e.g. , code is not reachable ...
In all cases this was due to errors elsewhere on my side , and SBCL is quite smart at figuring them out , it just does not tell me .
I could not get decent performance by growing the input buffer like the C version , realloc - style .
If an array is not adjustable , it is presumably copied when using ADJUST - ARRAY , and if we create it adjustable , it is not simple any more , and the compiler loudly complains that it cannot do some optimizations .
This complicates matters slightly .
I use the moral equivalent of Erlang iolists instead : a list of vectors .
( DECLARE ( OPTIMIZE ... ) ) annotations should be used sparingly , and not shotgun - style , as seems to be the default shootout compilation policy .
annotations should be used sparingly , and not shotgun - style , as seems to be the default shootout compilation policy .

It is a lot shorter , too .
s? ) but saner revcomp version is probably preferable in all but exceptional situations .
It is a lot shorter , too .
Optimizations like the above are highly implementation - dependent .
Different implementations might exhibit different behavior , or might even have better ways to reach the same performance ( e.g. , different stream implementations ) .
Out of all the benchmark entries so far , I liked the python entry quite a bit for it 's clarity and conciseness .
However , most of it is probably just calling out to C .
Børge Svingen kindly pointed me to his paper " When Lisp is Faster than C " ( ACM link ) .
He uses dynamic compilation to speed up his Lisp computations .
In Common Lisp , this is as easy as calling COMPILE at runtime .
Of course , with some more pain we could do something similar in C by generating C code , compiling it ( e.g. , with tcc ) , and loading it dynamically .
Or use GNU Lightning for JIT compilation ( even more pain ) .
The strategy of generating specialized C code is used quite often , for example in CADP and SPIN .

Diebold issued a response to our e-voting report .
While we feel our paper already addresses all the issues they raise , here is a point by point rebuttal .
Diebold ’s statement is in italics , our response in normal type .
Three people from the Center for Information Technology Policy and Department of Computer Science at Princeton University today released a study of a Diebold Election Systems AccuVote - TS unit they received from an undisclosed source .
The unit has security software that was two generations old , and to our knowledge is not used anywhere in the country .
We studied the most recent software version available to us .
The version we studied has been used in national elections , and Diebold claimed at the time that it was perfectly secure and could not possibly be subject to the kinds of malicious code injection attacks that our paper and video demonstrate .
In short , Diebold made the same kinds of claims about this version – claims that turned out to be wrong – that they are now making about their more recent versions .
Normal security procedures were ignored .
Numbered security tape , 18 enclosure screws and numbered security tags were destroyed or missing so that the researchers could get inside the unit .
This is incorrect .
Far from ignoring Diebold ’s “ normal security procedures ” , we made them a main focus of our study .
The tape and seals are discussed in our paper ( e.g. , in Section 5.2 ) , where we explain why they are not impediments to the attacks we describe .
The main attack does not require removal of any screws .
Contrary to Diebold ’s implication here , our paper accounts for these measures and explains why they do not prevent the attacks we describe .
Indeed , Diebold does not claim that these measures would prevent any of our attacks .
A virus was introduced to a machine that is never attached to a network .
This is irrelevant .
Our paper describes how the virus propagates ( see Sections 2.2.2 and 4.3 ) via memory cards , without requiring any network .
By any standard – academic or common sense – the study is unrealistic and inaccurate .
This is little more than name - calling .
For an academic evaluation , ask our academic colleagues .
We ’d be happy to provide a long list of names .
We demonstrated these problems on our video , and again in live demos on Fox News and CNN .
Common sense says to believe your eyes , not unsubstantiated claims that a technology is secure .
The current generation of AccuVote - TS software – software that is used today on AccuVote - TS units in the United States – features the most advanced security features , including Advanced Encryption Standard 128 bit data encryption , Digitally Signed memory card data , Secure Socket Layer ( SSL ) data encryption for transmitted results , dynamic passwords , and more .
As above , Diebold does not assert that any of these measures would prevent the attacks described in our paper .
Nor do we see any reason why they would .
These touch screen voting stations are stand - alone units that are never networked together and contain their own individual digitally signed memory cards .
As discussed above , the lack of networking is irrelevant .
We never claim the machines are networked , and we explain in our paper ( e.g. Sections 2.2.2 and 4.3 ) how the virus propagates using memory cards , without requiring a network .
Again , Diebold does not claim that these measures would prevent the attacks described in our paper .
In addition to this extensive security , the report all but ignores physical security and election procedures .
Every local jurisdiction secures its voting machines – every voting machine , not just electronic machines .
Electronic machines are secured with security tape and numbered security seals that would reveal any sign of tampering .
Our paper discusses physical security , election procedures , security tape , and numbered security seals .
See , for example , Sections 3.3 and 5.2 of our paper .
These sections and others explain why these measures do not prevent the attacks we describe .
And once again , Diebold does not assert that they would .
Diebold strongly disagrees with the conclusion of the Princeton report .
Secure voting equipment , proper procedures and adequate testing assure an accurate voting process that has been confirmed through numerous , stringent accuracy tests and third party security analysis .
Every voter in every local jurisdiction that uses the AccuVote - Ts should feel secure knowing that their vote will count on Election Day .
Secure voting equipment and adequate testing would assure accurate voting – if we had them .
To our knowledge , every independent third party analysis of the AccuVote - TS has found serious problems , including the Hopkins / Rice report , the SAIC report , the RABA report , the Compuware report , and now our report .
Diebold ignores all of these results , and still tries to prevent third - party studies of its system .
If Diebold really believes its latest systems are secure , it should allow third parties like us to evaluate them .

The legal dispute is over alleged misrepresentation
Yellowikis was set up in 2004 by Paul Youlten and 14 - year - old Rosa Blaus , from Sussex , to let anyone create or amend a listings page .
The website has almost 5,000 listings for firms around the world .
Yell , which operates Yell.com , has said that users could confuse the website with its own services .
In a letter to Mr Youlten , solicitors acting for Yell said that Yellowikis was " plainly purporting to be associated with our client " and that the firm 's intellectual property was under threat .
Website addresses
Yell wants Mr Youlten to shut down his site and hand over the four different website addresses for the service .
Solicitors have said they will seek damages and an injunction if he fails to respond to their requests .
A spokesman for Yell told BBC News : " Yell takes its brand and intellectual property seriously .
" Like any prudent brand owner it seeks to protect it . "
Mr Youlten has contacted a solicitor , who is examining their request .
He told BBC News : " We have not deliberately gone out to pretend to be Yell .
" It 's one of those unfortunate things .
We have a different sort of perspective than Yell .
" We consider ourselves to be a global business listing . "
Business information
Yellowikis allows users to post
Skype internet telephone numbers and video clips to listings , as well as traditional business information .
A wiki is a type of website that allows users to add , remove and edit most content .
The site is run as a hobby and not for profit , said Mr Youlten .
" We have 400 to 500 register editors who update the pages as a hobby . "
Users of the service are being asked to help choose a new name for the website and to make a donation to the legal defence fund .
" We hope they ( Yell ) understand that we did not mean to do it and that they will let us operate under a different name , " he added .
Yell is arguing that the use of the name Yellowikis , the yellow logo used by the service and its positioning at the top left of the website " amounts to a misrepresentation which may result in third parties associating the website registered in your name with out client " .

Toto , I Don't Think We 're in the Alpha Quadrant Anymore :
Nine Reasons
Why a Starfleet Education Wo n't Prepare You for the Real Navy By CDR Lesa McComas
Unlike Starfleet , where the ratio of officers to enlisted personnel is roughly 100:1 , and where the only apparent purpose of enlisted personnel is to provide anonymous crew members to be killed by alien life forms , the Navy is highly dependent on the expertise , skills and efforts of its enlisted members .
( Just remember this the next time you are putting together your away team . )
Just like in heaven there is no beer , in space there is no dirt .
Judging from the fact that we never witness Starfleet personnel engaged in activities such as cleaning heads , sweeping passageways , or inspecting berthing compartments for old Doritos wrappers and empty soda cans , one can only conclude that dirt and trash are a fairly rare commodity in the rest of the galaxy .
Based on this apparent shortage , a terrestrial - style landfill could have good long - term investment potential .
Starfleet captains seem to really like surprises .
Whenever the OOD on Voyager has something to tell Captain Janeway , he will call her on her communicator badge and say something like , " Captain , you need to get up to the bridge right away .
There 's something I think you should see . "
Without being told in advance whether she is coming up to see a Borg ship powering up its weapons array or a selection of fabrics to reupholster her command chair , the captain invariably freezes her holodeck gothic romance and heads to the bridge with the self - same degree of hair - on - fire urgency .
It 's hard to picture the Navy skipper who would n't rip the OOD 's head off for initiating this kind of uninformative summons .
Navy officers are a lot brighter than Starfleet officers ( although not , as a group , as photogenic ) .
The sole exception to this rule is our captains , who are not quite up to Starfleet standards .
As evidence of this phenomenon , note that whenever they hold wardroom meetings on Deep Space Nine , the officers just sit there with that deer - in - the - headlights look , waiting for Captain Sisko to tell them they need to realign the interstellar diffuser coagulator to prevent the worm - hole from collapsing , do a level four analysis on the data resolution imager to thwart the sneak attack from Dominion hijackers , or reverse the polarity on the integrator field to synthesize replacement DNA to kill the alien virus that is taking over Major Kira 's body .
The wardroom is incredibly lucky that the captain always knows all this stuff , because it 's pretty clear that nobody else on board has a clue what they are supposed to be doing .
Unfortunately in the Navy , although most COs are pretty smart people , they are n't anywhere near as smart as Captain Sisko .
One consequence of this is that Navy captains do n't have the luxury of populating their wardrooms with the merely photogenic , they have to keep a lot of ordinary looking subject - matter experts around to help them analyze the situation , weigh the alternatives , and develop thoughtful plans of action .
With the exception of those whose bodies have been taken over by evil alien life forms ( fortunately , an always temporary and completely reversible condition ) , all Starfleet personnel are sober , reverent , respectful , clean , brave , virtuous and completely deficient as management challenges .
The only Starfleet court martial on record turned out to be a terrible misunderstanding .
Nobody in Starfleet has ever missed a ship 's movement , called their superior officer a " sniveling weenie , " taken a kick - back from Quark 's bar , brought discredit on the service while having too much fun on liberty , or overindulged in synth - ale and tossed their cookies in the captain 's ready room .
In addition , Starfleet officers do n't have to put up with commuting on 880 , the IRS ( since they do n't seem to get paid ) , telemarketing calls from rival phone companies , incontinent pets , their neighbors ' late - night parties or , ( since so few of them ever get married ) their in - laws .
Because Starfleet leaders have so little experience dealing with adversity on a day to day basis , it 's a good thing the Federation is n't currently facing any serious threats in this sector of the galaxy .
In Starfleet , the XO gets first dibs on dating all the ensigns of the opposite gender .
In the Navy , for reasons you will no doubt recall from my GMT lecture , we have not found this to be a particularly great idea .
Starfleet does n't seem to have any clear mission .
Sure , there 's that explore the galaxy stuff , but as orders go that 's pretty darned vague .
What are their measures of effectiveness ?
The fact that they do n't seem to have any has all sorts of repercussions on the way they do business .
When Captain Picard has orders to take the Enterprise to the Cardassian system to mediate a diplomatic crisis , he still seems to have plenty of leeway , if he wants , to go a few thousand light years out of the way to observe a collapsing neutrino blue dwarf star he 's just heard about .
Unlike the Navy , where a new team of briefcase - laden experts can be expected onboard every week a ship is in port , Starfleet ships are never inspected by anybody .
With a few rare exceptions they never participate in fleet exercises , and their admirals do n't breathe down their captains ' necks to get regular updates on their level of training and material readiness .
This laissez - faire management style is probably related to the lack of a mission discussed above , and is not likely to be replicated in any segment of the naval service any time soon .
None of the officers in Starfleet went to Berkeley , Stanford , Davis or CMA , or for that matter , to Lake Wobegone State and OCS ; they all went to Starfleet Academy .
This seems like a bad plan for a variety of reasons :
One good cheating scandal , car theft ring conviction or medium sized non- nuclear blast could wipe out the better part of an entire year 's commissioning class .
Everyone in Starfleet is surrounded by people they knew , and did n't like , when they were 18 .
SFA does n't offer a broadly based liberal arts education , have fraternities and sororities , play football ( or if it does , the team must not be very good because you never hear Starfleet officers talking about it ) , have a graduate school , or offer its students a semester abroad or majors like " Product Design " and " Science , Technology & Society . "
My Brief Career as a Mutineer and What I Learned From It By CDR Lesa McComas
Part 1 : The Sea Story
As most of you probably know , I received my commission through Officer Candidate School when it was in Newport RI .
OCS was a lot like ROTC , except that when we got there we were already in debt up to our eyeballs from paying our own college tuition , we were there 24 hours a day , 6 days a week and stood watches every three nights ( which frequently seemed to involve the use of snow shovels ) , we got yelled at daily for the whole sixteen weeks rather than just the first five days , and few of the staff members bothered learn anyone 's name during that period unless we made a spectacular impression on them , either good or bad .
In other words , it was n't much like ROTC at all , but use your imagination .
For most of my tenure in Newport I was neither a spectacularly good nor spectacularly bad OC , and as a result my name was virtually unknown to everyone on the staff save my Company Officer ( and only then when I was wearing my name tag ) .
I did n't take this personally , since my aspirations at OCS consisted primarily of keeping my nose clean and doing my time , and then pinning on those gold bars and putting as much distance between myself and Newport RI as possible .
After three months of this carefully orchestrated strategy I rose to the position of First Platoon Commander , Papa Company , which I thought was a greatest assignment in the regiment .
First Platoon was responsible for cleaning the library , an effort that involved a little light dusting and window cleaning , generally done to the accompaniment of a boom box .
On the other hand , Second Platoon was responsible for cleaning the heads -- a thankless task which took about three times as long and involved the use of rubber gloves and industrial strength janitorial supplies .
I did n't know exactly what they did in other companies but some of it seemed even more distasteful , and I did n't even like to think about how the poor saps who were Company Commanders or members of the regimental staff had to spend their time .
One of my shipmates in Papa Company was a NUPOC , or Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate .
As a former enlisted person he was older than most of the rest of us recent college graduates , and tended to keep to himself .
( OK , maybe he was a little weird , but that is n't necessarily relevant to the story .
At that point in my naval career , I pretty much assumed that anyone with an interest in nuclear propulsion was going to be a little weird . )
One day , this NUPOC was unceremoniously called out of morning formation and hauled off to the Commanding Officer 's office , an event so extraordinary that it had never happened in the admittedly short corporate memory of the regiment .
Although we did n't really know what the CO did all day , we knew it did n't ordinarily involve any actual contact with Officer Candidates .
As it turned out , several weeks earlier this NUPOC had put down some less than complimentary ( but allegedly fairly amusing ) descriptions of various instructors on a confidential student feedback sheet .
After what we imagined were exhaustive comparisons of handwriting samples , he was eventually identified as the culprit and called on the carpet in front of the CO .
Rumors abounded .
He was going to be de-nuked .
He was going to be court - martialled , or at the very least disenrolled in disgrace and sent back to the fleet as an enlisted man .
In the end , he was allowed to continue in the program , although he spent the majority of his off - duty time over the remaining month marching around on the grinder , a grim but determined look on his face .
Shortly prior to commissioning , we were once again left alone in a room and told to fill out confidential student feedback sheets .
I looked around at my fellow Officer Candidates , and was suddenly struck by the absurdity of it .
Who was going to write anything even remotely negative , given the wretched fate of our classmate ?
If everyone was afraid to be critical , what was the point ?
My heart pounding , I stood up and said " I do n't know about the rest of you , but I think what they did to ( whatever his name was ) was a disgrace .
I 'm going to leave my feedback sheet blank in protest , and I 'd like you all to consider doing the same . "
Heartened by a murmur of assent , I sat down and carefully wrote my name on the top of the sheet , leaving the rest of it blank .
Unfortunately for me the most exalted of our fellow OCs , the Regimental Commander , was present in the classroom with us .
He turned out to be less than impressed by my speech , and called me down to his office that evening to tell me so in no uncertain terms .
A copy of the UCMJ in front of him , he accused me of inciting to mutiny and threatened to have me disenrolled , or maybe even court - martialled , practically on the very eve of graduation .
In retrospect , I do n't think he intended to do any such thing , but he did succeed in scaring the bejeepers out of me .
I recall that I did a lot of " voluntary " marching on the grinder in the week prior to graduation , but otherwise kept such a low profile that I was practically indistinguishable from the deck tiles .
It was n't until I marched into the gym with my classmates on the morning of commissioning that I was finally sure he was n't going to file formal charges against me .
Part 2 : Pop Quiz
What can we learn from this particular sea story ( check all that apply ) ?
The actions of the OCS staff were wrong , wrong , wrong .
The NUPOC was clueless and deserved what he got .
The XO , in her previous incarnation as an OC , was a blithering idiot .
The Regimental Commander was a jerk .
Part 3 : Quiz answers
My vote is for 1 , 2 and 3 , but not 4 , and I 'll tell you why .
The actions of the OCS staff were wrong , wrong , wrong .
If they told us our feedback would be kept in confidence , regardless of how unhappy they were with what they read , failing some evidence of a felony which might warrant such a breach of confidence they should have kept their word .
Their failure to do so gave a pretty sorry introduction to those of us unsure how the Navy was supposed to operate .
I was a blithering idiot .
No question about this one .
Although accusing me of inciting to mutiny might have been overstating the case a bit , what I did was clearly subversive and inappropriate .
The right thing to do , and what none of my classmates or I had the guts to do , would have been to discuss the matter with our Company Officer , and follow it up with a chit for request mast to tell the CO what I had to say face to face .
The fact that I did n't believe this course of action would get me anywhere but into deep doo - doo did n't excuse my lack of courage or initiative .
Contrary to what I thought at the time , The Regimental Commander was too easy on me .
Arguably , he exceeded the bounds of his authority by not reporting my breach of discipline to the Company Officer and letting him sort it out .
Many years later I realized that he probably went out on a limb for me , but it was for the best of reasons -- he wanted to punish me just enough that I 'd learn from the experience , and I think that I did .
Part 4 : Lessons Learned from the Whole Sorry Affair
Paris Hilton 's posse lashed out at Lindsay Lohan yet again with " firecrotch " ridicule .
On Friday night , after attending a Justin Timberlake concert at the House of Blues in West Hollywood , Paris Hilton , sister Nicky , Hollywood bad boy Brandon Davis and Scott Storch , the producer of Paris ' new CD , found themselves at In - N - Out Burger at 2 a.m. in Hollywood .
As they left , a photographer heard someone in the party of four use the word " firecrotch . "
You 'll recall the TMZ video in which Brandon Davis went on a now - infamous rant against Lindsay Lohan , peppering his comments by calling her a " firecrotch . "
As they left , a photographer heard the reference and asked " What did you say about firecrotch ? "
Storch replied " We 're actually celebrating firecrotch day . "
As Storch and Paris got in the vehicle which sported bright red interior ( Lindsay is famous for her red hair ) , he added " We even have firecrotch interior for the occasion . "
A photographer then asked " Did you get the interior done for firecrotch ? "
Storch promptly responded " Yes we did , in special honor of her freckled puss . "
Paris , who smiled during the entire exchange , could not contain her giggles with Storch 's parting shot .
Davis , who left in his own car , did not utter a " firecrotch " word .
He may have learned his lesson , but this feud is far from over .

The CIA , based in Langley , Virginia , may have to update its methods
The newspaper said it gathered the information from online services that compile public data , that any fee - paying subscriber can access .
It did not publish the names , at the CIA 's request .
Many of the agents are believed to be covert .
The paper also located two dozen " secret " facilities .
A CIA spokeswoman admitted the internet had scuppered some of its methods .
" Cover is a complex issue that is more complex in the internet age , " said Jennifer Dyck .
" There are things that worked previously that no longer work .

Ms Dyck declined to detail the remedies " since we do n't want the bad guys to know what we 're fixing " .

The Chicago Tribune article was headlined : " Internet blows CIA cover . "
It began : " She is 52 years old , married , grew up in the Kansas City suburbs and now lives in Virginia , in a new three - bedroom house . "
It went on to explain that the online service describes the woman in question as a CIA employee who has been assigned to several American embassies in Europe .
The CIA confirmed that she was a covert operative .
The paper also identified facilities in Chicago , northern Virginia , Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Utah and Washington state .
It said some were heavily guarded , but others appeared outwardly to be private residences .
Asked how so many personal details of CIA employees had found their way into the public domain , a senior US intelligence official told the Tribune " I do n't have a great explanation , quite frankly " .
Asked about fears that the details might be accessed by terrorist groups , he replied : " I do n't know whether al - Qaeda could do this , but the Chinese could . "
The disclosure comes as the US justice department continues an investigation into whether members of the Bush administration deliberately exposed the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Consumers can expect retail gas prices to rise to $ 4 a gallon soon , but whether they stay there depends on the long - term damage to oil facilities from Hurricane Katrina , oil and gas analysts said Wednesday .
" There 's no question gas will hit $ 4 a gallon , " Ben Brockwell , director of pricing at the Oil Price Information Service , said .
" The question is how high will it go and how long will it last ? "
OPIS tracks wholesale and retail oil prices and provides pricing information for AAA 's daily reports on fuel prices .
Brockwell said with gasoline prices now exceeding $ 3 a gallon before even reaching the wholesale level , it " does n't take a genius " to expect retail prices to hit $ 4 a gallon soon .
" Consumers have n't seen the worst of it yet , " Brockwell said .
He expects consumers in the Southeast and Northeast to be pinched first , following the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast region .
Katrina pressures gas supplies
Katrina forced operators to close more than a tenth of the country 's refining capacity and a quarter of its oil production , which sent gasoline prices surging .
Two major pipelines that supply gasoline to key terminals and distribution centers within the eastern U.S. were shut down due to power outages caused by the storm .
( Video of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman discussing U.S. plans to tap strategic oil reserve to help refiners -- 4:16 .
Click here to watch . )
Colonial Pipeline said it hopes to be back in partial operation soon , while the date of Plantation Pipeline 's restart is not clear .
Each day the pipelines are closed , supplies get backlogged and distribution centers must rely on reserves .
" With this kind of hiccup in refinery capacity , in stretched markets like California , you could see over $ 4 a gallon in gas , " Evan Smith , an analyst at U.S. Global Investors , told CNN / Money .
While it 's still too early to fully assess the damage caused by Katrina , efforts to build up inventories of crude oil , natural gas and other products like gasoline will be set back by the storm , according to Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at Global Insight .
In a research note , Behravesh laid out a worst - case scenario that puts average prices for regular unleaded gasoline at about $ 3.50 a gallon for the next four to six months .
" The impact on consumer spending in such a scenario would be very dramatic , cutting the growth rate by as much as 3 percent and pushing real GDP growth in the fourth quarter closer to zero , " he wrote .
In a best - case scenario , he forecast retail pump prices to peak at $ 3 a gallon for a couple of months , but then fall back to around $ 2.50 by year - end .
The nationwide average price for a gallon of regular unleaded hit a fresh high of $ 2.619 Wednesday , according to AAA , the largest U.S. motorist organization , formerly known as the American Automobile Association .
Average gasoline prices have gained 40 percent in the last year .
Prices for crude oil are also up sharply and are currently hovering near record highs just under $ 70 a barrel .

Thus , writing a clever piece of code that works is one thing ; designing something that can support a long - lasting business is quite another .
Commercial software design and production is , or should be , a rigorous , capital - intensive activity .
Software products should be based on a broad , deep structure that can support much more than whatever the product contains at any given time .
In addition to code that works , you need documentation , help functions , error handling , multi-platform support , and multiple languages .
You also need an underlying architecture that allows you to add and change features , purchase and integrated external software components , and allows other software vendors to make their products talk to yours , add customized widgets to it , embed your product inside something larger of their own .
A good architecture , one that will carry you for a decade 's worth of unpredictable technology and marked changes , take months to develop .
But if you skip this step , as Netscape did , you have made a truly Faustian bargain .
The problem with this [ building just what you need , instead of planning ahead ] is that these systems start getting ferociously complicated .
It comes time to fix a mistake , add a feature , replace something and you discover that everything is connected to everything else in ways you can't even begin to understand .
Because you 're doing something more ambitious than the initial academic prototype , it 's big enough that you need to partition it across a team .
The members of the team need to have a clear idea of how their work relates to everyone else 's , and they need to be able to communicate to the testers whose job it is to find errors .
Otherwise [ in other words ] , you give the patient a kidney transplant and his heart suddenly fails ; then you give him a heart drug , but that makes his lungs collapse .
You do n't know why , and you 're screwed .
And then the future comes , and you 're really screwed .
Later releases of the product inevitably are more complex , because they must continue to support previous version while adding new capabilities .
You discover that the original developers have quit or been promoted or have forgotten what they did , and it 's time to keep up with the competition by adding new features , supporting more platforms , translating into Japanese , and so forth .
The engineering team has to quadruple in size .
You start discovering things like three different groups need to change the same piece of code , and each set of changes causes problems for the others , and nobody else can test their work until that piece of code is stable , so a hundred people twiddle their thumbs for a week .
Or you want to use an existing function for some new purpose , but you can't isolate it from everything else , so you have to write it all over again .
This not only means that you have the extra time and cost of writing and maintaining twice as much code , but you probably have to ensure that the two versions work exactly alike , which they almost certainly wo n't .
With each successive release , these problems get worse .
By the time you 're on your fifth release , the decision to do your first product the quick and dirty way has probably cost you ten times what it originally saved .
A program like Microsoft 's Windows 98 is tens of millions of lines of code .
Nobody can keep that much complexity in their head or hope to manage it effectively .
So you need an architecture that says to everyone , " Here 's how this thing works , and to do your part , you need to understand only these five things , and do n't you dare touch anything else . " - C. Ferguson ( High Stakes , No Prisoners ; Times Business Press , page 107-109 )
Did Easter Island get ' ratted ' out ?
By Dan Vergano , USA TODAY WASHINGTON  Rats and Europeans are likely to blame for the mysterious demise of Easter Island , a team of anthropologists suggests .
Easter Island .

The fate of the people who built hundreds of 10 - ton stone statues on the South Pacific island and then vanished has long been seen as a cautionary environmental tale .
Natives deforested the island paradise to transport the statues , the story goes , triggering erosion that damaged farmlands .
And then they supposedly bumped themselves off in a cannibalistic civil war in about 1650 .
But anthropologist Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii at Manoa first blames the Polynesian rat .
The rats probably deforested the 66 - square - mile island 's 16 million palm trees .
" Palm tree seeds are filet mignon to rats , " Hunt says .
Working with colleagues at the island 's anthropology museum and elsewhere since 2001 , Hunt 's team has undertaken an extensive archaeological survey of the island : • Charcoal remains show that Polynesians settled the island in 1200 , much later than supposed from earlier , inaccurate dates of such deposits .
• Pollen and ash deposits show that the number of palm trees declined swiftly in the years before fires , the signature of human occupation , appeared on the island .
•
Rat remains indicate that the rodent population spiked at 20 million from 1200 to 1300 and then dropped off to a mere 1 million after the trees were gone .
• Skeletal remains and digs of old homes show little or no evidence of early warfare .

Instead , the disappearance of Easter Islanders probably was caused by visiting Dutch traders in the 1700s , who brought diseases and , later , slave raiding , says Hunt , who presented his findings at an American Anthropological Association meeting last week .
Older explanations essentially blamed the victims for their demise , says archaeologist Patricia McAnany of Boston University .
The island still represents a cautionary tale , she says , but one of the dangers of invasive species .
But New Zealand 's John Flenley of Massey University calls the idea " most unlikely , " saying rats did n't deforest other Polynesian islands .
Hunt counters that deforestation of palm trees by Polynesian rats occurred on the Hawaiian islands .
And the Easter Island palms were uniquely vulnerable because the rats had no predators and the trees did n't grow at elevations too high for them to reach .
Hunt suggests that about 50 settlers first landed on the island and grew to a stable population of at least 3,000 people by 1650 .
That seems reasonable , says mathematician William Basener of the Rochester ( N.Y. )
Institute of Technology , an expert in population models .

While thousands of people were celebrating the contribution America 's undocumented immigrants make to our economy , and demanding justice and recognition for workers who are denied basic rights , the government was making plans for large - scale detention centers in case of an " emergency influx " of immigrants .
KBR , the Halliburton subsidiary recently reprimanded for gross overcharging in its military contracts in Iraq , won a $ 385 million contract to build the centers .
According to the Halliburton website -- www.Halliburton.com-- " the contract , which is effective immediately , provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . "
What new programs might those be ?
The web was abuzz with speculation after the contract was awarded on January 24 .
Pacific News Service gave the most detailed analysis .
It connected the new " immigration emergency " plans with older plans that involved imposing martial law .
Certainly the detention centers raise the specter of WW II Japanese internment camps .
The new facilities could be used for round - ups of Muslim Americans or other American citizens tagged as " enemy combatants . ”
The use of military personnel and military contractors in the event of a Katrina - like disaster , which the Halliburton contract provides for , brings us closer to martial law , whether it is officially declared or not .
It also means record profits for Halliburton , which declared 2005 " the best in our 86 - year history . "
David Lesar , Halliburton 's chairman , president and CEO , declares on the company website , " For the full year 2005 we set a record for revenue and achieved net income of $ 2.4 billion with each of our six divisions posting record results . "
Not bad for a company that has been repeatedly cited for inflating charges and wasting taxpayer money in Iraq .
The immigration detention centers ought to raise a red flag , not just about nepotism and waste among military contractors , but about what our government has in store for us .
Perhaps the same energy that propelled immigrant rights into the national headlines could be harnessed to demand an explanation for what , exactly , Halliburton is helping to prepare for with this latest big chunk of taxpayer largess .
ヘルペスってどんな症状？
ヘルペスは同名のウイルス（HPV）に感染することで発症する皮膚病の一種です。
顔面の三叉神経にそった部分である口唇や鼻、目、また性器やその周辺に水泡が発生して同時に痛みをもたらします。
さらに水疱はしばしば破れ、潰瘍を形成することがあります。
このウイルスには近縁種があり、大きく分けるとHPV1型とHPV2型に分かれます。
大きな違いがみられるのは症状の発生する部位です。
HPV1型は口唇や顔面などが中心ですが、これに引き換えHPV2型は性器やその周辺に集中して発生します。
発症部位の違いは感染経路にもあらわれていて、HPV1型は幼少時に両親の唾液などに触れる接触感染が主です。
一方、HPV2型は思春期以降の性行為が感染経路となる性感染症です。
ウイルスの潜伏期間は3から7日間ほどですが、初回感染時は無症状で経過することが多く、数年から数十年後に再発することがよくあります。
しかし、中には初回感染時に症状が出ることもあり、水泡や痛みなどの皮膚の病変だけでなく、高熱や倦怠感など全身症状を併発するなど重症化することもあります。
特に性器ヘルペスをもたらすHPV2型の場合、初発症状は重症になりやすい傾向があります。
潜伏期間を経た後、水泡や痛みや掻痒感などの症状が出現するのは、ヘルペスウイルスが増殖しているからです。
増殖したウイルスが皮膚やその周辺の神経組織を攻撃しダメージを与えることで、水泡など病変部位を出現させて、増殖にともないさらに病変を拡大させていきます。
ここで大事なのは、治療薬の選択を間違わないことです。
症状が似通っているからといって安易に薬を使用すると、症状が悪化することもあります。
例えば、痒みや水泡など類似した症状が出るものに水虫があります。
水虫は白癬菌というカビの一種が角質層に感染する病気で、足裏だけでなく顔や性器周辺にも感染することがあります。
そこで水虫治療に効果的とされるイトラコナゾールを含んだ外用薬などを塗布しても、改善や回復は見込めません。
白癬菌などの他の微生物が減少することで、かえってHPVの繁殖を助長する恐れすらあるのです。
特にこれまで経験したことのない症状については、正しい治療の選択の観点から、早計な判断を下さないことがポイントになります。
Back to the nebulous tech hype that Register readers love to hate .
The New York Times appears to have breached two of its own ethics guidelines when it gave op - ed space to John Battelle last week to promote the Web 2.0 buzzword .
Battelle , who produced the Web 2.0 conference with MediaLive , used the space to assure us that Web 2.0 was n't really a bubble , in a curiously nervous and defensive piece .
But the Times failed to disclose that it's an investor in Battelle 's new Federated Media publishing company - a very Bubble 1.0 kind of oversight .
And neither did Battelle , until the admission was dragged out of him by Jon Garfunkel of Civilities .
net .
" Yes , The NYT Company is an investor in my company Federated Media , " confessed Battelle " I very much doubt this had anything to do with my having a chance to write this but I agree , it should have been disclosed in the Op Ed somewhere . "
Indeed so .
The Gray Lady , as the paper loves to be called , has a ponderous " Ethical Journalism Guidebook " , which it threw away for the occasion .
Guideline # 152 : tells us :
Times readers apply exacting standards to the entire paper .
They do not distinguish between staff written articles and those written by outsiders .
Thus as far as possible , freelance contributors to The Times , while not its employees , will be held to the same standards as staff members when they are on Times assignments , including those for the Times Magazine . "
Guideline # 154 covers conflict of interests :
Assigning editors in business and financial news who deal with non-staff contributors have a special duty to guard against conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflict .
To the extent possible , assigning editors should ensure that outside contributors meet the strict standards outlined in Section 12 above for the business and financial news staff .
The relevant guideline , # 114 , in Section 12 is :
No staff member may own stock or have any other financial interest in a company , enterprise or industry that figures or is likely to figure in coverage that he or she provides , edits , packages or supervises regularly .
While Guideline # 152 reminds editors not to employ freelancers who fall foul of the ethics rules .
" If they violate these guidelines , they will be denied further assignments , " it states .
So it looks like Battelle 's sparkling prose wo n't be troubling the Times op - ed readers again .
Web 2.0 organizer John Battelle Pic : John C Dvorak
" In short , the theme of the Op - Ed was that ' it 's once again safe to invest in the net again ' " , notes Garfunkel .
He told us that he had mailed the Times public editor but has yet to hear a reply .
He also observes , " ironically , given how much the blogs have ripping the NYTimes these days from TimesSelect to Judy Miller , they give bad journalism a pass when it 's sucking up to their interests . "
A failure of ' Collective Intelligence ' , we guess .
Now given the unanimity of disdain for the Web 2.0 hype - only two out of many hundreds of correspondents defended it in a recent survey - you 'd think the Times would be wiser to approach the subject with some scepticism .
But why let the facts get in the way of a cosy investment ? ®
WASHINGTON , Jan .
12 - The Interior Department has decided to open 389,000 acres of Alaskan lakes , tundra and shoreline to oil exploration , reversing an eight - year - old compromise intended to protect the habitat of hundreds of thousands of migratory birds and the hunting grounds of Inupiat natives who live near the Beaufort Sea .
Henri Bisson , the state director of the federal Bureau of Land Management in Alaska , said Thursday that the new plan would increase by as much as two billion barrels the oil that could be recovered from the northeastern section of the National Petroleum Reserve while providing protection for birds in the summer when they shed their flight feathers and hatch chicks .
Critics , including Alaska Natives and groups like the Audubon Society and the Wilderness Society , said the protection would not prevent fragmenting the birds ' habitat or the disturbance when pipelines were built .
There will be airplane and helicopter traffic , the critics said , and industrial activity will be a fixture of the collection of lakes and damp tundra that is now empty 150 miles west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Flickr has come a long way since its debut in February of 2004 .
In fact , Flickr 's traffic grew nearly 500 percent during the period between December of 2004 and 2005 .
There 's no doubt that Flickr would n't have had this type of growth if it were merely a photo storage site .
Instead , Flickr offers impressive photo - sharing features such as discussion groups and photo pools that encourage lively interaction amongst its treasured users .
This post is dedicated to the top 7 ( as organized by me ) tech - related Flickr groups .
If you think I overlooked or left a group out , please leave a comment .
Under each group description , I have included a picture exemplary of the type of photos you will find in that Flickr group .
7 ) The Ties
There are several great Flickr groups for Mac lovers but rather than choose between them , I 'll let you decide .
The largest of these groups is by no surprise the Macintosh group , nearly 9,000 members strong , that encompasses everything Mac- related from the newest MacBooks to the new retail Apple " Cube " store .
Other fine Flickr groups include Apple Porn , Cult of Mac , Apple , TUAW , Mac Addicts and The Apple Symbol .
Thousands of electronic components coalesce to form that favorite gadget of yours .
Unfortunately these electrical wonders are hidden from the populace .
The Electronic Porn group on Flickr exposes these components , circuit boards and pieces in the finest detail .
Expect many macro PCB shots .
It is a known fact that geeks and nerds alike have a wealth of gadgets .
Most techies bring them everywhere , crammed in backpacks or messenger bags .
The popular What 's In Your Bag group on Flickr provides a venue for people to display their collections .
While not everything in this group is tech related , it is nonetheless still an excellent place to waste a few minutes .
There is something captivating about the world behind the internet ; the stuff that all makes it possible .
The System Administrators group captures this unknown - by - most realm with images of mile - long aisles of servers , tangles of ethernet cables and other pictures that clue in the regular person about the life of sys admins .
Technology is great .
It makes our lives easier , allows us to communicate with others in faraway places and of course play some pretty addictive games .
But technology is n't perfect and it lets us down when it does n't work .
So what 's the solution ?
Destroying that faulty computer , gadget or what - cha - ma - call - it !
There 's no greater satisfaction than breaking something and the Abusing Personal Technology group is the premier showcase for this .
Transparent Screens is just one of those groups where every image makes you think " damn , that is cool . "
Generally considered an art only practiced by trained techies , a transparent screen involves carefully taking a picture of the workspace behind your computer and setting it as your computer 's desktop background .
If done properly , it creates the illusion that you can see through the monitor .
Believe it or not , there was no Photoshop used in this .

MAKE is a community built around people that have a passion for making things .
MAKE has gathered a massive following ever since the first publication of the quarterly MAKE magazine roughly two years ago .
The MAKE Flickr group showcases various contraptions , gadgets , devices and things that people have made .
Most make you wonder why you have n't thought of that before , while others make you wonder how the creator is still alive .
The MAKE community is one of the most thriving and rapidly growing on Flickr .
Check it out and make sure to take a look at the magazine , if it 's not sold out , the next time you 're at your local bookstore .
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic leader , characterized Mr. Bush 's move as " the latest abuse of power by the Bush White House , " while another Democrat , Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey , said in a statement that " even while the president preaches democracy around the world , he bends the rules and circumvents the will of Congress " at home .
Democrats were also angry about the refusal of the White House to turn over documents related to Mr. Bolton 's service at the State Department as well as his caustic comments about the United Nations .
In the 1990's , Mr. Bolton said that several floors of the United Nations headquarters could be lopped off without being missed .
In his remarks , Mr. Bush blamed the hold - up on " partisan delaying tactics by a handful of senators , " but Democrats countered that the handful numbered at least 42 , including one Republican .
" And it was growing , " said Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , who led the Senate opposition to Mr. Bolton .
" It may have been more people if we had ever gotten a vote . "
Senator George V. Voinovich , the Ohio Republican whose opposition to Mr. Bolton was the catalyst for the Senate 's refusal to confirm him , told reporters that he intended to send Mr. Bolton a copy of a Christian book that has served him well since his days as mayor of Cleveland in the 1980's : " The Heart and Soul of Effective Management " by James F. Hind .
" It 's basically a Christian approach to managing and motivating people , " Mr. Voinovich said , " that I thought he might read and perhaps ponder and take into consideration in terms of how he treats people up at the United Nations . "
Still , Democratic aides on Capitol Hill acknowledged that there was little their party could do beyond criticizing Mr. Bolton 's appointment , which senators did in statements of outrage that were sent via e-mail to reporters even as Mr. Bush was still speaking in the Roosevelt Room .
By 10:04 a.m. , three minutes after Mr. Bush began his remarks , Senator Edward M. Kennedy had sent out a statement that called the recess appointment " a devious maneuver " that " further darkens the cloud over Mr. Bolton 's credibility at the U.N. "
Mr. Bolton 's appointment came as Democrats on Capitol Hill were in a new fight with the White House over the records of Mr. Bush 's Supreme Court nominee , Judge John G. Roberts , when he worked in the office of the solicitor general .
But Democrats , wary that their anger over Mr. Bolton might be seen as retaliation against Judge Roberts , said that the two nominations were distinct and that they did not expect Mr. Bolton 's troubles with the Senate to affect Judge Roberts ' confirmation hearings in September .

For weeks , the blogosphere has been abuzz with tales of intrigue about Sony ’s XCP copy protection system .
Among the strangest revelations was that XCP itself infringes on the copyrights to several open source software projects .
In one case , Sam Hocevar found conclusive evidence that part of XCP ’s code was copied from a program called DRMS , which he co-authored with DVD Jon and released under the terms of the GPL open source license .
What made this finding particularly curious is that the purpose of DRMS is to break the copy protection on songs sold in Apple ’s iTunes Music Store .
Why would XCP rip off code intended to defeat another vendor ’s DRM ?
The answer is that XCP utilizes the DRMS code not to remove Apple DRM but to add it .
I ’ve discovered that XCP uses code from DRMS as part of a hidden XCP feature that provides iTunes and iPod compatibility .
This functionality has shipped on nearly every XCP CD , but it has never been enabled or made visible in the XCP user interface .
Despite being inactive , the code appears to be fully functional and was compatible with the current version of iTunes when the first XCP CDs were released .
This strongly suggests that the infringing DRMS code was deliberately copied by XCP ’s creator , First4 Internet , rather than accidentally included as part of a more general purpose media library used for other functions in the copy protection system .
This is n’t the first time another vendor has tried to make its DRM compatible with Apple ’s .
Apple ’s DRM , a system called FairPlay , places restrictions on songs purchased through the iTunes Music Store .
FairPlay is the only DRM compatible with the immensely popular iPod , and Apple has declined to license it to rival music distributors , effectively locking rivals out from the iPod platform ( at least as long as the rivals insist on using DRM ) .
In 2004 , RealNetworks attempted to work around Apple and reverse engineered FairPlay so that Real Player could create FairPlay files for use with the iPod .
Apple responded by making vague legal threats and updating iTunes to break this compatibility .
It looks like the people at First4 Internet wanted to create their own iPod compatibility system , but rather than take the time to reverse engineer FairPlay themselves , they copied critical pieces of code from DRMS in violation of the GPL license .
Intriguingly , the FairPlay compatibility code in XCP is not limited to converting files from XCP CDs .
The code appears to support conversion into FairPlay of files in a wide variety of input formats – MP3s , WAV files , raw audio files , and standard unprotected audio CDs – in addition to XCP - protected discs .
It ’s also strange that the FairPlay compatibility code is shipped but not made available for use by applications , not even XCP ’s own player software .
( Technically , the code is not exported from the shared library where it is stored . )
This might indicate that First4 Internet decided to remove the feature at the very last minute , shortly before XCP CDs started to ship .
In any case , the code is present and still works .
It ’s possible to execute it by jumping to the right memory location after performing some basic setup .
I ’ve used this method to test various aspects of the software .
Here is a screenshot of iTunes playing a protected file that I made from a regular MP3 file using the hidden XCP functionality :
It seems these findings raise more questions than they answer .
Where did the code come from ?
Since it supports audio sources other than XCP CDs , did First4 Internet license it from another vendor ?
Why did Sony disable the code but continue to ship it ?
How does iTunes compatibility fit in with Sony ’s overall copy protection strategy ?
Which is the greater evil – incompatible DRM platforms or GPL violations ?
Tune in again tomorrow when Ed will weigh in on these and other conundrums .
* * *
[ This rest of this post contains technical information about how XCP uses the DRMS code .
Feel free to stop reading now if you are n’t interested in the details . ]
Understanding how XCP uses code from DRMS requires some basic knowledge about FairPlay .
When you buy a song from the iTunes Music Store , you receive a FairPlay encrypted audio file that can only be played with knowledge of a secret key assigned to you by Apple .
iTunes retrieves this key from an Apple server , which prompts you to log in with your Apple ID and password .
Your user key is stored on your hard drive in an encrypted key database ( a file called SC Info.sidb ) .
When you play the song again , or if you try to copy it to an iPod , iTunes reads your key from the database instead of reconnecting to the server .
FairPlay ’s security depends on the encrypted key database being difficult for anyone but Apple to decipher , so it is protected using a proprietary encryption method and a system - dependent secret key .
( As security experts predicted , this protection was quickly broken ; today DRMS is able to defeat FairPlay because DVD Jon painstakingly reverse engineered the database decryption code in iTunes . )
iTunes encrypts the key database using a two step process .
First , it XORs the plaintext database with the output from a proprietary pseudorandom number generator ( PRNG ) using a system - dependent seed ; then it applies AES encryption with a system - dependent key .
As a consequence of this design , the code for the PRNG is exactly the same whether the file is being encrypted or decrypted .
To decrypt , iTunes applies AES decryption , then XORs the same PRNG output again .
This explains why parts of the DRMS code – in particular , a function called DoShuffle , which computes the PRNG ’s output – are useful for encryption as well as their original purpose , decryption .
The complex , proprietary PRNG must have been especially difficult to reverse engineer .
Rather than expend this effort themselves , XCP ’s authors appear to have lifted the DoShuffle code verbatim from DRMS .
XCP uses this code to manipulate the iTunes key database in the process of adding FairPlay protection .
Starting with an unencrypted audio file , such as a track from a protected CD , XCP compresses the audio in memory , then encrypts it using the same algorithm as FairPlay .
Instead of using an Apple - assigned user key , XCP creates a new random user key and , with the help of the DRMS code , adds it to the iTunes key database .
This ensures that the song file can only be used on the computer where it was created .
The XCP FairPlay compatibility code is contained in a file named ECDPlayerControl.ocx that is installed the first time an XCP CD is played .
Here is how the DRMS code ties in with the rest of the library .
( I ’ve provided a debugger offset for each function as an aid to other investigators . )
The DRMS DoShuffle subroutine ( 0x10089E00 ) is called from only two places , a function that encrypts the iTunes key database ( 0x1008A0C0 ) and a function that decrypts it ( 0x1008A300 ) .
Both these functions are called from only one other routine , which serves to read the key database , decrypt it , and , if necessary , to add the XCP user key to the database and write it out again in encrypted form ( 0x1008A470 ) .
This routine is called by a higher level function that converts an audio file into a FairPlay - protected AAC file ( 0x10027D20 ) .
You can test these functions by jumping into an earlier routine ( 0x10010380 , apparently the start of a thread for transferring music to iTunes ) after some simple initialization .
I ’ll happily provide serious investigators with rough sample code and instructions .
My tests indicate that XCP ’s FairPlay - compatibility code works with iTunes up to iTunes version 4.8 .
iTunes 4.9 , released June 28 , 2005 , included changes unrelated to FairPlay that cause the XCP code to fail .
XCP CDs released after this date do not appear to contain an updated version of the code .
Declassified archives document ties between CIA and Nazis
By Andre Damon
27 July 2006
On June 6 , the US national archives released some 27,000 pages of secret records documenting the CIA ’s Cold War relations with former German Nazi Party members and officials .
The files reveal numerous cases of German Nazis , some clearly guilty of war crimes , receiving funds , weapons and employment from the CIA .
They also demonstrate that US intelligence agencies deliberately refrained from disclosing information about the whereabouts of Adolf Eichmann in order to protect Washington ’s allies in the post - war West German government headed by Christian Democratic leader Konrad Adenauer .
Eichmann , who had sent millions to their deaths while coordinating the Nazis ’ “ final solution ” campaign to exterminate European Jewry , went into hiding in Buenos Aires after the fall of the Third Reich .
Utilizing friendly contacts in the Catholic Church and the Peron government in Argentina , Eichmann was able to reside in the South American country for 10 years under the alias of Ricardo Klement .
He was abducted in 1960 by Mossad , Israel ’s foreign intelligence agency , put on trial in Israel and executed in 1962 .
The documents show that the CIA was in possession of Eichmann ’s pseudonym two years before the Mossad raid .
The CIA received this information in 1958 from the West German government , which learned of Eichmann ’s alias in 1952 .
Both the CIA and the Bonn government chose not to disclose this information to Israel because they were concerned that Eichmann might reveal the identities of Nazi war criminals holding high office in the West German government , particularly Adenauer ’s national security adviser Hans Globke .
When Eichmann was finally brought to trial , the US government used all available means to protect its West German allies from what he might reveal .
According to the declassified documents , the CIA pressured Life magazine into deleting references to Globke in portions of Eichmann ’s memoirs that it chose to publish .
In addition to the revelations regarding Eichmann , the documents chronicle the CIA ’s creation of “ stay - behind ” intelligence networks in southwestern Germany and Berlin , labeled “ Kibitz ” and “ Pastime , ” respectively .
The Kibitz ring involved several former SS members .
In the early 1950s , the CIA provided these groups with money , communications equipment and ammunition so that they could serve as intelligence assets in the event of a Soviet invasion of West Germany .
The CIA documents were reviewed by Timothy Naftali , a historian with the National Archives Interagency Working Group , the government body that oversaw their declassification and release .
According to an article published by Naftali , the stay - behind program was dissolved “ in the wake of public concerns in West Germany about the resurgence of Neo - Nazi Groups . ”
Specifically , the Kibitz - 15 group , led by an “ unreconstructed Nazi , ” became a potential source of public embarrassment for the US , as its members were broadly involved in Neo - Nazi activity . [ 1 ]
The CIA terminated the program by 1955 and arranged for many of its contacts to be resettled in Canada and Australia .
According to the documents , Australia provided funds for relocation while the CIA provided its ex-assets with a “ resettlement bonus . ”
The CIA employed Gustav Hilger , a former adviser to Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop .
As an employee of the German foreign office , Hilger was present at the negotiation of the Stalin - Hitler pact in 1939 .
The CIA deemed his experience with the USSR sufficiently valuable to free him from incarceration at Fort Meade in Maryland and employ him as an intelligence evaluator in West Germany .
In 1948 , Hilger moved to the United States and obtained a position at the CIA ’s K Street building in Washington as a researcher and expert on the USSR .
Hilger eventually left the CIA to work for the West German foreign office .
According to a paper analyzing the CIA documents published by Robert Wolfe , a former senior archivist at the US National Archives , “ it is beyond dispute that Hilger criminally assisted in the genocide of Italy ’s Jews ....
During the roundup of Italian Jews in late 1943 , a note signed ‘ Hilger ’ recorded Ribbentrop ’s concurrence that the Italians be asked to intern the Jews in concentration camps in Northern Italy , in lieu of immediate deportation .
The SS intended thereby that the Italian Jews and their potential Italian protectors should believe that internment in Italy was the final destination , rather than eventual deportation to the murder mills in Poland to be immediately murdered or gradually worked to death .
The stated purpose of this ruse was to minimize the number of Italian Jews who would go into hiding to avoid deportation to Poland ” [ 2 ]
In another instance , the CIA employed Tscherim Soobzokov , a former Nazi gendarme and Waffen SS lieutenant , who , according to a paper published by Interagency Working Group Director of Historical Research Richard Breitman , “ participated in an execution commando [ combat group detailed to executing Jews and Communists en masse ] and had searched North Caucasian villages for Jews . ”
Soobzokov was employed by the CIA for seven years .
Over this period , he repeatedly used his intelligence contacts to avoid investigation by the FBI and the US Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) in regard to his complicity in war crimes .
According to Breitman ’s paper , CIA examiners noted that Soobzokov was an “ incorrigible fabricator ” who repeatedly lied about his past in order to conceal his participation in criminal activity .
Nevertheless , the CIA shielded him against investigation , at one point sending the INS a document asserting that Soobzokov had never worked for the Nazis . [ 3 ]
Prior to the outbreak of war , a significant section of the American ruling elite had favored cooperation with the Nazis as a European hedge against the spread of Bolshevism .
Henry Ford was notorious for his anti-Semitism and his political affinity for German Fascism , and a number of major American companies retained their business ties with the Third Reich .
Notably , IBM sold Germany the punch cards that were used to catalog the “ final solution . ”
( See : “ How IBM helped the Nazis IBM and the Holocaust ” )
However , as one European nation after another fell before Hitler ’s onslaught , the threat of German imperialist dominance in Europe spurred the American ruling class to enter the European theater .
US imperialism mobilized popular support in its war against the Nazi regime by appealing to the democratic and anti-fascist sentiments of the American people .
After the defeat of Germany , it organized , together with its World War II allies — Britain , the Soviet Union and France — the Nuremburg trials to prosecute top Nazi officials for their complicity in war crimes .
However , with the start of the Cold War , the United States reversed its policy of identifying , trying and executing prominent Nazi war criminals .
As is starkly demonstrated in the case of Eichmann , the knowledge possessed by many of these individuals made trying them inconvenient .
Regardless of its limited prosecution of upper - echelon Nazis , the United States had no qualms about recruiting Nazi Party members and war criminals into its military research apparatus .
Prominent German military developers such as Werner Von Braun and Bernhard Tessmann were assimilated into the US rocketry program , while Kurt Blome , a Nazi scientist who experimented on concentration camp prisoners , was employed by the US to develop chemical weapons .
Likewise , the early stages of the Cold War saw high - level Nazi cadres drafted into the US intelligence machine and deployed in Europe , the Middle East and the Americas .
According to the Department of Justice Office of Special Investigations ( OSI ) , the bureau assigned to investigate German war criminals living within the US , at least 10,000 Nazis entered the US between 1948 and 1952 .
Of the thousands of German Nazis who fled — or were brought — to the United States , only some 100 have been prosecuted by the OSI .

Windowsのユーザー・アカウントを「 Power Users（標準ユーザー）」グループに所属させるのは，ユーザーに与える権限を最低限に抑えながら，それでいて権限の小ささに伴う様々な苦痛を回避できる一般的な手法である。Power
Usersグループのメンバーであれば，ソフトウエアのインストールや電源とタイムゾーンの設定変更，ActiveXコントロールのインストールといった，「Users（制限ユーザー）」のメンバーには許可されていない様々なアクションが可能である。ただしその一方で，セキュリティが犠牲になることも忘れてはならない。
なぜな らPower Usersグループのメンバーは，自分自身をすべての権限を持つAdministrator（管理者）に昇格できることが，多くの記事によって指摘されているからだ（例：マイクロソフトのサポート技術情報「 Windows Server 2003 ，Windows 2000 ，また は Windows XP で Power Usersグループのメンバーが管理者権限およびアクセス許可を取得できる場合がある」）。ただし筆者は，この権限昇格の仕組みについて，詳細な資料を見つけられなかった。そこで筆者は，この問題について調査してみることにした。調査の全文は筆者のブログに掲載したので，ここでは重要な点を紹介しよう。
Power UsersはWindowsディレクトリに書き込みできる
まず最初に，筆者 はPower Usersグループのメンバーが 「 Windows 」ディレクトリ下にファイルを作成できることを発見した。Windows本来の設定では，AdministratorsグループのメンバーとLocal Systemアカウントにしか，Windowsディレクトリ下のファイルに対する書き込みが許可されていない。しかし，これには明らかな例外がある。「ntoskrnl.exe」である。Power Usersグループのメンバーでも，WindowsのコアOSファイルを置き換えたり書き換えたりできるのだ。本来，Windowsのシステム・ファイルが書き換えられると，5秒後にはWindowsファイル保護機能がバックアップ・ファイルを元に書き換えられたシステム・ファイルを復元する。しかし，Power Usersグループのメンバーであれば，Windowsファイル保護を回避できる。ファイルを置き換えて修正データをディスクに書き込むという単純なプログラムを実行し，Windowsファイル保護が働く前にシステムを再起動してしまうのだ。
しかし ，Power Usersグループのメンバーがこのぜい弱性を利用して上位の権限を得るには，どうすればいいのだろうか。答えは，Windowsが権限チェックに使用している「SeSinglePrivilegeCheck」という関数にあった。ユーザーは，この関数のエントリ・ポイントに対してパッチを当てるだけで，チェックされる権限をユーザーが持っていることを示す「TRUE」の値を常に返すようにできる。このように変更されたカーネル上では，ユーザーはドライバのロードやファイル所有権の取得，トークン作成などを含むすべての権限を持っているように見え，ユーザーはシステムをコントロールする管理者権限を簡単に得られるようになる。
ntoskrnl.exeを置き換えることだけが，Windowsディレクトリを経由して管理者権限の隙を突く方法というわけではない。「schedsvc.dll」に対するデフォルトのアクセス許可では，Power
Usersグループのメンバーに対する変更が許可されている。schedsvc.dllは，Windowsのタスク・スケジューラ・サービスを実装しているDLLである。Power
Usersグループのメンバーは，schedsvc.dllを他のファイル，例えばユーザーのアカウントをLocal Administratorsグループに追加してしまうような任意のDLLに置き換えられるのだ。
任意のサービス をLocal Systemアカウントで実行可能
次に筆者は ，Power Usersグループのメンバーが 「 Program Files」ディレクトリに対して持つアクセス権を調査した。そして，Power UsersグループのメンバーがProgram

筆者は ，Power Usersグループのメンバーが，「 DComLaunch」というサービスに対する書き込み権限を持っていることを見つけた。「DComLaunch」は，任意のDCOMサービスをサービスとして起動するだけでなく，非常に強力なLocal Systemアカウント権限で実行可能にするシステム・サービスである。つまりPower Usersグループのメンバーは，DComLaunchのイメージ・パスを変更して独自のイメージを参照するようにし，その上でシステムを再起動すれば，いとも簡単にシステムの管理者権限を入手できるのである。

Fewer college students choose computer majors By Michelle Kessler , USA TODAY
Tech firms might be rebounding from the dot - com bust , but enrollment in college computer programs keeps falling .
San Jose State University in Silicon Valley enrolled 417 full - time computer science undergraduates for the fall semester , down from 525 last year .
The University of Texas at Austin expects about 1,275 , down from 1,465 a year ago .
The University of Notre Dame should have 50 — better than last year , but down from 60 at the peak .
Ohio State University is down 30 % .
Nationwide data are n't available .
However , last year , the number of newly declared computer science and computer engineering majors in the USA and Canada fell 23 % vs. the year before , says the Computing Research Association , a college trade group .
The figures are n't expected to improve this year .
Blame the bleak tech job market .
In the past , a computer degree meant " instant riches , or at least a well - paying , secure job , " says San Jose computer science chair David Hayes .
" Now , the perception is jobs are going overseas , and people are being laid off . "
Students are now trying biology , nursing or other majors .
That 's not necessarily a bad thing , says Peter Lee , an associate dean at Carnegie Mellon .
His elite undergraduate program received 2,000 applicants this year , compared with 3,200 at the height of the boom .
But the students are often of higher quality , motivated more by love of technology than dreams of stock options , he says .
Still , many educators worry there wo n't be enough workers when the industry rebounds , crimping growth .
Matthew Szulik , CEO of software firm Red Hat , says he 's having trouble finding some highly skilled programmers .
The USA grants only about 6 % of the world 's engineering degrees , behind China , the European Union , Japan , Russia and India , says the National Science Foundation and tech trade group AEA .
Graduate programs have n't seen the same decline yet .
" One place you go when you can't get a job is back to school , " says computer science professor Warren Hunt at the University of Texas .
But that might change .
Many U.S. graduate programs rely on foreign students who come here to study .
In the USA and Canada , 43 % of computer science and engineering recipients are non-resident aliens , the CRA says .
New security regulations might be keeping these students from applying .
In India , the number of students taking the Graduate Record Exam , the test required for most applicants to U.S. graduate schools , fell 56 % this school year , vs. last , test administrators say .
In China , test - taking fell 52 % .
A thousand years from now , who will observe this doleful anniversary ?
From that perspective , will the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history seem like a blip on the wide screen of history , or a turning point in the saga of the rising American Imperium ?
Although I ’d be willing to bet on the latter , we ca n’t know , but one thing we do know for sure : 9/11 looms large over the world of 2006 .
Its gigantic shadow cast a pall over the West , paralyzing rational thought and inaugurating a new age of perpetual war  a “ clash of civilizations , ” in Samuel Huntington ‘s phrase .
In the five years since the twin towers fell , the clear victor in this epic battle is Osama bin Laden , still at large and threatening us with fresh attacks .
His trail long since grown “ stone cold , ” as the Washington Post puts it , bin Laden is a hero to millions .
I would venture to say he is the most popular Muslim leader , and certainly the preeminent Middle Eastern Arab leader .
The inspirer and progenitor of 9/11 has attained the status of a living myth , and , as long as he remains at large , his mythic stature will only grow .
And yet President Bush , after initially declaring he wanted the al - Qaeda leader “ dead or alive , ” did not mention him by name for years .
However , that kind of pretense is hard to keep up , and certainly this dark anniversary required the White House to suddenly recall Osama bin Forgotten .
One can see why they ’d rather forget , because the mere mention of his name is enough to invoke the circumstances whereby he was allowed to get away .
In what sense this result was “ allowed ” is for history to judge .
All I can do is ruefully note what the Washington Post reported :
“ Many factors have combined in the five years since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks to make the pursuit more difficult .
They include the lack of CIA access to people close to al - Qaeda ’s inner circle ; Pakistan ’s unwillingness to pursue him ; the reemergence of the Taliban and al - Qaeda in Afghanistan ; the strength of the Iraqi insurgency , which has depleted U.S. military and intelligence resources ; and the U.S. government ’s own disorganization . ”
The diversion of resources away from the fight against al - Qaeda and toward effecting “ regime change ” in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East has been a godsend to the Islamist radicals who burn with hatred for America and yearn to top the terror of 9/11 .
In an excellent CNN documentary on bin Laden shown the other night , Peter Bergen reported the post - 9/11 judgment of many of bin Laden ’s comrades was that the whole thing was a mistake .
Suddenly they had this unrelenting nemesis on their backs : a whole layer of the top leadership was lopped off , and those that survived were on the run .
The big news in the above - sourced Washington Post story , however , is that bin Laden ’s own flight from the mountains of Tora Bora was apparently captured on videotape , which has been obtained by the CIA .
The tape shows bin Laden
“ [ C ] onfidently instructing his party how to dig holes in the ground to lie in undetected at night .
A bomb dropped by a U.S. aircraft can be seen exploding in the distance .
‘ We were there last night , ’ bin Laden says without much concern in his voice .
He was in or headed toward Pakistan , counterterrorism officials think .
“ That was December 2001 .
Only two months later , Bush decided to pull out most of the special operations troops and their CIA counterparts in the paramilitary division that were leading the hunt for bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for war in Iraq , said Flynt L. Leverett , then an expert on the Middle East at the National Security Council .
“ ‘I was appalled when I learned about it , ’ said Leverett , who has become an outspoken critic of the administration ’s counterterrorism policy .
‘ I do n’t know of anyone who thought it was a good idea .
It ’s very likely that bin Laden would be dead or in American custody if we had n’t done that . ’
Several officers confirmed that the number of special operations troops was reduced in March 2002 . ”
Perhaps just as appalling is this eerie video , which makes one wonder just how closely we tracked bin Laden .
Unless they just plucked it off the Internet  could it have been part of al - Qaeda ’s propaganda effort , posted on some jihadist Web site ?
 our government ’s possession of the tape indicates just how close they came to him , and how just a little more sustained effort might very well have nabbed him .
Given the above , we can say , with fair certainty  and a certain rectitude in our voice  that bin Laden was allowed to get away .
Not inadvertently , as an unintended consequence of a mistaken policy , but as the result of a conscious decision that made the invasion of Iraq a higher priority than the capture of the terrorist leader .
It was more important to carry out the neoconservative agenda in the Middle East  to raise the flag of the president ’s “ global democratic revolution ”  by force of arms .
It was more vital to our interests to enable the Israelis in their campaign to build an impregnable Fortress Israel out of the broken lives and hopes of their Palestinian helots , to give a “ green light ” to the invasion of Lebanon , and to set up Syria and Iran for “ regime change . ”
Bin Laden ?
9/11 ?
Forget it , buster  that was just a pretext , a catalyzing event that allowed a well –organized network with a preexisting agenda to move quickly and with determination to implement its plan .
The recently issued “ phase two ” of the Senate Intelligence Committee report  see here  shows how this administration bent the facts and twisted the intelligence to lie us into war .
It turns out the CIA warned the administration that there were no links to al - Qaeda , which we knew already , but the really devastating part of the report is the section dealing with the role of Ahmed Chalabi‘s Iraqi National Congress .
That the INC was simultaneously an Iranian intelligence asset and an American client , and that we knew this and still sponsored Chalabi & Co. , tells us all we need to know about this administration and its Bizarro World mindset .
As the report notes , on March 3 , 1995 , “ Chalabi made contact with Iranian intelligence officials to discuss Iran ’s positive support on the planned action [ a coup against Saddam ] and their support for possible action against Southern Iraq . ”
He did so with American approval : our guy “ was present outside the meeting space , was seen by the Iranians , and was aware that Chalabi intended for the Iranians to see him there as a signal of U.S. support . ”
Yesterday , we worked in tandem with the Iranians to overthrow Saddam Hussein , with our agent standing literally outside the door as Chalabi chatted with his Iranian handlers , and today we are ringing the alarm bells over the supposedly dire threat posed by Tehran .
Our State Department routinely refers to Iran as the world ’s number - one exporter of terrorism , and yet here we have solid evidence of an American - INC - Iranian axis of convenience .
We pride ourselves on never negotiating with purported terrorists , and yet we are apparently not above allying with them .
If this is supposed to be some sort of Machiavellian deviousness , then it seems the Americans outwitted themselves : they are fighting a monster of their own creation .
Iran is yet another diversion away from al - Qaeda , and a conflict with Tehran is bound to help bin Laden with what is , perhaps , his biggest problem , and that is the big split in the Muslim “ Ummah ” between Shi’ite and Sunni doctrine .
Instead of fighting each other in Iraq , the sectarian factions will turn their sights on a common enemy : the invading Crusaders , as bin Laden would put it , and their Israeli allies .
Michael Scheuer , head of the CIA ’s bin Laden unit until 1999 and author of Imperial Hubris , says that the U.S. is bin Laden ’s “ one indispensable ally , ” and it certainly seems that way , does n’t it ?
We could n’t be helping his cause more if we directly subsidized it : our Middle East policy , spelled out plainly as unconditional support for Israel and local despots , is a virtual recruiting poster for al - Qaeda .
The Iraq war , the rape of Lebanon , the gathering threat to Syria and Iran  if bin Laden is telling the Muslim world that the Crusaders are moving to eliminate Islam from the face of the earth , then our actions confirm his prognosis on a daily basis .
There are those who deny the very existence of bin Laden and disdain al - Qaeda as a myth , the creation of the “ real ” perpetrators of the worst terrorist attack in American history  the U.S. government itself .
You and I saw those two planes crash into the World Trade Center , and we saw the Pentagon hit  but who are you going to believe , those Alexander Cockburn calls the “ 9/11 conspiracy nuts ” or your lying eyes ?
I agree with Cockburn ’s critique of the utterly daffy “ controlled demolition ” thesis , and the equally crackpot delusion that the Pentagon was hit by a missile instead of a jetliner .
Yet there is more here than meets the eye
A whole movement has grown up , apparently , the so - called “ 9/11 Truth ” movement , which seeks to show well , it is n’t quite clear .
Some 9/11 - Truthers think an evil cabal within the U.S. government plotted the whole thing from beginning to end , although when it comes to naming names and drawing up a bill of indictment , the Truthers stumble on their lack of specifics .
The jet fighters that might have intercepted the hijacked planes were delayed  deliberately , of course , since no government has ever been guilty of incompetence , heaven forfend !
 and the rest is history .
And if you think these people are just fringe nut - jobs , take a look at the polls .
As the Seattle Times reports :
“ A recent Scripps Howard / Ohio University poll of 1,010 Americans found that 36 percent suspect the U.S. government promoted the attacks or intentionally sat on its hands .
Sixteen percent believe explosives brought down the towers .
Twelve percent believe a cruise missile hit the Pentagon .
Distrust percolates more strongly near Ground Zero .
A Zogby International poll of New York City residents two years ago found 49.3 percent believed the government ‘ consciously failed to act . ' ”
These people are not crazy : they are smart enough to question the “ accepted ” narrative , and their skepticism of governmental beneficence is healthy and quintessentially American .
The problem with the 9/11 Truthers is not that they question the conventional 9/11 narrative , but that their alternative explanations defy common sense  and divert attention away from the core mystery of 9/11 , which is : how in the name of all that ’s holy did a conspiracy envisioned on such a large scale , and stretching over at least five years , go undetected ?
Yes , governments are incompetent , but there were key people in government who were fully aware of the threat posed by bin Laden and his followers .
In the months and weeks leading up to the attack , the president was presented with the evidence , including an Aug. 6 memo entitled “ Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States . ” [ .pdf ]
It ’s not as if , prior to 9/11 , the terrorist threat had never been raised : I seem to remember at least one New Year when the color code would have gone to a slightly reddish orange if we ’d had color - coded terror alerts back then .
Yet , in spite of the multi-billions spent on “ anti- terrorist ” measures , 19 hijackers managed to penetrate American society and carry out a synchronized terror assault on two major targets , twin symbols of U.S. financial and military power .
For all the scrutiny invited by bin Laden , it surpasses understanding how not even an inkling of his plan was picked up by any intelligence agency , anywhere .
None of our allies picked up the scent : not the Brits , not the intelligence services of our local satraps , including the Pakistanis , with their links to the Taliban  not even the Mossad , with its legendary prowess as the most ruthlessly efficient of the lot .
Of course , if you believe Carl Cameron and Fox News , which reported that the Israelis did indeed know that something pretty awful was going to happen on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and somehow neglected to tell us all they knew , then this last does not apply .
In mid-December 2001 , Cameron told his viewers :
“ Since Sept. 11 , more than 60 Israelis have been arrested or detained , either under the new PATRIOT anti-terrorism law , or for immigration violations .
A handful of active Israeli military were among those detained , according to investigators , who say some of the detainees also failed polygraph questions when asked about alleged surveillance activities against and in the United States .
“ There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9/11 attacks , but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance , and not shared it .
A highly placed investigator said there are ‘ tie-ins . ’
But when asked for details , he flatly refused to describe them , saying , ‘ evidence linking these Israelis to 9/11 is classified .
I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered .
It ’s classified information . ' ”
So how come the 9/11 conspiracy nuts are n’t demanding the immediate declassification of the evidence for these alleged “ tie-ins ” ?
After all , here is a source that can hardly be accused of being part of the Bush - bashing Left , and is not exactly hostile to Israel .
On account of its pro-administration , pro-Israel orientation , Fox News ’ reporting on this subject is all the more credible .
You ’d think the conspiracy theorists would be all over it .
But you ’d be wrong .
Instead , they prattle on about “ controlled demolition , ” a missile striking the Pentagon , and other wild “ theories ” that only discredit all attempts to examine and revise the official 9/11 narrative .
Like Bush going into Iraq , the “ demolitionists ” and their brethren divert scarce resources  and limited attention spans  away from the really baffling anomalies , like this , for example .
The suspicions many Americans have about the official 9/11 narrative do n’t seem all that unreasonable to me .
What does seem unreasonable is the attempt to deride any effort to put 9/11 in its full context as “ conspiracy theory ” and worse .
The unsolved mysteries of 9/11 continue to haunt us , and will remain with us as long as the real history of that signal event is shrouded in murk and protected by taboos .

He says that he 's never found the right order for the ideas in the title .
Computer companies in the 1960s thought Moore 's law meant that they 'd get higher margins .
Web presses are amazing pieces of technology , but when you look at it , you do n't see anything that tells you about how it changes things .
Similarly , looking at the DynaBook in 1968 does n't tell you the most important things .
Thus , the idea of a $ 100 laptop is n't important because of the technology .
Half the price of a typical laptop is the marketing and distribution .
Get a non-profit and drop that .
Half of the remaining cost is Microsoft , or more generally commercial software vendors .
Free and open source software more than adequately covers the computing needs of most people , particularly children .
The fact that there are $ 122 DVD players says you can build a $ 100 laptop .
The cheapest hard drives are too expensive ; so use flash memory .
One big problem is the grey market .
They 'll be diverted from children unless you do something to protect the laptop .
A few ideas : an RFID card keyed to the specific owner helps .
The device is networked , so the owner of the device has to log in every few days to get a token to keep it working .

Pro-choice groups feel Roberts might not be sympathetic
Mr Roberts , a Roman Catholic , told the committee examining his nomination that the 1973 ruling legalising abortion was " settled as a precedent of the court " .
He denied his faith would influence his decisions if he was chosen for the job .
President Bush nominated Mr Roberts to be the country 's top judge after the death of William Rehnquist this month .
Correspondents say the Senate is expected to back Mr Roberts , 50 .
Divisive debate
Asked about the court 's landmark ruling on the issue of abortion , Roe vs Wade , Mr Roberts called it a " very important consideration " .
JOHN ROBERTS
Born in Buffalo , raised in Indiana Graduated from Harvard in 1979 Was clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and then served in the Reagan administration Serves on the District of Columbia appeals court Has argued before the Supreme Court 39 times
Profile : John Roberts
The issue of abortion has long been a deeply divisive one in the US .
None of the Senate 's 100 members have declared their opposition to Mr Roberts but some civil rights groups have expressed concern .
Some abortion rights campaigners are worried Mr Roberts may be sympathetic to an attempt to make abortions more difficult to obtain .
Civil rights
On the second day of his confirmation hearing , Mr Roberts came under intense criticism from Democrats , one of whom , Joe Biden , accused him of giving " misleading " answers .
" Go ahead and continue not to answer , " Senator Biden said .
But he was in turn accused of interrupting Mr Roberts , who argued the senator would have had a whole answer had he allowed him to speak out .
Democrats also questioned Mr Roberts about his writings on civil rights dating back to his years as a lawyer in Ronald Reagan 's administration .
Senator Edward M Kennedy accused him of showing a " narrow , cramped and mean - spirited view " in those writings , and of failing to show a full appreciation of discrimination .
But Mr Roberts denied having a problem with the 1965 Voting Rights Act , which guaranteed the right to vote to African American citizens .
" The constitutionality has been upheld , and I do n't have any issue with that , " he said .
He was also questioned on women 's rights , the fight against terror and the balance of power between the branches of government .
The hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee is due to be completed this week .
It is the panel 's first Supreme Court confirmation for 11 years .
On a recent visit to New York , Mark Young was casually chatting with the ticket taker at the Empire State Building , only to have the conversation take an unexpected turn .
" He asked me where I was from .
I said , ' Wyoming , ' and he said , ' Why do you guys get all of the homeland security money ? ' " Mr. Young recounted .
" He did n't even know that I was the fire chief [ in Casper ] , " he noted , " or that I had anything to do with it . "
Since Congress first dispensed money after 9/11 to help local officials prepare for future acts of terrorism , New Yorkers have been rankled by the notion that people in rural states like Wyoming get almost twice as much per capita as they do .
It 's a feeling based not only on having experienced 9/11 firsthand , but also in knowing that New York remains a top target .
This week , Congress might do something to change that .
A House - Senate conference committee will decide how much risk should factor into the decision about how to distribute homeland security money .
Big , vulnerable states like New York are in favor of a more risk - based formula , but they 're getting a fight from lawmakers in small states , who contend they also have vulnerabilities and just as much right to protect themselves .
The dispute started earlier this year , when the Senate passed an appropriations bill that essentially shares 75 percent of homeland - security funds equally between the 50 states , with the other 25 percent being allocated according to risk .
That 's favored by most smaller states .
But this July , the House passed an amendment to the Patriot Act that would turn this formula on its head .
Only 25 percent would be shared equally by the states , although even to qualify for that , each state would have to prove why they needed the money .
Border states could qualify for more .
But most of the money would be given based totally on how much risk each location faced .
The 9/11 commission recommended more than a year ago that all homeland security money be allocated based on risk .
Most terrorism experts and lawmakers from big states are in full agreement .
" The current formula is distributed as pork barrel , the same amount to everybody , no matter what , and it does n't make sense , " says Rep. Nita Lowey ( D ) of New York , who wrote the House amendment .
" New Yorkers are not very pleased about being No. 1 , but if we are No. 1 in the risk / threat / vulnerability category , we clearly should get the resources so that we can be prepared . "
People from states like Wyoming recognize that New York has a case .
But they believe they have vulnerabilities as well and an equal right to federal funds to protect themselves .
" My state has a great deal of energy production and infrastructure that involves substantial Homeland Security risk , " wrote Sen. Craig Thomas ( R ) of Wyoming in an e-mail interview .
" As we 've seen the hurricanes impact our energy infrastructure on the Gulf Coast , it further underlines the importance of safeguarding our nation 's energy interests . "
Representative Lowey does n't dispute this but says that under her formula , all Wyoming would have to do is to make a good case for why they should get more money .
" They should n't automatically get more per capita than states that have high risks .
That 's the bottom line , " she says .
" They 'll be getting enough money to prepare their police , their firefighters , but fortunately they do n't have the threats that we have in New York . "
But Chief Young of Casper , Wyo. , argues that looking at the issue on a per capita basis can be misleading .
For instance , according to the Congressional Research Service , in 2005 Wyoming got $ 27.80 per person in homeland - security funds , and New York got $ 15.54 .
But the total dollar amounts that they translated into were vastly different .
Wyoming 's total was only $ 13.9 million , while New York 's total was $ 298.3 million .
" Dollarwise there 's a big , big difference , " says Young .
" And I think we 've spent our money very wisely . "
Some smaller states and districts have been criticized for using homeland - security money to fund things like fitness programs , Segway scooters , air - conditioned garbage trucks , and even homeland - security rap songs .
Natrona County in Wyoming , where Casper is located , used its money to buy a new communications system so the police , fire , EMS , and public - health facilities can all speak with one another during a disaster .
That 's one of the top recommendations of the 9/11 commission - something New York , with a police department that 's bigger than the FBI , is still working on accomplishing , primarily because of the cost .
And that 's one reason Lowey is determined that her amendment be accepted by the Senate as well as the House .
" We 're all still part of the United States of America , and just like we all realized that we have to rise above our immediate needs and help those who 've been impacted by Katrina , " she says , " we need to make sure cities like New York and others that are facing tremendous threats get the money so they can prepare . "
The conference committee is expected to make a decision this week .
Security feature in Microsoft 's new Windows could drive users nuts SEATTLE 
An annoying surprise awaits 2 million consumers expected to enthusiastically step forward in the next few weeks to help Microsoft test its new Windows Vista PC operating system .
Volunteers will test Vista Beta 2 , a near - final version of the much - hyped upgrade of Windows .
The testing is the last step leading up to Vista 's broad consumer release , scheduled for January .
Beta 2 testers can expect to encounter an obtrusive security feature , called User Account Control ( UAC ) .
Designed to prevent intruders from performing harmful tasks , the feature grays out the computer screen , then prods you to confirm that you really want to do certain functions .
In early test versions , the queries crop up so often that they interrupt routine tasks , such as changing the time clock or deleting shortcuts .
And UAC sometimes triggers an endless loop of dialogue boxes that can be curtailed only by rebooting , says Paul Thurrott , news editor of Windows IT Pro magazine .
" Microsoft completely botched UAC , " Thurrott says .
" It 's almost criminal in its insidiousness . "
Microsoft counters that refinements are being continually made .
" The final product will be very usable and have a good balance of security , " says Windows senior product manager Alex Heaton .
Once scheduled to arrive in 2004 , Vista has been beset by delays , the latest nudging its public launch from fall to early 2007 .
Vista improves on Windows XP ; it is the cornerstone of the software giant 's push to extend its products deeper into the workplace and home .
Yet Microsoft has struggled to infuse Vista with tighter security , partly because of a decision to let older software applications run on it , says Michael Cherry , tech security analyst at Directions on Microsoft .
Most Windows applications are written to take advantage of the fact that the operating system treats users as " system administrators " with carte blanche to alter basic system configurations .
Trouble is , this has opened the door for cybercrooks to infect Windows with malicious programs that steal data and use infected PCs to carry out cyberfraud .
Microsoft should have set stricter parameters for Vista , Cherry says .
But it has n't required software developers to retool system administrator access .
Instead , it devised workarounds .
The result : UAC 's labyrinth of dialogue boxes .
" Windows historically has been wide open , " says Andrew Jaquith , senior analyst at the Yankee Group .
" By trying to restrict what people can do , it 's going to cause a lot of pain . "
Security experts worry that Vista users will dismiss the dialogue boxes , clicking through them rapidly and undermining any security benefit .
Or they will figure out how to turn off UAC .
" Consumers , sadly , are probably going to disable it , " Thurrott says .
Enlarge Microsoft Dialogue boxes like this one could get annoying for Vista beta testers .

Here are common questions about the virus and your safety and health .
Petrodollar Theories of the War A small but significant number of observers consider the issues around which the newspaper discussions of the Iraq war revolve to be nothing but a screen that hides other causes fueling the present conflict -- causes that require some knowledge of economics to grasp .
According to this view , a leading motive of the U.S. in the Iraq war -- perhaps the fundamental underlying motive , even more than the control of the oil itself -- is an attempt to preserve the U.S. dollar as the leading oil trading currency , on the view that the institution of petrodollars , as these have developed since the early 1970s , is fundamental to well - being of the U.S. economy .
A corollary of this view is that the real underlying antagonism in the conflict is not a military or geopolitical or national - security issue between the U.S. and Iraq , but rather an economic struggle between the U.S. and Europe .
Below are three such arguments and a link to a fourth .
The first two pieces are by Canadians and the third is by an Australian .
( Following these pieces is a link to a less expert analysis by an American who is a self - confessed novice in analyzing international affairs . )
1 . AMERICA'S WAR AGAINST EUROPE Paul Harris
YellowTimes.org Columnist ( Canada )
February 2003
There are many reasons for George Bush 's single - minded drive toward Baghdad .
In other articles I have written for YellowTimes.org I hinted that a not so obvious reason for the drive against Iraq is Bush 's war against Europe .
In fact , I have now come to believe that is the primary reason for his Iraqophenia .
Whenever a nation decides to go to war , there are plans made for who is going to win and who is going to lose ; no one goes to war expecting to lose but it is n't always the obvious target of the aggression that is the real thrust behind the war .
Sometimes , it is n't a case of what you expect to win from a war but rather a case of what you hope someone else loses ; and it does n't have to be your stated enemy who you hope will sustain the losses .
In this case , Bush 's hoped - for victim is the European economy .
It is robust , and is likely to become much stronger in the easily foreseeable future .
Britain 's entry into the European Union is inevitable ; Scandinavia will join sooner rather than later .
Already , even without those countries , there will be 10 new member nations in May 2004 which will swell the GDP of the E.U. to about $ 9.6 billion with 450 million people as against $ 10.5 billion and 280 million people in the United States .
This represents a formidable competing block for the United States but the situation is significantly more complex than what is revealed just by those numbers .
And much of it hinges on the future of Iraq .
I have written before , as have many others , that this upcoming war is about oil .
To be sure there are other reasons , but oil is the single most impelling force .
Not in the way you might expect , however .
It is n't so much that there are believed to be huge untapped oil reserves in Iraq , untapped only due to outdated technology ; it is n't so much an American desire to get its grubby hands on that oil ; it is much more a question of whose grubby hands the Americans want to keep it out of .
What precipitated all of this was not September 11 , nor a sudden realization that Saddam was still a nasty guy , nor just the change in leadership in the United States .
What precipitated it was Iraq 's November 6 , 2000 switch to the euro as the currency for its oil transactions .
At the time of the switch , it might have seemed daft that Iraq was giving up such a lot of oil revenue to make a political statement .
But that political statement has been made and the steady depreciation of the dollar against the euro since then means that Iraq has derived good profits from switching its reserve and transaction currencies .
The euro has gained about 17 percent against the dollar since that time , which also applies to the $ 10 billion held in Iraq 's United Nations " oil for food " reserve fund .
So the question arises , as it did for George Bush , what happens if OPEC makes a sudden switch to euros ?
In a nutshell , all hell breaks loose .
At the end of World War II , an agreement was reached at the Bretton Woods Conference which pegged the value of gold at $ 35 per ounce and that became the international standard against which currency was measured .
But in 1971 , Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and ever since the dollar has been the most important global monetary instrument , and only the United States can produce them .
The dollar , now a fiat currency [ i.e. , " money that is made legal tender by the decree , or fiat , of the government but that is not covered by a specie reserve " ( Columbia Encyclopedia , 6th ed. ) ] , is at a 16 - year trade - weighted high despite record U.S. current - account deficits and the status of the U.S. as the leading debtor nation .
The U.S. national debt as of April 4 , 2002 was $ 6.021 trillion against GDP of $ 9 trillion .
Trade between nations has become a cycle in which the U.S. produces dollars and the rest of the world produces things that dollars can buy .
Nations no longer trade to capture comparative advantage but rather to capture needed dollars to service dollar - denominated foreign debts and to accumulate dollar reserves in order to sustain the exchange value of their domestic currencies .
In an effort to prevent speculative and potentially harmful attacks on their currencies , those nations ' central banks must acquire and hold dollar reserves in amounts corresponding to their own currencies in circulation .
This creates a built - in support for a strong dollar that in turn forces the world 's central banks to acquire and hold even more dollar reserves , making the dollar stronger still .
This phenomenon is known as " dollar hegemony , " which is created by the geopolitically constructed peculiarity that critical commodities , most notably oil , are denominated in dollars .
Everyone accepts dollars because dollars can buy oil .
The reality is that the strength of the dollar since 1945 rests on being the international reserve currency for global oil transactions ( i.e. , " petro- dollar " ) .
The U.S. prints hundreds of billions of these fiat petro-dollars , which are then used by nation states to purchase oil and energy from OPEC producers ( except presently Iraq and , to some degree , Venezuela ) .
These petro-dollars are then re-cycled from OPEC back into the U.S. via Treasury Bills or other dollar - denominated assets such as U.S. stocks , real estate , etc .
The recycling of petro-dollars is the price the U.S. has extracted since 1973 from oil - producing countries for U.S. tolerance of the oil - exporting cartel .
Dollar reserves must be invested in U.S. assets which produces a capital - accounts surplus for the U.S. economy .
Despite poor market performance during the past year , U.S. stock valuation is still at a 25 - year high and trading at a 56 percent premium compared with emerging markets .
The U.S. capital - account surplus finances the U.S. trade deficit .
Since it is the U.S. that prints the petro- dollars , they control the flow of oil .
Period .
When oil is denominated in dollars through U.S. state action and the dollar is the only fiat currency for trading in oil , an argument can be made that the U.S. essentially owns the world 's oil for free .
So what happens if OPEC as a group decides to follow Iraq 's lead and suddenly begins trading oil on the euro standard ?
Economic meltdown .
Oil - consuming nations would have to flush dollars out of their central bank reserves and replace them with euros .
The dollar would crash in value and the consequences would be those one could expect from any currency collapse and massive inflation ( think of Argentina for an easy example ) .
Foreign funds would stream out of U.S. stock markets and dollar denominated assets , there would be a run on the banks much like the 1930s , the current account deficit would become unserviceable , the budget deficit would go into default , and so on .
And that 's just in the United States .
Japan would be particularly hard hit because of total dependence on foreign oil and incredible sensitivity to the U.S. dollar .
If Japan 's economy tumbles , so does that of many other countries , especially the United States in a crescendo of dominos .
Now this is the potential effect of a " sudden " switch to euros .
A more gradual shift might be manageable but even that would change the financial and political balance of the world .
Given the size of the European market , its population , its need for oil ( it actually imports more oil than the U.S. ) , it may be rapidly approaching that the euro will become the de facto monetary standard for the world .
There are some good reasons for OPEC as a group to follow Iraq and begin to value oil in euros .
There seems little doubt that they would relish the opportunity to make a political statement after years of having to kowtow to the U.S. , but there are solid economic reasons as well .
The mighty dollar has reigned supreme since 1945 , and in the last few years has gained even more ground with the economic dominance of the United States .
By the late 1990s , more than four - fifths of all foreign exchange transactions , and half of all world exports , were denominated in dollars .
In addition , U.S. currency accounts for about two thirds of all official exchange reserves .
The world 's dependency on U.S. dollars to pay for trade has seen countries bound to dollar reserves , which are disproportionately higher than America 's share of global output .
It is important to note that the euro is not at any disadvantage versus the dollar when one compares the relative sizes of the economies involved , especially given the E.U. enlargement plans .
Moreover , the E.U. has a bigger share of global trade than the U.S. and while the U.S. has a huge current account deficit , the E.U. has a more balanced external accounts position .
One of the more compelling arguments for keeping oil pricing and payments in dollars has been that the U.S. remains a large importer of oil , despite being a substantial producer itself .
But the EU is an even larger importer of oil and petroleum products than the U.S. , and represents for OPEC a more attractive market , closer and less domineering .
The point of Bush 's war against Iraq , therefore , is to secure control of those oil fields and revert their valuation to dollars .
Then to increase production exponentially and force prices to drop .
Finally , to threaten significant action against any of the oil producers who would switch to the euro .
In the long run , then , it is not really Saddam who is the target ; it is the euro and , therefore , Europe .
There is no way the United States will sit by idly and let those upstart Europeans take charge of their own fate , let alone of the world 's finances .
Of course , all of this depends on Bush 's insane plan not becoming the trigger for a Third World War , as it so readily might .

2 . BUSH'S DEEP REASONS FOR WAR ON IRAQ : OIL , PETRODOLLARS , AND THE OPEC EURO QUESTION Peter Dale Scott
University of California , Berkeley
Updated March 13 , 2003 [ Note : at the address above this essay contains many hotlinks to relevant documents . ]
As the United States made preparations for war with Iraq , White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer , on 2/6/03 , again denied to US journalists that the projected war had " anything to do with oil . " < 1 >
He echoed Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld , who on 11/14/02 told CBS
News that " It has nothing to do with oil , literally nothing to do with oil . "
Speaking to British MPs , Prime Minister Tony Blair was just as explicit : " Let me deal with the conspiracy theory idea that this is somehow to do with oil .
There is no way whatever if oil were the issue that it would not be infinitely simpler to cut a deal with Saddam .... " ( London Times 1/15/03 )
Nor did Bush 's State of the Union Message , or Colin Powell 's address to the United Nations Security Council , once mention the word " oil . "
Instead the talk was ( in the president 's words ) of " Iraq 's illegal weapons programs , its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors , and its links to terrorist groups . "
However our leaders are not being candid with us .
Oil has been a major US concern about Iraq in internal and unpublicized documents , since the start of this Administration , and indeed earlier .
As Michael Renner has written in Foreign Policy in Focus , February 14 , 2003 , " Washington 's War on Iraq is the Lynchpin to Controlling Persian Gulf Oil . "
But the need to dominate oil from Iraq is also deeply intertwined with the defense of the dollar .
Its current strength is supported by OPEC 's requirement ( secured by a secret agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia ) that all OPEC oil sales be denominated in dollars .
This requirement is currently threatened by the desire of some OPEC countries to allow OPEC oil sales to be paid in euros .
The Internally Stated US Goal of Securing the Flow of Oil from the Middle East As early as April 1997 , a report from the James A. Baker Institute of Public Policy at Rice University addressed the problem of " energy security " for the United States , and noted that the US was increasingly threatened by oil shortages in the face of the inability of oil supplies to keep up with world demand .
In particular the report addressed " The Threat of Iraq and Iran " to the free flow of oil out of the Middle East .
It concluded that Saddam Hussein was still a threat to Middle Eastern security and still had the military capability to exercise force beyond Iraq 's borders .
The Bush Administration returned to this theme as soon as it took office in 2001 , by adopting , some say commissioning , a second report from the same Institute .
( This Task Force Report was co-sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York , another group historically concerned about US access to overseas oil resources . )
As reported by the Scotland Sunday Herald ( 10/6/02 ) , " President Bush 's Cabinet agreed in April 2001 that `Iraq remains a destabilising influence to the flow of oil to international markets from the Middle East ' and because this is an unacceptable risk to the US `military intervention ' is necessary .
" Vice - president Dick Cheney , who chairs the White House Energy Policy Development Group , commissioned a report on `energy security ' from the Baker Institute for Public Policy , a think - tank set up by James Baker , the former US secretary of state under George Bush Snr .
" The report , Strategic Energy Policy Challenges For The 21st Century , concludes : ` The United States remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma .
Iraq remains a de-stabilising influence to ... the flow of oil to international markets from the Middle East .
Saddam Hussein has also demonstrated a willingness to threaten to use the oil weapon and to use his own export programme to manipulate oil markets .
Therefore the US should conduct an immediate policy review toward Iraq including military , energy , economic and political / diplomatic assessments .
` The United States should then develop an integrated strategy with key allies in Europe and Asia , and with key countries in the Middle East , to restate goals with respect to Iraqi policy and to restore a cohesive coalition of key allies . '
" Baker who delivered the recommendations to Cheney , the former chief executive of Texas oil firm Halliburton , was advised by Kenneth Lay , the disgraced former chief executive of Enron , the US energy giant which went bankrupt after carrying out massive accountancy fraud . "
[ The Sunday Herald did not mention that the report begins with references to " recent energy price spikes " and " electricity outages in California , " which we now know were engineered by Enron market manipulations for which two Enron energy traders have since pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges ( Forbes , 2/5/03 ) . ]
The Unstated US Goals of Increasing the Flow of Oil from the Middle East , and US Dominance of the Area Behind the acknowledged concern about the " free flow " of Persian Gulf oil are other motives .
Following the recommendations of the Task Force Report , the Bush administration wishes to increase international ( which may well turn out to mean US ) investment in the under - developed Iraq oilfields .
On 1/16/03 the Wall Street Journal reported that officials from the White House , State Department , and Department of Defense have been meeting informally with executives from Halliburton , Schlumberger , ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips to plan the post - war expansion of oil production from Iraq ( whose oilfields were largely held by US companies prior to their nationalization ) .
The Journal story has since been denied by Administration officials ; but , as the Guardian noted on 1/27/03 , " It stretches credulity somewhat to imagine that the subject has never been broached . " < 2 >
It is worth pointing out that Saddam Hussein already has offered exploratory concessions ( which remained inactive because of the UN sanctions ) to France , China , Russia , Brazil , Italy , and Malaysia .
If Saddam is replaced by a new client regime , it seems likely that these concessions will be superseded , although there are reports that the US has offered France , Russia and China a share of post - war Iraqi oil , as an inducement to get their support in the Security Council . < 3 > Last September former CIA Chief Woolsey threatened in the Washington Post ( 9/15/02 ) that the price for participation by France and Russia in the post - war Iraq oil bonanza should be their support for " regime change . " < 4 >
It would not take much of such menacing talk from official sources to turn the Bush campaign against Iraq into a campaign against Europe ( see Postscript ) .
Iraq 's proven oil reserves are 113 billion barrels , the second largest in the world after Saudi Arabia , and eleven percent of the world 's total .
The total reserves could be 200 million barrels or more , all of it relatively easy and cheap to extract .
Thus increasing Iraqi oil production will diminish the market pressure on oil - importing countries like the US .
It will also weaken the power of OPEC to influence oil markets by decisions to restrict output .
Indeed , were Iraqi oil production to expand to near its capacity , the quotas established by OPEC would cease to be honored in today 's market . < 5 >
But the US is not just interested in oil from Iraq , it is concerned to maintain political dominance over all the oil - producing countries of the region .
Secretary of State Colin Powell gave a glimpse of US intentions when he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 6 that success in the Iraq war " could fundamentally reshape that region in a powerful , positive way that will enhance U.S. interests . "
In conceding that it will be necessary to station US troops in occupied Iraq for the foreseeable future , the US is serving notice to Iran and to Saudi Arabia ( both of which were once secure bases for US troops but are so no longer ) that the US will reassert its presence as the dominant military power in the region .
The Unstated US Goal of Preserving Dollar Hegemony Over the Global Oil Market Dominance of Middle Eastern oil will mean in effect maintaining dollar hegemony over the world oil economy .
Given its present strategies , the US is constrained to demand no less .
As I explain in this extract from my book , Drugs , Oil , and War , the present value of the US dollar , unjustified on purely economic grounds , is maintained by political arrangements , one of the chief of which is to ensure that all OPEC oil purchases will continue to be denominated in US dollars .
( This commitment of OPEC to dollar oil sales was secured in the 1970s by a secret agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia , before the two countries began to drift apart over Israel and other issues . )
The chief reason why dollars are more than pieces of green paper is that countries all over the world need them for purchases , principally of oil .
This requires them in addition to maintain dollar reserves to protect their own currency ; and these reserves , when invested , help maintain the current high levels of the US securities markets .
As Henry Liu has written vividly in the online Asian Times ( 4/11/02 ) , " World trade is now a game in which the US produces dollars and the rest of the world produces things that dollars can buy .
The world 's interlinked economies no longer trade to capture a comparative advantage ; they compete in exports to capture needed dollars to service dollar - denominated foreign debts and to accumulate dollar reserves to sustain the exchange value of their domestic currencies .
To prevent speculative and manipulative attacks on their currencies , the world 's central banks must acquire and hold dollar reserves in corresponding amounts to their currencies in circulation .
The higher the market pressure to devalue a particular currency , the more dollar reserves its central bank must hold .
This creates a built - in support for a strong dollar that in turn forces the world 's central banks to acquire and hold more dollar reserves , making it stronger .
This phenomenon is known as dollar hegemony , which is created by the geopolitically constructed peculiarity that critical commodities , most notably oil , are denominated in dollars .
Everyone accepts dollars because dollars can buy oil .
The recycling of petro-dollars is the price the US has extracted from oil - producing countries for US tolerance of the oil - exporting cartel since 1973 .
" By definition , dollar reserves must be invested in US assets , creating a capital - accounts surplus for the US economy .
Even after a year of sharp correction , US stock valuation is still at a 25 - year high and trading at a 56 percent premium compared with emerging markets . "
But central bankers around the world do not expect either the US dollar or the US stock markets to sustain their current levels .
As William Greider in The Nation ( 9/23/02 ) has pointed out : " US economy 's net foreign indebtedness -- the accumulation of two decades of running larger and larger trade deficits -- will reach nearly 25 percent of US GDP this year , or roughly $ 2.5 trillion .
Fifteen years ago , it was zero .
Before America 's net balance of foreign assets turned negative , in 1988 , the United States was a creditor nation itself , investing and lending vast capital to others , always more than it borrowed .
Now the trend line looks most alarming .
If the deficits persist around the current level of $ 400 billion a year or grow larger , the total US indebtedness should reach $ 3.5 trillion in three years or so .
Within a decade , it would total 50 percent of GDP . "
There is also a major potential threat to the overpriced dollar in Japan 's unresolved deflationary crisis .
As observers like Lawrence A. Joyce have commented , the dollar would take a major pummeling if the Japanese government ( as seems quite possible ) were suddenly required to fulfil its legal obligations to bail out failed Japanese banks ( which could easily happen if a sustained scarcity of oil were to keep oil prices at $ 40 a barrel or higher ) :
" There is only one place where the Japanese government can get enough money to bail out its banking system :
The Japanese government owns about 15 % of our U.S. Treasury securities .
And it would have to start selling them if it found itself facing a major banking crisis .
" That would send the already ailing dollar down even further .
And the initiation of a sale of our Treasury securities by Japan , of course , would immediately trigger a worldwide stampede to do the same before the securities become worth only a fraction of what they were purchased for .
At the same time , interest rates in the U.S. would immediately go through the roof . "
Washington is of course aware of these problems , and believes that overwhelming military strength and the will to use it supply the answer , persuading or forcing other countries to support the dollar at its artificial level as the key to their own security .
In an article entitled " Asia : the Military - Market Link , " and published by the U.S. Naval Institute in January 2002 , Professor Thomas Barnett of the US Naval War College , wrote : " We trade little pieces of paper ( our currency , in the form of a trade deficit ) for Asia 's amazing array of products and services .
We are smart enough to know this is a patently unfair deal unless we offer something of great value along with those little pieces of paper .
That product is a strong US Pacific Fleet , which squares the transaction nicely . "
There is some merit to this argument with respect to friendly countries like Japan , whose defense costs have been lowered by the US presence in Asia .
But of course the Islamic countries of the world are less likely to appreciate the " great value " of a threatening US presence .
Instead they are more likely to follow the example of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , and turn to the Islamic gold dinar as a way to diminish dollar hegemony in world markets and increase the power of Islamic nations to challenge US policies .
The United States has at present little reason to fear a challenge to the dollar from Malaysia .
But Malaysia is an Islamic country ; and the US has every reason to fear a similar challenge from the Islamic nations in OPEC , were they to force OPEC to cease OPEC oil sales in dollars , and denominate them instead in euros .
The Unstated US Goal of Preserving Dollar Hegemony Against Competition from the Euro As noted in a recent article by W. Clark , " The Real But Unspoken Reasons for the Iraq War " , the OPEC underpinning for the US dollar has shown signs of erosion in recent years .
Iraq was one of the first OPEC countries , in 2000 , to convert its reserves from dollars to euros .
At the time a commentator for Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty predicted that Saddam 's political act " will cost Iraq millions in lost revenue . "
In fact Iraq has profited handsomely from the 17 percent gain in the value of the euro against the dollar in that time .
Other countries have gradually been climbing on to the euro bandwagon .
An article in the Iran Financial News , 8/25/02 , revealed that more than half of Iran 's Forex Reserve Fund assets had been converted from dollars to euros .
In 2002 China began diversifying its currency reserves away from dollars into euros .
According to Business Week ( 2/17/03 ) Russia 's Central Bank in the past year has doubled its euro holdings to 20 percent of its $ 48 billion foreign exchange reserves .
And for a very good reason , according to its First Deputy Chairman Oleg Vyugin : " Returns on dollar instruments are very low now .
Other currency instruments pay more . "
Business
Week continues :
` The story is the same across the globe .
Money traders say that institutions as diverse as Bank of Canada , People 's Bank of China , and Central Bank of Taiwan are giving more weight to the European currency .
By the end of this year , they predict , the euro could account for 20 % of global foreign currency reserves , which today amount to a cool $ 2.4 trillion .
Little more than a year ago , the euro made up just 10 % .
" No one is saying that the euro 's going to replace the dollar as the premier reserve currency , " says Michael Klawitter , a currency strategist at WestLB Research in London .
" But it will increase in importance for many central banks . " ...
` The shift to the euro has big implications for the foreign exchange markets and the U.S. and European economies .
Currency specialists say the yawning U.S. current account deficit , now at 5 % , is bound to drive the dollar down further , and the euro still higher , over the next two to four years .
Although the greenback may stage a short - term recovery once the looming war with Iraq is over , predictions are that it will then continue its downward trend , and that central banks will play their part in the descent .
" Even if central banks increase their euro holdings by just a few percent , it will have a major impact in the markets , " says Klawitter .
" We 're talking many billions of dollars . " '
If not deterred , OPEC could follow suit .
Libya has been urging for some time that oil be priced in euros rather than dollars .
Javad Yarjani , an Iranian senior OPEC official , told a European Union seminar in April 2002 that , despite the problems raised by such a conversion , " I believe that OPEC will not discount entirely the possibility of adopting euro pricing and payments in the future . "
Meanwhile Hugo Chavez has been taking Venezuelan oil out of the petrodollar economy by bartering oil directly for commodities from thirteen other third world countries .
Although this has not yet qualified Venezuela for official membership in Bush 's " axis of evil , " the heavy hand of the Bush Administration in the recent coup attempt against Chavez was only too obvious .
( See " Venezuela Coup Linked to Bush Team , " London Observer , 4/21/ 02 , for details about the roles of US officials Elliot Abrams , Otto Reich , and John Negroponte . ) < 5 > Conclusion : How Should the US Be Addressing These Real Problems ?
To conclude , the Bush administration is not threatening Iraq out of pique or whim .
The recent policies of both parties have indeed made the US vulnerable to foreign oil and petrodollar pressures .
But hopefully decent Americans will protest the notion that it is appropriate to rain missiles and bombs upon civilians of another country , who have had little or nothing to do with this crisis of America 's own making .
Some in addition will continue to explore avenues whereby America 's oil and financial vulnerabilities can be diminished without continuing down the road to Armageddon .
These problems are serious , but economists have put forward proposals for diminishing them peacefully and multilaterally .
With respect to oil , Ralph Nader has just written , " The demand is simple : Stop this war before it starts and immediately establish a sane national energy security strategy . "
In fact one key ingredient of such a strategy , restriction of demand , can be found in saner parts of the Baker Institute reports that the Bush administration has so far chosen to ignore .
But an energy strategy for the United States must be addressed in the larger context of an economic and financial restructuring of global institutions and currency flows .
With respect to the more esoteric financial problems of the dollar , the economist and futurist Hazel Henderson has written that " My recommendations for reforming current international institutions , revitalizing the UN and expanding civic society are summarized in Beyond Globalization ( 1999 ) .
A more balanced world order must center on reforming global finance , taxing currency exchange and reducing the dollar 's unsustainable role as the world 's de facto reserve currency ( which is destructive for all countries -- even the US itself ) .
I favor a global reserve currency regime based on the parity of the US dollar and the euro .
The fundamentals in the USA and the EU suggest that the G - 8 has an opportunity to peg the dollar and the euro into a trading band .
This , together with the new issue of SDR's [ Special Drawing Rights ] .
proposed by all the IMF country members , promoted by George Soros and opposed only by the USA , would lend to more stable currency markets . "
Without endorsing these specific proposals , I wish to second two rather obvious principles :
1 ) The problems of global financial instability must be addressed .
As George Soros , famed as the man who broke the British pound in 1992 , wrote later in the Financial Times , � " To argue that financial markets in general , and international lending in particular , need to be regulated is likely to outrage the financial community .
Yet the evidence for just that is overwhelming . "
2 ) A multilateral approach to these core problems is the only way to proceed .
The US is strong enough to dominate the world militarily .
Economically it is in decline , less and less competitive , and increasingly in debt .
The Bush peoples ' intention appears to be to override economic realities with military ones , as if there were no risk of economic retribution .
They should be mindful of Britain 's humiliating retreat from Suez in 1956 , a retreat forced on it by the United States as a condition for propping up the failing British pound .
America 's influence in the world has up to now been based largely on good will generated by its willingness to resolve matters multilaterally .
This legacy of good will is being squandered recklessly , as US officials insult European leaders and steer NATO towards irreconcilable disagreement .
The assumption seems to be that America does not need Europe and can afford to break up an entente that has endured since World War II .
The risks of such arrogance are explored in a separate Postscript .
FOOTNOTES < 1 > Ari Fleischer Press Briefing of February 6 , 2003 : Q Since you speak for the President , we have no access to him , can you categorically deny that the United States will take over the oil fields when we win this war ?
Which is apparently obvious and you 're on your way and I do n't think you doubt your victory .
Oil -- is it about oil ?
MR .
FLEISCHER : Helen , as I 've told you many times , if this had anything to do with oil , the position of the United States would be to lift the sanctions so the oil could flow .
This is not about that .
This is about saving lives by protecting the American people ....
Q
There are reports that we 've divided up the oil already , divvied it up with the Russians and French and so forth .
Is n't that true ?....
MR .
FLEISCHER : No , there 's no truth to that , that we would divide up the oil fields .
( Concerning Mr. Fleischer 's second answer , see the next two footnotes -- PDS . )
For an exhaustive rebuttal of a similar statement by Ari Fleischer on 10/30/02 , see Larry Chin , " The Deep Politics of Regime Removal in Iraq " , onlinejournal.com . < 2 >
An extremely interesting news item last October in Alexander 's oilandgas.com revealed that the US was planning not only for the post - war exploitation of Iraq 's oil reserves , but for Iraq 's relationship to OPEC as well : " 30-10 - 02 The US State Department has pushed back its planned meeting with Iraqi opposition leaders on exploiting Iraq 's oil and gas reserves after a US military offensive removes Saddam Hussein from power to early December .
According to a source at the State Department , all the desired participants are not yet available .
" The Bush administration wants to have a working group of 12 to 20 people focused on Iraqi oil and gas to be able to recommend to an interim government ways of restoring the petroleum sector following a military attack in order to increase oil exports to partially pay for a possible US military occupation government -- further fuelling the view that controlling Iraqi oil is at the heart of the Bush campaign to replace Hussein with a more compliant regime .
( Emphasis added -- PDS ) ....
" According to the source , the working group will not only prepare recommendations for the rehabilitation of the Iraqi petroleum sector post - Hussein , but will address questions regarding the country 's continued membership in OPEC and whether it should be allowed to produce as much as possible or be limited by an OPEC quota , and it will consider whether to honour contracts made between the Hussein government and foreign oil companies , including the $ 3.5 b[ illio ] n project to be carried out by Russian interests to redevelop Iraq 's oilfields , which , along with numerous other development projects , has been thwarted by United Nations sanctions . < 3 > " Oil firms wait as Iraq crisis unfolds " by Robert Collier , San Francisco Chronicle , 9/29/02 : ` Iraqi opposition leaders suggest that unless France , Russia and China support the U.S. line in the Security Council , their oil companies may find themselves blacklisted .
`" We will examine all the contracts that Saddam Hussein has made , and we will cancel all those that are not in the interest of the Iraqi people and will reopen bidding on them , " said Faisal Qaragholi , operations officer of the Iraqi National Congress , the opposition coalition based in London that plays a central role in the American anti-Hussein strategy .
` Ahmed Chalabi , the INC leader , has gone even further , proposing the creation of consortium of American companies to develop Iraq 's oil fields . ' < 4 >
As the Asia Times reported on 10/21/02 , ` The war of positioning for a possible post - Saddam Iraqi environment is getting more ruthless by the minute .
American oil conglomerates are openly courting representatives of the Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) , the umbrella opposition .
The darling of Exxon Mobil and Chevron Texaco is Ahmed Chalabi , US vice President Dick Cheney 's pal and major contender for the title of Iraq 's number one opposition figure .
Chalabi , the INC leader , has already stressed on the record that he favors the creation of a " US - led consortium to develop Iraqi oil fields .
American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil . "
` To widespread doubts about how a pro-American post - Saddam government would respect contracts signed with non-American oil giants , the INC has reassured all players - mostly Russian and European - that the new post - Saddam administration will honor all its PSAs .
` The Future of Iraq Group , a State Department task force , officially is not talking about oil - which sounds like a joke .
[ Cf. footnote 2 -- PDS ]
And there 's also no official confirmation that oil has been a key issue in the current hardcore Security Council negotiations between the US and Britain , on one side , and France , Russia and China on the other .
But it is obviously not by historical accident that oil companies from these five permanent Security Council members are all positioning themselves for the post - Saddam environment .
` People like former CIA supremo James Woolsey are not even disguising Washington 's plan to turn Iraq into an American protectorate with an Arab Hamid Karzai al - la Afghanistan eager to open the oil taps for American oil giants .
Woolsey had been openly saying that if France and Russia contributed to " regime change " , their oil companies would be able to " work together " with the new regime and with American companies .
Otherwise , they would be left contemplating passing cargoes in the Gulf . ' < 5 >
Note that the true issue here is not just access to Iraq oil , but control over it .
As Michael Parenti reminds us , in 1998 , when the UN allowed Iraq to increase its exports into an already over - supplied oil market , this was perceived as a threat to US interests : ` The San Francisco Chronicle ( 22 February 1998 ) headlined its story " IRAQ'S OIL POSES THREAT TO THE WEST . "
In fact , Iraqi crude poses no threat to " the West " only to Western oil investors .
If Iraq were able to reenter the international oil market , the Chronicle reported , " it would devalue British North Sea oil , undermine American oil production and --- much more important --- it would destroy the huge profits which the United States [ read , US oil companies ] stands to gain from its massive investment in Caucasian oil production , especially in Azerbaijan . " ' < 5 >
In August 2000 Chavez met with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad , the first dead of state to visit him since the 1991 Gulf War .
Chavez told the press later that " We spoke at length on how to boost the role of OPEC . "
This was part of an extended Chavez tour to bolster OPEC unity against US - led pressure to lower oil prices , then at nearly $ 30 a barrel .

3 . IT 'S NOT ABOUT OIL OR IRAQ : IT'S ABOUT THE U.S. AND EUROPE GOING HEAD-TO - HEAD ON WORLD ECONOMIC DOMINANCE Geoffrey Heard ( Australia )
March 2003 Summary : Why is George Bush so hell bent on war with Iraq ?
Why does his administration reject every positive Iraqi move ?
It all makes sense when you consider the economic implications for the USA of not going to war with Iraq .
The war in Iraq is actually the US and Europe going head to head on economic leadership of the world .
America 's Bush administration has been caught in outright lies , gross exaggerations and incredible inaccuracies as it trotted out its litany of paper thin excuses for making war on Iraq .
Along with its two supporters , Britain and Australia , it has shifted its ground and reversed its position with a barefaced contempt for its audience .
It has manipulated information , deceived by commission and omission and frantically " bought " UN votes with billion dollar bribes .
Faced with the failure of gaining UN Security Council support for invading Iraq , the USA has threatened to invade without authorisation .
It would act in breach of the UN 's very constitution to allegedly enforced UN resolutions .
It is plain bizarre .
Where does this desperation for war come from ?
There are many things driving President Bush and his administration to invade Iraq , unseat Saddam Hussein and take over the country .
But the biggest one is hidden and very , very simple .
It is about the currency used to trade oil and consequently , who will dominate the world economically , in the foreseeable future -- the USA or the European Union .
Iraq is a European Union beachhead in that confrontation .
America had a monopoly on the oil trade , with the US dollar being the fiat currency , but Iraq broke ranks in 1999 , started to trade oil in the EU 's euros , and profited .
If America invades Iraq and takes over , it will hurl the EU and its euro back into the sea and make America 's position as the dominant economic power in the world all but impregnable .
It is the biggest grab for world power in modern times .
America 's allies in the invasion , Britain and Australia , are betting America will win and that they will get some trickle - down benefits for jumping on to the US bandwagon .
France and Germany are the spearhead of the European force -- Russia would like to go European but possibly can still be bought off .
Presumably , China would like to see the Europeans build a share of international trade currency ownership at this point while it continues to grow its international trading presence to the point where it , too , can share the leadership rewards .
******************
DEBATE BUILDING ON THE INTERNET
Oddly , little or nothing is appearing in the general media about this issue , although key people are becoming aware of it -- note the recent slide in the value of the US dollar .
Are traders afraid of war ?
They are more likely to be afraid there will not be war .
But despite the silence in the general media , a major world discussion is developing around this issue , particularly on the internet .
Among the many articles : Henry Liu , in the ' Asia Times ' last June , it has been a hot topic on the Feasta forum , an Irish - based group exploring sustainable economics , and W. Clark 's " The Real Reasons for the Upcoming War with Iraq : A Macroeconomic and Geostrategic Analysis of the Unspoken Truth " has been published by the ' Sierra Times ' , ' Indymedia.org ' , and ' ratical.org ' .
This debate is not about whether America would suffer from losing the US dollar monopoly on oil trading -- that is a given -- rather it is about exactly how hard the USA would be hit .
The smart money seems to be saying the impact would be in the range from severe to catastrophic .
The USA could collapse economically .
******************
OIL DOLLARS
The key to it all is the fiat currency for trading oil .
Under an OPEC agreement , all oil has been traded in US dollars since 1971 ( after the dropping of the gold standard ) which makes the US dollar the de facto major international trading currency .
If other nations have to hoard dollars to buy oil , then they want to use that hoard for other trading too .
This fact gives America a huge trading advantage and helps make it the dominant economy in the world .
As an economic bloc , the European Union is the only challenger to the USA 's economic position , and it created the euro to challenge the dollar in international markets .
However , the EU is not yet united behind the euro -- there is a lot of jingoistic national politics involved , not least in Britain -- and in any case , so long as nations throughout the world must hoard dollars to buy oil , the euro can make only very limited inroads into the dollar 's dominance .
In 1999 , Iraq , with the world 's second largest oil reserves , switched to trading its oil in euros .
American analysts fell about laughing ; Iraq had just made a mistake that was going to beggar the nation .
But two years on , alarm bells were sounding ; the euro was rising against the dollar , Iraq had given itself a huge economic free kick by switching .
Iran started thinking about switching too ; Venezuela , the 4th largest oil producer , began looking at it and has been cutting out the dollar by bartering oil with several nations including America 's bete noir , Cuba .
Russia is seeking to ramp up oil production with Europe ( trading in euros ) an obvious market .
The greenback 's grip on oil trading and consequently on world trade in general , was under serious threat .
If America did not stamp on this immediately , this economic brushfire could rapidly be fanned into a wildfire capable of consuming the US 's economy and its dominance of world trade .
******************
HOW DOES THE US GET ITS DOLLAR ADVANTAGE ?
Imagine this : you are deep in debt but every day you write cheques for millions of dollars you do n't have -- another luxury car , a holiday home at the beach , the world trip of a lifetime .
Your cheques should be worthless but they keep buying stuff because those cheques you write never reach the bank !
You have an agreement with the owners of one thing everyone wants , call it petrol / gas , that they will accept only your cheques as payment .
This means everyone must hoard your cheques so they can buy petrol / gas .
Since they have to keep a stock of your cheques , they use them to buy other stuff too .
You write a cheque to buy a TV , the TV shop owner swaps your cheque for petrol / gas , that seller buys some vegetables at the fruit shop , the fruiterer passes it on to buy bread , the baker buys some flour with it , and on it goes , round and round -- but never back to the bank .
You have a debt on your books , but so long as your cheque never reaches the bank , you do n't have to pay .
In effect , you have received your TV free .
This is the position the USA has enjoyed for 30 years -- it has been getting a free world trade ride for all that time .
It has been receiving a huge subsidy from everyone else in the world .
As it debt has been growing , it has printed more money ( written more cheques ) to keep trading .
No wonder it is an economic powerhouse !
Then one day , one petrol seller says he is going to accept another person 's cheques , a couple of others think that might be a good idea .
If this spreads , people are going to stop hoarding your cheques and they will come flying home to the bank .
Since you do n't have enough in the bank to cover all the cheques , very nasty stuff is going to hit the fan !
But you are big , tough and very aggressive .
You do n't scare the other guy who can write cheques , he 's pretty big too , but given a ' legitimate ' excuse , you can beat the tripes out of the lone gas seller and scare him and his mates into submission .
And that , in a nutshell , is what the USA is doing right now with Iraq .
******************
AMERICA'S PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC POSITION
America is so eager to attack Iraq now because of the speed with which the euro fire could spread .
If Iran , Venezuela and Russia join Iraq and sell large quantities of oil for euros , the euro would have the leverage it needs to become a powerful force in general international trade .
Other nations would have to start swapping some of their dollars for euros .
The dollars the USA has printed , the ' cheques ' it has written , would start to fly home , stripping away the illusion of value behind them .
The USA 's real economic condition is about as bad as it could be ; it is the most debt - ridden nation on earth , owing about US $ 12,000 for every single one of it's 280 million men , women and children .
It is worse than the position of Indonesia when it imploded economically a few years ago , or more recently , that of Argentina .
Even if OPEC did not switch to euros wholesale ( and that would make a very nice non-oil profit for the OPEC countries , including minimising the various contrived debts America has forced on some of them ) , the US 's difficulties would build .
Even if only a small part of the oil trade went euro , that would do two things immediately : * Increase the attractiveness to EU members of joining the ' eurozone ' , which in turn would make the euro stronger and make it more attractive to oil nations as a trading currency and to other nations as a general trading currency .
*
Start the US dollars flying home demanding value when there is n't enough in the bank to cover them .
*
The markets would over - react as usual and in no time , the US dollar 's value would be spiralling down .
******************
THE US SOLUTION America 's response to the euro threat was predictable .
It has come out fighting .
It aims to achieve four primary things by going to war with Iraq : * Safeguard the American economy by returning Iraq to trading oil in US dollars , so the greenback is once again the exclusive oil currency .
*
Send a very clear message to any other oil producers just what will happen to them if they do not stay in the dollar circle .
Iran has already received one message -- remember how puzzled you were that in the midst of moderation and secularization , Iran was named as a member of the axis of evil ? *
Place the second largest reserves of oil in the world under direct American control .
* Provide a secular , subject state where the US can maintain a huge force ( perhaps with nominal elements from allies such as Britain and Australia ) to dominate the Middle East and its vital oil .
This would enable the US to avoid using what it sees as the unreliable Turkey , the politically impossible Israel and surely the next state in its sights , Saudi Arabia , the birthplace of al Qaeda and a hotbed of anti-American sentiment .
* Severe setback the European Union and its euro , the only trading bloc and currency strong enough to attack the USA 's dominance of world trade through the dollar .
* Provide cover for the US to run a covert operation to overturn the democratically elected government of Venezuela and replace it with an America - friendly military supported junta -- and put Venezuala 's oil into American hands .
Locking the world back into dollar oil trading would consolidate America 's current position and make it all but impregnable as the dominant world power -- economically and militarily .
A splintered Europe ( the US is working hard to split Europe ; Britain was easy , but other Europeans have offered support in terms of UN votes ) and its euro would suffer a serious setback and might take decades to recover .
It is the boldest grab for absolute power the world has seen in modern times .
America is hardly likely to allow the possible slaughter of a few hundred thousand Iraqis stand between it and world domination .
President Bush did promise to protect the American way of life .
This is what he meant .
******************
JUSTIFYING WAR
Obviously , the US could not simply invade Iraq , so it began casting around for a ' legitimate ' reason to attack .
That search has been one of increasing desperation as each rationalization has crumbled .
First Iraq was a threat because of alleged links to al Qaeda ; then it was proposed Iraq might supply al Qaeda with weapons ; then Iraq 's military threat to its neighbours was raised ; then the need to deliver Iraqis from Saddam Hussein 's horrendously inhumane rule ; finally there is the question of compliance with UN weapons inspection .
The USA 's justifications for invading Iraq are looking less impressive by the day .
The US 's statements that it would invade Iraq unilaterally without UN support and in defiance of the UN make a total nonsense of any American claim that it is concerned about the world body 's strength and standing .
The UN weapons inspectors have come up with minimal infringements of the UN weapons limitations -- the final one being low tech rockets which exceed the range allowed by about 20 percent .
But there is no sign of the so - called weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) the US has so confidently asserted are to be found .
Colin Powell named a certain north Iraqi village as a threat .
It was not .
He later admitted it was the wrong village .
' Newsweek ' ( 24/2 ) has reported that while Bush officials have been trumpeting the fact that key Iraqi defector , Lt. Gen .
Hussein Kamel , told the US in 1995 that Iraq had manufactured tonnes of nerve gas and anthrax ( Colin Powell 's 5 February presentation to the UN was just one example ) they neglected to mention that Kamel had also told the US that these weapons had been destroyed .
Parts of the US and particularly the British secret ' evidence ' have been shown to come from a student 's masters thesis .
America 's expressed concern about the Iraqi people 's human rights and the country 's lack of democracy are simply not supported by the USA 's history of intervention in other states nor by its current actions .
Think Guatemala , the Congo , Chile and Nicaragua as examples of a much larger pool of US actions to tear down legitimate , democratically elected governments and replace them with war , disruption , starvation , poverty , corruption , dictatorships , torture , rape and murder for its own economic ends .
The most recent , Afghanistan , is not looking good ; in fact that reinstalled a murderous group of warlords which America had earlier installed , then deposed , in favour of the now hated Taliban .
Saddam Hussein was just as repressive , corrupt and murderous 15 years ago when he used chemical weapons , supplied by the US , against the Kurds .
The current US Secretary for Defence , Donald Rumsfeld , so vehement against Iraq now , was on hand personally to turn aside condemnation of Iraq and blame Iran .
At that time , of course , the US thought Saddam Hussein was their man -- they were using him against the perceived threat of Iran 's Islamic fundamentalism .
Right now , as ' The Independent ' writer , Robert Fisk , has noted , the US 's efforts to buy Algeria 's UN vote includes promises of re-arming the military which has a decade long history of repression , torture , rape and murder Saddam Hussein himself would envy .
It is estimated 200,000 people have died , and countless others been left maimed by the activities of these monsters .
What price the US 's humanitarian concerns for Iraqis ?
( Of course , the French are also wooing Algeria , their former north African territory , for all they are worth , but at least they are not pretending to be driven by humanitarian concerns . )
Indonesia is another nation with a vote and influence as the largest Muslim nation in the world .
Its repressive , murderous military is regaining strength on the back of the US 's so - called anti-terror campaign and is receiving promises of open and covert support -- including intelligence sharing .
******************
AND VENEZUELA
While the world 's attention is focused on Iraq , America is both openly and covertly supporting the " coup of the rich " in Venezuela , which grabbed power briefly in April last year before being intimidated by massive public displays of support by the poor for democratically - elected President Chavez Frias .
The coup leaders continue to use their control of the private media , much of industry and the ear of the American Government and its oily intimates to cause disruption and disturbance .
Venezuela 's state - owned oil resources would make rich pickings for American oil companies and provide the US with an important oil source in its own backyard .
Many writers have noted the contradiction between America 's alleged desire to establish democracy in Iraq while at the same time , actively undermining the democratically - elected government in Venezuela .
Above the line , America rushed to recognise the coup last April ; more recently , President Bush has called for " early elections " , ignoring the fact that President Chavez Frias has won three elections and two referendums and , in any case , early elections would be unconstitutional .
One element of the USA 's covert action against Venezuela is the behaviour of American transnational businesses , which have locked out employees in support of " national strike " action .
Imagine them doing that in the USA !
There is no question that a covert operation is in process to overturn the legitimate Venezuelan government .
Uruguayan congressman , Jose Nayardi , made it public when he revealed that the Bush administration had asked for Uruguay 's support for Venezuelan white collar executives and trade union activists " to break down levels of intransigence within the Chavez Frias administration " .
The process , he noted , was a shocking reminder of the CIA 's 1973 intervention in Chile which saw General Pinochet lead his military coup to take over President Allende 's democratically elected government in a bloodbath .
President Chavez Frias is desperately clinging to government , but with the might of the USA aligned with his opponents , how long can he last ?
******************
THE COST OF WAR Some have claimed that an American invasion of Iraq would cost so many billions of dollars that oil returns would never justify such an action .
But when the invasion is placed in the context of the protection of the entire US economy for now and into the future , the balance of the argument changes .
Further , there are three other vital factors : First , America will be asking others to help pay for the war because it is protecting their interests .
Japan and Saudi Arabia made serious contributions to the cost of the 1991 Gulf war .
Second -- in reality , war will cost the USA very little -- or at least , very little over and above normal expenditure .
This war is already paid for !
All the munitions and equipment have been bought and paid for .
The USA would have to spend hardly a cent on new hardware to prosecute this war -- the expenditure will come later when munitions and equipment have to be replaced after the war .
But amunitions , hardware and so on are being replaced all the time -- contracts are out .
Some contracts will simply be brought forward and some others will be ramped up a bit , but spread over a few years , the cost will not be great .
And what is the real extra cost of an army at war compared with maintaining the standing army around the world , running exercises and so on ?
It is there , but it is a relatively small sum .
Third -- lots of the extra costs involved in the war are dollars spent outside America , not least in the purchase of fuel .
Guess how America will pay for these ?
By printing dollars it is going to war to protect .
The same happens when production begins to replace hardware components , minerals , etc. are bought in with dollars that go overseas and exploit America 's trading advantage .
The cost of war is not nearly as big as it is made out to be .
The cost of not going to war would be horrendous for the USA -- unless there were another way of protecting the greenback 's world trade dominance .
******************
AMERICA'S TWO ACTIVE ALLIES
Why are Australia and Britain supporting America in its transparent Iraqi war ploy ?
Australia , of course , has significant US dollar reserves and trades widely in dollars and extensively with America .
A fall in the US dollar would reduce Australia 's debt , perhaps , but would do nothing for the Australian dollar 's value against other currencies .
John Howard , the Prime Minister , has long cherished the dream of a free trade agreement with the USA in the hope that Australia can jump on the back of the free ride America gets in trade through the dollar 's position as the major trading medium .
That would look much less attractive if the euro took over a significant part of the oil trade .
Britain has yet to adopt the euro .
If the US takes over Iraq and blocks the euro 's incursion into oil trading , Tony Blair will have given his French and German counterparts a bloody nose , and gained more room to manouevre on the issue -- perhaps years more room .
Britain would be in a position to demand a better deal from its EU partners for entering the " eurozone " if the new currency could not make the huge value gains guaranteed by a significant role in world oil trading .
It might even be in a position to withdraw from Europe and link with America against continental Europe .
On the other hand , if the US cannot maintain the oil trade dollar monopoly , the euro will rapidly go from strength to strength , and Britain could be left begging to be allowed into the club .
******************
THE OPPOSITION
Some of the reasons for opposition to the American plan are obvious -- America is already the strongest nation on earth and dominates world trade through its dollar .
If it had control of the Iraqi oil and a base for its forces in the Middle East , it would not add to , but would multiply its power .
The oil - producing nations , particularly the Arab ones , can see the writing on the wall and are quaking in their boots .
France and Germany are the EU leaders with the vision of a resurgent , united Europe taking its rightful place in the world and using its euro currency as a world trading reserve currency and thus gaining some of the free ride the United States enjoys now .
They are the ones who initiated the euro oil trade with Iraq .
Russia is in deep economic trouble and knows it will get worse the day America starts exploiting its take - over of Afghanistan by running a pipeline southwards via Afghanistan from the giant southern Caspian oil fields .
Currently , that oil is piped northwards -- where Russia has control .
Russia is in the process of ramping up oil production with the possibility of trading some of it for euros and selling some to the US itself .
Russia already has enough problems with the fact that oil is traded in US dollars ; if the US has control of Iraqi oil , it could distort the market to Russia 's enormous disadvantage .
In addition , Russia has interests in Iraqi oil ; an American take over could see them lost .
Already on its knees , Russia could be beggared before a mile of the Afghanistan pipeline is laid .
******************
ANOTHER SOLUTION ?
The scenario clarifies the seriousness of America 's position and explains its frantic drive for war .
It also suggests that solutions other than war are possible .
Could America agree to share the trading goodies by allowing Europe to have a negotiated part of it ?
Not very likely , but it is just possible Europe can stare down the USA and force such an outcome .
Time will tell .
What about Europe taking the statesmanlike , humanitarian and long view , and withdrawing , leaving the oil to the US , with appropriate safeguards for ordinary Iraqis and democracy in Venezuela ?
Europe might then be forced to adopt a smarter approach -- perhaps accelerating the development of alternative energy technologies which would reduce the EU 's reliance on oil for energy and produce goods it could trade for euros -- shifting the world trade balance .
Now that would be a very positive outcome for everyone .

The plea is as disturbing — and arresting — as a hostage video from Iraq .
In a navy blazer and preppy Oxford shirt , the actor Michael J. Fox calmly asks viewers to support stem cell research by voting for several Democratic candidates in Maryland , Missouri and Wisconsin , while his body sways back and forth uncontrollably like a sailor being tossed around in a full - force gale .
In short , Mr. Fox ’s display of the toll Parkinson ’s disease has taken on him turned into one of the most powerful and talked about political advertisements in years .
Republican strategists who saw how quickly the commercial was downloaded , e-mailed and reshown on news broadcasts certainly thought so .
Rush Limbaugh rushed in to discredit Mr. Fox , though he mostly hurt himself .
Mr. Limbaugh , the conservative radio talk show host , told his listeners that the actor either “ did n’t take his medication or was acting . ”
Mr. Limbaugh later apologized for accusing Mr. Fox of exaggerating his symptoms , but said that “ Michael J. Fox is allowing his illness to be exploited and in the process is shilling for a Democrat politician . ”
Republicans cobbled together a response ad that did not mention Mr. Fox but attacked the ethics of embryonic stem cell research .
It included testimonials by the actress Patricia Heaton ( “ Everybody Loves Raymond ” ) and James Caviezel , who played Jesus in Mel Gibson ’s “ Passion of the Christ . ”
At least in the advance version shown on YouTube last night , Mr. Caviezel ’s introduction seemed either garbled or to be in Aramaic .
The presenter is being treated at Leeds General Infirmary
The 36 - year - old was thought to be driving at about 300 mph on an airfield near York when he crashed on Wednesday .
The BBC , which is likely to be closely scrutinised , and the Health and Safety Executive will investigate the crash .
Top Gear co-host Jeremy Clarkson , who was visiting the hospital , said many motorists were " rooting for " Hammond .
Clarkson was joined at the Leeds General Infirmary by the show 's other presenter , James May .
He said in a statement that Hammond and his family were " the most important concerns we have " .
The audience and the TV producers want you as a presenter to be there , on the inside

Former Top Gear presenter
Send us your comments
" I would just like to say how heartened Richard will be when I tell him just how many motorists and truck drivers on my way here wound down their windows to say they were rooting for him . "
Referring to Hammond by his nickname , Clarkson added : " Both James and I are looking forward to getting our ' hamster ' back . "
He was initially reported to have suffered serious head injuries and was taken to the neurological unit of hospital by helicopter .
A spokesman said Hammond 's condition , which was described as serious but stable , had showed some improvement overnight .
Doctors confirmed that his wife was at his bedside and his family had requested that no further information be released .
Hammond was driving a jet - powered dragster similar to the Vampire - used by Colin Fallows to set the British land speed record .
It is thought Hammond was attempting to break Fallows ' record of 300.3 mph .
Vampire
Estimated top speed : 370mph
Acceleration : 0 to 272 mph in 6 seconds
Engine : Rolls Royce Orpheus Fuel economy : 7 - 10 gallons per mile
Weight : 2,200 lbs ( 998kg )
Length : 30 feet ( 9.14 m )

The BBC said in a statement that they had already begun to investigate the accident and promised full co-operation with the Health and Safety Executive .
" We continue to be concerned about his condition and we are keeping in touch with his family , " the statement said .
Top Gear has courted controversy in the past over its big - budget car stunts .
In 1999 a group of MPs criticised the series for being " obsessed with acceleration and speed " .
Last year , lobby group Transport 2000 called for the show to be taken off the air accusing it of " glamorising speed and failing to make the connection with danger on the roads " .
At the time , Hammond defended the programme , saying : " Top Gear is an entertaining show , for people that are interested in cars , that is driven by people who have been motoring journalists for many , many years . "
Parachutes deployed
Former firefighter Dave Ogden , who was working with Hammond at the Elvington airfield near York , said the car had done several runs when it " veered off to the right " .
" One of the parachutes had deployed but it went on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100 yards from us . "
His crew and an ambulance rushed over and had to cut Hammond free from the wreckage .
Steve Berry , one of Top Gear 's former presenters , said the show had changed over the years .
In the past , he said audiences would have been happy to see the presenter interviewing the driver .
" That 's not any good anymore ... the audience and the TV producers want you as a presenter to be there , on the inside . "
Hammond grew up in Solihull , was educated in Yorkshire and lives near Cheltenham with his wife and children .
In addition to presenting Top Gear for the BBC , he also fronted Brainiac on Sky One and had his own show on ITV1 .

You ARE a marketer .
Deal with it .
It 's so trendy to diss marketing .
Especially if you 're in engineering , product design , or virtually anything but marketing .
A comment for me by pinhut on my " You 're emotional ... " blog entry reads :
" this started out being so interesting .
then you reveal yourself as a marketer .
please terminate yourself . "
The late ( and brilliant ) comedian Bill Hicks was an early adopter of the " all marketing is evil " meme :
" By the way , if anyone here is in advertising or marketing , kill yourself .
No , this is not a joke : kill yourself . . .
I know what the marketing people are thinking now too : ' Oh .
He 's going for that anti-marketing dollar .
That 's a good market . '
Oh man , I am not doing that , you f*** ing evil scumbags . " ( asterisks are mine )
I was about to protest , " Dammit Jim , I 'm a programmer , not a marketer ! "
But that would be a lie .
In this new open - source / cluetrain world , I am a marketer .
And so are you .
If you 're interested in creating passionate users , or keeping your job , or breathing life into a startup , or getting others to contribute to your open source project , or getting your significant other to agree to the vacation you want to go on ... congratulations .
You 're in marketing .
Now go kill yourself .
The word " marketing " ( and by extension , " marketers " ) has a bad rep for sure , as does " advertising " and " PR " .
But they all share a common goal -- connecting buyers and sellers .
Is n't that what we 're doing ?
Except with a Find and Replace :
" Buyers " becomes --> " readers " or " users " or " community participants "
" Sellers " becomes --> " authors " or " developers " or " organizations "
As Guy Kawasaki puts it , we 're selling the dream .
But the difference between what we now consider " old- school marketing " ( otherwise known as The Four P's -- product , price , promotion , and placement -- heavy on advertising and " branding " ) and the " neo- marketing " we 're doing here is frickin' huge .
Here are a few ideas on some of the differences :

** Real is relative to the desires and perceptions of the user .
And who 's to say that taking better photos wo n't in fact lead to more sex ?
*** rhymes with " hit "
But even if we feel OK about doing some of these marketingish things , there 's still the problem of the word " marketing " .
We need a word that distinguishes the kinds of things we ( developers / programmers , ministers , realtors , authors ) do from old - school traditional marketing .
I just do n't know if the marketing - averse among us can rehabilitate that word ... it 's been too heavily associated ( framed ) with old - fashioned , negative , sleazy and inauthentic practices ( even if much of that was a misconception ... does n't matter ) .
My " neo - marketing " label is just lame .
Open Solaris ' Laura Ramsey and I were talking about it this weekend , and she came up with an alternative that might be a good contender : Modern Attraction .
We 're not marketers , we 're attractors .
I do n't know if that 's the right phrase , but it still sounds better to me than " marketing " .
( Personally , I was voting for " cheerleader " , but for some reason I just could n't get the other programmers to go along with that ... cute t- shirt ideas , though ... ; )
Others have come up with replacement phrases as well , but none seem to have truly taken hold , and the word " conversation " is n't enough .
What do you think ?
If we believe in something , and we want others to share what we know can be a fun / meaningful experience , whether it 's getting involved in our open source project , or joining our cause , or - - yes - - buying our book or software -- we need to get past our " go kill yourself now " thing .
If framing it with a new word / phrase helps , perhaps that 's a better approach than trying to give the word " marketing " a massive makeover .
Remember -- when people are passionate about something , and in a state of flow -- and you have contributed to that by helping users / members learn and grow and kick ass -- these are some of the happiest moments in their lives .
Trying to promote more of that is something we should feel wonderful about , not guilty .

I think this is one of your best posts ever .
I especially like the old - school / new - school comparison table , which echos many similar thoughts I 've been having lately .
The brand hijacking is especially interesting .
Because word of mouth is becoming so powerful , I feel more like the collaborator in the process of marketing rather than the controller of it .
You might also enjoy this article I wrote a while back called " Marketing From Your Conscience , " which is about how marketing becomes a privileged duty when you honestly believe you 're doing genuine good by spreading the word :
http://www.stevepavlina.com/articles/marketing-from-your-conscience.htm
I think in one sense the Internet is helping to raise our collective intelligence , such that we 're less likely to fall to old school marketing tactics .
There has to be some genuine substance to a product or service now -- on some level it much achieve a measure of greatness to get noticed .
It must provide real value .
Posted by : Steve Pavlina | Aug 27 , 2005 10:41:11 AM
Bravo for the piece on marketing .
I 've been working as a mentor on a Google Summer Of Code , and my very first question to Gary was " How are you going to market this ?
Let 's start with the module name .
What are you going to call it ? "
The # 1 problem with the perception of marketing is that people think " marketing " = " advertising " = " TV ads for soap . "
It 's something that we all must get past .
This also came up when Bill Odom & I were working on our slides for last year 's OSCON talk on getting hired .
We talked explicitly about treating yourself as a product that must be marketed .
Even if you do n't advertise the product , you still must manage yourself as a product .
You must still know what upgrades and improvements to make to the product .
Maybe there 's a word other than marketing that will make the young ( and not - so - young ) and skeptical see marketing in a more palatable way .
Posted by : Andy Lester | Aug 27 , 2005 3:24:52 PM
If marketing is so unpalletable , why are so many people still trying to get into the field ?
Why is it still ranked as one of the " hot " jobs of the 21st century ?
Why do all the people I know in Finance and Sales departments often see their jobs there as gateways into marketing ?
Quit whining .
People make lawyer jokes .
Will they stop if we start calling them " barristers " or " attorneys " more often ?
Not bloody likely .
I think the table you 've put together above is nice .
Shallow , but nice .
It 's directional and helpful to folks who are still mired entirely in the 1950 's style of , as you put it , " old - school " marketing , but going totally " new - school " -- that is , to swing completely into the right - hand column -- would be as unwise as to stay completely in the left .
Why ?
Because as marketers ( and I 'm fine with the name , by the way ) we have a responsibility to several groups of people ... not just users .
Creating passionate users is a wonderful goal , and I love lots of your writing on this site , and more companies / marketers should be doing many of the things you advocate .
But let 's also remember that ( in many cases ) , we are beholden to those crazy shareholders .
Too much of the stuff in the right - hand column can water - down shareholder value in certain circumstances .
Same holds true for employee loyalty at times .
If you fixate on customers and ignore the folks inside the barn who built the company and know your products and procedures inside and out ... you may lose them to a competitor who strokes their egos a bit more .
Same arguments for the legal department , finance and HR .
Marketing is a tough gig .
The bigger the pot , the tougher the noodles , too .
What we 've seen in the past decade or so , are some companies that have been able , through the revolutions in technology and communications , to be highly profitable with much smaller companies , in terms of embedded resources , at least in their early phases .
This makes it seem as if they need be less " tied down " to many of the " old- school " ways of doing business , since they can make their money without regard for lots of the " old- school " requirements .
That 's not the case with lots and lots of " old- school " style companies whose business models have n't ( and can 't ) change , because gravity still requires the same amount of force to pull crap out of the earth and truck it across country .
Do n't get me wrong -- I 'm a total technophile .
But just because Google and Amazon can make a bjillion bucks doing business in a new way does n't mean that steel companies , lawn care companies and fishermen can .
And for many of those companies , the old ways of marketing are still just as important .
Let us , for example , witness the very recent and hugely successful Geico insurance TV campaigns .
Since starting their two - pronged campaigns -- the lizard and the " I just saved 15 % on my insurance bits -- the company has increased its market share by 40 % .
All using traditional , " old- school " advertising .
TV , print and radio .
Other recent " old- school " successes inlcude the Absolut print campaign and Quiznos .
The other thing that we need to keep in mind is that this is n't the first " old vs. new " marketing trend - shift in the history of the biz .
It has n't ever NOT happened , not since the advent of the " modern " economy after the Civil War .
About every 10 - 20 years , some new facet of the business world requires that the marketing folk sit up and change gears a bit .
Whether it's the Model - T Ford , mail - order catalogs , national magazines , radio , TV , phones ... whatever .
They all require us to keep on our toes and do new stuff .
Our mistakes are aired on national television , in car lots and billboards .
So the view of our mishaps is much more pronounced than that of other professions .
You know what ?
Tough buns .
We also get to do cool stuff , play with big budgets , go on neat trips , make fun and colorful displays and create compelling messages that help shape the world around us .
If I have to put up with a few commedians calling me names , I can live with that .
Pass around the bandoliers of CMYK cartridges , boys .
The old - school , tough - bastard marketing team is on the hill .
We 'll do all the neat , new stuff in the right - hand column -- when it 's the right thing to do -- but when we need to lay down a $ 20 million national ad blitz ; bring it on .
Good marketing is good , bad is bad .
Let 's not get caught up in our own playground of definitions .
Whatever moves our company 's or client 's products is what we should do .
Old or new , who cares .
It 's still marketing , and I 'm still proud to be doing it .

you change the signifier , but you cannot change the signified .

Posted by : pinhut | Aug 27 , 2005 7:28:24 PM
pinhut 's right , you know ; you have n't addressed Bill Hicks 's point .
Just because we 're all in marketing now , does n't change anything ; maybe it just means we should all kill ourselves .
The dispersal of the marketing function over the whole of society does n't make it any less unpleasant ; on the contrary , it makes it nastier , because not only do we have to put up with marketing from others , we now have to put up with the marketing we do ourselves .
The political theory literature on immaterial and affective labour is interesting here ( see http://www.ecn.org/valkohaalarit/english/lazz.htm for example ) .
Creative and leisure time activities are increasingly becoming productive for , and tightly controlled by , capitalism .
That our enthusiasm for the work we do is increasingly being repurposed into a form of marketing is not a good thing .
Posted by : Tim | Aug 27 , 2005 8:43:18 PM
I 'm thinking smackdown Andy Havens vs. pinhut & Tim .
Andy Havens : you made some great points ( extra points for being passionate about it ) , but I 'm not sure we 're talking apples - to - apples ( my fault for not being clear ) .
I 'm not addressing marketing as a whole -- just the marketingesque activities that non-marketers do , and even * that * within our very limited context .
This blog is n't directed at -- or useful to -- the kinds of companies and products with the size and budgets you 're talking about ( although obviously some stuff can still be applied ) .
But the idea that , because of the web , a tiny software company or even a horse trainer can find a following and create passionate users -- by being good and helping users kick ass -- but with virtually a zero marketing / ad budget , is pretty powerful .
The Good Things ( products , services , websites , causes , music ) are bubbling up from the bottom and succeeding much more quickly , and that part IS new .
I think of all the wonderful things people built that were lost because they had no mechanism to scale their word - of - mouth within a livable time frame , and they could n't survive .
pinhut : sorry for the comment edit , but as much as I love Bill Hicks , my older relatives read this blog and are still shocked that I " use the word ' ass ' with such abandon . "
And yes , this * is * just a ride . ; )
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Aug 27 , 2005 10:39:29 PM
Andy has a point re .
shareholders etc .
But you know what ?
I do n't care .
If people want to spend their lives beholden to the shareholder slushpile , well , they have free will .
Nobody makes you become a meatpuppet .
There 's no law saying you have to be an MBA cogboy .
The cost of creating global media has fallen from billions of dollars to PENNIES in the last few decades .
And the slushpile has no earthly clue what to do about it .
As the world becomes more commodified by the China - WalMart make n' sell complex , the demand for " Bespoke " grows .
Therein lies the opportunity .

Posted by : Carlos Saldivia | Aug 28 , 2005 9:08:36 AM
Buy Carlos a Telephone -- stop --
But listen to his message -- stop --
Shareholders will lose all their non-tangible - assests if the customers go away .
We all know this .
Marketers ( old school ) do n't have to deliver customers as much as find a scapegoat for their failures .
Shareholders -- schmareholders -- marketers self - interest is to score points by how much power they can weild , " my budget is bigger than yours " type BS .
But then that is because marketers are not rewarded by tangible measurable results .
Set up a system where " your " rewards do n't align with the companies ?
Guess which rewards Marketers ( and Sarbanes , Oxley ... ) will go for ...
Posted by : Doug | Aug 28 , 2005 10:19:28 AM
The 4 P's are still a good way ( if perhaps simplified ) of addressing the main marketing problems , and show how marketing is different from development / engineering .
Someone in the company needs to address pricing and product definition issues , leaving them to the customers is daft .
Worse , leaving them to engineering is commercial suicide .
Still , after seeing Kathy S's pic recently I see she is a babe , and I want her to have my babies , so I 'm not picking any quarrels here !

Trying to sell people on something other than marketing is marketing .
Developing an anti-marketing schtick is marketing .
Blogs are marketing .
In short , there 's no escape .
So , the challenge is perfectly clear .
We need to make marketing better .
Posted by : David Burn | Aug 28 , 2005 5:21:14 PM
Wally : you 're the best .
But about that picture ... flattered as I am , keep in mind that I know Photoshop .
And I do like " marketeers " ; it also has the whole Disney thing going for it .
David : oh how true that is .
I am finding it ironic that some of the people who hate me for sounding / smelling like a marketer are making a masterful use of trackbacks and comment links to their own sites .
Seems they do n't mind using this blog to * market * their own ; )
Tim : I can think of reasons for people to kill themselves , but promoting your project / blog / book / whatever that you believe in is pretty low on that list .
Life 's going to be short enough for all of us as it is .
pinhut : I strongly disagree with you about the " signified " being unchanged .
Making distinctions and seeing shades of grey and subtley ( and holding conflicting points of view while still being able to function ) is profoundly important .
I 'm definitely for having strong values and sticking to them ... but failing to appreciate the difference between honest , authentic evangelizing for something we believe in , and the mindless detached promotion of things that might , say , kill people ... is a problem .
I believe that most of the folks on this blog are making those distinctions .
That said , it could very well BE a slippery slope .
I could imagine myself justifying the little things step by step until one day I 'm finding myself doing something I would have , at some earlier point , found pretty distasteful ( the " slowly boiling frog " effect ) .
But that 's part of why many of us are having a conversation about it .
So we can figure out our own subtle boundaries , and as Dave said , try to make it better .
But Dave was right -- all of us here ARE marketing , pinhut .
You 're certainly trying to promote / market a point of view ( and your own site ) and using provocative ad - savvy techniques to do so .
And I have fallen right into your evil marketing scheme , because here we are talking about you and linking to you again .
And having said THAT -- I have to laugh at this whole conversation again , because I 'm not willing to take ANY of this -- anything I or anyone else says here -- * that * seriously .
Perhaps I 've been playing my Bill Hicks videos just a little too often , or studying too much quantum physics -- but I just can't help recognize that none of this is " real " .
However , I do n't need it to be " real " in order to have a conscience , or care about people , or to believe that many of us just might change the world in our own small way : )

" If you 're interested in creating passionate users , or keeping your job , or breathing life into a startup , or getting others to contribute to your open source project , or getting your significant other to agree to the vacation you want to go on ... congratulations .
You 're in marketing . "
Not all of these are clearly marketing in my view .
To be specific , it 's only marketing if you are selling something .
Marketing takes place in a market .
Other types of promotion have other names : advocacy , evangelism , propaganda , and so on .
If those passionate users are using a commercial product then creating them might be a marketing act ( helping to secure the market for that product ) .
However , if those are users of public infrastructure ( roads , parks , government services ) then there is no market ( there is a commons , a political arena , perhaps many conversations but nothing is being bought or sold ) .
Keeping your job is marketing , yes , in as much as workers are commodities of the job market .
" Breathing new life into a startup " is n't specific enough to comment on .
There are any number of reasons for wanting others to contribute to your open source project .
Many of them have to do with creating a market for related offerings but there are also wholy non-commercial motivations that are cultural , ethical , political or other .
Lastly , at risk of offending your elder relatives , unless you or your significant other is a , ahem , " professional " companion then there is no market between you .
Economic abstractions are enormously pervasive today .
The idea of a competitive market is easily our most popular metaphor for any sort of social interaction .
However , it is sloppy or worse to call every argument for one thing over another " marketing " when there are more accurate terms available , and English is a truly enormous language .
I 'd like to suggest " advocacy " for the more inclusive , " everybody does it " type of promotion you 've described .
If you really want to emphasis the passion and zeal , say " evangelism " .
I like " cheerleading " too but , as with each of these terms , it has it's own associations such as being facile , shallow , and unfailingly partisan ( " go team ! " ) .
But , like whatever , y'know .
Laugh it off .
Nothing is real .

Maybe it's the whole metaphor of ' selling ' that is inflationated and has all kinds of negative connotations .
If you are selling , then you are marketing .
Can we think of a better word ?

Oddly enough , I 've been listening to my one Bill Hicks ( another Arkansaw boy ) CD quite a bit lately ( a live one , the Flying Saucer Tour , Vol. I ) , and wondering where my moral clarity went , in comparison to Hicks ' .
I like this comment surrounding a quote from Marianne Faithful :
She speaks of the '60s as someone might speak of Paris in the ' 20s , which is why it carries tremendous weight when , speaking of Epstein 's failure to secure a lucrative licensing deal for American - produced Beatles ' merchandise , she says , " I do n't think it 's bad to not be good at that . "
Her statement takes your breath away :
It repudiates everything that has come to be thought important in the arts -- the deal making , the percentages , the grosses -- and puts the focus back on the work itself .

I know that , given a market - fundamentalist society , I do n't have any choice but to sell myself .
That does n't mean I have to feel good about it , accept it , or believe that it 's simply in the nature of things .

Kathy ,
If your still looking for a replacement for " marketer " or " marketeer " , how about " evangelist " ?
My first run in with this alternative title was when Guy Kawasaki became one for the Macintosh - I know , that drag in the whole Apple as a cult thing , oh well .
If you 're passionate about your product , whatever it is , and you want others to believe too , then I think Evangelist fits the bill pretty well .

Kathy ,
After some thought , I think that the best terms I can come up with are " dictatorial " and " democratic " marketing .
In the old days , marketers were like dictators , manipulating and commanding their audience .
Today , we have to be democrats , cultivating a following by listening to the concerns of our constituents .

Chris , could you explain why you called it " democratic " instead of " demagogic " or " populist " ( two entirely different slants ) marketing ?
I 'm not sure " democratic " is the right word for sweetening a top - down process .

BRUSSELS , April 26 - Investigators for the European Parliament said Wednesday that data gathered from air safety regulators and others found that the Central Intelligence Agency had flown 1,000 undeclared flights over European territory since 2001 .
Sometimes the planes stopped to pick up terrorism suspects who had been kidnapped to take them to countries that use torture , the investigators added .
The operation used the same American agents and the same planes over and over , they said , though they could not say how many flights involved the transport of suspects .
The investigation , by a committee looking into C.I.A. counterterrorism activities in Europe , also concluded that European countries , including Italy , Sweden and Bosnia and Herzegovina , were aware of the abductions or transfers and therefore might have been complicit .
The book details a meeting between President Bush and Tony Blair
The book by Philippe Sands says the two leaders discussed going to war regardless of any United Nations view .
And it suggests the US wanted to provoke Saddam Hussein by sending a spy plane over Iraq in UN colours .
Downing Street said on Thursday it did not comment on discussions that " may or may not have happened " between leaders .
' Disarm Saddam '
The revelations come in an updated edition of Mr Sands ' book Lawless World , which caused controversy when it was first published early last year .
The government has always insisted military action was used as a last resort against Saddam Hussein 's regime .
Sir Menzies Campbell says there was a " rush to war "
Mr Blair told MPs on 25 February 2003 : " Even now , we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully . "
But the new book centres on a meeting between Mr Bush and Mr Blair at the White House three weeks earlier , on 31 January .
Professor Sands , a QC and professor of international law at University College London , says the two - hour meeting was also attended by six advisers .
The book quotes from a note it says was prepared by one of the participants .
Surveillance aircraft
According to the note , Mr Bush said the military campaign was pencilled in for March .
Mr Blair is quoted as saying he was " solidly with the president and ready to do whatever it took to disarm Saddam " .
The book claims Mr Blair only wanted a second UN Security Council resolution because it would make it easier politically to deal with Saddam .
And it says Mr Bush told Mr Blair the US " was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq , painted in UN colours " .
If Saddam fired on them , the Iraqis would be in breach of UN resolutions , he suggested .
Mr Bush is also quoted saying it was possible an Iraqi figure would defect and be able to give a " public presentation " of weapons of mass destruction .
The note said Mr Bush thought there was also " a small possibility that Saddam would be assassinated " .
The book also claims the president " thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups " .
' Will not re-litigate '
It also claims the note reveals the two leaders discussed a number of options .
A Downing Street spokeswoman told BBC
News the events leading up to the war had been thoroughly investigated .
A spokeswoman said the prime minister only committed UK forces to Iraq after securing the approval of the House of Commons on 18 March 2003 .
The decision to resort to military action into Iraq fulfilled the obligation imposed by successive UN Security Council resolutions after other routes to disarm Iraq had failed , she said .
The spokeswoman said No 10 did not comment on conversations between the prime minister and other leaders .
In the US , Frederick Jones , chief spokesman for the National Security Council , said the White House would not comment on what was said or not said in alleged private conversations between Mr Bush and foreign leaders .
Mr Jones said the White House " was not going to re-litigate how the nation went to war " .
Acting Liberal Democrats leader Sir Menzies Campbell said Mr Blair had " a lot of explaining to do " and a full inquiry into the Iraq decision was now " imperative " .
" It would appear that the diplomatic efforts in New York after the meeting of January 31 [ for a second UN resolution ] were simply going through the motions , with the decision for military action already taken , " he said .
Sir Menzies said the suggestion that the US considered using their military aircraft in UN colours to provoke Saddam Hussein " illustrates the rush to war " .
Secrets of Greatness " South Park's " rise to fame Back to story 1992 Matt Stone and Trey Parker , still in college , create " Jesus vs. Frosty , " a crudely animated short with the four " South Park " boys .
Providence , RI - Researchers at Rhode Island Hospital and Brown Medical School have discovered that insulin and its related proteins are produced in the brain , and that reduced levels of both are linked to Alzheimer 's disease .
The findings are reported in the March issue of the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease ( http://www. j-alz . com ) , published by IOS Press .
" What we found is that insulin is not just produced in the pancreas , but also in the brain .
And we discovered that insulin and its growth factors , which are necessary for the survival of brain cells , contribute to the progression of Alzheimer 's , " says senior author Suzanne M. de la Monte , a neuropathologist at Rhode Island Hospital and a professor of pathology at Brown Medical School .
" This raises the possibility of a Type 3 diabetes . "
It has previously been known that insulin resistance , a characteristic of diabetes , is tied to neurodegeneration .
While scientists have suspected a link between diabetes and Alzheimer 's disease , this is the first study to provide evidence of that connection .
By studying a gene abnormality in rats that blocks insulin signaling in the brain , researchers found that insulin and IGF I and II are all expressed in neurons in several regions in the brain .
Additionally , researchers determined that a drop in insulin production in the brain contributes to the degeneration of brain cells , an early symptom of Alzheimer's .
" These abnormalities do not correspond to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes , but reflect a different and more complex disease process that originates in the CNS ( central nervous system ) , " the paper states .
By looking at postmortem brain tissue from people diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease , researchers discovered that growth factors are not produced at normal levels in the hippocampus - the part of the brain responsible for memory .
The absence of these growth factors , in turn , causes cells in other parts of the brain to die .
Reserachers found that insulin and IGF I were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex , hippocampus and hypothalamus - all areas that are affected by the progression of Alzheimer's .
Conversely , in the cerebellum , which is generally not affected by Alzheimer 's , scientists did not see the same drop in insulin and IGF I .
" Now that scientists have pinpointed insulin and its growth factors as contributors to Alzheimer 's , this opens the way for targeted treatment to the brain and changes the way we view Alzheimer 's disease , " de la Monte says .
In an accompanying review article , de la Monte and accompanying author Jack Wands , MD , of Rhode Island Hospital and Brown Medical School , write that " there is a genuine need for thorough and comprehensive study of the neuropathological changes associated with diabetes mellitus , in the presence or absence of superimposed Alzheimer 's Disease or vascular dementia . "

The study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse and from a COBRE award from the National Institutes of Health .
Founded in 1863 , Rhode Island Hospital ( www.rhodeislandhospital.org) is a private , not - for - profit hospital and is the largest teaching hospital of Brown Medical School .
A major trauma center for southeastern New England , the hospital is dedicated to being on the cutting edge of medicine and research .
Rhode Island Hospital ranks 13th among independent hospitals who receive funding from the National Institutes of Health , with research awards of more than $ 27 million annually .
Many of its physicians are recognized as leaders in their respective fields of oncology , cardiology , orthopedics and minimally invasive surgery .
The hospital 's pediatrics wing , Hasbro Children 's Hospital , has pioneered numerous procedures and is at the forefront of fetal surgery , orthopedics and pediatric neurosurgery .
Douglas Giles is a recent casualty .
He used to teach a class on world religions at Roosevelt University , Chicago , founded in memory of FDR and his liberal - inclined wife , Eleanor .
Last year , Giles was ordered by his head of department , art historian Susan Weininger , not to allow students to ask questions about Palestine and Israel ; in fact , nothing was to be mentioned in class , textbooks and examinations that could possibly open Judaism to criticism .
Students , being what they are , did not go along with the ban .
A young woman , originally from Pakistan , asked a question about Palestinian rights .
Someone complained and Professor Giles was promptly fired .
Leaving aside his boss 's doubtful qualifications to set limits on a class of comparative religion - her speciality is early 20th - century Midwestern artists such as Tunis Ponsen ( nor have I ) - the point to grasp is that Professor Giles did not make inflammatory statements himself : he merely refused to limit debate among the young minds in front of him .
This might be seen as a troubling one - off like the story involving the president of Harvard , Lawrence Summers , who suggested that innate differences between the minds of men and women could be one reason why fewer women succeed in science and maths careers and was then ousted .
But Giles 's sacking is far more important because it is part of the movement to suppress criticism of Israel on the grounds that it is anti-semitic .
A mild man , Giles seems astonished to find the battle for free speech in his own lecture theatre .
' It may be sexy to get on a bus and go to DC and march against war , ' he said to me last week .
' It is much less sexy to fight in your own university for the right of free speech .
But that is where it begins .
That is because they are taking away what you can talk about . '
He feels there is a pattern of intolerance in his sacking that has been encouraged by websites such as FrontPageMag.com and Campus Watch .
Joel Beinin of Stanford University is regularly attacked by both .
Beinin is a Jew who speaks both Hebrew and Arabic .
He worked in Israel and on an assembly line in the US , where he helped Arab workers understand their rights .
Now , he holds seminars at Stanford in which all views are expressed .
For this reason , no doubt , his photograph recently appeared on the front of a booklet entitled ' Campus Support for Terrorism ' .
It was published by David Horovitz , the founder of FrontPageMag.com who has both composed a bill of rights for universities , designed to take politics ( for which read liberal influence and plurality ) out of the curriculum and a list of the 100 most dangerous academics in America , which includes Noam Chomsky and many other distinguished thinkers and teachers .
The demented , bullying tone of the websites is another symptom of the descent of public discourse in America and , frankly , one can easily see the attractions of self - censorship on the question of Middle East and Israel .
Read David Horovitz for longer than five minutes and you begin to hear Senator Joseph McCarthy accusing someone of un-American activities .
At Harvard , a few weeks after what was called Summers 's ' mis - step ' , a much greater row ensued when John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago and Stephen Walt of Harvard published a paper called ' The Israel Lobby ' .
Brave because the alleged distortion of US pro-Israel foreign policy is unmentionable in American public life .
Their paper was printed only in the UK , in the London Review of Books .
In America , there then followed what has been described as the massive ' Shhhhhhhhh ! '
Apart from the mud-slinging from sites such as Campus Watch and FrontPageMag , it has had little mainstream circulation and there has been no real debate .
I have read it several times and cannot disagree with an early point made by the authors .
' There is a strong moral case for supporting Israel 's existence , but that is not in jeopardy .
Viewed objectively , its past and present conduct offers no moral basis for privileging it over the Palestinians . '
That is the crux .
All Americans , to say little of the British who have been reluctantly welded to US policy , surely deserve the chance to know about the influence that lobbies such as the American - Israeli Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) exert at times like these .
' The bottom line , ' say Mearsheimer and Walt , 'is that AIPAC is a de facto agent for a foreign government , has a stranglehold on Congress , with the result that US policy is not debated there , even though the policy has important consequences for the entire world .
In other words , one of the three main branches of the government is firmly committed to supporting Israel . '
Later they say : ' The lobby 's influence causes trouble on several fronts .
It increases the terrorist danger that all states face , including America 's European allies .
It has made it impossible to end the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , a situation that gives extremists a powerful recruiting tool , increases the pool of potential terrorist and sympathisers and contributes to Islamic radicalism in Europe and Asia . '
You could add that the lobby 's influence may , in the long run , be very much against Israel 's interests .
That is my belief , but these things are rarely discussed in America .
People look vaguely queasy when you raise the subject of the Israeli lobby , as though the only concern in American discourse is not to appear anti-semitic , a fear which , I suggest , is sometimes shamelessly played upon .
The right of people like Mearsheimer , Walt , Beinin , Giles and even Summers to say what they think must remain inviolate if we are not to lose the values the West insists its fighting for .
A little boldness is called for on both sides of the Atlantic to question the pressure coming from both Jewish and Muslim quarters not to discuss issues openly because of various sensibilities .
In Britain , we should deplore with equal vehemence the temptation to give into special pleading from , for instance , the Muslim businessmen who do not want the film of Monica Ali's Brick Lane made in their area .
They have no right to dictate to this ancient democracy of ours - now theirs - and so stifle free expression .
Last week , during Jon Snow 's fascinating Channel 4 documentary about Muslim attitudes in this country , a woman said that British society was too decadent for her to allow her children to integrate completely .
A moment 's thought suggested that British democracy had much to offer over the appalling civic values found in most Muslim countries , the oppression of women in Islam , the untold domestic abuse and the tens of thousands of children sold into bonded labour in Pakistan - her husband 's country of origin .
Her prim separatism fails to grasp the value of our democratic institutions when set against societies run by Sharia law and so undermines them .
My view is that in America and Britain , we should think of free speech as an article of faith , as one of the ways that we define our civilisation against the forces that were to be unleashed on us this week , as well as the influences that stifle criticism of Israel and so enable the disgraceful actions in south Lebanon .
The interests of extreme proponents of Muslim and Jewish faiths combine in one way or another to assault our ancient democratic traditions and we must resist them .
Let the students like those in Douglas Giles 's class ask whatever they like .
Gwyneth Paltrow has a secret to getting in shape after pregnancy - girdles .
The screen beauty , who is married to Coldplay rocker Chris Martin , started wearing the waist - cinching garments after giving birth to son Moses last month .
She has also started a strict diet to help shift the extra pounds .
A source told Britain 's Grazia magazine : " Gwyneth gave up wheat , sugar , caffeine and dairy straight after Moses was born .
And she 's also wearing a special girdle designed to pull her waist back into shape .
" She follows quite a strict diet anyway , but she got her figure back quickly after having her daughter , Apple , and now wants to achieve the same following Moses ' birth .
"
It is n't the first time the actress has admitted turning to some secret support .
After having her Apple , now two , Gwyneth confessed : " I wore two girdles !
It 's a great trick .
That 's how all the Hollywood girls do it .
" There are these great things called Spanx , which are like bike shorts , and they just squeeze you in .
It 's terrific . "
最近は学校教育ばかりに目が行くが、社会教育とりわけ職業教育の分野で今の日本は目詰まり状態にある。製造現場や運輸事業などで相次ぐ事故。明らかに日本の現場力が落ちているという現実をもはや否定できない。
日本式経営というものは、中途半端に教育を受けている人材より純粋無垢な人材を企業カラーに染めることを重視したきた。大企業は製造業の現業員であれば工業高校で最低限の技術教育を受けていればいい、大卒社員でも大学で学んだ内容は余り重視せず、潜在的能力さえあればいいという考えが支配的であった。
し かし90年代以降、新入社員をじっくり育てる大企業が軒並み新卒採用を減らし、非正規雇用に切り替えたり、即戦力確保のための中途採用に踏み切るようになった。一方で新興企業は大企業のリストラにより即戦力の確保が比較的容易であり、企業内での基礎的職業教育のノウハウがなくてもそこそこうまく行っていたのである。
現在どういう問題が起きているかと言えば、誰も職業教育をやらなくなった日本という現実である。
企業は都合よく、学校に即戦力を輩出する教育をしろだとか、国に職業教育しろと言うのである。
企業が社会的責任を放棄して、それを国が代替する姿こそ、「大きな政府」が生まれる温床である。
人々はベンチャー企業と「小さな政府」の親和性の高さ、或いは企業は新自由主義を支持しているような錯覚を持っているが、「人を育てる」という最低限の社会的責任を放棄した企業の態度は明らかに矛盾している。

Pluvo
Pluvo is a nascent experimental scripting language with an easy to use syntax , built in test facilities , and modern datatypes .
High level and data structured , it makes things easier for the programmer by incorporating idioms from a wide range of languages in a consistent manner .
Download Guide Documentation FAQ
What 's Inside ?
Pluvo is a functional and imperative programming language intended to be highly practical for scripting and CGIs , interpreted using a just - in - time compiler .
Its hybrid dynamic and strict typing is flexible enough to allow duck typing .
Its functions are , more specifically , closures , and it allows object orientation using prototypes .
Apart from Strings , Numbers , URIs , Regexps , and other such atoms , its most important datatype is the Table , which is an array and hashtable hybrid à la Javascript and Lua ( from which it gets its name ) .
All of a program 's code is stored in Tables that may then be manipulated by the program itself .
Being a data - structured language it allows self - modification à la Smalltalk and Lisp .
Download and Install
Unstable alpha : pluvo-latest.tar.gz ( 2006-07-08 ) Size : 43,232 bytes MD5 : 3a729916c8bbfe1a64ad4253b2fcd44f
: pluvo-latest.tar.gz ( 2006-07-08 )
See below for installation instructions .
Pluvo comes as a single package with all tests and documentation included .
The just - in - time compiler is not by any means optimised , though should Pluvo emerge from its rapid prototype development phase then targeting IMCC may be a future option when Parrot is mature enough .
Status :
Most of the structure and essential functions are implemented , but the standard library is very sparse so it 'll be difficult to implement non-trivial programs in it .
The language is mainly a features playground ; further development will depend on the viability of the approaches .
Please feel free to help out by using the language , reporting bugs , and submitting patches !
Installation : Full instructions are given in the README .
txt file in the package , but basically it 's the normal ./ configure , make , and make install ( with privileges ) dance .
You only need to do the latter step if you want to install pluvo into /usr / local / bin ; otherwise you can use the pluvo .
py script to test the language without installing .
Try running pluvo hello.pvo to check the installation quickly .
Hello World
The best way to get a feel for a programming language is to look at examples .
Hello world in Pluvo is just a one liner , say " Hello , world ! " , so here 's a more illustrative script :
#!/usr/bin/env pluvo % grep.pvo - Search Files for Pattern Author : Sean B. Palmer , inamidst.com usage " grep.pvo [ options ] pattern filenames + " -h/--help " Display a help message " - t/-- test " Perform builtin code tests " grep = ( filenames pattern ) %%
Grep through filenames for pattern example grep ( " tag:pluvo.org,2006 :words " ) " ria " => " 20 . Thesmophoriazousae " for line {@lines filenames} / $ pattern / line { out line } main = ( argv ) -- help or {not args} { help } -- test { check grep ; quit } grep {args .
filenames} {args .
pattern} script main
Check out the Guide to Pluvo for a quick walkthrough of the language , written mainly for people who already have a fair amount of programming experience .
There is n't really a good introduction to Pluvo yet for anyone who is starting out programming , and Pluvo is n't yet recommended for those types of people ( I suggest Python , Lisp , Ruby , or Perl ) .
There 's also a guide to Pluvo 's basic functions , which contains a few helpful examples .
Another way to get a feel for a language is to be told what it 's derived from , but it 's hard to say what Pluvo is most like .
The author is a Python addict , but the feel of the language is n't really all that Pythonic , even though it might look like that on the surface .
For example , the whitespace indenting is really just bracket optionality , so it owes more to Haskell on that front .
Its object orientedness is like Javascript and Self .
Its syntax owes much to Bash , and its structure owes a lot to Lisp .
The datatypes are much like you would find in any programming language , but Tables are from Javascript and Lua .
A couple of the function names are from Perl6 .
There 's also a lot of novel stuff in there .

A : Yes .
It was developed on Windows , in fact .
You 'll need to install Cygwin , the Linux - like environment for Windows , of which there are many lightweight variants ( try searching for more information ) .
It 's very easy to install and use .
Q : What license is Pluvo released under ?
A : At the moment none , so full copyright is retained , but the plan is to use an Open Source or Free Software license .
The problem is deciding which one , or which ones , to use !
If you can make a case for a particular license , please do so on the Pluvo mailing list .
Before a license is chosen , you 're still free to use it : " Once you 've legally downloaded a program , you can compile it .
You can run it .
You can modify it .
You can distribute your patches for other people to use . "
And once a suitable license is chosen you 'll be able to do much more .
Q : What justifies Yet Another Programming Language ?
A : I wanted to develop a language to fill a gap in my scripting needs , calquing features from the languages I know since whenever I go to use them I always dream of a hybrid .
In fact I ended up taking from more languages than I use .
Languages are consensus driven , so there 's no harm in there being another one ; if people think it 's good they 'll use it , and if they do n't then it 'll be out there but unspoken of .
Either way there have already been benefits for me : making a language is fun , and there 's a lot to learn by doing .
Q : Is Pluvo stable and suitable for use yet ?
A : It 's not stable .
It 's suitable for use as long as you understand that it may undergo large backwards incompatible changes whilst it 's in its alpha phase .
Once it 's out of alpha , pains will be taken to ensure that backwards incompatible changes do n't happen .
Q : Is Pluvo being worked on ?
A : Yes , but sporadically .
It 's mainly an experiment and a playground , though it does seem to be a very good one .
But whilst it may be a highly viable approach to structuring a programming language , actually implementing a programming language is not a weekend job , especially for a programming team of one .
If you want to see it be furthered , feel free to write code in it , give feedback , and contribute .
Q : Where is the source repository ?
A : You can use the inamidst directory browser to view the source , and the updates and changes service to view the differences between versions as GNU unified diff files .

Enric Naval was presented with an opportunity he could n't pass up : a plump scholarship , real - world programming experience , and some spending money .
All he had to do was give up sixteen measly hours each week for some work - study in the college 's IT department .
How hard could that be ?
According to this figure I just made up , 63 % of college students spend at least that much time each day in World of Warcraft .
Enric 's job did n't seem too hard , either .
All he had to do was maintain the Student Registration System .
How hard could that be ?
It 's not like the Student Registration System really changes ; all it needs is student , class , and schedule data imported .
Maintenance should be a cinch .
At least , that might be the case at other colleges .
At WTFU , the " Student " adjective in " Student Registration System " refers to not only the target users of the system , but also to those who build and maintain it .
And really , who better to build and maintain a production application than those armed with only a few programming classes under their belt ?
Designed and built by an army of work - study students , the complexity of this system is unimaginable .
Like an old painting , the system has been written , re-written , and re-written again , all without ever starting on a fresh canvas .
With no versioning in place , thousands of code files lay side by side with several different MAKE files , the newest of which is named " new-new2-BUILDSITE - real . "
But despite all this , the system worked .
And it needed to continue working .
One of the areas that Enric maintained was the redirect logic .
The idea was that , instead of using something like navigation , a central Servlet would be used to redirect users to the appropriate page following an action .
For example , users working on the start page in activity 5 woud get redirected to the task page for the same activity .
Then they would get redirected to the process page .
All fairly simple stuff ... in concept .
Somewhere down the line , one of the developers had an idea " guess " redirect users , meaning that if another developer accidently misspelled a page name , the user would still go to the correct page instead of seeing a page - not - found error .
This , and several other similar features , led to redirect logic spanning several thousand lines of code .
Presented to you is only a small subset of this redirect code .
The entire redirect servlet is but a drop in the bucket in the context of the Student Registration System ...
public final class RedirServlet extends CoreServlet { public final void doGet ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse res ) { res.setContentType( " text / plain " ) ; res.setStatus(res.SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY ) ; res.setHeader( " Location " , doRedirect ( req.getServletPath ( ) ) ) ; } private final String doRedirect ( String page ) { // default redir String redir = " /unknown_redir.jsp " ; // find/return redirect ( 1 - 4 unused ) int n = parseRedirIndex ( page ) ; if ( n == 5 ) { redir = doRedirect_a5 ( page ) ; } else if ( n == 6 ) { redir = doRedirect_a6 ( page ) ; } else if ( n == 7 ) { redir = doRedirect_a7 ( page ) ; } else if ( n == 8 ) { redir = doRedirect_a8 ( page ) ; } /* snip */ else if ( n == 51 ) { redir = doRedirect_a51 ( page ) ; } else if ( n == 52 ) { redir = doRedirect_a 52 ( page ) ; } else if ( n == 53 ) { redir = doRedirect_a53 ( page ) ; } return redir ; } private final String doRedirect_a5 ( String page ) { if ( page.equals ( " a5- intro.jsp " ) ) return " ../activity-5/a5-introduction.jsp " ; else if ( page.equals ( " a5-introduction.jsp " ) ) return " ../activity-5/a5-introduction.jsp " ; else if ( page.equals ( " a5-intorduction.jsp " ) ) return " ../activity-5/a5-introduction.jsp " ; /* snipped a whole bunch of cases */ else if ( page.startsWith( " a5 - task - 2 - 3 " ) ) return " ../tasks/r.jsp?redir=../activity-5/task-2-4.jsp " ; else if ( page.startsWith( " a5 - task - 3 - 3 " ) ) return " ../tasks/r.jsp?redir=../activity-5/task3/taskC.jsp " ; /* snipped a whole bunch more cases */ else if ( page.equals ( " conclusions -5.jsp " ) ) return " ../conclusions3/incident5.jsp " ; else if ( page.equals ( " conclusions -specific -5.jsp " ) ) return " ../conclusions3/incident5.jsp " ; else if ( page.equals ( " conclusions-general -5.jsp " ) ) return " ../conclusions3/incident5.jsp " ; else return " ../activity-5/process.jsp " ; } /* snipped several thousand lines */ public final String doRedirect_a53 ( String page ) { if ( page.equals ( " a53-intro.jsp " ) ) return " ../activity - generic/introduction53.jsp " ; /* snip */ else if ( page.starts
With ( " professor - data " ) ) { if ( page.endsWith ( " - class.jsp " ) ) return " / classes/index.jsp " ; else if ( page.endsWith ( " ES102 - class.jsp " ) ) return " / classes/class-ES102.jsp " ; /* snip */ else if ( page.endsWith ( " PS442-class.jsp " ) ) return " / classes/class-PS442.jsp " ; } else return " ../activity-53/reprocess2.jsp " ; } }
A hybrid skeleton showing features of both Neanderthal and early modern humans has been discovered , challenging the theory that our ancestors drove Neanderthals to extinction .
The skeleton of a young boy was found in Portugal .
Scientists say it shows for the first time that Neanderthals , who became extinct tens of thousands of years ago , mated with early members of our own species .
The scientists believe that the offspring of the interbreeding could be ancestors of modern man .
" This skeleton , which has some characteristics of Neanderthals and others of early modern humans , demonstrates that early modern humans and Neanderthals are not all that different .
They intermixed , interbred and produced offspring , " said Erik Trinkaus of Washington University .
But Joao Zilhao of the Portuguese Archaeological Institute said more research was needed to back up the controversial theory .
And Dr Robert Foley of Cambridge University told the BBC : " The fossil evidence as we currently understand it does n't show the signs of hybrids between Neanderthals and modern humans , so it would be a novel and unusual find . "
Child skeleton found in rabbit hole
The skeleton , thought to be that of a four - year - old boy , was found when an archaeologist explored a rabbit hole near the coast north of Lisbon .
The child had been given a ritual burial , with red ochre and pierced shells .
He had the pronounced chin and teeth of modern humans , but his sturdy limbs were more characteristic of the Neanderthals .
The Neanderthals were a powerfully - built species who evolved to cope with the challenging climate of Ice Age Europe .
While their brains were bigger than our own , Neanderthals never developed the sophisticated culture and technology that became the hallmark of their modern human contemporaries .
' Out of Africa ' theory challenged
Most anthropologists believe that modern humans evolved in Africa by about 100,000 years ago .
They eventually spread across the world - the so - called " Out of Africa " theory .
By 20,000 years ago , the Neanderthals were extinct .
But it was not known whether modern humans destroyed them , or whether their distinctive characteristics disappeared through interbreeding .
Dr Trinkaus says the Portuguese skeleton provides powerful evidence for the interbreeding theory .
" This find refutes strict replacement models of modern human origins - that early modern humans all emerged from Africa and wiped out the Neanderthal population , " said Dr Trinkaus .
The scientists believe that raises the possibility that people alive today could have some genes inherited from Neanderthal ancestors .
" A major contribution "
Chris Stringer , an expert on Neanderthal man at the Museum of Natural History in London , said he expected the find to make a " major contribution " to the debate on how the Neanderthals died out .
The hybridisation theory has been difficult to prove because only fragments of skeletons have previously been found , Dr Stringer said .
" The Iberian peninsula is an area where there was a significant overlap in time and space between Neanderthal and modern man .
They could have coexisted for as long as 10,000 years , " he said .
World leaders vowed to " make poverty history " last year
The Center for Global Development 's ( CGD ) Commitment to Development Index of the world 's 21 richest nations puts the UK 12th - and ranks Japan last .
CGD President Nancy Birdsall welcomed a " steady " improvement in commitment to poverty reduction in recent years .
But , she added , help had fallen far short of promises made by world leaders in 2005 - the " Year of Development " .
The CGD 's measures a broad number of factors for the index , rather than merely the amount of aid countries provide .
It also examines several policy areas - such as trade investment migration and environment - while aid is measured not only in terms of quantity but as a share of its income and the quality of aid given .
' Room for improvement '
While the Netherlands led the pack on generous investment and aid as well as measures to curb greenhouse gases , the CGD added the country could still work harder .
By contrast , Japan ranked in last place as a result of a combination of factors including its low aid and high barriers to imports and migrants from poorer nations .
And although the US gave more money than anywhere else , its donation was the smallest of the 21 states in relation to the size of its economy .
Much of the US 's aid , the CGD added , was contingent on the purchase of US goods , and so was in fact a " backdoor subsidy for American interests " .
America was also criticised for its handling of aid in Iraq , with the CGD claiming that 90 cents in every dollar was lost to violence and corruption .
Trade barriers
However , the US fared well on the trade front .
Its barriers to exports from developing countries were lower than any other country in the Commitment to Development Index except New Zealand .
Elsewhere , the UK ranked first in the investment component of the Index for its efforts to boost technology and increase jobs .
It also achieved the highest score for its environmental record .
But the index penalised the UK for selling arms to " undemocratic governments " .
" The lives of a billion people could be improved in the next decade if rich countries reform their trade , migration and investment policies , " David Roodman , CGD researcher and chief architect of the CDI .
" Politically , these changes are difficult .
However , if rich countries are truly committed to development , they could easily bear the short - term costs of the reforms and the spread of prosperity would serve the interests of all countries . "

Welcome to my blog .
Here , I will post items of interest to me most likely focusing on : Security in Healthcare Information Technology
Electronic Voting Security

This is the first shot that I got when I discovered a pair of Leopard Slugs ( Limax maximus ) beginning to mate in my garden .
They were suspended by about a metre of the slime shown in the photo , and anchored from the bark of a tree trunk .
They were about half a metre off the ground .
At this stage they had finished producing the slime and were about to start really mating .
In this shot you can see that part of the sexual organ has been ' everted ' by the slug that 's lower down .
It is a very beautiful thing - translucent white , almost blue , like those photos of ice caverns you see .
The other slug has also begun to evert the organ .
You can see that it comes out from around the side of the head .
Well those beautiful organs have found each other and they 've entwined a few times .
You can see another feature of the organs - they are flanged .
Mr Hansen called for Danish sex laws to be more like Holland's
Torben Hansen , who has cerebral palsy , which severely affects his speech and mobility , believes his local authority should pay the extra charge he incurs when he hires a sex worker - because his disability means he cannot go to see them .
His case is currently being considered .
In Denmark , local authorities compensate disabled people for extra costs incurred because of their disability .
" I want them to cover the extra expenses for the prostitutes to get here , because it 's a lot more expensive getting them to come to my home rather than me going to a brothel , " Mr Hansen told BBC World Service 's Outlook programme .
" It 's a necessity for me .
I can't move very well , and it 's impossible for me to go there . "
' Unfair '
In Denmark , prostitution and other forms of sex work are not illegal so long as it is not a woman 's sole means of income .
Mr Hansen started seeing a prostitute after attending a course at a social centre .
There , he and other disabled people were taught that if they had needs , they " could do something about it " .
" I had a strong desire to have sex , and I think I gained the confidence around that time to get the call girls to come to me .
We spend tax money on trying to prevent prostitution - and we have a clear policy that this is a social problem that we want to solve
Danish MP Kristen Brosboel
He had been with his last girlfriend for six months , but she died in 2003 .
After that , Mr Hansen began arranging for visits to begin again .
He also said there had been " much research " into people in his situation , and that it had showed that not being sexually fulfilled can lead to " frustration and aggression " .
" It 's unfair to deny people with disabilities the right to a sex life , " he added .
Mr Hansen said the reaction to his campaign had been " very mixed . "
" Most of it 's been positive , but I 've read some very angry letters and comments in the papers ... a lot of politicians have been critical , especially women politicians against prostitution . "
Kristen Brosboel , a Social Democrat member of the Danish Parliament , is among those who have argued against Mr Hansen .
" Obviously I recognise that he has a problem that people without a disability may not have - but I disagree with the fact that we should support his visits with a prostitute with tax money , " she told Outlook .
" We also spend tax money on trying to prevent prostitution , helping women out of prostitution - and we have a clear policy that this is a social problem that we want to solve .
" So I think that 's very much in contradiction with spending tax money on requiring prostitutes . "
Google 's success has already spurred Microsoft to develop its own Internet search engine ( a project code - named Underdog ) , but Google has legions of engineers banging away on a range of projects of its own that , if successful , could dislodge Microsoft from the pre-eminent spot it has enjoyed since the early 1980's .
Of course , Silicon Valley has had past pretenders to the throne .
Netscape , which went public 10 years ago this month , and its Web browser , Navigator , were supposed to fell Microsoft -- but it is Netscape that is no longer in business .
And while Google is riding high , those closely following the company caution that it is hardly invincible ; an inflated stock price , a desire to compete in too many sectors simultaneously or simple hubris might cause it to stumble , they say .
Even Microsoft , after all , has had legal troubles .
Still , similarities between Google and Microsoft are evident to local entrepreneurs including Steven I. Lurie , who worked at Microsoft between 1993 and 1999 but now lives in San Francisco , and Joe Kraus , a founder of the 1990 's search firm Excite .
" There 's that same ' think big ' attitude about markets and opportunities , " said Mr. Lurie , who has visited the Google campus in Mountain View many times to see friends who work there .
" Maybe you can call it arrogance , but there 's that same sense that they can do anything and get into any area and dominate . "
To place Google in context , Mr. Kraus offered a brief history lesson .
In the 1990's , he said , I.B.M. was widely perceived in Silicon Valley as a " gentle giant " that was easy to partner with while Microsoft was perceived as an " extraordinarily fearsome , competitive company wanting to be in as many businesses as possible and with the engineering talent capable of implementing effectively anything . "
Now , in the view of Mr. Kraus , " Microsoft is becoming I.B.M. and Google is becoming Microsoft . "
Mr. Kraus is the chief executive and a founder of JotSpot , a Silicon Valley start - up hoping to sell blogging and other self - publishing tools to corporations .
Just as Microsoft has been seen over the years as an aggressive , deep - pocketed competitor for talent , Internet start - ups in Silicon Valley complain that virtually every time they try to recruit a well - regarded computer programmer , that person is already contemplating an offer from Google .
Acceptance ( does n’t equal ) Acquiescence
by Douglas Rushkoff
from Arthur No. 24 / Oct 02006 :
I ’ve been debating for a while about whether to do this .
Whether to come right out and say it .
On a certain level , it ’s like shouting “ fire ” in a crowded theater .
What good is it to announce a problem if I do n’t have a ready solution at hand ?
Furthermore , what if sharing this information – this perspective on our predicament – simply exacerbates our paralysis to do anything about it .
I mean , fascism breeds best in populations that have been stunned into complacency , cynicism , or despair .
( That ’s called a “ buried lede ” – a publishing term for hiding the main idea of a story deep within a paragraph .
Editors do n’t like it because it makes it hard for the reader to figure out what an article is about .
But I felt it necessary because , well , I ’m not quite comfortable talking about it too directly , just yet .
This fascism stuff . )
It all became blindingly clear to me the morning I found out Ken Lay was dead .
I was listening to the radio – to a friend of mine , actually , reading the news report on NPR .
He was explaining how the dishonored corporate elite criminal , the former CEO of Enron , had a fatal heart attack before he had the chance to spend the rest of his life in jail .
Because of certain technicalities in the law , this also meant Lay ’s family would in all likelihood be able to keep the millions of dollars that would have otherwise been paid back to Enron employees and shareholders in court fines .
The newsreader opined that Lay ’s death might have been suicide , and not just for the money .
Lay was in on those early secret energy industry meetings with Dick Cheney – the ones where they figured out oil prices and the Iraq War and other matters of state – and , facing prison , the fallen corporate superstar could have posed a security risk if he had leaked information about what had transpired to other prisoners or , worse , the FBI in trade for better living quarters .
But , given all that , I could n’t bring myself to believe Lay was dead at all .
If you ’re that rich and powerful , why die ?
Why not just get a hold of some corpse , pay - off a coroner , move to an island and call it a day ?
This is no grassy knoll feat .
It ’s not even CSI , but early 90’s Law & Order .
No big deal for a guy intimately connected with one of the most actively clandestine administrations in US history .
That same July morning , when news of North Korea ’s failed nuclear test launches were broadcast , I did n’t feel sure I was being told what was happening , either .
Not that news agencies can really know , either .
Did they launch ?
Were they thwarted by a US counterstrike , or by their own ineptitude ?
Do they even know ?
Do we ?
I ’m not saying one thing or the other happened – just that I stare at the news and do n’t believe anything they ’re saying .
I ’ve got no idea .
And it feels really weird .
I find I can trace this sense of uncertainty to the 2004 election .
The 2000 election was crooked , but the fraud was rather out in the open .
We watched hired thugs stop the Florida recount by trying to break into the room where the counting was happening – and thus delay the process long enough for the Supreme Court to choose Bush as the President .
But the 2004 voter fraud in Ohio , fully documented by Robert Kennedy Jr. , among others , was an entirely more hidden affair .
Diebold voting machines , teams of fraud squads , and election officials too afraid that disclosure of what happened will turn people off voting forever .
Those of us who try to stay even remotely connected to what is going on in the world around us have enough hard evidence to conclude with certainty that voting in America has been systematically and effectively undermined by the party currently in power .
In an increasing number of precincts , how people vote – if they are even allowed in – no longer has a direct influence on how their votes are tallied .
It ’s sad and confusing not to live in a democracy , anymore .
And while it ’s quite plainly true , it ’s a bit too unthinkable for most sane people to accept .
It goes in the same mental basket as more outlandish ( if not unthinkable ) thoughts — such as dynamite on the WTC or no airplane crashing into the Pentagon — even though , in this case , it ’s not conjecture , it ’s just plain real .
So what I ’m coming to grips with is accepting that I do n’t live in a democratic nation , and that the propaganda state attempted in 1930 ’s Europe did finally reach fruition here in the U.S. , just as Henry Ford and those of his ilk predicted .
Maybe I ’m just old , and have a very idealistic view of democracy .
When I was a kid , we were all told that this is a government of the people , and that our votes provided a check on the power of our leaders .
That ’s why we called them “ elected . ”
Or maybe it ’s just naïve to think that representative democracy could have worked the way it was presented to us .
The other side – the fascist side – does have an argument to make , and they ’ve been making it since Woodrow Wilson was president .
Having run on a “ peace ” campaign , Wilson later decided that America needed to get involved in World War I .
So , with the help of one of the great Public Relations masters of all time , Edward Bernays , he created the Creel Commission , whose job was to change America ’s mind .
Bernays , like the many political propagandists who followed , honestly believed that the masses are just too stupid to make decisions for themselves – particularly when it involved global affairs or economics .
Instead , an enlightened and informed elite ( corporate America ) needs to make the decisions , and then “ sell ” them to the public in the form of faux populist media campaigns .
This way , the masses feel they are coming up with these opinions , themselves .
Truly populist positions , on the other hand – such as workers ’ rights or minority representation – must be recontextualized as the corruption of the public by elite “ special interests ” or decadent social deviants .
Throughout most of history , these scapegoats were the Jews , but now it ’s mostly gays and liberals .
By distracting the masses with highly emotionally charged issues like flag - burning or gay marriage , those in power consolidate their base of support while developing a new mythology of state as religion .
As long as they do all this , they do n’t have to worry about how people vote , or what might be happening on the ground .
“ Unregulating ” the mediaspace turns the fourth estate ( the news agencies ) into just another arm of the corporate conglomerates that fascism was invented to serve .
( Mussolini called it “ corporatism , ” do n’t forget . )
The last and most crucial step in creating a truly seamless fascist order , though , is to frighten the intellectuals , students , and artists from seeing the world as it is and sharing their sensibilities with one another .
Hell , calling America ’s leaders “ a fascist regime ” ca n’t be good for business .
The only place I ’m allowed to write this way is on my blog or here in Arthur – and neither pays the bills .
Besides : why rock the boat ?
I may not have the right to vote , anymore , but I ’m being kept comfortable enough .
Like others of my class , I have a roof over my head .
I ’m crafty enough to get paid now and again for a book or talk or comic series .
And the state is functioning well enough that I can afford a tuna sandwich and walk around my neighborhood eating it without getting whacked with a rock or a grenade .
As far as history goes , that ’s pretty good .
So was democracy a failed experiment ?
Should we just let these guys run the country as long as they let us eat ?
Clearly , they ’re not scared of us or what we might be saying about them .
In fact , their best argument that we have n’t descended into fascism is the fact that we ’re allowed to distribute columns like this one .
How could we be living in a totalitarian propaganda state if there are articles pronouncing the same ?
Because fascism looks different every time around .
1930 ’s fascism failed because it was too obviously repressive .
Today ’s fascism works because it has turned the mediaspace into a house of mirrors where nothing is true and everything is permissible .
The fact that there are plenty of blogs and even major books saying what ’s happening and still it does n’t matter is proof that it has worked .
But there is hope .
It ’s not just the radicals and militias who are alarmed , but mainstream congresspeople and government wonks .
I , myself , have been approached by two separate government intelligence agencies and three members of congress ( of both parties ) for help understanding what they already deem to be actionable offenses against the American people by some of our leaders .
They are disturbed by the disinformation campaign leading up to the Gulf War , voter fraud , and the way Americans have been frightened into supporting the curtailment of civil rights .
Surprisingly , most of my conversations with these patriotic people involve two main concerns .
First , they have been ostracized by their peers for their views .
This has created some urgency , for they fear they will not get enough party support for re-election if they do n’t succeed in their efforts in the next few months .
Second , and more troublingly , they are afraid to disillusion America ’s youth .
Is n’t there a way to fix this problem , they wonder , without raising an entire generation of Americans in environment of acknowledged voter nullification ?
And what of our reputation in the world ?
Which is more damaging to democracy : voter fraud , or the public awareness of voter fraud ?
To this , we simply must conclude that the reality of voter fraud is more dangerous than any associated disillusionment .
To worry about the impact on public consciousness is to get mired in the logic of public relations – and that ’s what got us into this mess to begin with .
It ’s time to get real , and either fight ( through the courts , if possible ) to reinstate the rule of law as established by the Constitution , or accept that Enlightenment - era democracy simply does n’t work and move into a new phase of government by decree or market forces or whatever it is that comes next .
In any case , it serves no one to have a “ pretend democracy ” that ’s actually something else .
I ’m going to stop denying what ’s going on here , and use what influence I have with lawmakers , government workers , and activists to get them to do the same .
Instead of trying to feel better about all this , I ’m going to allow myself and everyone around me to feel worse .
Indeed , the bad news is the good news .
Total disillusionment , though momentarily painful , is utterly liberating and probably required .
Acceptance is n’t acquiescence at all ; it ’s the first step towards reconnecting with a reality that can and must be changed .
If we ’re going to get back on the horse , we ’ve got to acknowledge that we ’ve fallen off .

日本Rubyの会会長でツインスパークの高橋征義は「 Ruby の歴史」と題して講演。Rubyが初めて公開された1995年から，海外でも書籍の出版やカンファレンスの開催が行われるようなった普及の軌跡をたどり，「 Ruby on Railsの普及に見られるように，Rubyは趣味の言語からビジネスの言語になった」と語った。
まつもとゆきひろ氏はRubyが多くの人々に受け入れられた理由を「頭のいい人向けではなく“普通の人向け”に作った言語だったからではないか」と語った。また「海外で最初のRuby本を書いてくれたDave Thomas氏や，リファクタリングを提唱したMartin Fowler氏 ，Obejctive -Cの開発者Brad Cox氏，SmallTalkの開発者のひとりであるAlan Key氏など，多くの人がRubyを気に入ってくれ，紹介してくれた」と感謝の意を表した。
Rails事例が続々，社内標準とする企業も
カンファレンスでは，多数 のRuby on Rails採用事例に関する報告が行われた。
はてなの舘野祐一氏は，5月下旬にサービスを開始した「はてなスクリーンショット」を，分散オブジェクトを実現するライブラリ「dRuby」とRubyのWebアプリケーション・フレームワーク「 Ruby on Rails 」 （Rails）を使って構築したことを紹介した（詳細記事）。
「 Rails in Production 」 と題されたパネル・ディスカッションでは，Ruby on Railsを実際に業務に利用している企業がその実例を披露した。
ドリコムの瀧内元気氏は， 「 ドリコムでは2005年末に全社共通フレームワークとしてRuby on Railsを採用，B2Cサービスは全てRailsで作ることにした」との方針を紹介。すでに求人情報検索サービス「 Drecom Career Search 」 をRailsで構築，公開した。このサービスは50の求人サイトから求人情報を一括検索するもので，Ajaxも利用している。
また同社ではRailsで構築したアプリケーションのコンテスト「 Drecom Award on Rails」を企画，現在応募を受け付けている。
オープングルーヴ 技術責任者 大前潤氏は ，RSSリーダー・サイ ト「 FEEDBRINGER 」 をRailsで構築した事例を紹介した。RailsのほかPostgreSQLやlighttpdも利用している。
シルバーエッグ・テクノロジー ストヤン・ジェコフ氏は 約2年前にRuby on Rails を会社に提案，現在ほとんどのプロジェクトで使用しているという。これまでに社内向けの内部計算システムやモニタリング・システムなどを構築した。
イーサポートの高木宏氏は，保守契約管理などの社内業務にRailsを採用している事例などを紹介した。顧客向けにも，ログ集計結果分析閲覧サービスをRailsで構築，先日リリースしたという。
ミッタシステムの吉田和弘氏は，託児施設入退室管理・請求書発行システム，携帯メール連絡網システム，顧客・業務管理システム，さぬきうどん製麺所メールマガジン配信システム，アンティーク雑貨ショッピングサイトなどをRailsで構築した。
大西正太氏はRailsで構築したCMS（コンテンツ管理システム）Rubricksを紹介した。Ajaxを活用しユーザーがマウスのドラッグ・アンド・ドロップによりレイアウトを変更することができる。
「 DBとWebを統一して操作可能に 」 ，Rails 作 者Hansson 氏
カンファレンスには ，Railsの作者であ るDavid Heinemeier Hansson氏がシカゴから来日，基調講演を行った。Hansson氏は「
One controller , many ins , many outs 」と題して講演 。Railsの設計思想について語るとともに，現在開発中の新機能を紹介した。
ActiveResourceと呼ぶそれは，Railsの中核となるO/Rマッピング・ツールActiveRecordの拡張であり，データベースに加えてWebアプリケーションにも同じ方法でアクセスできるようにする機能だ。データベースとWebアプリケーションに対してもはCRUD（Create，Read，Update，Delete）という統一された枠組みで操作できるようにする。ただし現在のところRailsで構築されたWebアプリケーションへのアクセスを前提に実装しており「SOAPやXML Webサービスをサポートする必要は私自身では感じていない。必要な人に実装していほしい」と話した。
日本科学未来館の 「 インターネット物理モデル 」 はRubyで動いていた
Rails以外にも多くのRuby採用事例が紹介された。
まつもと氏の勤務先であるネットワーク応用通信研究所
代表取締役 井上浩氏は日本医師会の 「 医事標準レセプト ソフト 」 やCRMなどの業務ソフト「 Laborシリーズ」など，同社の社員が開発したRuby関連オープンソース・ソフトウエアを紹介した。同社は島根県のホームページを構築したが（関連記事），同社が開発したRubyベースのCMS（コンテンツ管理システム）を使用しており，こちらも今後オープンソース・ソフトウエアとして公開する予定という。井上氏は「ネットワーク応用通信研究所はlinux.or.jpのサーバーを運営するための企業として生越昌己氏らと設立，まつもと氏も創業時から参加しSI案件にRubyを活用してきた」と同社設立の経緯を紹介，「今後もRuby普及のためコミュニティのお手伝いをしていきたい」と話した。
また独立行政法人 産業技術総合研究所 江渡浩一郎氏は日本科学未来館の常設展示である 「 インターネット物理モデル 」 のRubyによる制御事例を紹介した。日本Rubyカンファレンス2006が開催されたのは産業技術総合研究所
臨海副都心センター。日本科学未来館のすぐ隣である。インターネット物理モデルとは，インターネットを流れるデータを小さな玉に見立て，その動きを実際の玉の動きとして見ることができる，日本科学未来館を代表する展示だ。インターネット物理モデルはRubyで直接Win32APIをたたくことによって制御したという。
このほかにも，多くの技術的な興味深い発表が行われた。講演者の発表資料などは日本Rubyカンファレンス2006の公式サイトで今後順次公開される予定である。
