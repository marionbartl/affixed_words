Macy ’s department store has refused to give prosecutors the names of customers who purchased children ’s jewelry made with potentially toxic lead , according to an official with the Los Angeles district attorney ’s office .
The department store ’s lack of cooperation comes nearly six months after the district attorney ’s office filed misdemeanor charges against Macy ’s , alleging that it falsely advertised necklaces as “ lead nickel free ” when they contained a significant amount of lead .
Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Daniel Wright said he subpoenaed the customer information from Macy ’s in January , but the company has balked at turning it over .
He said he believes Macy ’s customers could easily be tracked using records from credit cards and checks .
“ We want a list of the people that bought the lead - contaminated items so that they can be notified , ” Wright said .

Beth Charlton , director of issue management at Macy ’s Inc , . said the company had no comment .
A hearing has been set for April 7 in Superior Court in Glendale on Wright ’s motion to force the company to provide the names .
The criminal trial is scheduled to start May 4 .
The district attorney ’s office also charged Pecoware Co. Inc. , the Chino - based company that imported the jewelry from China .
The companies face a maximum penalty of $ 2,500 for each violation .
A judge could consider the sale of each piece of jewelry a violation .
Wright , who works in the district attorney ’s environmental law section , said it was extremely rare for his office to file this type of case .

He said Pecoware has been “ very cooperative ” and provided the district attorney ’s office with the information it requested , including test results on the jewelry .
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a voluntary recall of the necklaces in February 2008 , and customers were told to contact Pecoware for a refund .
It estimated that 2,900 of the necklaces were sold from January 2006 through November 2007 for about $ 13 each .
Macy ’s was not mentioned in the safety commission ’s recall announcement .
Prosecutors , however , contend that Macy ’s sold more tainted necklaces than any other retailer .

Scott Wolfson , a spokesman for the safety commission , said the commission encourages companies to use databases or other information in their possession to reach those who bought the product .
“ Research shows that directly contacting consumers leads to the highest response level , ” he said .
The commission , he said , has a special concern over children ’s metal jewelry .
“ Our advice to parents with young children is to be very cautious when it comes to metal jewelry , ” he said .
The necklaces that are the subject of the recall are a cat with silver and pink rhinestones ; a heart , lock and key with pink rhinestones ; a silver - colored heart with a rhinestone crown inside ; and a silver - colored lock and key with pink rhinestones .
They hang from silver - colored chains .

According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , lead poisoning can affect almost every part of the body and show no obvious symptoms .
It can cause learning disabilities in children , behavioral problems and , at high levels , seizures , coma and death .
Linda Kite , director of Healthy Homes Collaborative , a Los Angeles nonprofit group working to improve people ’s health and housing , said Macy ’s should make efforts to alert those who bought the necklaces .
“ Macy ’s , in order to be a responsible business , should , of course , be concerned their products are hurting people , ” she said .
“ We all make mistakes and should take responsibility for mistakes .
That ’s what ’s being asked . ”

Singer machines were reported to be changing hands for exorbitant prices
Saudi police say they are investigating a hoax that has seen people rushing to buy old - fashioned sewing machines for up to $ 50,000 ( £ 33,500 ) .
The Singer sewing machines are said to contain traces of red mercury , a substance that may not exist .
But it is widely thought that it can be used to find treasure , ward off evil spirits or even make nuclear bombs .
It is believed that tiny amounts can sell for millions of dollars , the Saudi Gazette reported .
The paper said that trade in the sewing machines was brisk across the country .
Rumours about the sewing machines have been spreading for days by word of mouth and over the internet , it said .
These included rumours that foreign experts and companies had been buying up Singers .
In Dhulum , it was reported that people had broken into two tailors ' shops to steal the machines .
In the city of Madina , people were holding mobile phones up to the machines , due to the belief that they could be used to detect the presence of red mercury .
An interior ministry spokesman said authorities were trying to discover who had spread the rumours .
" We have to find out who started this hoax , " he told Reuters news agency .
" People hope to make profit , " he added .
" This is no different to cases of citizens who put their money in untrustworthy schemes . "
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : tar 0.3.0.0
All , I 'm pleased to announce a major new release of the tar package for handling " .tar " archive files .
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/tar
This release has a completely new and much improved API .
See the hackage page for the API documentation .
There are high level " all in one " functions for extracting or creating . tar files .
More interestingly , it is easy to make variants by composing a pipeline .
For example extracting a " .tar.gz " file is just : > Tar.unpack dir .
Tar.read .
GZip.decompress =<< BS.readFile tar
Or creating a " .tar. bz2 " file : > BS.write
File tar .
BZip.compress .
Tar.write =<< Tar.pack base dir
In addition it provides a full api for inspecting and constructing tar files without having to pack or unpack to local files .
The functions are lazy which allows large archives to be processed in constant space .
It is based on the tar handling code that has been in use in the cabal - install program for the last year or so .
It has been tested on a large number of real world . tar. gz files so compatibility should be pretty good .
There is also an ' htar ' tool which is essentially a demo program for the tar library .
It implements the common subset of the command line interface of the standard tar program , including gzip and bzip compression .
Thanks to Christian Maeder for feedback on pre-release versions .

If you read websites about food , NYC or general wackiness , there 's a good chance you 've recently run into Scanwiches — a Tumblr with nothing but flatbed scans of bisected deliciousness .
Here 's the story behind the site .
Advertisement
I love Scanwiches .
It 's a fantastic concept , aesthetically beautiful , and its creator and I both share similar tastes , like the ridiculously good Vietnamese meatball sandwich at Banh Mi So No. 1 that 's just a few blocks away from Gizmodo HQ .
It 's not every day you see your favorite sandwich baring all on the web as you eat it .
The site is the brainchild of Jon Chonko , an NYC designer at thehappycorp global .
Once I got in touch with him via Tumblr , I had to know more about the how , what and why of this excellent work .
Advertisement
Q : When did the idea for Scanwiches strike , and what was your inspiration ?
A : I think the word popped into my head first and then I had to see how it would actually look .
I 've always loved scanning things .
It 's a very specific way of capturing an image .
Everything — exposure , depth of field — is totally pre-set on a scanner so you try and explore the stuff you do have control with .
Once the project started getting popular people began sending me things , especially foods , that people have scanned .
There 's a guy who does fast food , another person who did a project scanning green market produce , and several artists who do scanned flowers .
It 's a weird little genre I did n't now existed and was pleased to find I was a part of .
Advertisement
Q : What kind of scanner do you use ?
A : I use my girlfriend 's old scanner .
It has a broken lid and she did n't want it .
It 's an HP scanjet 4570c and it was made in 2002 .
The thing is on its last legs .
It sounds like a subway train hitting the brakes every time it starts a scan .
I think it has a max optical resolution of 400 dpi but it's been a while since I read the manual .
Advertisement
Q : What is your process for scanning them ?
Do you just clean the glass really well after each one or put down some kind of transparent film for easy cleanup ?
Do much cleaning up in Photoshop or anything ?
Advertisement
A : I clean the glass at the end of each set with Windex and a paper towel but between sandwiches it just gets wiped down .
We started with a plastic film when we first scanned but we found that it fogged up when we did hot sandwiches .
Straight onto the glass gets the best quality .
This is a full time sandwich scanning machine — we have another really nice photo scanner for office use .
I take the image into Photoshop and do some white balance and color - correction but nothing dramatic .
The sandwiches have to look appealing and realistic .
I want people who see a sandwich on the site to recognize it if they 've ordered it .
It 's about education first and delight second .
Advertisement
Q : What 's the sloppiest sandwich you 've scanned ?
A : Eggplant Parmesan from Parisi Bakery .
I had to wipe the thing down with a wet cloth afterwards .

Then , do the right thing : get yourself a sandwich .
It 's lunchtime !

To date , holographic storage has not been on a path to mainstream use .
The G.E. development , however , could be that pioneering step , according to analysts and experts .
The G.E. researchers have used a different approach than past efforts .
It relies on smaller , less complex holograms  a technique called microholographic storage .
Image Brian Lawrence leads G.E.s holographic storage program .
Credit ... Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times
A crucial challenge for the team , which has been working on this project since 2003 , has been to find the materials and techniques so that smaller holograms reflect enough light for their data patterns to be detected and retrieved .
The recent breakthrough by the team , working at the G.E. lab in Niskayuna , N.Y. , north of Albany , was a 200 - fold increase in the reflective power of their holograms , putting them at the bottom range of light reflections readable by current Blu-ray machines .
“ We ’re in the ballpark , ” said Brian Lawrence , the scientist who leads G.E. ’s holographic storage program .
“ We ’ve crossed the threshold so we ’re readable . ”
In G.E. ’s approach , the holograms are scattered across a disc in a way that is similar to the formats used in today ’s CDs , conventional DVDs and Blu-ray discs .
So a player that could read microholographic storage discs could also read CD , DVD and Blu-ray discs .
But holographic discs , with the technology G.E. has attained , could hold 500 gigabytes of data .
Blu-ray is available in 25 - gigabyte and 50 - gigabyte discs , and a standard DVD holds 5 gigabytes .
“ If this can really be done , then G.E. ’s work promises to be a huge advantage in commercializing holographic storage technology , ” said Bert Hesselink , a professor at Stanford and an expert in the field .
The G.E. team plans to present its research data and lab results at an optical data storage conference in Orlando next month .
i came on to ask why you knew what a condom tasted like but you answered my question .
i've never had it but now you 've piqued my interest and i'll buy some next time i'm out just for the hell of it .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Software maker Microsoft Corp. announced Thursday it will cut up to 5,000 jobs in the next year and a half , or 5.5 % of its global workforce , citing further deterioration of global economic conditions .
The company also posted lower fiscal second - quarter earnings that missed analysts ' forecasts .
Microsoft will slash 1,400 positions immediately , with the rest of the cuts coming by June 2010 .
The company also said it will freeze employees ' pay in 2009 .
Microsoft said it will save about $ 1.5 billion in operating expenses and $ 700 million in 2009 capital expenditure from the job cuts and pay freeze .
" Economic activity slowed beyond our expectations in the quarter , and we acted quickly to reduce our cost structure and mitigate its impact , " said Chris Liddell , Microsoft 's chief financial officer , on a conference call .
" We are planning for economic uncertainty to continue through the remainder of the fiscal year , almost certainly leading to lower revenue and earnings for the second half relative to the previous year . "
Thursday's was the first mass job cut announcement in Microsoft 's 34 - year history .
Prior to the cuts , Microsoft had been hiring rapidly , growing its global workforce by 14 % since September 2007 .
But even as it cuts staff , the company said it will continue to hire a few thousand employees in the current quarter , mainly in its online advertising division .
Many analysts on the conference call questioned whether Microsoft was cutting enough , given the strong headwinds it is facing in a tough economic environment .
Some believe that more cuts could be on the way , as the company takes a slow approach to evaluate its capital situation .
" Obviously , no one has any real visibility as to how things are going to go , " said Brent Williams , analyst at The Benchmark Co . " But if they cut too much , too fast , it 's going to hurt them . "
Shares of the company fell more than 9 % in midday on the news .
Earnings disappoint
Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) also announced second - quarter net income of $ 4.17 billion , down 11 % from a year earlier .
The company reported earnings per share of 47 cents , missing analysts ' estimates of 49 cents , according to a consensus compiled by Briefing.com
The Redmond , Wash .- based company reported revenue of $ 16.63 billion for the quarter , up 2 % from $ 16.37 billion a year earlier .
The software maker said software sales , including its Vista operating system , slumped 8 % on weak PC sales as well as a continued shift toward lower - priced laptop computers .
Microsoft 's Online Services division , which includes the online portal MSN and its online advertising sales , continued to lose money - $ 471 million in the quarter - even as that sector 's sales were up 7 % from the same quarter a year earlier .
Microsoft continued to struggle to compete with rivals Google and Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) in the online advertising business .
But sales grew in other areas .
Revenue from its entertainment and devices division , which includes the Xbox 360 , rose 3 % over the same period a year earlier .
Microsoft said holiday
Xbox sales were strong , selling a record 6 million game consoles in the quarter .
The company also performed well in its server unit , with revenue growing 15 % in that sector .
Still , some analysts question Microsoft 's strategy of participating in seemingly every aspect of the tech market .
" In the short term , it 's all about PC unit demand , but once they surmount that problem , they go back to their longer - term strategic issues : they can't match the speed , economics , or the quality and reliability of their competitors , " said Williams .
" They may ultimately suffer a fate worse than death - big , but irrelevant . "
Weak sales likely to continue
Microsoft did not offer specific earnings and revenue guidance for the coming quarter " due to the volatility of market conditions going forward , " but it said consumer , business and advertising sales will likely continue to decline for at least the next six months .
The company said Xbox sales will probably decline at least through June as well , as consumer confidence and spending wanes .
Microsoft also suggested that investors should not rely on previous fiscal 2009 estimates .
" The economy is resetting to a lower level of consumer spending due to reduced leverage in the economy , " said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on the conference call .
" Consumers have less money to buy discretionary second and third PCs . "
Microsoft 's announcement comes a day after rival Apple Inc. ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) reported net income rose 2 % in the most recent quarter , trouncing analysts ' expectations .
Ballmer noted that Apple 's Macintosh computer sales were strong in the quarter , but he predicted that trend may drop off soon .
" The price premiums that people pay for Macs versus PCs will be looked at much more critically in the next two quarters , " said Ballmer .
" Neither the consumer nor business side is immune to the economic conditions . "
Though Ballmer called the current economic dislocation " unprecedented , " he called the recent downturn in the tech sector " just a pause . "
" Nothing will stop the forward march of our industry or Microsoft , " Ballmer said .
" There will soon be renewed growth in the tech industry and certainly in Microsoft . "
Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) is set to release its quarterly financial report after the market 's close Thursday .
Call him a reluctant entrepreneur .
[ Jay Freeman ] ( http://www.saurik.com)stays plenty busy with his graduate studies in computer science at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
In his spare time he 's worked on applications for the iPhone , but now he 's competing against Apple itself .
As I [ wrote about ] (/mobility/article.php/3809191/Rival+iPhone+App+Store+Apples+Very+Stubborn.htm ) last Friday , Freeman launched The Cydia Store , an alternative to the App Store , out of frustration with Apple 's policies .
He could n't get his own Cycorder video recording application approved by Apple which has blocked other iPhone apps it says duplicates functions Apple already provides .
Cycorder does n't currently compete with any Apple program for the iPhone , though the company is expected to release video recording capability for the device at some point .
To put this all in perspective , Apple 's restrictions come at a time of unprecedented growth in iPhone software .
The iPhone App Store has reportedly passed 25,000 applications , which gives it more applications available for download than for the venerable Windows Mobile ( at about 20,000 apps ) , a platform that 's many years older .
Clearly thousands of developers are happy to live under the friendly dictatorship of Sir Steve , but not Jay Freeman .
" Apple drives a lot of developers insane , " he told me .
" It 's not just Apple saying no , sometimes they effectively mothball some program .
I 've heard stories of companies waiting two to three months with no word from Apple either way .
Freeman 's alternative is Cydia , an App Store for [ jail broken iPhones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailbreak_(iPhone)).
He plans to charge developers no more than the thirty percent commission Apple charges developers for distribution and payment processing , perhaps less .
But Apple says users who jail break their iPhone void their warranty .
There 's also a chance Apple could harm Cydia 's usefulness -- or usability period -- in future iPhone software updates .
** Going beyond the App Store * *
But Freeman is undeterred .
He plans to take Cydia a step beyond the App Store with a social media twist by offering users a way to see what applications friends are using and a rating system .
" The ratings and comments will be tied to Facebook Connect so you can see profile pictures and things like that . "
As for Apple , he said he hopes they see his effort as something that helps the iPhone , but admits , " I 'm not holding my breath . "
" They lock people like me out with interesting products and that 's what forced this alternative market , " said Freeman .
( CNN ) --
There was a time when airline travel was a special treat , the kind of occasion that inspired passengers to dress up .
Hordes of travelers pass through airport security en route to their flights .
Now , the awe people once felt about flying through the clouds is tempered by additional fees , cramped seats and horrifying tales of fellow travelers .
Take , for instance , " Mr. Poopy Pants " -- a grown man who allegedly soiled himself 10 minutes into a flight from Florida to Minnesota .
And then he just sat there .
" We 've all had our flying hell experiences , " said Gregg Rottler , creator of FlightsFromHell.com .
The site provides a venue for people to share their tales of woe , said Rottler .
" It 's therapeutic ... so it benefits them and provides entertainment value for others . "
Rottler , a 54 - year - old environmental health supervisor in Tampa , Florida , launched the site more than two years ago .
Since then , FlightsFromHell.com has attracted submissions from passengers and flight attendants that have run the gamut , touching on categories that include " odors , " " attendant issues , " " weird people , " and " luggage and delays . "
Among the story headlines : " Titanic toddler creates tumult , " " Wifey punched by elderly ' sleepwalker , ' " and " Lip - locked tousle - haired 20 - somethings . "
" There 's something about being scrunched up with strangers ...
The seats are n't that big , and once someone starts going wacko , it just creates an extremely stressful environment that was already stressful enough , " Rottler said .
TripAdvisor , the world 's largest online travel community , recently released survey results from more than 1,500 U.S. respondents asked to discuss what about flying bugs them most .
The purpose was to " allow travelers to air their grievances , " TripAdvisor spokesman Brooke Ferencsik said .
Sure enough , he continued , " 83 percent of respondents said air travelers have gotten ruder over the past 10 years " and the most annoying travelers , earning 59 percent of votes , were " oblivious parents . "
Flyers griped about fellow passengers snoring , vomiting and having " excessive flatulence . "
But it was n't just crying babies , heavy perfume and strangers dozing off and drooling on their shoulders that people complained about .
Add - on fees were also a concern .
These charges often hit when booking tickets , making particular seat selections and checking bags .
Bringing a pet on board or getting food , blankets and pillows can also add fees .
But 54 percent agreed on this :
No airline fee is more annoying than the one to check luggage .
The trend of ratcheting up fees began in late spring of 2008 , explained Anne Banas , executive editor of SmarterTravel.com , an online consumer travel publication .
" Everyday it seemed a new fee came out , " she said .
" The consumer sees it as nickel and diming . "
While some add - on charges have fallen by the wayside , such as U.S. Airways ill - fated decision to charge $ 2 for water , juice and soda , Banas believes other more universally instituted fees that are of great help to struggling airlines , including the ones for checked bags , are likely here to stay .
" Baggage fees get people the most upset because it 's the one that 's hardest to avoid , " she said .
" People get upset when there was a status quo and something gets taken away . "
To help frustrated travelers , who become even more aggravated because the fees vary by airline , Smarter Travel created a guide to airline fees .
TripAdvisor , which collaborates with SmarterTravel ( both are owned by Expedia ) , also instituted a fees estimator , which allows people to figure out what flights will really cost , removing the element of surprise .
When the company set out to do its survey , Ferencsik said , " We were curious to find out how much people were frustrated , " by fees , such as the one for checked baggage .
" Does it surprise them ?
And what are they doing to avoid it ? "
The fact that 19 percent of respondents said they do n't check bags anymore , and 39 percent said they try their best to avoid it , was proof that they 're " modifying the way they travel . "
But while they 'll bend to deal with change , there are some talked - about fees that may be deal - breakers .
Seventy - five percent of those surveyed said they 'd draw the line if they were ever charged by an airline to use toilets .
Does that mean " Mr. Poopy Pants " will have company ?
" I hope they would just choose a different airline , " Ferencsik said .

Do n't look down :
The incredible daredevil who balances on the edge of 1,000 ft cliffs
It 's the ultimate balancing act - travelling upside - down on a bicycle 1,000 metres above an icy Norwegian fjord , with just a weight dangling below him for stability .
This is the latest jaw - dropping trick from extreme artist Eskil Ronningsbakken , who enjoys nothing more than precariously perching on the edge of a clifftop or walking on a tightrope between two hot - air balloons .
The 29 - year - old with a head for heights describes himself as an ' educated balancing performer ' , and has been honing his death - defying skills since the age of five , with circus troupes around the globe .
Naked save for a skin- coloured thong , Eskil rides a bike - backwards and upside down - 1000 m over a Norwegian fjord .
Strong , cold winds added to the extreme nature of the stunt
Eskil says of his feats : ' What I do , is draw a picture with vulnerable human beings and their bodies , in the surrounding of mother earth . '
Seeing his balancing acts as expressions of art and not stunts , Norwegian Eskil has even bigger plans for the future .
He says : ' I dream of balancing on the top of the Burj in Dubai , the tallest building in the world . '
Eskil sees his balancing acts as expressions of art and not stunts , and is currently working with a group of 50 like - minded performers in Nairobi in Kenya .
No fjords there to criss - cross just ' intimate ' work balancing on chairs and bicycles .
' A stunt is something you see in movies , often done with mattresses safety lines or nets , ' says Eskil .
' What I do , is draw a picture with vulnerable human beings and their bodies , in the surrounding of mother earth .
' That 's the balance between life and death , and that is where life is .'
Regardless of his particular philosophy , Eskil has performed and produced feats of endurance that seem to be super - human .
In March of 2007 , he managed to balance on a single ice cube that measured 60 cm by 35 cm , supported on each end only by two ropes and suspended almost 1000ft above a glacier in a Norwegian national park .
In the same year in his home country , he positioned himself upside down and did a handstand on a trapeze bar placed under a hot air balloon .
' I have performed professionally for almost 14 years now , so it's hard to compare one piece to another , ' says Eskil about his antics .
' Biking upside down on a wire 1000 m above the Norwegian fjords in fresh biting wind still stays as one of the most exciting moments of life . '
Seeing an Indian yogi on television serenely balancing inspired the younger Eskil to devote his life to his precise art .
Again back in a skin - tight leotard and surrounded by mist , Eskil balances on a chair , on a pole , on a rock wedged between two cliff faces
' Living in the countryside of Norway was filled with inspiration , ' says Eskil about the trees and mountains of his homeland .
' My mother would be screaming at me to come down all the time , but my dad would be saying " Wait a minute , let me take a picture first ! "
' I know it sounds crazy , but you learn a lot from that kind of play you learn to respect the height and danger . '
Literally running away when he was 18 to join the circus , Eskil perfected his craft under the expert tutelage of Peter Jakob , a trainer with the Moscow State Circus .
Honing his natural talents over the past 11 years , Eskil has now reached a level of athletic excellence mixed with spiritual calm .
However , he is acutely aware of the risks he takes with his balancing .
In this stunt the daredevil performs a handstand over a dramatic drop bizarrely as part of a Norwegian TV campaign about risk - taking
He added : ' I feel fear , of course I do , we are humans and we have a natural sense of self - preservation .
' However , I must control that before I undertake any new project because that would lead to lethal mistakes .
' If I ever find myself totally fearless then that is when I will stop what I am doing . '
Next up on Eskil 's dream list of performance feats is the Burj hotel in Dubai which he feels will top his previous achievements .
' I would dream of balancing on the top of the Burj in Dubai , the tallest building in the world . '
Do n't look down : Eskil Ronningsbakken strikes a pose as he balances on a penny farthing ... on the edge of a 1,000 m cliff
U.S. EPA released a proposed finding today that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare , a move that is expected ultimately to trigger broad regulation of those heat - trapping industrial emissions .
EPA released the 133 - page proposed " endangerment finding " [ pdf ] in response to a 2007 Supreme Court decision that ordered the agency to reconsider whether greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act .
" This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations , " Administrator Lisa Jackson said in a statement .
" Fortunately , it follows President Obama 's call for a low carbon economy and strong leadership in Congress on clean energy and climate legislation .
This pollution problem has a solution – one that will create millions of green jobs and end our country 's dependence on foreign oil . "
The agency is also proposing to find that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles are contributing to this mix of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and are therefore contributing to the endangerment of public health and welfare .
The draft does not include any proposed regulations .
Environmentalists hailed the announcement as a victory for environmental protection , while industry groups expressed concern that the finding will spur an avalanche of costly regulations across the economy .
" The EPA decision is historic and a game - changer for climate policy that will have political and policy repercussions domestically and abroad , " said Joe Mendelson , global warming policy director at the National Wildlife Federation and a lead author on the original 1999 petition to EPA seeking regulations for greenhouse gases .
" This is the single largest step the federal government has taken to fight climate change . "
EPA under President George W. Bush dedicated 70 staffers and spent about $ 5.3 million on outside government contracts to prepare its response , but senior White House officials resisted finalizing any actions linked to the Supreme Court opinion and ultimately shoved the issue to the Obama administration .
The Bush administration opted to link greenhouse gases to threats to public welfare , avoiding the more challenging direct connection to public health , former EPA Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett told E&E last fall .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , praised the administration for making the finding but said legislative action would be the best way to tackle carbon regulations .
" The release of EPA 's proposed finding that global warming is a threat to public health and welfare is long overdue -- we have lost eight years in this fight , " Boxer said in a statement .
" The Clean Air Act provides EPA with an effective toolbox for cutting greenhouse gas emissions right now . "
" However , " Boxer added , " the best and most flexible way to deal with this serious problem is to enact a market based cap and trade system which will help us make the transition to clean energy and will bring us innovation and strong economic growth . "
Industry groups and Republicans have long expressed concern that the announcement would lead to broad , crippling regulations .
" Today 's action by the EPA is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs , raise energy prices for consumers and undermine America 's global competitiveness , " said Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee .
" It now appears EPA 's regulatory reach will find its way into schools , hospitals , assisted living facilities and just about any activity that meets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act . "
Charles Drevna , president of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association , said that while EPA 's announcement comes as no surprise , the agency failed to address the valid concerns raised by stakeholders and consumers .
" Should the Obama Administration choose to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act , it would constitute EPA 's single largest and potentially most complex assertion of authority over the U.S. economy and Americans ' lifestyles , " Drevna said in a statement .
" Such regulation would have an enormous impact on every facet of the economy , businesses large and small , as well as on the general population . "
EPA will accept public comment on the draft 60 days after publication in the Federal Register .
The agency is also planning to hold two public hearings on the matter next month .

I ’ve been wanting for a while to start a column called “ Sexy Retrofits , ” exploring the idea that the key to green building is overhauling existing buildings , not starting from scratch .
Despite what Larry Page might think .
It ’s not the most glamorous notion , but it is energy efficient , cost effective , and exciting .
I swear !
So consider this the first edition , because it does n’t get much sexier than this : the Empire State Building is going green .
In a news conference today , NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg will appear with Bill Clinton to give details of the $ 20 million retrofit , which will reportedly include replacing windows and giving tenants web - based systems for managing their energy usage .
It ’s part of an estimated $ 600 million renovation expected to take five years .
More details to come .

What is the best proof yet that Rush Limbaugh is the true voice of the modern , hilariously out - of - touch conservative movement ?
His tacky $ 44 million Palm Beach compound !
Limbaugh bought the big mansion there on in 1998 for a paltry $ 3.98 million , and picked up all the rest of those buildings bit by bit by the end of the decade .
( All this before Rush 's eight - year , $ 31 million contract in 2001 and eight year , $ 400 + million extension in 2008 ! )
His neighbors have never really cared for him , because they 're snooty elitists who look down on things like prescription drug abuse ( at least , public prescription drug abuse ) .
So — this post is our gift to Rush , and to Harry Reid , and to James Carville .
Rush and the Dems have stumbled into a mutually beneficial relationship : after years of hoping he'd go away if they ignored him , they now embrace his virulent babbling , and they especially appreciate his version of conservative ideology , which is " anything that gets Rush 's name out there . "
He feeds on the hatred and insults of people like , you know , us , so hey , look at how tacky his stupid houses are !
And while our previous policy was that the rotund broadcaster was totally irrelevant , now we 'll amend that : he 's relevent purely as a symbol of a Republican party that appeals only to aging white men .
" His positives for voters under 40 was 11 percent , " Carville recalled with a degree of amazement , alluding to a question about whether voters had a positive or negative view of the talk show host .
Paul Begala , a close friend of Carville , Greenberg and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , said they found Limbaugh 's overall ratings were even lower than the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's controversial former pastor , and William Ayers , the domestic terrorist and Chicago resident who Republicans sought to tie to Obama during the campaign .
So while Rush holds no sway over things like policy and even Republcian strategy , his worth as a symbol is , for the moment , incalculable .
He is Reverend Wright .
Or Barbra Streisand !
Or , most importantly , Jane Fonda , with the entire Republican party as John Kerry .
The Wright distractions did n't work on Obama because he was a charismatic candidate with a compelling pitch .
Jane Fonda had precisely nothing to do with John Kerry , but she stuck on him , because he was not a coherent and attractive response to the first Bush term .
As long as Republicans remain in the wilderness , Rush can feed off their misery .
He 's a secret liberal !
Let 's all help him build another wing on his hideous mansion !
( CNN ) --
When travel author Beth Whitman was in Vietnam , she witnessed a group of young American male travelers rough - housing in the streets outside of the Rex Hotel .
Americans traveling to sites around the world like the Blue Mosque in Istanbul should be respectful .
In their youthful , loud exuberance , they ended up ripping each other 's shirts as they horsed around .
" I thought to myself that those shirts probably cost maybe 20 , 30 , 40 dollars apiece , and here you are in a culture where the people may not be even making that much on a monthly basis .
" It 's that sort of thing , just not being aware how off - putting that can be to the local culture . "
Such behavior , while seemingly harmless , can help to cement the moniker of " the ugly American , " which came to refer to loud , rude and thoughtless behavior of U.S. citizens abroad .
The term came about as a result of the book " The Ugly American , " and more than 50 years after its publication , those from the United States continue to battle an image of arrogance and nationalism .
Written by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick , the novel chronicled American foreign policy and diplomacy failures in a fictitious developing nation .
In the book , the American ambassador to the country is portrayed as crude and inept .
That enduring legacy has not been easy to shake , and even the U.S. president knows the score .
During a recent trek to Turkey , President Obama said in his remarks at the Tophane Cultural Center in Istanbul that he knows the " stereotypes of the United States are out there . "
" Sometimes it suggests that America has become selfish and crass , or that we do n't care about the world beyond us , " he said .
" And I 'm here to tell you that that 's not the country that I know and it's not the country that I love . "
Whitman , the author of the " Wanderlust and Lipstick " guides and publisher of " Traveling with Kids , " often gives lectures and workshops -- many geared toward female travelers -- and speaks on the importance of Americans being stellar representatives of their homeland while abroad .
How to not be an ' ugly American '
There are some ways to not be considered an " ugly American ' " when traveling .
1 ) Research the area and its culture before you travel to your destination .
Read guidebooks to learn about the region .
2 ) Learn some basic words in the language of the region you are traveling to .
Do n't expect everyone to speak English .
3 ) Travel with a desire to experience the local cuisine .
Do n't expect to get a hamburger .
4 ) Do n't flash around money or expensive items like cell phones and cameras .
5 ) Try to really experience the culture .
You are less likely to offend if you understand .
-- Travel experts Chris Baker and Beth Whitman
" It 's about being respectful of the country and the culture , treating the people respectfully and not flashing around your money and your material possessions , " Whitman said .
" It 's up to every individual to be that ambassador and portray their country well . "
Author Ann Hulbert wrote a piece for The New York Times Magazine a few years ago about her desire not to be mistaken for an ugly American when her family traveled to Istanbul and the Turkish coast .
Hulbert took the step of vetoing one of her teenage son's T - shirts , worried that the message on it , " The Fighting Quakers .
Beat them ' til they reach consensus , " might be misunderstood in the Muslim country .
" I think that when you are a big and powerful country , it 's easy for the rest of the world to feel that you do n't deal with the kind of consideration and humility that other people do , " said Hulbert , who researches the areas she visits prior to her trips .

Christopher P. Baker , who is a Cuba travel expert and award - winning author of the best - selling guidebook " Moon Cuba , " said he has concerns about what will happen if and when travel restrictions are completely lifted from that country .
He recalled two years ago when he was reviewing one of Havana 's first five - star hotels that had just opened .
Standing in the lobby with one of the hotel 's executives , he witnessed a man , dripping wet from the pool and wrapped in a towel , emerge from the elevator .
The man walked through the bar , down the stairs and into the marble lobby just as the staff tried to intercept him , Baker said .
" I heard them say , ' We do n't allow guests in the lobby dressed this way , ' and the man said , ' Yeah , I know ' in this deep American brogue , " Baker said .
" Behavior like that is not necessarily common to Americans , but it 's the type of thing that can give Americans a bad name . "
Manners and lifestyle expert Thomas P. Farley runs the site What Manners Most and said Americans tend to be seen as free - spirited and not nearly as guarded as natives of some of the other countries -- as evidenced most recently by first lady Michelle Obama putting her arm around Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II .
" That 's something that maybe sent shivers up the spine of a lot Britons , but in the final analysis , people really looked at that as a nice gesture and something very American to do , " said Farley , who added that travelers should be as respectful in other countries as they would be if they were in someone else 's home .
The Obamas may actually be aiding in changing the perception themselves .
Travel writer Beth Whitman said the mere election of President Obama has helped to improve America 's reputation worldwide .
" It helped to change how we are viewed , but the real key is the behavior once a person arrives in a country , " Whitman said .
" Some of [ the ugly American perception ] will exist no matter who is in office , and that 's why everyone has to take responsibility for being the very best representative of their country that they can . "

He 'd heard the debates about the cost of alcohol abuse to the NHS , but only when novelist Chris Paling found himself on a ward with long - term alcoholics did he really grasp the prognosis
In the early hours of Sunday 11 January 2009 , after a sleepless and painful night , I am admitted to my local NHS hospital with suspected appendicitis .
It had come without warning and very soon things began to go wrong .
Day 2 , 9 am A young consultant anaesthetist arrives , squats beside my bed and shakes my hand .
" I 'll be looking after you , " he tells me .
" I 've talked to the surgical team and I agree an operation is necessary ...
Just one thing .
The last thing you might feel before we put you out is my hands round your throat .
You might feel as if you are being strangled . "
" ...OK . "
" This is to prevent the contents of your stomach rising up into your mouth .
But do n't worry . "
Afterwards , a consultant tells me it was n't appendicitis but diverticulitis .
Diverticula are small sacs that protrude from weak points in the colon like bulges in a bicycle tyre .
Occasionally they become infected and rupture .
" There was some infected colon , so we took out a section and stapled you back together , " the consultant says .
" Slightly more complicated than we anticipated , but you should be fine .
Any questions ? "
" Can I have something for the pain ? "
Night 2
I am put on a high - intensity ward I later learn is fondly called " Beirut " .
There are three nurses to six patients .
This is where the seriously ill and the immediate post - op patients reside .
Beirut is one of eight digestive diseases wards .
Perhaps a third of the residents are here because of liver problems caused by alcohol abuse .
I 've been watching the debate on TV about increasing the cost of alcohol as a way of combating alcoholism , and the £ 3bn the NHS spends a year treating drink - related illnesses .
Most of the alcoholics I encounter in hospital are happy to admit they spend £ 500 - £ 800 a month on booze .
These are not well - heeled , white - collar drinkers .
Many subsidise their drinking by benefits and thieving .
Food is low on their list of priorities .
Each ward holds six beds , three against each wall .
I am in the middle bed on the right - hand side .
In the bed closest to the door on the other side is a man I will call Alcoholic Alan .
His skin is yellow and his eyes are closed .
Next to him , and directly facing me , is a dying man .
The curtains around his bay are closed and throughout the night distraught relatives arrive to bid him farewell .
To my right is a cadaverous man , also in his 60s , who keeps taking off his gown and displaying his genitals to the nurses .
Long - term abuse of alcohol has rendered him infantile .
He rarely sleeps and spends all night calling out , " John Terry , John Terry , John Terry . "
The curtain on the bay to my left is half - closed , so I can't see my neighbour - another liver patient .
I can , however , see his white shins and purple feet .
A surgeon and nurse occasionally attend to him , using what looks like an electric razor on the skin .
The smell is appalling .
At a little after 4 am , the man opposite dies .
I hear the sudden outpouring of grief .
More relatives arrive .
The ward is flooded with the smell of conflicting perfumes .
The body is removed two hours later to the accompanying chant of " John Terry , John Terry , John Terry " .
Day 3
A nurse arrives with a large syringe of morphine .
The drug is connected directly to the cannula in my arm .
To trigger the syringe , I press a green switch .
Every hour a nurse arrives to check my " pain score " on a scale of one to 10 .
For most of the day I award it eight or nine , reserving full marks for some unimaginable future horror .
Night 3
It 's 3 am and Beirut is busy .
It 's a male - only ward , but because of space shortage a woman has just been wheeled in after an operation .
The smell of shit fills the room .
Several nurses attend to her .
She moans and screams in pain .
I can't sleep anyway - the hallucinations are getting worse .
I have not slept for three nights .
I feel sick .
My temperature is high and the morphine no longer seems to take the edge off the pain in my stomach .
I reach for my wound .
It feels wet .
I touch my fingers to my nose and smell bile .
To get away from the chaos in the ward , I take my fluid stand to the lavatory and tentatively raise my pyjama jacket .
Green bile is pouring down my stomach from the stapled wound .
It smells rank .
I vomit and pull the alarm cord .
A nurse arrives , gently tells me not to worry and instructs me to return to bed .
I vomit again .
The doctor arrives , instructs the nurse to send me for an x-ray and tells her to tube me .
" This will not be nice , " she warns , " but you must work with me and it will be easier .
OK , darling ? "
" OK . "
I feel a sharp tube entering my nose .
I swallow and feel the tube in my throat .
I retch .
Over the following four days , the contents of my ailing stomach drain into this bag .
My bowel , meanwhile , is taking a well - earned rest .
I learn the next day that the crisis was caused by an enterocutaneous fistula - an open channel between a tear in the colon at the site of the operation and the surface wound .
Nearly 800 ml drains from the wound on the first day .
The hope is that the fistula will slowly heal itself .
If it does n't , another operation will be necessary .
Day 5 Barrel Man arrives on the ward early in the evening .
His legs are white and spindly , but his belly is the size and shape of a beer barrel .
His belly button extends four or five inches from his stomach and is the width of a baby 's arm .
He was brought in because Meals On Wheels had alerted the police that his door had remained unanswered for two days .
The police broke in and immediately called an ambulance .
This elderly man is a former alcoholic , his liver is not functioning and his stomach now has many litres of liquid in it .
Barrel Man is immediately put on a drain .
Several clear bags of fluid are emptied from his stomach every couple of hours .
During the night , at around 2 am , we are awoken by the sound of a cry and a splash of liquid .
The room fills with the aroma of faeces .
A nurse dashes in , switches on the light and pulls Barrel Man 's curtain round , but not before we have glimpsed the pool of blood and faeces on the floor .
Two doctors arrive .
Barrel Man is wheeled down to the theatre .
We do n't expect to see him on the ward again .
With typical understatement , the following day the nurse reports his condition as " very poorly " .
Day 6
The wound is like a tiny , evil mouth in my stomach .
Occasionally it belches and fluid plops out and into the stoma bag , causing a burning sensation as the acid hits the skin .
Day 7
Because I have not eaten for a week and my weight has dropped by three - quarters of a stone , the nutritionist tells me I 'm to be fed intravenously .
I watch a white tube being fed into my vein until only an inch or so is visible just above my inner elbow joint .
I can now be attached to a bag that will provide me with much - needed nourishment .
Day ?
I have lost all track of time .
Days blur into nights .
I 'm convinced I have been here before and had a similar operation two years ago .
My wife assures me this is not the case .
I can't sleep because each time I close my eyes I fall into the same hellish dream .
I am walking along a corridor and I stumble .
I roll over , head over heels , faster and faster , hitting every jagged surface I pass .
The agony is immense .
Finally I hit a wall .
I am lying on my back .
I know I have just experienced my death .
I have not slept for three or four nights , but at last I have found a solution to this mental turmoil .
I will walk to the beach and swim out to sea .
I will not feel the cold because the morphine will prevent it .
The desire for the salt water against my skin is as fierce as a raging thirst .
I have no intention of drowning myself , but no plans beyond swimming out to the pier .
The night sister is at the desk with one of the nurses .
" Where are you going ? " she asks me .
" For some fresh air . "
" The nurse will come with you .
We 'd hate you to fall over .
And hurt yourself . "
Somehow the sister knows .
The nurse comes outside with me .
She tells me it 's freezing cold , but it seems warm to me .
I return to bed and watch Time Team on television until the small hours .
I am grateful when dawn breaks .
Day 18
Nearly two feet of snow have fallen during the night .
The transport systems of the city are paralysed - there are no buses , taxis or trains .
" It 's too cold to snow , " Detox Dave says , despite the evidence to the contrary .
" I blame global warming . "
He was admitted because of stomach ulcers .
While on the ward , he chose to be detoxed .
My wife arrives to visit me after walking for an hour and a half .
She has not missed a day .
Without her visits and the support of my son and daughter , this would be intolerable .
Many of the liver disease patients are unvisited .
Day 20
Most of the alcoholics on the ward are hardcore drinkers who see a hospital stay as a necessary but inconvenient interruption to their consumption .
Counselling is routinely offered .
Occasionally it is accepted .
Alcoholic Alan has not yet opened his eyes .
His hair has been razored to his skull , so he now looks like a Dickensian criminal on a poorhouse bed .
His partner , who is some kind of trained healthcare assistant , takes care of him : she changes the sheets , tries to feed him .
She dispenses the care with tender brutality , whispering poisonous comments to him as she attends to him .
She is wrecked from lack of sleep and fear .
I overhear her talking to a nurse : " He had three chances and he blew it .
This is his fourth time in here . "
" You 're coping with it very well . "
" Yeah , but I 'll be in a puddle at the end . "
Alan purrs like a cat .
The following morning Alan is gone .
He died in the night .
He was in his mid-30s .
Day 21
This being a digestive diseases ward , bowels and the operation thereof provide an endless source of discussion .
The term " a regular guy " takes on a whole new meaning in here .
When Barrel Man returned last night , his first request was for a commode .
When it was delivered , he was soon calling out to the nurse that he had provided her with " a lot of black stool " .
The nurse emerged from his curtained cubicle bearing the sample at arm 's length .
We present our stool samples to the nurses like proud schoolchildren .
They are always received with thanks .
Flatulence is considered a sign of improving health , therefore any fart is unleashed loudly across the ward , usually earning spontaneous congratulations and words of encouragement - which is fine , except , of course , when the practice continues during visiting times .
Day 22
Despite being discharged only 24 hours ago , Detox Dave is back to visit his friend , Baz .
He struts around the ward as if it was the scene of his greatest triumph .
When he leaves , I ask Baz how Dave is doing and Baz says he'd had a couple of cans of strong lager that afternoon , thus rendering his detox on the ward fruitless .
He 'll undoubtedly be back within a couple of months .
Meanwhile a new alcoholic has been delivered to Beirut ward .
His screams can be heard from some distance away .
Nurses emerge white - faced from his cubicle .
He continues screaming for a few hours , but falls silent around midnight .
Day 23 Barrel
Man tells me that , until recently , he lived with his mother .
Although he has not drunk anything for almost a year , he is now living with the effects of the 12 years during which he drank a bottle of gin a day .
They had hoped his liver would regenerate when he stopped drinking , but it 's too badly damaged .
It 's unlikely he will be offered a transplant because of his age and he has been told he 'll probably die within three months .
His mother is in a nursing home and he has yet to phone and give her the news .
He is never visited .
I watch him now across the aisle .
When his eyes are not closed in sleep , he stares out as though he is peering towards the horizon , looking towards his next destination .
Day 24 Startled Nigel came in badly bruised .
He is very well spoken , cadaverous , and has chosen to wear a nightshirt .
Nightshirts are rarely tied correctly at the back , and those who wear them tend to have their arses on display each time they leave their bed .
He has tumours on his bladder and is another former alcoholic .
He has just undergone a cystoscopy , in which a tube with a tiny scalpel on the end is inserted into his urethra .
Matt ( another long - term resident ) and I are discussing Pain Poker and Matt awards Startled Nigel the winning hand - the equivalent of four aces .
I 've learned a lot about pain since I came in here , and I now know I 've been lucky to have avoided it for much of my life .
I thought I knew what it was : the sharp , sickly agony of a football to the testicles , nagging toothache , a paper cut , a bad headache .
Always manageable , recognisable , easily dealt with .
But pain comes in many more colours and intensities .
The nurses here have a chart with a series of cartoon facial expressions denoting differing degrees of pain .
That way , when the agony is too intense for self - assessment , they can award it a score .
On the ward it 's easy to recognise which of the inmates is suffering .
They are the ones who lie silent but not asleep , breathing shallowly , hands often clasped over the centre of the pain , staring straight down the barrel .
Night 24 , 2.15 am
The ward is silent now .
Just the regular breathing of Barrel Man and the tinkle of pumps delivering liquids into veins breaking the silence .
Rain is being hurled at the window by a high westerly wind and I can see the traffic lights changing and changing - liquid green and amber and red spilling on to the wet road - while no cars wait .
I am afraid that I will remain in the arena of the unwell for ever .
The fear always returns at night .
I have been on clear fluids for two days now , to test the fistula , which seems to be healing , but I have had violent diarrhoea several times and I am worried .
At 3 am I take my concerns to the night sister at the front desk .
She 's used to my nocturnal wanderings and assures me that I am progressing well and that diarrhoea is perfectly normal .
She is busy but , as always , finds time to reassure me .
Day 25
The next morning 's ward round is brisk .
The consultant is not concerned about the diarrhoea either .
" We 'll put you on a light diet , OK ? "
A male nurse delivers two slices of toast , two pats of butter and a tiny pot of Marmite .
I contemplate it for a while , then I spread the butter and Marmite , and pause to allow the smell to permeate my nostrils .
Then I bite .
I feel the soft abrasion of the toast against my palate , the soft , comforting cloy of the butter coating my tongue .
I chew slowly .
Another bite .
Heaven .
I can manage only one slice and I await my bowel 's response to the first solids I have presented to it in 26 days .
Three days later I am released .
Day 32
After spending four days at home enjoying those things and people I 'd for so long taken for granted , I awake with a stabbing pain in my chest .
I expect it to pass .
It worsens .
I am glad I 'd reserved full marks on the pain score , because I could now award it .
This was a full 10 .
Via A&E , I return to the ninth floor for a series of tests that reveal I now have gallstones and an inflamed gallbladder .
In my new ward , inmates conform to the usual statistical breakdown .
Two of the five are liver patients , caused by alcoholism .
The man to my left has an angry purple rash on both legs which at the ankles is hard and black - the skin crumbling like coal .
He announces regularly that his testicles have swollen up to three times their normal size , he has n't had a shit in seven days and his stomach is giving him a great deal of pain .
Crohn 's disease is suspected .
He tells me he was drinking 13 bottles of sherry a day , spending £ 800 a month on booze .
When I ask why sherry , he says , " It 's a drinker 's drink " as if that is all the explanation necessary .
He is a compelling presence , his voice like that of a night - time DJ on an offshore jazz station .
He rarely stops talking , but often the conversation is directed towards an imaginary congregation .
Recent statements : " You know I love you all very much .
I 'm very fond of you . "
" Egypt is dying , Egypt is dead . "
" I am the Count of Monte Cristo . "
And my particular favourite from today , delivered when he was at the height of his pain : " Beelzebub has visited and taken me shopping . "
Facing the DJ is the other liver patient , Seasick Scott .
He is an alcoholic , and his skin and hair are so jaundiced they appear a yellow gold colour .
He has a tumour on his hip .
He spends much of the day calling for the overburdened nurses to make him cups of tea or asking them to wheel him outside so he can have a " ciggy " .
The tiny , Borrower - sized old man across the aisle is in great trouble .
He can't swallow .
His stomach is blocked .
He spends all day and night spitting black bile into a cardboard bowl .
The smell of it permeates the ward .
His slippers are tiny with Power Rangers ' logos on them .
Day 37
Five days later my bag is packed .
I am dressed and waiting for one last change of the wound dressing before I return home for the second time .
The ward is quiet and a consultant 's team are visiting Seasick Scott .
His curtains are closed .
I can't help overhear the conversation .
" ... So , whatever happens , the likelihood of us being able to cure this is fairly small .
We 'll have to discuss where you 're going to live ...
Scott ?
Let 's get the Macmillan nurses to come and see you and have a chat ...
Anything else ? "
" No .
Thank you . "
" I 'm sorry . "
The news of his impending death is the first thing Seasick Scott has thanked anybody for since I first encountered him .
A phlebotomist arrives and asks if she can take his blood .
He refuses on the grounds that he has been given bad news .
The curtains remain closed .
A moment later I hear him call : " Nurse !
Could I have a cuppa tea , please ? "
Sadly , there 's nobody around to answer .
Five minutes later a different consultant 's team arrives to see the Borrower .
The curtains are drawn around his bay .
The Borrower is told that they now have the results of his tests and it's not good news .
Like Seasick Scott , he has cancer and it is inoperable .
The Borrower does n't say anything .
The consultant says he is sorry but there is little they can do .
He leaves him with some literature .
When the curtains are pulled back , the tiny old man looks towards me and smiles .
" They gave me a book , " he says proudly , holding it up , and for some reason the sight of it breaks my heart .
Out I 'm out now , although I have to return when the wound has healed for an operation to remove my gallbladder .
I caught sight of the DJ and the Borrower when I went in for an outpatient 's visit .
The Borrower waved .
The DJ 's eyes were closed in pain .
Seasick Scott 's bed is empty .
In the press , the debate over alcohol continues and the chief medical officer is now pushing for a minimum price of 50 p per unit .
The prime minister is apparently against it , not wanting to penalise the great majority who drink " sensibly " .
Meanwhile , the news that heavy drinkers receive one in four liver transplants , an increase of 60 % in the past decade , has angered some .
Is alcoholism self - inflicted ?
Curable ?
Who can say ?
I doubt Detox Dave , the DJ , Barrel Man and Seasick Scott are aware of the recent arguments .
They have come too late for Alcoholic Alan .
For the regulars on the digestive diseases floor , alcoholism is a disease of the soul ; the arena of the unwell , a way station between this world and another place .

Just now on MSNBC , President Obama stated that he'd leave prosecutions of those who ordered torture up to the Attorney General .
He does n't want to politicize the matter , but does want to " learn lessons as we move forward . " ..
" We need to uphold our ideals even when they 're hard . "
UPDATE , per David Shuster :

I hope you 'll respect me in the morning .
This is one of the tougher decisions I 've had to make ...
There should be no prosecution of those who carried out the policy ...
Those who formulated more of a decision , that is up to Eric Holder to decide ... I do not want to prejudge .
" He 's kicking it over to the A.G. to take a closer look .

Mr Milburn is concerned about cancer in Africa A former health secretary has told the BBC that the problem of cancer in Africa is " like a steam train coming down the track " .
Alan Milburn has helped set up an organisation called AfrOx , which is trying to tackle the issue .
He compared the challenge of trying to get good cancer care in Africa to the fight in previous decades over access to HIV drugs .
He was speaking ahead of a conference focussing on cervical cancer .
African health ministers and doctors will join pharmaceutical companies and charities at Oxford University during the next two days to discuss the issue .
The delegates will issue a declaration at the end of the event , calling for global funds to help eradicate cervical cancer in developing countries .
By 2020 , it 's expected that 70 % of new cases of cancer will be in developing countries .
Cervical cancer is the most common cancer for African women .
But 32 of the 53 countries in Africa have no radiotherapy services , nor prevention or screening programmes .
There 's a steam train coming down the track , in terms of cancer incidence in Africa
Alan Milburn
Vaccine programmes have begun recently in the UK and the US to protect girls against HPV , the virus which causes about 70 % of cervical cancers , before they become sexually active .
A course of jabs costs up to £ 300 though - and many developing countries do n't have the infrastructure to deliver such a vaccination programme .
Mr Milburn told BBC
News : " The HPV vaccine is affordable in the US and the UK , but not in Africa .
Now does n't that ring a bell ?
" People used to say that HIV treatments were unaffordable .
But then the world acted and the pharmaceutical companies caved in to pressure , and eventually did the right thing .
" It took a decade to act though , and I do n't want that to happen when it comes to introducing the HPV vaccine to Africa .
" There 's a steam train coming down the track , in terms of cancer incidence in Africa .
We know the epidemic is happening and it's going to intensify .
" If you roll back 20 or 30 years to what we knew about HIV , people knew it was coming and would have terrible consequences .
" The purpose behind AfrOx is to galvanise the global community to stop the steam train and prevent as many cancer deaths as possible . "
Jade Goody Mr Milburn , who was health secretary between 1999 and 2003 , said a third of cancer deaths in Africa were preventable and another third were treatable .
He added : " And where we can't prevent or treat the cancer , we must at least provide modest forms of palliation - other than giving a paracetamol .
Unfortunately all too often that 's what you get as pain relief for cancer in an African country .
" That is n't good enough and we 've got to change it . "
Mr Milburn paid tribute to " the lasting legacy " of Jade Goody , who died last weekend from cervical cancer .
He said : " She sought to put cervical cancer under the spotlight .
" I hope we can take that message of hope and possibility into the continent where it 's most needed . "

Mr Burris swears that he offered nothing in return for the seat Democratic senators have endorsed Roland Burris , the man selected to fill Barack Obama 's vacant seat .
Senate leaders initially tried to block Mr Burris 's membership , because he was appointed by scandal - hit Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich .
Mr Burris said he was " humbled and honoured " to be Illinois ' next junior senator , after senate leaders relented .
Mr Blagojevich was arrested last month and charged with attempting to " sell " the vacant seat to the highest bidder .
He has defied calls to resign , and also calls to delay naming a new senator .
Under Illinois law , the state 's governor has sole responsibility to fill vacancies in the senate .
Barred entry
We have spoken to Mr Burris to let him know that he is now the Senator - designate from Illinois
Harry Reid and and Dick Durbin
Democratic senators
Q&A : The Blagojevich scandal Mr Burris was initially turned away from Congress when he attempted to attend the swearing - in last Tuesday .
Officials said he did not have the correct credentials because his appointment had not been signed off by the Illinois secretary of state .
But after discussions with Mr Burris , Senate majority leader Harry Reid and senior Illinois Senator Dick Durbin said he had provided fresh paperwork confirming his appointment .
" We have spoken to Mr Burris to let him know that he is now the Senator - designate from Illinois and as such , will be accorded all the rights and privileges of a Senator - elect , " the two Democrats said in a statement on Monday .
They added that they expected Mr Burris to be sworn in and formally seated later this week , barring objections from Republicans .
On Friday , the Illinois House of Representatives voted 114 - 1 to impeach Mr Blagojevich .
Illinois 's state Senate will now try Mr Blagojevich .
If found guilty , the governor will be forced out of office .
He was arrested in December and charged with three counts of soliciting bribes , and offering to distribute public funds in return for political favours and campaign contributions .

A Skeptical Woman ’s Science , Superstitions and Life Blog
The site has moved to Freethought blogs .
After two weeks of live broadcasted hearings on the Internet , the ' Spectrial ' is coming to an end .
This week both parties presented their closing statements to the court .
Time for us to weigh up developments so far and look forward to the verdict .
Yesterday the prosecutor called for jailtime , while the prosecution presented its closing statements .
Today the defense had its say and the trial officially ended .
The Pirate Bay trial started on February 16 with lots of press coverage , protesting pirates and people handing out free candy .
As the days went by , plenty of information was presented by both the prosecution and defense .
So which elements are most relevant , and which side is ahead in the polls ?
On day two of the trial the prosecutor announced that half of the charges against the four defendants had been dropped .
The prosecutor could n’t prove that the .torrent files that were submitted as evidence actually used The Pirate Bay ’s tracker , and he had to let go of all charges that accused the Pirate Bay folks of ‘ assisting copyright infringement ’ .
What remained is the claim that they were ‘ assisting in making copyright content available ’ .
Armed with several screenshots of web pages and torrents downloading films and music albums , the prosecution argued that this was indeed the case .
The torrent files hosted on The Pirate Bay allow people to download and share copyrighted material – period – they argued .
The crucial part here of course is whether the defendants actually ‘ assisted ’ in making any files available , this will eventually be up to the judge to decide .
The prosecution has shown that there are indeed torrent files hosted on The Pirate Bay , and that some of these indirectly link to copyrighted material .
However , whether the defendants are assisting in making copyright content available remains doubtful .
The defense has argued that they are not ‘ assisting ’ , and dragged a giant primate into court to prove it .
On the third day of the trial Carl Lundström ’s lawyer , Per E Samuelsson pointed out that the prosecution failed to prove that Lundström had been involved in any transfers of any copyrighted material .
This became known as the now famous King Kong defense .
“ The admins of The Pirate Bay do n’t initiate transfers .
It ’s the users that do and they are physically identifiable people .
They call themselves names like King Kong , ” Samuelsson told the court .
“ According to legal procedure , the accusations must be against an individual and there must be a close tie between the perpetrators of a crime and those who are assisting .
This tie has not been shown .
The prosecutor must show that Carl Lundström has personally interacted with the user King Kong , who may very well be found in the jungles of Cambodia , ” the lawyer added .
During the days that followed both sides tried to strengthen their case , but not much that was actually related to the ‘ assisting in making available ’ charges that are central to the case .
The prosecution brought in more screenshots and some actual torrent files as evidence , and tried to get a better grip on the Pirate Bay ’s anarchic ‘ management ’ structure .
The defense on the other hand , argued that there are many ways to share torrent files online .
By playing a video in court they showed that The Pirate Bay is just one of many torrent trackers , and a tiny part of the download chain .
One of the witnesses , Kristoffer Schollin from Gothenburg University , told the court that the Pirate Bay is an “ open database ” of . torrent files which he described as simply an advanced type of hyperlink .
In addition to detailing the charges , there was further debate on the damages claims from last week .
While music and movie industry insiders claimed that piracy was responsible for a large part of the decline in sales of their respective industries , media professor Wallis told the court that the file - sharing is actually beneficial to the entertainment industry .
It is now up to the judge to review all the information presented by both parties and decide whether the defendants are guilty of ‘ assisting in making copyright content available ’ .
If the decision was based purely on a big win via the media during the trial , there can be no question that The Pirate Bay won a decisive victory and proved to be even more popular than ever expected .
However , as it stands , it ’s difficult to find anyone – no matter where their preferences lie – who is willing to step out and say who they believe is going to prevail in the case overall .
What is pretty much certain is that this wo n’t end with the verdict that is due on April 17 .
No matter what the outcome it seems unthinkable that either side will accept a defeat .
An appeal seems almost inevitable .
Stay tuned .

Residents of Rosario became witnesses to further UFO activity on the evening of January 30 and the early morning hours of the 31st .
Initial eyewitness accounts describe lights seen at 23:30 hs . over the facilities of the Alto Rosario Shopping Center located between Av. del Valle and Blvd. Avellaneda .
Witnesses in the area described the object as having glowing white light and apparently suspended halfway above the center , engaging in a swinging motion and shooting off beams of light against the ground .
Local residents , who saw its maneuvers clearly from their balconies and the way it fired off the beams , saw the object as early as 23:30 .
A second object , yellow in color , was seen later on , moving slowly over the city .
The first object was seen again around 1:00 a.m. on January 31st .
The second object caused a commotion due to its low altitude , low enough to cause cars to stop moving .
Eyewitness accounts suggest that the traffic lights appeared frozen on “ red ” and cellphones employed to photograph or record the object were left with grey screens and drained batteries .
All accounts agree that the object was nothing known to the witnesses , exemplified by the recording released a few days ago by a young Rosario resident taken in 2007 , and which caused such public commotion .
Given the number of reports , the Vision Ovni team looked into the case , as it did with the recording from 2007 , and through one of its researchers , Elias Kolev , contacted several witnesses to establish parameters regarding what was observed .
This case opens the possibility of obtaining specific evidence , since according to those who saw the objects , there is relevant information such as the interference with the traffic lights .
In a conversation with expert Salvatore Carta , there is physical and mechanical action involved in the operation of these traffic control signals .
According to Kolev ’s initial consultations with the Dirección de Control de Transito ( traffic control office ) , when traffic lights are faced with a power shortage , they enter an “ intermittent ” ( blinking ) phase .
A specialist from this state agency will be interviewed on Monday to secure details on the specific operating mechanism of these devices .
Moreover , cellphones were left blank and drained of power .
This did not occur in all cases , only in some – a situation that requires specific study to ascertain these failures .
This case has acquired special importance for Visión Ovni and everything suggests the existence of elements of major investigative value in the region .
We hope to provide you with the results of this research .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
While the debate rages on over whether stocks have found a bottom I want to take a longer - term view .
A better question for investors might be , " Will the market be higher in a year or two than it is now ? "
Clearly , the stock market is not fundamentally cheap as we can argue just how bad earnings are going to be this year .
One projection values the Standard & Poor 's 500 today at a price - to - earnings ratio as high as 19 .
For a bear market , that is still rather expensive .
I am not talking about timing the market regardless of whether you think it has bottomed or that another big drop is coming .
I 'm talking about taking a long , hard look at investing , and what its goals really are .
This is not about not buy - and - hope investing .
That the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded last month at levels not seen since 1997 is testament to the folly of that strategy .
Rather , I am talking about finding opportunity when it seems that none exists .
While buying a share of General Motors GM , - 2.37 % for the price of a cup of Dunkin ' Donuts coffee ( notice I did n't say Starbucks ) seems very enticing , there are no guarantees it will pan out .
In technical analysis circles , we can say we are not in the javelin - catching business .
But what about the legions of stocks out there that have traded more or less flat since the crash - like declines of September ?
Even Apple AAPL , - 0.75 % falls into that category despite the fear surrounding its business and the potential loss of its visionary founder Steve Jobs to health issues .
I 'll leave the fundamental analysis to others but it seems to me that Apple is not going out of business .
Nobody can really say the same about many banks , automakers and retail stores .
Now , I am not specifically recommending buying Apple now or ever .
I just want to point out that unless the economy is going to fully implode , the idea that a long - term investment in stocks -- with proper risk controls in place , of course -- is not such a crazy idea .
So , where do I cash in my insured bank CDs to back up the truck at my favorite brokerage outlet ?
Not so fast .
Diving into the stock market right now is not a prudent long - term strategy either .
But taking a little risk capital and buying small amounts of whichever stocks you feel will survive the recession seems to be a decent plan .
The operative word is " small . "
Controlling risk is imperative in today 's environment and moving large sums back into stocks would be an implicit argument for a bottom .
I 'm not going there .
For me , sentiment is negative and fearful as I 've seen .
Analysts talk down the market and the economy and anyone even suggesting stocks now is skewered in message boards .
That likely will be my fate here .
But what if analysts ' earnings projections are too pessimistic ?
After all , they have no real visibility into the economy .
And even if earnings projections are right on the mark it seems that the bad news has already been factored in to stock prices .
Remember , the stock market started to fall weeks , if not months before everyone acknowledged that something was truly wrong in the economy .
It is not outrageous to expect them to firm up well before the last of the really rotten economic news hits the wires .

This composite color infrared image of the center of our Milky Way galaxy reveals a new population of massive stars and new details in complex structures in the hot ionized gas swirling around the central 300 light - years .
This sweeping panorama is the sharpest infrared picture ever made of the Galactic core .
It offers a nearby laboratory for how massive stars form and influence their environment in the often violent nuclear regions of other galaxies .
This view combines the sharp imaging of the Hubble Space Telescope 's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) with color imagery from a previous Spitzer Space Telescope survey done with its Infrared Astronomy Camera ( IRAC ) .
The Galactic core is obscured in visible light by intervening dust clouds , but infrared light penetrates the dust .
The spatial resolution of NICMOS corresponds to 0.025 light - years at the distance of the galactic core of 26,000 light - years .
Hubble reveals details in objects as small as 20 times the size of our own solar system .
The NICMOS images were taken between February 22 and June 5 , 2008 .
Commercial Launch
Listen to this article
When Adam , Orion , and I started Heroku two years ago , we had no idea how much new technology we would have to build to realize our vision of an instant platform for Ruby that just works .
Luckily , we were able to attract an amazing team to work on this problem with us , and the team has really shaped Heroku into the offering it is today .
We ’re currently by far the fastest and easiest deployment platform for Ruby , and we ’ve gotten great feedback on our provisionless hosting architecture .
We have over 25,000 apps running on the platform today , and many of our users have been asking for pricing and paid services for some time now .
So today we ’re pleased to announce that we are officially out of beta and available for commercial use .
Detailed pricing information is now available .
Dynos
As discussed previously , our system is built around a dyno grid that allows us to deploy your app just by pushing your code , and to scale it up and down instantly .
Your app runs inside this grid in any number of dynos .
The number of dynos you run directly affects the concurrency and therefore the performance of your app , so our pricing is based around this same concept .
The first dyno for an app is always free , and additional dynos will be billed at $ 0.05 per dyno - hour .
Play with the dyno slider on our pricing page to estimate your bill .
You can scale your dynos up and down instantly at any time via the web interface , our API , or our command - line gem .
Database
At the database layer , we have two categories of options .
We offer a shared database cluster in three storage sizes .
The smallest size is free , and you can upgrade / downgrade between options instantly at any time .
For more serious needs , we also offer three dedicated database plans , ranging from small to large in compute and storage levels .
These can also be changed at any time , but resizing requires a few moments of downtime .
Add-ons
We ’re also officially launching some add - on features .
Some of these features , like backups and more frequent cron tasks are paid features .
Others , like custom domains and SSL are free , but require you to enter your billing information as an abuse protection measure ( more info ) .
There is a lot more to come – you can get a preview by checking out the beta features in the add-ons section .
Free Service
It ’s important to us to continue to provide a free service tier , useful enough to get started with Heroku .
This is still available , and is the default for new apps with a single free dyno and free shared database .
This free tier is well suited for rapid - prototyping , staging , and testing purposes , as well as actually running lightweight apps .
Pricing and paid - features are being rolled out in phases across our user base .
It may take a few days for commercial service to be activated for all accounts .
The official press release is available here .
I guess when we said that we would release the trailer on the 18th we did n’t really elaborate in which part of the country we would be in at the time .
So here it is , our super early trailer for our third game which currently has no title .
Let ’s get some of the obvious questions out of the way first :
Release Date : See Trailer
Console :
No specifics yet
Price : No idea
Game Details : Coming Soon
That should cover the basics .
the game is in a very super early development stage right now .
We ’re fortunate enough to have some awesome programmers that can get us playable versions of our games very very very early on .
At any rate here we go , enjoy !
The Behemoth – Game # 3 Trailer from The Behemoth
Oh yeah one more thing .
We ’re officially on twitter now and we ’re obsessed with watching our follower count grow like some type of text based rpg .
So if you have n’t already check out our twitter page !

The three were trying to travel without passports or money Two German children - aged five and six - have been stopped by police from eloping to Africa to tie the knot in the sun , reports say .
The budding lovebirds , identified as Mika and Anna - Lena , packed bathing costumes , sunglasses and a lilo and headed for the airport .
They even had the presence of mind to invite along an official witness - Anna - Lena 's seven - year - old sister .
The three got as far as Hanover railway station before police intervened .
The young couple were " very much in love " and had decided to get married in Africa " where it is warm " , police spokesman Holger Jureczko told the AFP news agency .
Sun-seekers
The idea for the getaway wedding was born as the children 's families celebrated New Year 's eve together and Mika regaled the two girls with stories of a recent holiday to Italy .
They can still put their plan into action at a later date
Holger Jureczko
Hanover police spokesman
The following morning , as their parents slept , the intrepid trio walked 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) to the local tram station at Langenhagen , where they hopped aboard a tram for Hanover central station .
But the group aroused the suspicion of a guard as they waited for a train to the airport , and police were called in .
Officers persuaded the children they would not get far without tickets and money , but consoled them with a free tour of the police station , where they were shortly picked up by relieved parents .
Although any marriage plans have been put on hold for now , police did not altogether rule out the possibility of an African wedding .
" They can still put their plan into action at a later date , " AFP quoted the spokesman as saying .

Continuing its advertising campaign which seeks to promote generic PCs running Windows as more attractive than Macs , Microsoft 's latest spot plays up specifications over aesthetics as opposed to just suggesting that PCs are simply cheaper as the previous spot did .
However , it ends up making the opposite point instead .
Following Lauren , the latest ad introduces Giampaolo , who says he 's looking for portability , battery life , and power .
" I 'm technically savvy , " he says , " I know what I want .
I like a computer that allows me to customize . "
He 's shown shopping at Fry 's Electronics , where he picks up a unibody MacBook and says , " This is so sexy ! "
Giampaolo then explains why he can't buy it , saying , " Macs to me are all about aesthetics more than they are the computing power .
I do n't want to pay for the brand , I want to pay for the computer . "
Of course , it 's really Microsoft that 's paying for Giampaolo 's computer , and Steve Ballmer is not going to pick up the tab for a MacBook .
So instead , Giampaolo uses his $ 1500 budget to ultimately buy an HP Pavilion HDX 16t , which he says has everything he needs .
" That thing is gigantic "
On HP 's website , that model starts at $ 1000 .
At Fry's , the salesman in the ad points out its typical configuration of $ 1,100 , although HP's " recommended configuration " is $ 1400 , still within Giampaolo 's budget .
However , it 's an odd choice for somebody who wants portability , as the 16 " widescreen model he lugs out of Fry 's weighs over 7.3 pounds naked , almost twice as much as the " sexy " MacBook that 's " all about aesthetics . "
HP certainly is n't " all about aesthetics . "
The cheap plastic body of the HP Pavilion HDX 16t is 1.7 inches thick , nearly twice as bulky as the MacBook .
All that size surrounds a large 16 " screen with a miserably low density 1366x768 screen resolution .
Giampaolo could upgrade to the 1920x1080 option , but that would have bumped him over his artificial $ 1500 ad budget , even when applying a $ 200 instant rebate HP offers .
Battery life not so good
" What would have the best battery life , that could still accommodate my needs ? "
Giampaolo asked while shopping .
It sure was n't what he picked out .
HP rates its built - in battery for less than 3 hours , but reviewers gave it less than two .
That 's not very good at all for its category .
HP also offers a $ 150 expansion battery that hangs off the back of the already large system to give it twice the battery life .
The " sexy " MacBook is rated for 5 hours with a single battery .
" It 's a pretty strong contender "
In terms of power , Giampaolo 's third primary need , the " recommended configuration " of the HP Pavilion HDX 16t that he apparently purchased ships with a 2.13 GHz Core 2 Duo P7450 paired with 4GB of PC2- 5300 DDR2 RAM , which is a slower memory architecture than Apple was shipping in early 2006 MacBooks three years ago .
The latest MacBooks that Giampaolo feared were " all about aesthetics " pair a Core 2 Duo P7350 or P8600 with PC3 - 8500 DDR3 RAM , delivering a peak transfer rate that 's twice as fast as the HP machine Giampaolo selected .
So much for Macs being about " aesthetics more than they are the computing power , " or Giampaolo being " technically savvy . "
Hopefully , Giampaolo is at least technologically savvy enough to upgrade to the 64 - bit version of Windows Vista ( or downgrade to the 64 - bit version of Windows XP ) in order to actually take advantage of that 4GB of RAM , as the standard version of Windows can only actually use about 3GB of it , a technical problem he would n't face on the MacBook .
Given that only a fraction of the PC installed base runs a 64 - bit version of Windows ( Microsoft reported that less than 6 % of users hitting its software update servers were running 64 - bit Vista last June ) , there 's lots of " technically savvy " PC users with loads of installed RAM their computer can't even use .
And while Giampaolo can upgrade to even more RAM , he can't upgrade his new system to use the faster DDR3 RAM specification used in the MacBook .
That would make his system faster overall and allow it to take full advantage of the installed CPU 's 1066M
Hz front side bus , which HP chose to cripple by pairing it with a 533MHz memory architecture to save money and deliver a cheap system for people who do n't know what they 're really buying as they shop at Fry 's for good - sounding GB and MHz numbers rather than focusing on finding a computer that does the things they want it to do .
Giampaolo was distracted by marketing
Of course , with the scant money that he 's saving ( he could have bought the high end MacBook by matching Microsoft 's money with his own $ 100 ) , Giampaolo will now get to go shopping for software , where he can easily spend several hundred dollars just trying to match the features and usability of the free iLife and Mac OS X tools Apple bundles with the MacBook .
Giampaolo will also have to spend hours of his time installing and running antivirus and adware tools , and stay on the lookout for that Conficker computer worm that Microsoft is warning Windows PC users about on the front page of its corporate website .
IN 1933 , in the depths of the Depression , Irving Fisher , America 's most prominent economist , wrote a pamphlet on “ Stamp Scrip ” .
This was a type of alternative currency popular in America and elsewhere at the time that was periodically taxed with a stamp so that it would be spent , not hoarded .
Based on the theories of Silvio Gesell , a German “ quasi-economist ” , one such currency , the wära , was used to revitalise Schwanenkirchen , a Bavarian coalmining village , in 1931 .
“ No one who received wära wished to hold [ them ] , the workers , store - keepers , wholesalers and manufacturers all strove to get rid of them as quickly as possible , for any person who held [ them ] was obliged to pay the tax .
So wära kept on circulating , a large part of [ them ] returning to the coal mine , where [ they ] provided work , profits and better conditions for the entire community , ” Fisher wrote approvingly .
“ The miracle of Schwanenkirchen ” is a historical footnote , but as deflation fears increase , and interest rates fall close to zero , the allure of such currencies may resurface .
Though there are alternative currencies everywhere , Germany is particularly fond of Gesellian depreciating varieties .
Bavaria still boasts the biggest in the country , the chiemgauer .
Named after the region where it originated in 2003 , the chiemgauer can be used alongside the euro in more than 600 shops and firms in the area .
About 300,000 of them are said to be in circulation .
In the town of Traunstein , the chiemgauer can be spent on newspapers and food and some people are paid in it .
Spent it must be , because it loses value every quarter .
The notes have an expiry date after which they need to be renewed with a sticker costing 2 % of their value .
The quicker money is spent , the faster , in macroeconomic terms , its velocity .
Gesell argued that a higher velocity of money helps combat deflation .
Some of Gesell 's theories were rejected by Fisher .
But generations later , zero interest rates in slumping Japan led to renewed debate about a temporary tax on money to encourage spending .
Gerhard Rösl , professor of economics at the University of Applied Sciences in Regensburg , who wrote on alternative currencies in 2006 for the Bundesbank , says the overall stimulus from such schemes in times of deflation may be short - lived — because , though the velocity of money increases , its supply tends to shrink .
For now , the amounts in circulation are minuscule .
Most are a gesture of defiance against globalisation by encouraging local commerce rather than a rigorous economic experiment .
But there may be more converts if monetary policy eventually runs out of road .
Welcome to the first issue of Debugged !
MZ / PE magazine !
More than 3 years ago I conceived an idea of a Debugging Gazette but was swayed by a blogging wave .
Last year DumpAnalysis.org together with OpenTask iterative and incremental publisher announced 2009 as The Year of Debugging , 2010 as The Year of Dump Analysis and the magazine is the vital part of this initiative .
The goal of every issue is to be useful as much as possible and be on a desk of practicing engineers for as long as possible .
By engineers I mean software engineers in general , software technical support and escalation engineers , and software test engineers .
To achieve this goal every issue features useful tables and charts in full colour and back covers can be used as mini posters featuring tips on debugging .
The focus is on Windows debugging but not limited to if any information about other platforms is of sufficient generality .
Despite an economic downturn and recession we decided to go ahead and even increased the number of pages for the first issue .
This issue features 12 page WinDbg command supplement to pattern - driven memory dump analysis methodology , overview of Win32dd complete memory dumper and PowerDbg enhancements to debug ASP .

The " Ukelin " is the name of a bowed stringed instrument which combines the Hawaiian ukulele with the violin .
Ukelins were produced by American companies from the 1920's through 1970's , and often had Hawaiian - inspired names .
The ukelin may be played with the instrument held with one hand and bowed with the other , or it may be laid down and played with one bow in each hand , or strummed with one hand and bowed with the other .
The ukelin has 16 bowed strings plus 4 open chords for strumming .
It was the product of a surge in musical interests , and instrument inventors and manufacturers raced to outdo one another with cross - bred novelty / strange musical instruments .
9 ) . The Didgeridoo
The Didgeridoo is a long wooden instrument , used traditionally by the Aboriginal people of Northern Australia .
Known as the oldest wind instrument in the world , the origins may go back as far as 40,000 years .
Though only one " drone note " can be played with the didgeridoo , overtones and vocal sounds from the player give it a rich sound and countless textures .
The didgeridoo , while not necessarily a " weird instrument " , has such a unique sound that it makes the number 9 spot for unusual instruments .
8 ) . THE TSABOUNA
The Tsabouna is made of goatskin , which is inflated by blowing into the mouthpiece .
at the other end of the instrument is a flute which is played with the fingers .
It is similar to the Bagpipe with the exception that it does not have the drone pipes that give the bagpipe its unique sound .
It was invented by Greek shepherds some 2000 years ago .
7. ) HURDY GURDY
The hurdy - gurdy is a stringed instrument which is played in a fashion similar to the violin except the strings are rubbed by a rosined wheel instead of a bow .
The wheel is turned by the player 's right hand , while the left hand plays the tune on the keys .
Typically two strings , called the chanters or melody strings , run though the keybox and their vibrating length is shortened by the keys , or wedges , pressing against them .
Several drone strings are outside the keybox , and sound the same notes all the time .
A small movable bridge on one of the drones can be made to vibrate rhythmically by cranking the wheel harder , and this buzzing creates a rhythmic accompaniment to the tune
6. ) AEOLIAN WIND HARP
The Aeolian harp is a musical instrument played by the wind .
It originated in Ancient Greece , and was commonly used as a home decoration during the Renaissance period .
The aeolian harp was designed to be played by the wind and not human hands , thereby giving the music an eerie sound composed solely by the influence of nature .
The wind causes the Aeolian harp to vibrate and produce random harmonic sounds and notes .
These wind harps come in a myriad of shapes and sizes .
The unusual sound produce by the wind harp puts it at number 6 on our top 10 list of strange musical instruments .
5. ) GLASS " ARMONICA "
Number 5 on the list of unusual instruments is the The Glass Armonica .
Benjamin Franklin invented the Glass Armonica in 1761 somewhere between the lightning rod and bifocals .
The glass armonica , ( Armonia in Italian means harmony ) , was Ben Franklins favorite invention , and was also of interest to Mozart who wrote compositions specifically for the instrument .
The Armonica is played in a similar fashion to rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine glass .
The Armonica has a series of glass bowls on a rotating spindle , its tuning is achieved by the size selection of each bowl , the larger the bowl the deeper the pitch .
The player wets their fingers and by touching the spinning bowls creates music .
4. ) WAVE ORGAN
Wave organ .
At the eastern edge of the Golden Gate National Park resides the home of the San Francisco Wave Organ .
Another Sea Organ is located on the shores of Zadar , Croatia , and is the world ’s first musical pipe organ that is played by the sea .
Waves create random harmonic sounds by way of tubes of varying size located underneath the structures .
As the waves move in and out of these tubes the air likewise is pushed in and out of the tubes creating random sounds that are heard through openings on the surface / walkways of the structure .
Like The Aeolian Harp this instrument 's music is truly a composition created solely by nature .
Being somewhat like a massive panpipe , played by water instead of wind , the wave organ gets number 4 on the top ten weird instruments .
3. ) STALACPIPE ORGAN
The Great Stalacpipe Organ is considered by many to be one of the largest instruments and the oldest natural lithophone in the world .
It is located inside the Luray Caverns , in the Shenandoah Valley .
The inventor Lelend Sprinkle discovered that stalactites inside the caverns produced melodic sounds when struck by a mallet .
He then constructed a keyboard console and wired a mallet to each stalactite within a 3.5 acre cavern space .
The sounds gathered from the stalactites are then regulated by the stalacpipe organ and can be played by using a traditional keyboard .
This unusual instrument is number 3 on our top 10 list for 3 reasons ;
1 ) It 's a weird instrument , and 2 ) Somewhat actually thought of it , and 3 ) They built it .
2. ) THEREMIN
The Theremin is definitely one of the earliest electronic musical instruments , and the first to be played without any physical contact .
It was invented by Russian inventor Léon Theremin .
It is controlled by two metal antennae which sense the position of the player 's hands and control the sound output .
The pitch / frequency is controlled with one hand , and volume with the other .
The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker .
The theremin is number 2 on the top ten strange musical instruments list due to it's other - wordly sound , and because it is the first synthesizer ever .
( More on the Theremin here )
1. ) TESLA COILS
Number one on the top ten strange unusual musical instrument list is the Tesla coil .
Twin Solid State Musical Tesla coils playing Mario Bro's theme song at the 2007 Lightning on the Lawn Teslathon sponsored by DC Cox ( Resonance Research Corp ) in Baraboo WI .
The music that you hear is coming from the sparks that these two identical high power solid state Tesla coils are generating .
There are no speakers involved .
The Tesla coils stand 7 feet tall and are each capable of putting out over 12 foot of spark .
Not normally considered to be a musical instrument ,
The tesla coil , with some yankee ingenuity , is definitely the most unusual instrument .

You do n’t want to make the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors mad .
You really do n’t .
The supes have incredible power–they ’re both the legislative and executive branch of government for a county of more than 10 million people .
And there are only five of them .
Do the math .
Yep , those are districts of two million people each .
That ’s power that puts a mere congressman or state senator to shame .
An incumbent supe loses a seat about as often as Halley ’s Comet swings by the earth .
But oh , you state government .
You ’ve gone and done it .
You ’ve made the supes mad .
And now you ’re going to pay .
Well , more precisely , you ’re not going to get paid .
Maybe .
The county supes are so disgusted at the state government ’s fiscal mess — and the legislature and governor ’s delay in solving it — that they ’re threatening to withhold tax payments to the state .
It ’s only fair –the state is refusing to pay its bills , and the delays already have cost the county more than $ 100 million .
Is it legal for the county to withhold payments , you ask ?
No .
Is it practical ?
Probably not , since most taxes are collected by the state directly .
But property tax receipts go through the county .
Can they do it ?
Of course they can .
Who ’s going to stop them ?
The state of California ?
Ha !
What ’s Arnold gonna do–send the National Guard into the Hall of Administration ?
Supervisor Gloria Molina is promising “ our own Boston tea party . ”
Pardon me while I assemble my costume .
The state of California and its governing system is at risk of unraveling , right now .
Folks in Sacramento seem to be behaving as though they have time to work out a budget agreement .
The latest reason for delay is to see how much money California receives once the federal stimulus package is passed .
( State politicians do n’t want to take a tough budget vote and then learn the feds would have let them off the hook ) .
I ’m hearing talk about a resolution “ this spring . ”
Some elected officials seem to be waiting for intervention — by the courts , by the feds , by the bond holders .
We ca n’t afford to wait .
With the state unable to do what it ’s supposed to , all sorts of government agencies , cities and counties are going to do all sorts of strange things .
And here ’s one fearless prediction : in this climate , with the state refusing to pay bills and the largest county in the state threatening to withhold tax payments , look for a grass roots movement of citizens who refuse to pay any state or local taxes .
It ’s time for the state ’s leaders to stop talking and pass a budget plan .
Not tomorrow .
Not next week .
Today .
It does n’t have to be perfect .
It does n’t even have to be any good or make much sense .
But it has to happen .
Now .
POLICE uncovered a secret stash of uranium in country Victoria during a series of top - level drug raids yesterday .
They have no idea why a drug suspect would have hidden the material in a storage area near Bendigo .
Detectives from the Petra Taskforce and Ethical Standards Department , backed by the Special Operations Group carried out eight raids in Melbourne and country Victoria .
They allegedly found a working amphetamine lab in a house in Preston .
But they also found about 300 grams of uranium oxide in a Harcourt Storage property .
A team from the Department of Human Services wearing special protective gear was called in remove the uranium and take it to a safe facility .

Ron Paul is -- or was -- an ob - gyn doctor .
So he should know , right ?
And he says all this swine flu H2ON9 or whatever scary flu talk is , well , just that -- scare talk .
Just another facet of an ongoing plot by the federal government to frighten the public and assume more control over the lives of Americans .
In a regular video report to supporters ( see below ) , the 11 - term libertarian - like Texas Republican congressman says simply : " The government should n't be in the medical business . "
He describes a similar outbreak of swine flu back in 1976 when Democrat Joe Biden was already a senator but Barack Obama was just a teenager .
Paul says he was one of two votes against federal involvement in flu - fighting back then .
" There was a panic , " he recalls , " and they said it was going to sweep the nation and the government came up with some flu shots and the government was going to inoculate everybody and save the world from this disaster . "
According to Paul , one person died in the swine flu outbreak that year while more than 25 died as a result of bad reactions to the flu shots .
Which sounds like scary stuff to those of us sneezing into our bent arms and compulsively washing our hands this morning .
By late today word of mouth and exaggerated e-mails will have the number of those 1976 deaths up to 250 or worse .
Not to mention the secret highway being planned from Mexico across Texas to connect with Canada .
But that 's another conspiracy .
" Here we are once again , " Paul says , " swine flu coming up and everybody 's panicking .
It 's practically like we 've been attacked by nuclear weapons .
I mean , press conferences on the weekend !
And how did the Department of Homeland Security get into the medical business ? "
Paul , who 's even older than another unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate John McCain , paints the outbreak of panic over the outbreak of flu as another bid by the new Democratic administration to grow government unnecessarily .
He has more to say in the video below .
" The big question , " the shirt - sleeved Grandpa Paul lectures , " is , does bigger government always solve these problems ?
It usually makes them much worse . "
Which is , of course , a totally ridiculous assertion .
Look at how well the federal government handled the Hurricane Katrina aftermath .

STOCKHOLM , Sweden , Jan. 31 ( UPI ) --
A judge says four people who forced an armless man to beg in Swedish subways must serve prison sentences for human trafficking .
The Stockholm district court judge Friday handed a four - year sentence to the 24 - year - old leader of an alleged international gang for forcing an armless man from Ukraine to beg in the city 's Metro subway , keeping for himself every penny of what police estimate could have been as much $ 120,000 donated to the man , the Swedish Web site The Local reported .

The Web site said the defendant , along with a 28 - year - old woman who received a three - year sentence , were also deported from Sweden for 10 years .
Two other alleged gang members drew lesser sentences as accomplices .
Prosecutors said the group virtually imprisoned the armless man for two years , traveling around Europe and forcing him to beg .
The man testified he was told by his persecutors that if he did not obey they would harm his mother , The Local reported .
Bernard Goldberg , a conservative guest on Sean Hannity ’s show finally had enough of Hannity ’s Obama bashing while discussing Barack Obama ’s involvement with the Somali pirate incident .
“ If something bad happened here , and thank God it did n’t , but if something bad happened here , I ’ll guarantee you , I ’ll tell you who would be leading the crusade against him :
You .
And you may have been right , if something bad happened , you may have said this is because he ’s seen as soft and they took advantage of him .
You might have been right .
But it did n’t .
Look , Sean , the good guy is alive and well .
The bad guys are dead .
That ’s all good .
It happened on Barack Obama ’s watch .
He gets the credit . “

In 2002 , bearing her microscope on a microbe that lives in the gut of fish , Bonnie Bassler isolated an elusive molecule called AI - 2 , which showed not only that almost all bacteria can communicate — but that they do so all the time .
( Watch her 2009 TEDTalk ! )
The TED Blog interviewed Bassler over the phone to talk about this secret , social life of bacteria .
She told us why the chemical language evolved the way it did , what the applications of her research outside of medicine might be , and what the daily life of a scientist is like .
Here ’s a snippet :
The fantasy is , since an anti-quorum sensing drug wo n’t kill bacteria , it wo n’t select as readily for resistance .
Even if some bacterium is fortuitously resistant , it wo n’t get the growth advantage that comes when its siblings die as happens with resistance to a traditional antibiotic .
The hope is that an anti-quorum sensing therapeutic will have a long shelf - life , that is , it will take bacteria a long while to evolve ways around the anti-quorum sensing therapy .
That , in turn , gives scientists time to develop more new ways to combat harmful bacteria or to enhance good bacteria .
Read the full interview , after the jump >>
Interview with Bonnie Bassler ( 4/8/09 ) :
Talk about the implications of your work outside of the context of medicine .
Is this going to help us make better yogurt ?
We ’ve all been sick ; we ’re all afraid of infection .
I think the easiest application to help people understand what quorum sensing is and why it ’s important to study is to tell them that if we could make the bacteria either deaf or mute , we could create new antibiotics .
But , what many people generally do n’t know is that bacteria also do all these amazing , fantastic things .
In fact , we mostly do n’t get sick .
Most often , bacteria are keeping us well .
So , on the flipside of trying to make antagonists — molecules that suppress quorum sensing — my lab spends lots of time trying to make agonists , molecules that make bacteria talk better .
If we could beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live in us or on us that are keeping us healthy , it might be even better than developing an anti-quorum sensing molecule .
We want to manipulate these bacterial conversations both positively and negatively .
But we do n’t know yet if it ’s better to enhance the conversation for mutualists or to suppress it in the case of harmful bacteria .
There ’s a place for each of these technologies , and we ’re trying to get them both to work .
How exactly they ’re deployed will come later .
Would a drug that comes from this research technically be called an antibiotic ?
Current antibiotics work in only a few ways — they pop membranes , they prevent DNA replication — but the bottom line is , they either kill bacteria or they stop bacterial growth .
An anti-quorum sensing - type compound would simply prevent bacteria from counting one another .
In essence , the bacteria would “ think ” they were alone when they are actually in a group .
Alone , they do n’t initiate virulence cascades .
So , if the bacteria ca n’t count themselves and thus , ca n’t carry out these group virulence activities that are critical for enabling them to stay in the host , the immune system just gets rid of them .
Such a drug would not be an antibiotic .
It would simply give your immune system a little extra time to do what it ’s supposed to do : constant surveillance , and get rid of harmful invading microbes .
But I do n’t know what you ’d call it — it ’s a funny question .
Many scientists are investigating different bacterial traits that could be similarly exploited .
Behavior modification drugs ?
Maybe that ’s what I should call them .
Of the many molecules bacteria might have evolved to use for signaling , why these ?
We do n’t actually understand this yet , but we have some ideas .
First , these molecules are cheap and easy to make .
The molecules come from core , central metabolites .
They ’re made from leftover molecules that bacteria must produce in order to stay alive .
After putting a bell or whistle on these leftovers , they become signals .
For this reason , we do n’t think it costs the bacteria very much to evolve these signaling capabilities .
Second , we are also now beginning to understand that there is extra information encoded in the molecules in the form of their physical properties .
For example , the molecules used for intra-species communication are hydrophobic — they do n’t like water .
On the other hand , the molecule I showed on my slide — the one used for inter-species communication — is hydrophilic and loves water .
A hydrophobic molecule does n’t travel very far .
A hydrophilic molecule goes really far .
In this way , I think bacteria can use the blends of molecules to measure space .
There are also long - lived and short - lived signals .
I think the bacteria can use them to measure time .
These features are in addition to using the molecules to count numbers of other cells in the vicinity .
Does this process ever “ go to sleep , ” or are the bacteria just constantly chugging along , creating these signaling molecules ?
The bacteria are constantly producing the signal molecules .
As I mentioned , these molecules are not expensive to make .
The real energy in quorum sensing is n’t spent making the signaling molecules .
What really “ costs ” the bacteria something , is turning on and off hundreds of genes in a precise order , to switch from the “ alone ” program to the program related to collective behavior in response to the signal molecules .
Maybe then it would make sense then for bacteria to “ cheat . ”
That is , it might seem ideal for a bacterium to produce the signal molecule only , and let the neighboring cells turn on and off the hundreds of genes as a consequence .
But if there were cheaters , that is , members of the gang did n’t participate in the quorum sensing behaviors , there would be no benefit because it takes the whole group acting together to make quorum sensing behaviors successful .
Consistent with this notion , as far as we can tell , this kind of cheating does n’t happen .
Rather , we see that , if a particular bacterium initiates the quorum sensing - program , one of the first genes that gets turned on in response to the signal molecule is the gene responsible for making the signal molecule itself .
This “ positive feedback loop ” floods the environment with even more signal molecule and ensures that all the surrounding cells enter the program .
We think this feedback step acts as a sort of molecular police that imposes synchrony .
I would n’t say any of these ideas are obvious , but after hearing about them , they seem to make so much sense .
I spend half my time thinking , “ My God , I ca n’t believe they do this ! ” and then the other half thinking , “ Why did it take me so long to figure this out ?
Of course they do this ! ”
I agree , it ’s obvious in retrospect .
I often think , “ Why is it that my lab that ’s doing this ? ”
Bacteria have been intensively studied for 400 years .
How could this have been missed for nearly 390 of those years ?
I guess there was this sort of snobbery — among bacteriologists and among scientists in general — that because bacteria seemingly live this mundane primitive life , and they have so few genes , and are so tiny , that we could not imagine they possessed this level of complexity and sophistication .
But think about multicellularity on this Earth .
Every living thing originally came from bacteria .
So , who do you think made up the rules for how to perform collective behaviors ?
It had to be the bacteria .
Again , even after we knew about intra-species quorum sensing , when we discovered the cross -species signaling molecule , we were shocked .
But in retrospect , of course they have to signal across species !
It does n’t do bacteria any good to only count their siblings if there are all kinds of other species around .
It all makes total sense , right ?
But you ca n’t know that until you figure it out .
The bottom line is that we are always underestimating them .
Do you often have these sorts of “ Whoa ! ” moments ?
I remember the day we found the gene for the inter - species signaling molecule like it was yesterday .
We got the gene and we plugged it into a database .
And we immediately saw that this gene was in an amazing number of species of bacteria .
It was a huge moment of realization .
We had wondered for so long what this second molecule was for , and the database told us in an instant this must be about cross-species communication .
It ’s a manic - depressive life .
You run in here , you open your incubator , your experiment makes no sense , you think , “ I hate this job . ”
Then ten minutes later you think , “ Well , now , maybe I ’ll try this or I ’ll try that . ”
You do it because you know there will be an “ a - ha ! ” day .
Those a - ha !
days make it all worthwhile and they have to last you a long time .
One thing that is really good is that now there are 18 of us in this lab .
The people in my lab get to see people who ’ve come before them who are successful .
We see one another have the a -ha !
moment and you think you can figure something out too and that you ’re a -ha !
day will come .
Luckily , I get to be a part of all of the a - ha !
days that happen for the group .
Craig Venter has talked about a species of bacteria that creates gasoline .
Is this sort of industrial technology at all in your daily thinking , or on your road map ?
Yes .
There are very clear medical and industrial applications .
Let ’s talk about anti-quorum sensing molecules , for example .
Researchers want to embed them in the plastic wrap used to package foods to monitor for bacteria and keep food fresher longer .
They want to put anti-quorum sensing molecules in the plastic that catheters are made from so we do n’t get infections in hospitals .
They want to put them in paints so they can paint cooling towers in industrial plants and keep the towers from getting gunked up and made unusable .
They want to put them in toothpaste so you do n’t get the bacterial films on your teeth that give you cavities .
What if these quorum sensing - based technologies open another Pandora ’s Box ?
Oh , indeed they will — no question , the bacteria will figure a way around this new strategy .
When antibiotics first came out , nobody could have imagined we ’d have the resistance problem we face today .
We did n’t give bacteria credit for being able to change and adapt so fast .
Basically bacteria do evolution on a 20 - minute time scale .
It takes humans about 20 years to make an offspring ; but bacteria are dividing every 20 minutes , testing out new mutations for selective advantages .
When antibiotics became industrially produced following World War II , our quality of life and our longevity improved enormously .
No one thought bacteria were going to become resistant .
This is the problem with underestimating bacteria that I mentioned earlier .
People thought the bacterial problem was solved .
Researchers moved on to other important diseases : cancer and heart disease .
Antibiotics were put into tremendous use both for health and agriculture — and now we have this resistance problem .
Compounding the problem is that because we thought the bacterial problem was gone , little effort was placed on studying bacteria , learning resistance mechanisms , and developing new antibiotics .
So we ’re way behind in this game .
The fantasy is , since an anti-quorum sensing drug wo n’t kill bacteria , it wo n’t select as readily for resistance .
Even if some bacterium is fortuitously resistant , it wo n’t get the growth advantage that comes when its siblings die as happens with resistance to a traditional antibiotic .
The hope is that an anti-quorum sensing therapeutic will have a long shelf - life , that is , it will take bacteria a long while to evolve ways around the anti-quorum sensing therapy .
That , in turn , gives scientists time to develop more new ways to combat harmful bacteria or to enhance good bacteria .
Have you come to see the everyday world differently , working in this microscopic world all the time ?
I would say mostly no .
Just like you , I ca n’t see bacteria either .
So what ’s funny is that , in the lab most everything we work on looks like water or grains of sand in tubes and bottles .
It ’s in our heads that we make up pictures of what ’s going on in that invisible world inside those tubes and bottles .
What I do think I have is an appreciation for nature ’s complexity .
It ’s a really lucky life to be tuned into a world that ’s completely invisible to everyone else .

Microsoft 's security team plans to retire a much - abused feature in its Windows operating system that uses flash drives and other removable media to spread malware .
Beginning with Release Candidate 1 of Windows 7 , the operating system will no longer display AutoRun when most removable media is connected .
Up to now , the feature has automatically opened a window each time a drive is connected that presents a list of tasks the user can instruct Windows to carry out .
Malware purveyors have long manipulated the feature to display options that say things like " open folder to view files " but install malware when clicked instead .
" With these changes , if you insert a USB flash drive that has photos and has been infected by malware , you can be confident that the tasks displayed are all from software already on your computer , " Arik Cohen , a program manager on the Microsoft 's core user experience team writes here .
The changes eventually will be added to Vista and XP .
During the second half of 2008 , malware that abused AutoRun accounted for almost 18 percent of infections , the biggest single malware category , according to a Security Intelligence Report Microsoft released earlier this month .
Indeed , the AutoRun ruse is one of the secrets behind the rapid spread of the Conficker worm .
The move is definitely a step in the direction , but it 's by no means perfect .
A fair number of today 's flash drives , including those made by U3 , will continue to evoke an AutoRun popup window upon connecting to Windows .
That 's because Windows sees the devices as a CD or DVD drive and Microsoft will continue to display AutoRun when such optical drives are attached .
This is a hole big enough to drive a truck through , and you can be sure malware distributors will do just that .
Microsoft says the change is designed to find middle ground between security and usability of removable media .
Perhaps so , but it's worth remembering that Windows is the only operating system that has an AutoRun feature - and for good reason .
Even Macs - with the mantra " it just works " - have eschewed the added convenience of AutoRun .
So thanks and congratulations , Microsoft , but we 'll continue to disable AutoRun altogether .
Instructions are here . ®
On March 27 , 2009 6 MUSLIM men ( more coming ) were arrested for the sexual exploitation and rape of little / young girls .
- once again this despicable pedophile ring is located in Northern Britain .
As usual , the police were obsessively concerned with muslim neighborhood sensitivities & political correctness -
" A police spokesman said that it was important to maintain a low profile in order to keep the impact and disturbance caused to surrounding communities to a minimum .
He added : " Uniformed officers from the Safer Neighbourhood Teams will be issuing leaflets to residents following the raid to reassure them and explain some details of the operation . " see article below
Recall from August 2007 where mother 's had to beg police to intervene and stop the muslim men exploiting their young daughters :
" A hidden world in which Asian men “ groom ” young white girls for sex has been exposed with the jailing yesterday of two men for child - abuse offences .
Zulfqar Hussain , 46 , and Qaiser Naveed , 32 , from east Lancashire , were each jailed for five years and eight months after exploiting two girls aged under 16 by plying them with alcohol and drugs before having sex with them .
Parents have complained that in parts of the country with large Asian communities white girls as young as 12 are being targeted for sex by older Asian men yet the authorities are unwilling to act because of fears of being labelled racist .
... Although campaigners claim that hundreds of young girls are already being passed around men within the Asian community for sex , she said that attempts to raise the problem with community leaders had met with little success , with most of them being in a state of denial about it . "
LINK
Clearly Hussain and Naveed were and are the " tip of the iceberg " when it comes to predatory muslim men raping British little girls .
Interesting to note that a television documentary that exposed the huge numbers of Pakistani muslim men involved in this pedophilia ring was stopped - twice - from being televised - eventually it was shown .
Some surmise upcoming elections played a role in its initial cancellations .
Apparently the feckless British police and vote whoring politicians , as shown by their persistent refusal to publicly condemn & swiftly deal with such actions , are happy to continue to keep ( gangs of ) muslim pedophile 's exploitation and rape of young girls " hidden " .
The media are also consistently to blame as this current story - below - is allowed to remain ( hidden ) local news rather than national .
I addressed this national cover -up of muslim rapes in my recent blog British women pay high price for multiculturalism .
And , of course , the media hides the muslim identity of these despicable pedophiles .
Also note that it appears the internet was used - the link between child pornography and muslims / terrorists has already been established .
DAWN SWOOP SEX ARRESTS
I do n’t often ask for your help via this blog .
I feel it ’s kind of intrusive , and almost like I ’m being a pimp .
While the snazzy clothes of a pimp might offer me a funky new look , I ’m not sure what it would do for my ( perceived ) street cred .
So , no pimping .
However , there ’s something I ’d really like to ask of you .
A small favour that would mean a lot .
I ’m in the running to win a contest to choose the tagline for a new publication .
The Printed Blog is a pretty cool idea that takes blog posts and transfers them to print .
People can then pick up issues and read them like a normal newspaper .
It ’s a nice way to bring traditional and newer media together .
Anyhoo …
The prize for the winner of the contest is a Nintendo Wii .
What I ’ve decided is that if I win , I ’ll donate the Wii to my local Sick Children hospital in Toronto .
It ’s one of the largest and most respected hospitals worldwide for the care , treatment and research towards kids illnesses .
It helps kids locally , nationally and internationally .
Basically , it ’s an amazing place .
I ’d love to help make the lives of these kids a little more fun -filled , and this is where you can help .
If you could visit The Printed Blog ’s competition page and vote for my entry , that would be cool .
It ’s the one that says , “ Your Voice .
Our Voice .

Senior US Representatives Henry Waxman ( D - Calif ) and Ed Markey ( D - Mass ) today released draft cap - and - trade legislation that would reshape US energy and climate policy through drastic cuts in emissions in the next 20 years and significant increases in renewables by 2025 .
The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 ( ACES ) , intended to “ create jobs , help end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil , and combat global warming ” according to the official announcement of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce , centers around four titles :
A clean energy title that promotes renewable sources of energy , carbon capture and sequestration technologies , low - carbon fuels , clean electric vehicles , and the smart grid and electricity transmission ;
An energy efficiency title that increases energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy , including buildings , appliances , transportation , and industry ;
A global warming title that places limits on emissions of heat - trapping pollutants ; and
A transitioning title that protects U.S. consumers and industry and promotes green jobs during the transition to a clean energy economy .
The bill seeks emissions reductions greater than those proposed by the president : calling for a 20 percent cut in emissions from 2005 by 2020 instead of the 14 percent included in Obama ’s Feburary budget .
It also calls for utilities to produce one - quarter of US electricity from renewables sources by 2025 , and includes a federal low carbon fuel standard modeled on California legislation .
While the stated intent of the bill is “ to strengthen our economy by making America the world leader in new clean energy and energy efficiency technologies ” , it comes at a time when some US lawmakers have raised concerns about how such a cap - and - trade program would hurt an economy already in recession .
To address this concern , the legislation would award industry up to 2 billion tons of “ offsets ” once GHG restrictions are enacted .
Industry leaders are likewise concerned that emissions restrictions would gravely impact their competitiveness internationally .
For energy - intensive businesses who fear that costs imposed by climate - change laws will put them at a disadvantage with countries – like China – which appear unlikely to impose similar restrictions , the bill proposes “ rebates ” so that they can remain competitive .
While these and other measures contained in the 600 - page draft climate bill are likely to stimulate intense debate on the Hill , it is what the bill does not say that has seemed to cause the most initial controversy .
Namely , the bill does not include measures for distribution of pollution allowances , or state whether they would be auctioned or freely given to polluting industries .
Nevertheless , several Democratic lawmakers briefed on the bill yesterday remain hopeful the bill would pass .
Rep Bart Stupak commented “ I think there might be some angst , but they ’ll get there . ”
So , how well - liked do you think Rush Limbaugh is ?
Shane Murphy , who was kidnapped by the Somalian Pirates , is n't one of his fans :
Shane Murphy , the second - in - command aboard the American merchant ship seized by pirates , lashed out at Rush Limbaugh for the talk show host 's racial characterization in discussing the rescue of the ship 's captain by the Navy .
Murphy , who returned to his Seekonk , Mass. , home Friday , called Limbaugh a purveyor of " hate speech . "
In commenting on the rescue of Capt .
Richard Phillips by the Navy Seals who shot and killed the three Somali pirates who were holding him captive , Limbaugh generated controversy when he called the pirates " black teenagers . "
" There you have it , three teenagers shot on the high seas at the order of President Obama , " said Limbaugh according to a transcript of an April 14 broadcast on his Web site .
" Just imagine the hue and cry had a Republican president ordered the shooting of black teenagers on the high seas , " Limbaugh said .
Murphy said Limbaugh 's remarks were unacceptable .
" It feels great to be home , " Murphy said .
" With the exception of Rush Limbaugh who is trying to make this into a race issue .
It 's disgusting . "
" The president did the right thing .
It 's a war .
It 's about good versus evil .
And what you ( Limbaugh ) said is evil , that is hate speech .
I wo n't tolerate it , " Murphy said .

HA . Bloomberg is trying to apply FOIA to the Federal Reserve .
Well , to those of you who still believe that the Fed is part of the U.S. Government , pay close attention :
The Board of Governors contends that it ’s separate from its member banks , including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which runs the lending programs .
Most documents relevant to the Bloomberg suit are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which the Fed contends is n’t subject to FOIA law .
The Board of Governors has 231 pages of documents , which it is denying access to under an exemption under trade secrets .
Via : Bloomberg :
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors receives daily reports on loans to banks and securities firms , the institution said in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Bloomberg News .
The Fed refused yesterday to disclose the names of the borrowers and the loans , alleging that it would cast “ a stigma ” on recipients of more than $ 1.9 trillion of emergency credit from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
The bank provides “ select members and staff of the Board of Governors with daily and weekly reports ” on Primary Dealer Credit Facility borrowing , said Susan E. McLaughlin , a senior vice president in the markets group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a deposition for the Fed .
The documents “ include the names of the primary dealers that have borrowed from the PDCF , individual loan amounts , composition of securities pledged and rates for specific loans . ”
The Board of Governors contends that it ’s separate from its member banks , including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which runs the lending programs .
Most documents relevant to the Bloomberg suit are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which the Fed contends is n’t subject to FOIA law .
The Board of Governors has 231 pages of documents , which it is denying access to under an exemption under trade secrets .
“ I would assume that information would be shared by the Fed and the New York Fed , ” said U.S. Representative Scott Garrett , a New Jersey Republican .
“ At some point , the demand for transparency is paramount to any demand that they have for secrecy . ”
Bloomberg sued Nov. 7 under the U.S. Freedom of Information
Act requesting details about the terms of 11 Fed lending programs .
‘ Financial Crisis ’
The Bloomberg lawsuit said the collateral lists “ are central to understanding and assessing the government ’s response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression . ”
The Fed stepped into a rescue role that was the original purpose of the Treasury ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The central bank loans do n’t have the oversight safeguards that Congress imposed upon the TARP .
Total Fed lending exceeded $ 2 trillion for the first time Nov. 6 after rising by 138 percent , or $ 1.23 trillion , in the 12 weeks since Sept. 14 , when central bank governors relaxed collateral standards to accept securities that were n’t rated AAA .
Fed lending as of Feb. 25 was $ 1.92 billion .
Posted Collateral
Bloomberg News , a unit of New York - based Bloomberg LP , on May 21 asked the Fed to provide data on collateral posted from April 4 to May 20 .
The central bank said June 19 that it needed until July 3 to search documents and determine whether it would make them public .
Bloomberg did n’t receive a formal response that would let it file an appeal within the legal time limit .
On Oct. 25 , Bloomberg filed another request , expanding the range of when the collateral was posted .
It sued Nov. 7 .
In response to Bloomberg ’s request , the Fed said the U.S. is facing “ an unprecedented crisis ” in which “ loss in confidence in and between financial institutions can occur with lightning speed and devastating effects . ”
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would meet congressional demands for transparency in a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system .
The Freedom of Information Act obliges federal agencies to make government documents available to the press and public .
The Bloomberg lawsuit , filed in New York , does n’t seek money damages .
Bank Opposition
Banks oppose any release of information because that might signal weakness and spur short - selling or a run by depositors , the Fed argued in its response .
“ You could make everything a trade secret , ” said Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Arlington , Virginia - based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
The case is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 08 - CV-9595 , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .
Who watches the watchmen ?
Or , to translate Juvenal another way : who polices the police ?
The answer this week was a New York fund manager , of all unlikely superheroes , who provided the Guardian with key footage of the minutes leading up to the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London .
The man came forward because " it was clear the family were not getting any answers " .
If there is anything to feel optimistic about today , perhaps it is the hope that we are witnessing the flowering of an effective inverse surveillance society .
Inverse surveillance is a branch of sousveillance , the term coined by University of Toronto professor Steve Mann , and it emphasises " watchful vigilance from underneath " , by citizens , of those who survey and control them .
Not that turning our cameras on those who train theirs on us is without risk .
Indeed , one might judge it fairly miraculous that the man was not forcibly disarmed of his camera phone , given that it is now illegal to photograph police who may be engaged in activity connected to counterterrorism .
And as we know , everything from escorting Beyoncé to parking on a double yellow while you nip in to Greggs for an iced bun can now be justified with that blight of a modern excuse - " security reasons " .
Yet it will by now have dawned on even the most dimwitted Met officer that it is increasingly impossible for them to control the flow of information about their activities - to kettle it , if you will - no matter how big their army of press officers putting out misleading information in the immediate aftermath of any event may be .
Did the Met genuinely think they could prevent the emergence of a far more joined - up picture of Tomlinson 's passage through the City of London that afternoon , much as they thought they could suppress the details about Jean Charles de Menezes 's tragic final journey ?
If so , their naivety is staggering .
Yet it 's odd how often it has been the little ways in which the state attempts to keep tabs on our behaviour - tracking devices on wheelie bins and the like - that have most alienated those who previously bowed to authority .
Also captured on film and published yesterday was an amusingly British act of defiance - a pyjama - clad householder blocking dustmen into his road by standing in their path , after they had declined to empty his neighbour 's bin of five pebbles .
As Tomlinson 's death shows , though , it 's not all Victor Meldrew - meets - Passport - to - Pimlico larks .
Indeed it is something of a shame that certain elements of society have only recently woken up to the possibility that the police might not be the faultless , justice - dispensing force of establishment myth , and only because - in the cases of De Menezes and Tomlinson - they have seen it with their own eyes , or at least enough of it to provoke a suspicion that was hitherto absent .
The serially deferential dismissed the Blair Peach outcry as lefty agitating .
They did not make a point of seeing Injustice , the brilliant and desperately depressing 2001 documentary about deaths in police custody , of which at the time there had been 1,000 in the previous 30 years , without a single conviction .
But they are undeniably more cynical and inquisitive now , and it is interesting that for many previously deferential Brits , the Countryside Alliance march a year later , in 2002 , was such a watershed .
Here , peaceful marchers who considered themselves fine , upstanding members of law - abiding communities , were genuinely shocked and appalled at the manner in which they felt police treated them during the demonstration .
It is hard to say whether this sea change in the amount of trust people are willing to put in their alleged protectors will be reflected in the judgments of those with the power to call those protectors to account .
The De Menezes jury chose notably to believe the civilian witnesses who countered the police line and said that officers had not shouted " armed police " before they shot .
Then again , the Independent Police Complaints Commission had apparently failed to interview the police officer who attacked Tomlinson 48 hours after he had come forward , with anonymous
Met sources briefing that the man had not known it was him till he saw the footage , and collapsed upon realising it was .
It is up to you how you interpret that memory hole .
Maybe the attack was merely a forgettable instant in a trying afternoon .
Maybe he had seen so many lone men walking with their hands in their pockets truncheoned that day that his own crack of the baton did n't stick in the mind .
Either way , perhaps the IPCC should interview the officer no matter what sort of funk he is in .
After all , from what little we know of him , he would surely agree that there are no excuses for dawdling .
But we have no means of chivvying the IPCC along , alas - of giving them a metaphorical shove in the back , or a notional truncheoning .
So in the meantime , let 's note that a day which started out protesting about a very different them - and - us situation has reminded us that there is more than one attritional show in town .
And sometimes , New York fund managers are on our side .

' Bailout psychology ' destroying the economy BAILOUT PSYCHOLOGY
WASHINGTON - MARCH 30 : U.S. President Barack Obama ( R ) , with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , makes an announcement about the U.S auto industry at the White House March 30 , 2009 in Washington , DC .
Obama unveiled the details of his administration 's plan to deal with the auto industry crisis .

Obama ... more Photo : Mark Wilson , Getty Images Photo : Mark Wilson , Getty Images Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close ' Bailout psychology ' destroying the economy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
President Obama must stop the bailouts and start the prosecutions .
It 's time to focus on anti-poverty programs to protect the growing unemployed from hunger and homelessness .
Stealth payments to billionaire bondholders must cease immediately .
Since the mid-1970s , average Americans ' wages have stayed flat when adjusted for inflation .
Productivity rose , profits rose , but not wages .
To compensate for stagnant wages and the desire to consume more each year , Americans worked more , retired later , spouses went to work , and many burned savings .
Then they started borrowing .
Debt became America 's growth industry .
The scheme collapsed because Americans ' wages were n't sufficient to pay the interest on existing debts .
The only way out of this is to tighten our belts and pay down debt , the opposite of what our bank - owned government is advising .
The administration and the banks keep talking about a credit crisis , but there is n't one .
Banks are lending .
If you want a mortgage and can afford to pay it back , you can borrow at low rates today .
You can finance a car at low rates for seven years .
But most Americans do n't want more debt because it is a debilitating path to poverty .
The average American family already pays 14 percent of annual income in interest to banks .
To fix this fake crisis , there are fake discussions about what the government must do .
The endlessly recycled plan to buy " troubled " assets is n't to get banks lending again , because they have n't stopped lending .
The plan seeks for taxpayers to buy worthless assets at high prices to absorb rich investors ' losses .
That 's it .
It keeps coming back as a different plan , but with that same goal .
There is no goal beyond that one goal : keep rich people from taking losses .
Obama and his economic gurus all chant , " Credit is the lifeblood of the economy , " but they do n't mean credit .
They mean debt .
Imagine the president saying , " Debt is the lifeblood of our economy .
We desperately need to get more American families deeper in debt . "
That 's what he means , and that 's what these bailouts hope to do .
In a Sept. 14 article in this newspaper , I noted that banks push senators , with the blessing of the administration , to introduce bills that are bailouts , but disguised to appear not to be bailouts .
The goal is to accomplish the desired result without risking your bought - and - paid - for representative .
Imagine you bet $ 500,000 on a stock and it dropped to $ 20,000 .
If you owned Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , he'd get on TV and explain that if the government did n't buy your shares for $ 500,000 , the economy would suffer because you could n't invest anymore .
He 'd say the " free market " is n't pricing the stock " right , " and we have to " help " the market with taxpayer money to make sure you get the " right " price .
Bailout psychology is destroying the economy .
Banks hold off on foreclosures in the hope of refinancing borrowers into government - backed loans that will almost certainly default - at taxpayer expense .
I 've talked to ordinary people delinquent on credit cards who put off bankruptcy because they " heard " the president was unhappy with unfair bank practices and " help was coming soon . "
Millions of homeowners desperate to sell are keeping empty houses off the market waiting for a " rebound , " flushing a stream of income down the toilet .
Worsening economic figures are being used to confirm that more bailouts are needed rather than that previous ones might be failing .
The logic is much like medieval blood letting :
The patient died because we did n't drain enough of his blood .
The promise of more bailouts also keeps everyone from doing what 's necessary .
Millions of houses sit empty , open to vandalism and destruction , while millions of Americans live in cars or on the street .
Our tax money is given to banks and speculators to hold houses empty .
On March 20 , 2007 , I wrote here that a mortgage bailout was coming and would cost at least $ 1 trillion , yet not bail out homeowners .
As it turned out , the bailout did nothing to stop foreclosures from going through the roof .
On Feb. 8 , 2008 , I wrote here that Fannie and Freddie would be taken into receivership within a year - an event that occurred Sept.
7 . I argued here on Sept. 18 that most loan modifications were a fraud and " I optimistically predict that within 12 months half of these refinanced loans will result in default . "
On Dec. 8 , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that 53 percent of modified loans were in default .
To " fix " all these problems , the George W. Bush administration , and now the Obama administration , have chosen people ( or their accomplices ) who stole from the public .
That 's why no one has been prosecuted .
Would former Treasury Secretary and Goldman Sachs chief Henry Paulson have pressured for an investigation of Goldman Sachs ?
Right .
As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , current Treasury Secretary Geithner had a front - row seat during the run-up to the crisis and watched for years while pushing a " no regulation " policy .
Why ?
At that time his friends were winning their bets and making a lot of money .
Why did n't Bush or Obama pick Brooksley Born ( the Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair who tried to regulate credit default swaps ) or Harry Markopolos ( the whistle - blower in the Madoff scandal ) to serve as treasury secretary or chairman of the SEC ?
Because Born and Markopolos are technically competent and possess integrity .
Banks would tolerate neither quality in an administration official .
We have a crisis of confidence , because fraud permeates most of our banks and financial institutions .
The solution is law enforcement , not handouts .
On Jan. 31 , 2009 , Santa Barbara police held a 53 - year - old homeless man on $ 20,000 bail for shoplifting $ 7.69 worth of soup and bread .
Yet Bush did not move to prosecute a single executive at any of these banks , and Obama likewise does n't want to be " vengeful " by investigating the crimes of investment bankers .
If the government feels lenient , ca n't it let alone families campingin a vacant lot in Sacramento , or homeless people stealing bread ?
We can stop this by closing our accounts at any bank that took government money .
A list is on the Treasury 's Web site .
Close your accounts and move them .
If we do , those banks will suffer receivership or bankruptcy within a few months , and then there will be no need for bailouts .
Our healthy community banks will thrive , while billionaire bondholders will have to downsize their G - 5 fleets and take a haircut .
If you buy an American car , buy a Ford .
Do not buy GM or Chrysler .
GM and Chrysler took bailout money .
If everyone who would buy a GM or Chrysler bought a Ford , GM and Chrysler would quickly go bankrupt , the government would be forced to stop giving them tycoon welfare , and Ford would probably have enough customers to get through this .
If Ford takes bailout money , do n't buy a Ford , either .
You do n't need to buy anything .
Save your money until the government stops the bailouts .
Your children will thank you for the peace and security .
Growing up , as I more or less did , watching nothing but cartoons , I came to realize one glaring irritation : nearly every cartoon ‘ hero ’ had at least one sidekick .
Seriously , look at someone like Fred Flintstone : no matter how you slice him or try to shoehorn him into his own separate story , Barney Rubble was the jelly to Fred ’s peanut butter .
How about , say , DuckTales : Huey , Dewey , and Louie were Scrooge McDuck ’s sidekicks regardless of the fact that they carried most of the episodes .
Now , those two examples aside , many other major characters had decent tag - a - longs as well , but then there were those few whose buddies were about as irritating as a swimsuit full of burning sand .
Here are ten such samples .
10 .
Wheelie
Transformers the Animated Movie and beyond .
Wheelie was absolutely the most grating Transformer from the very moment he was introduced to Kup and Grimlock in the animated movie .
He spoke in a high - pitched , rhyming , robotic tone that the moronic Dinobot absolutely loved .
Oh sure , he had his useful moments and did n’t talk nearly as much as the second most obtrusive Autobot , Blurr ( voiced by Micro Machine great , John Mushida ) , and post film , Wheelie went on to befriend the human cast and genuinely rub everyone the wrong way for years .
9. Dorno
The Child from the Herculoids
It never failed .
Each and every episode not only featured an entirely different type of alien on the Herculoids jungle world , but also the bumbling doofus , Dorno , somehow managing to get himself into hot water from said aliens .
What really amazed me was that even with friends like Zok , Igoo , Tundro , Gloop , and Gleep , each sporting a talent that could easily keep the young lad protected , he still managed to get his dumb ass in dire straights .
8. Ogee
The Supposedly Innocent Little Girl on Magilla Gorilla
Speaking of high - pitched , sugary sweet sidekicks , Ogee was perhaps the most unassuming little pest around .
Much akin to the little baby mouse on Tom and Jerry who wandered around in a diaper , unawares as a catastrophe went on behind him , so went Ogee .
Once she managed to release Magilla from Mr. Peeble ’s store , the gorilla spent the remainder of the episode keeping the little shit out of trouble .
7. Jan , Jace , and Blip
The Reasons Space Ghost Even Had a Job
Forget Brak , never mind Zorak , no the real trouble makers that stuck in Space Ghost ’s craw were Jan and Jace and their ridiculous space monkey , Blip - possibly related to Gleek ( see entry in this list ) , no one really knows - always egging on the enemy .
Most of these bad guys were just motoring around outer space just sort of thinking about their past ass whippings from Space Ghost , when suddenly the kids and the primate would interfere with their bad guy plans and WHAM !
They ’d be captured .
And off Space Ghost would go , begrudgingly , after his useless sidekicks .
6. Jimmy Olsen
Pal and Side - Thorn to Superman
Back in the glory days of DC Comics , Superman was always either teaching a lesson to , or receiving some kind of warped power - draining butt - whoopin ’ from , his ‘ pal ’ , Jimmy Olsen .
Yes , a sort of sidekick , though not in the traditional sense as Supes could pretty much do anything and everything with his seemingly limitless powers , Jimmy hung around with The Man of Steel through many , many adventures getting each of them into all sorts of stupid troubles .
5. Gleek
The Worthless Space Monkey
Now , on this entry , I almost just went with the Wonder Twins themselves until I watched a few of these old episodes and it became apparent that they did , though in round - about ways , assist the Super Friends more often than not .
No , as it turned out , Gleek was frequently the source of much of the Twins ’ ( not to mention the Team ’s ) misery .
Just when they though danger was free and clear , Gleek would come along and do something exceptionally stupid .
Especially for an apparently hyper - intelligent simian .
4. Robin
The Boy ‘ Wonder ’
From the get go of DC ’s Detective Comics , Batman ’s faithful companion was more colossally irritating than any of his rogue ’s gallery .
Fast forward a bit to the campy TV show starring the brilliant Adam West and Burt Ward , and you end up with an even more over - the - top , clingy version of the second half of the Dynamic Duo , regardless of the fact that the show lived on cheese .
Then throw on some Super Friends and , well , you can easily see him getting even more ( if that was possible ) silly .
‘ Holy Quatro , Batman !
I ’m number 4 !’ Yep .
3. Snarf
What the Hell Was That Thing , Anyway ?
Though the Thundercats were a close - knit crew always willing to back one another up no matter the cause , only Lion - O was a real friend to the cat / monkey , Snarf .
Panthro , Cheetara , Tigra… well , they all just kind of put up with his whining , mewling , childish ass just so they would n’t piss off their leader .
Snarf was often captured , trapped , snared , or otherwise pointlessly involved in the Thundercat ’s battles , much to the team ’s chagrin .
Shit , even Lion - O got loud with his pussy ass .
Yes , read that sentence again .
2. Orko
A Wizard ?
Apparently .
There were only three people in the whole of Eternia who knew that Prince Adam was He - Man : Man-at - Arms ( makes sense ) , The Sorceress ( good idea ) , and frickin ORKO !
That ’s right ; the floating , witch - hatted robe who could almost do a little bit of worthless magic but mostly just hovered around talking like he was huffing Helium , also knew of the biggest secret in the land .
Now , whose brilliant idea was it to tell the most talkative and irritating critter around the most coveted piece of info on the planet ?
That ’s what I ’d like to know .
1. Scrappy Doo
That Little Bastard that Crapped on a Franchise
Sometimes , as with Sit-Coms , when the story appears to be getting stale , another cast member is brought in to liven things up a bit .
Maybe it ’s a baby , or a long - lost cousin , or , in the case of the otherwise great cartoon , Scooby - Doo , it ’s another damn dog with a street - wise mouth and , more or less , the polar opposite demeanor of the star !
Scrappy is , by far , the most irritating dog in all of Hanna Barberra ’s toon universe and that even includes Yabba Doo and Dyno - Mutt .
Scrappy succeeded in getting himself into far more trouble than he was worth .
If I were Scoob and Shag , his little ass would be back in that crate on the train he fell off of .
Where was he going , anyway ?

Concern on Left : Gov't of settlers underway
Left camp looking on anxiously as Netanyahu 's cabinet takes shape .
Peace Now launches campaign under slogan – ' This is n't unity , it 's extreme Right . '
Former MKs also being recruited to fight .
Gal - On : I will let you govern , but will voice different stance .
Beilin : Can't fool world

The slogan for Peace Now 's newly launched campaign , " This is n't unity , it 's extreme right - wing , " expresses the movement 's opposition to Benjamin Netanyahu 's government and Labor 's participation in it .
" Our goal is to expose the truth to the public , " said the organization 's Secretary General Yariv Oppenheimer to Ynet .
" This is one of the most right - wing governments ever known in Israel . "

The campaign objective , according to Oppenheimer , is " to make it clear to the public that despite Netanyahu 's effort to present the government as a center - right government that strives for peace , in actuality , it is the most extremist government ever known in Israel – a government that does not support a two - state solution and that is committed to the settler population and the Yesha Council . "

"
Oppenheimer , a member of Labor , opposed his party 's decision to join the coalition .
" It was a mistake , " said Oppenheimer .
" The Labor Party is playing into the hands of the Right and is granting artificial legitimacy to one of the most extreme governments in the history of the state .
The Labor Party is an insignificant minority in the coalition and will not have any impact on political issues . "

Peace Now claims that the next government is expected to expand settlement building , block all peace process initiatives , and oppose any compromises with the Palestinians and Syrians .
The movement intends to work toward exposing the assurances and promises made to coalition partners on settlement building , increasing patrols in the Palestinian territories , and upping public relations efforts against settlements and approving outposts .

' Labor is n't even a fig leaf '
Leaders of the left wing , or what is left of it after its parliamentary representation shrunk significantly , stand behind Peace Now 's campaign .
" I completely identify with the campaign , " said former MK Zehava Gal - On ( Meretz ) , who was left out of the Knesset in the last elections .
" There is no doubt that this is an extreme - right government .
( Ehud ) Barak , Fouad ( Binyamin Ben- Eliezer ) and Shalom Simhon fit such a government .
There is nothing different about their world view and that of the Likud .
The public deserves this government because that is what the public voted for , but I think it is legitimate that there is a protest movement , an opposition . "

" I will let them govern , however , will make every effort to oppose them and voice a different stance .
I do n't believe the claim that only right - wing governments can bring progress in the peace process .
If the left is allowed to decide , groundbreaking progress will be made .
And I do n't mean left as in Kadima or Labor .
Woe is our country if Kadima and Labor are called left , " continued Gal - On .

Former Meretz Chairman Yossi Beilin also thinks the next government is a " very right - wing " government .
The most outstanding expression of this , according to Beilin , is the appointment of ( Yisrael Beiteinu leader ) Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister .
" If the defense minister were Barak and the foreign minister were even ( Dan ) Meridor , then the world would see it differently , " Beilin said to Ynet .
" But the fact that Lieberman is foreign minister and Labor gets this , says it all . "

No one needs an explanation that this is a right - wing government .
There has never been a government with Lieberman as foreign minister .
The Labor Party , with such a small number of party members supporting the coalition , can't even act as a fig leaf . "

Beilin also is holding on to a thread of hope that the government could possibly make advances towards peace .
" If this government will go out of its way to be accepted by the world and will prove to everyone that it is not what it seems , then it will receive the support of the left , " said Beilin .

" I found myself allowing ( Ariel ) Sharon to have a government .
Without Meretz led by myself , Sharon would not have had a government .
And if you had asked me a few months prior to that if I would support Sharon , I would have said you are crazy .
Therefore , I am cautious .
You can never know .
On the face of things , Lieberman as foreign minister is a provocation to the whole world , but if he divides Jerusalem and brings us back to the ' 67 armistice lines , I will clap for him , " attested Beilin .

Rezo para que mi mujer deje de ir de compras
y adquiera sentido común
Tan religioso mensaje está en un templo de Kamakura ( Japón ) donde se reza a los dioses sintoístas
( ¡Gracias Algogoku por enviarnos una foto desde tan lejano sitio ! )
A little over a week and a half ago , Google blocked Ego from getting XML reports from Analytics .
Every user ’s GA widgets stopped working ( they started reporting all zeros ) .
I panicked , tried to figure out how to get around this problem , and eventually talked to Google and they helped me solve it ( I ca n’t say exactly how yet , but nevertheless Ego now has as close to “ official ” GA support as there can be in 3rd - party app ) .
I submitted the update to Apple .
Now , of course , I wait .
And what does waiting mean ?
As I ’ve said before , it means tons of email a day and tons of bad reviews .
It means answering the same question ( “ My GA widgets all report zero… what gives ? ? ” ) 20 times a day .
It means watching negative reviews pour in .
Here are some excerpts from lovely recent reviews :
I feel this app was misrepresented .
Pretty disappointing .
Its best feature is junked .
Do n’t represent your product as doing something it can’t .
But my favorite part of this whole experience is that there ’s no way for me to respond to reviews as the app creator .
So I ca n’t go in and say , “ Hey , by the way , version 1.3 fixes all this and we ’re just waiting on Apple ’s ridiculously slow and convoluted approval process ! ” I just sit by and watch .
Or , even worse , I try to help via support and get punished for it .
When the GA thing started happening , someone created a support thread on Get Satisfaction about the issue .
Awesome , that ’s exactly why I have GS set up .
A bunch of people me - too ’d it , and added comments .
I responded with updates and then , after I submitted version 1.3 , marked it as solved with a simple statement that 1.3 fixed it and was awaiting approval .
I also created 3 company announcements saying the same thing .
But that was n’t enough for a user who came to GS , did n’t read anything , and posted a new support thread about the same issue .
So I marked it as solved , said it was a duplicate of a previous thread , and that it was fixed in 1.3 .
The user responded with a comment :
Oh , I ’m supposed to read all the other support requests marked “ this problem is resolved ? ” Sorry .
It ’s still not resolved for me .
Apparently they did n’t understand that “ solved ” was a relative term .
Yes , sure , it ’s not solved for you right now , but my resolution was pretty clear–it ’s solved in the version Apple is looking at .
JUST HOLD TIGHT .
I thought this was enough .
But no .
I wake up this morning to find that user has submitted the following review in the iTunes Store :
I bought this because it claimed to support GA .
It worked for me one time the day I bought it and has n’t worked since .
I posted to their support forum and was berated for not reading this long and confusing thread about how it is supposed to be working , or it will work again soon , or something .
I feel like the software developer did a poor job building and testing this , and now they ’re willing to blame the users for their own mistakes .
This kind of thing continually reinforces something I ’ve thought about a lot since the App store was released , which sounds horrible to say but it might be true :
Apple is creating an ecosystem of the kind of customers I do n’t want .
With the ridiculous approval process leaving bugfixes to take over a week to show up , with prices being driven down to nothing by farting apps … it just feels hostile to me .
While I have plenty of great customers who have been raving about the app , all it takes is one little issue and it all comes crashing down .
I ’m far more likely to get 15 one - star reviews when something goes wrong than I am to get 15 five - star reviews when everything goes right .
Perhaps it ’s just frustration speaking here , but when Apple ties my hands behind my back and lets users punch me publicly in the face without allowing me to at least respond back , it ’s hard to get excited about building an app .
LLVM 2.5 Release Notes
Written by the LLVM Team
This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure , release 2.5 .
Here we describe the status of LLVM , including major improvements from the previous release and significant known problems .
All LLVM releases may be downloaded from the LLVM releases web site .
For more information about LLVM , including information about the latest release , please check out the main LLVM web site .
If you have questions or comments , the LLVM Developer 's Mailing List is a good place to send them .
Note that if you are reading this file from a Subversion checkout or the main LLVM web page , this document applies to the next release , not the current one .
To see the release notes for a specific release , please see the releases page .
The LLVM 2.5 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM repository — which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers , code generators and supporting tools — and the llvm - gcc repository .
In addition to this code , the LLVM Project includes other sub- projects that are in development .
The two which are the most actively developed are the Clang Project and the VMKit Project .
The Clang project is an effort to build a set of new ' LLVM native ' front - end technologies for the LLVM optimizer and code generator .
While Clang is not included in the LLVM 2.5 release , it is continuing to make major strides forward in all areas .
Its C and Objective - C parsing and code generation support is now very solid .
For example , it is capable of successfully building many real - world applications for X86 - 32 and X86 - 64 , including the FreeBSD kernel and gcc 4.2 .
C++ is also making incredible progress , and work on templates has recently started .
If you are interested in fast compiles and good diagnostics , we encourage you to try it out by building from mainline and reporting any issues you hit to the Clang front - end mailing list .
In the LLVM 2.5 time - frame , the Clang team has made many improvements : Clang now has a new driver , which is focused on providing a GCC - compatible interface .
The X86 - 64 ABI is now supported , including support for the Apple 64 - bit Objective - C runtime and zero cost exception handling .
Precompiled header support is now implemented .
Objective - C support is significantly improved beyond LLVM 2.4 , supporting many features , such as Objective - C Garbage Collection .
Variable length arrays are now fully supported .
C99 designated initializers are now fully supported .
Clang now includes all major compiler headers , including a redesigned tgmath.h and several more intrinsic headers .
and several more intrinsic headers .
Many many bugs are fixed and many features have been added .
Previously announced in the last LLVM release , the Clang project also includes an early stage static source code analysis tool for automatically finding bugs in C and Objective - C programs .
The tool performs a growing set of checks to find bugs that occur on a specific path within a program .
In the LLVM 2.5 time - frame there have been many significant improvements to the analyzer 's core path simulation engine and machinery for generating path - based bug reports to end -users .
Particularly noteworthy improvements include experimental support for full field - sensitivity and reasoning about heap objects as well as an improved value - constraints subengine that does a much better job of reasoning about inequality relationships ( e.g. , x > 2 ) between variables and constants .
The set of checks performed by the static analyzer continues to expand , and future plans for the tool include full source - level inter-procedural analysis and deeper checks such as buffer overrun detection .
There are many opportunities to extend and enhance the static analyzer , and anyone interested in working on this project is encouraged to get involved !
The VMKit project is an implementation of a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines ( Microsoft .NET is an implementation of the CLI ) using the Just - In - Time compiler of LLVM .
Following LLVM 2.5 , VMKit has its second release that you can find on its webpage .
The release includes bug fixes , cleanup and new features .
The major changes are : Ahead of Time compiler : compiles .class files to llvm .bc. VMKit uses this functionality to native compile the standard classes ( e.g. java.lang .
String ) .
Users can compile AoT .class files into dynamic libraries and run them with the help of VMKit .
New exception model : the dwarf exception model is very slow for exception - intensive applications , so the JVM has had a new implementation of exceptions which check at each function call if an exception happened .
There is a low performance penalty on applications without exceptions , but it is a big gain for exception - intensive applications .
For example the jack benchmark in Spec JVM98 is 6 x faster ( performance gain of 83 % ) .
User - level management of thread stacks , so that thread local data access at runtime is fast and portable .
Implementation of biased locking for faster object synchronizations at runtime .
New support for OSX / X64 , Linux / X64 ( with the Boehm GC ) and Linux / ppc32 .
Pure is an algebraic / functional programming language based on term rewriting .
Programs are collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in a symbolic fashion .
Pure offers dynamic typing , eager and lazy evaluation , lexical closures , a hygienic macro system ( also based on term rewriting ) , built - in list and matrix support ( including list and matrix comprehensions ) and an easy - to - use C interface .
The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to JIT - compile Pure programs to fast native code .
In addition to the usual algebraic data structures , Pure also has MATLAB - style matrices in order to support numeric computations and signal processing in an efficient way .
Pure is mainly aimed at mathematical applications right now , but it has been designed as a general purpose language .
The dynamic interpreter environment and the C interface make it possible to use it as a kind of functional scripting language for many application areas .
LDC is an implementation of the D Programming Language using the LLVM optimizer and code generator .
The LDC project works great with the LLVM 2.5 release .
General improvements in this cycle have included new inline asm constraint handling , better debug info support , general bugfixes , and better x86 - 64 support .
This has allowed some major improvements in LDC , getting us much closer to being as fully featured as the original DMD compiler from DigitalMars .
Roadsend PHP ( rphp ) is an open source implementation of the PHP programming language that uses LLVM for its optimizer , JIT , and static compiler .
This is a reimplementation of an earlier project that is now based on LLVM .
This release includes a huge number of bug fixes , performance tweaks , and minor improvements .
Some of the major improvements and new features are listed in this section .
LLVM 2.5 includes several major new capabilities : LLVM 2.5 includes a brand new XCore backend .
llvm -gcc now generally supports the GFortran front - end , and the precompiled release binaries now support Fortran , even on Mac OS/X .
CMake is now used by the LLVM build process on Windows .
It automatically generates Visual Studio project files ( and more ) from a set of simple text files .
This makes it much easier to maintain .
In time , we 'd like to standardize on CMake for everything .
LLVM 2.5 now uses ( and includes ) Google Test for unit testing .
The LLVM native code generator now supports arbitrary precision integers .
Types like i33 have long been valid in the LLVM IR , but were previously only supported by the interpreter .
Note that the C backend still does not support these .
have long been valid in the LLVM IR , but were previously only supported by the interpreter .
Note that the C backend still does not support these .
LLVM 2.5 no longer uses ' bison , ' so it is easier to build on Windows .
LLVM fully supports the llvm - gcc 4.2 front - end , which marries the GCC front - ends and driver with the LLVM optimizer and code generator .
It currently includes support for the C , C++ , Objective - C , Ada , and Fortran front - ends .
In this release , the GCC inliner is completely disabled .
Previously the GCC inliner was used to handle always - inline functions and other cases .
This caused problems with code size growth , and it is completely disabled in this release .
llvm -gcc ( and LLVM in general ) now support code generation for stack canaries , which is an effective form of buffer overflow protection .
llvm - gcc supports this with the - fstack - protector command line option ( just like GCC ) .
In LLVM IR , you can request code generation for stack canaries with function attributes .
LLVM IR has several new features that are used by our existing front - ends and can be useful if you are writing a front - end for LLVM :
The shufflevector instruction has been generalized to allow different shuffle mask width than its input vectors .
This allows you to use shufflevector to combine two " < 4 x float > " vectors into a " < 8 x float > " for example .
LLVM IR now supports new intrinsics for computing and acting on overflow of integer operations .
This allows efficient code generation for languages that must trap or throw an exception on overflow .
While these intrinsics work on all targets , they only generate efficient code on X86 so far .
LLVM IR now supports a new private linkage type to produce labels that are stripped by the assembler before it produces a .o file ( thus they are invisible to the linker ) .
LLVM IR supports two new attributes for better alias analysis .
The noalias attribute can now be used on the return value of a function to indicate that it returns new memory ( e.g. ' malloc ' , ' calloc ' , etc ) .
The new nocapture attribute can be used on pointer arguments to indicate that the function does not return the pointer , store it in an object that outlives the call , or let the value of the pointer escape from the function in any other way .
Note that it is the pointer itself that must not escape , not the value it points to : loading a value out of the pointer is perfectly fine .
Many standard library functions ( e.g. ' strlen ' , ' memcpy ' ) have this property .
The parser for " .ll " files in lib / AsmParser is now completely rewritten as a recursive descent parser .
This parser produces better error messages ( including caret diagnostics ) , is less fragile ( less likely to crash on strange things ) , does not leak memory , is more efficient , and eliminates LLVM 's last use of the ' bison ' tool .
Debug information representation and manipulation internals have been consolidated to use a new set of classes in llvm / Analysis/ DebugInfo.h .
These routines are more efficient , robust , and extensible and replace the older mechanisms .
llvm - gcc , clang , and the code generator now use them to create and process debug information .
In addition to a large array of bug fixes and minor performance tweaks , this release includes a few major enhancements and additions to the optimizers :
The loop optimizer now improves floating point induction variables in several ways , including adding shadow induction variables to avoid " integer <-> floating point " conversions in loops when safe .
The " - mem2reg " pass is now much faster on code with large basic blocks .
The " - jump - threading " pass is more powerful : it is iterative and handles threading based on values with fully and partially redundant loads .
The " - memdep " memory dependence analysis pass ( used by GVN and memcpyopt ) is both faster and more aggressive .
The " - scalarrepl " scalar replacement of aggregates pass is more aggressive about promoting unions to registers .
We have put a significant amount of work into the code generator infrastructure , which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make it run faster :
The Writing an LLVM Compiler Backend document has been greatly expanded and is substantially more complete .
The SelectionDAG type legalization logic has been completely rewritten , is now more powerful ( it supports arbitrary precision integer types for example ) , and is more correct in several corner cases .
The type legalizer converts operations on types that are not natively supported by the target machine into equivalent code sequences that only use natively supported types .
The old type legalizer is still available ( for now ) and will be used if - disable - legalize - types is passed to the code generator .
is passed to the code generator .
The code generator now supports widening illegal vectors to larger legal ones ( for example , converting operations on < 3 x float > to work on < 4 x float > ) which is very important for common graphics applications .
The assembly printers for each target are now split out into their own libraries that are separate from the main code generation logic .
This reduces the code size of JIT compilers by not requiring them to be linked in .
The ' fast ' instruction selection path ( used at - O0 and for fast JIT compilers ) now supports accelerating codegen for code that uses exception handling constructs .
The optional PBQP register allocator now supports register coalescing .
New features of the X86 target include :
The llvm .
returnaddress intrinsic ( which is used to implement __builtin_return_address ) now supports non-zero stack depths on X86 .
intrinsic ( which is used to implement ) now supports non-zero stack depths on X86 .
The X86 backend now supports code generation of vector shift operations using SSE instructions .
X86 - 64 code generation now takes advantage of red zone , unless the - mno - red - zone option is specified .
option is specified .
The X86 backend now supports using address space # 256 in LLVM IR as a way of performing memory references off the GS segment register .
This allows a front - end to take advantage of very low - level programming techniques when targeting X86 CPUs .
See test / CodeGen / X86 / movgs.ll for a simple example .
for a simple example .
The X86 backend now supports a - disable - mmx command line option to prevent use of MMX even on chips that support it .
This is important for cases where code does not contain the proper llvm .
x86.mmx.emms intrinsics .
command line option to prevent use of MMX even on chips that support it .
This is important for cases where code does not contain the proper intrinsics .
The X86 JIT now detects the new Intel Core i7 and Atom chips and auto - configures itself appropriately for the features of these chips .
The JIT now supports exception handling constructs on Linux / X86 - 64 and Darwin/x86 - 64 .
The JIT supports Thread Local Storage ( TLS ) on Linux / X86 - 32 but not yet on X86 - 64 .
New features of the PIC16 target include : Both direct and indirect load / stores work now .
Logical , bitwise and conditional operations now work for integer data types .
Function calls involving basic types work now .
Support for integer arrays .
The compiler can now emit libcalls for operations not supported by m/c instructions .
Support for both data and ROM address spaces .
Things not yet supported : Floating point .
Passing / returning aggregate types to and from functions .
Variable arguments .
Indirect function calls .
Interrupts / programs .
Debug info .
New features include : Beginning with LLVM 2.5 , llvmc2 is known as just llvmc .
The old llvmc driver was removed .
is known as just .
The old driver was removed .
The Clang plugin was substantially improved and is now enabled by default .

If you 're already an LLVM user or developer with out - of - tree changes based on LLVM 2.4 , this section lists some " gotchas " that you may run into upgrading from the previous release .
llvm - gcc defaults to - fno - math - errno on all X86 targets .
In addition , many APIs have changed in this release .
Some of the major LLVM API changes are : Some deprecated interfaces to create Instruction subclasses , that were spelled with lower case " create , " have been removed .
LLVM is known to work on the following platforms : Intel and AMD machines ( IA32 , X86 - 64 , AMD64 , EMT - 64 ) running Red Hat Linux , Fedora Core and FreeBSD ( and probably other unix - like systems ) .
PowerPC and X86 - based Mac OS X systems , running 10.3 and above in 32 - bit and 64 - bit modes .
Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries ( native ) .
Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries ( limited support is available for native builds with Visual C++ ) .
Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 10 .
Alpha - based machines running Debian GNU / Linux .
Itanium - based ( IA64 ) machines running Linux and HP - UX .
The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself to the machine and operating system on which it is built .
However , minor porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms .
We welcome your portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages .
This section contains significant known problems with the LLVM system , listed by component .
If you run into a problem , please check the LLVM bug database and submit a bug if there is n't already one .
The following components of this LLVM release are either untested , known to be broken or unreliable , or are in early development .
These components should not be relied on , and bugs should not be filed against them , but they may be useful to some people .
In particular , if you would like to work on one of these components , please contact us on the LLVMdev list .
The MSIL , IA64 , Alpha , SPU , MIPS , and PIC16 backends are experimental .
The llc " - filetype=asm " ( the default ) is the only supported value for this option .
The X86 backend does not yet support all inline assembly that uses the X86 floating point stack .
It supports the 'f ' and 't ' constraints , but not 'u ' .
The X86 backend generates inefficient floating point code when configured to generate code for systems that do n't have SSE2 .
Win64 code generation was n't widely tested .
Everything should work , but we expect small issues to happen .
Also , llvm - gcc cannot build the mingw64 runtime currently due to several bugs and due to lack of support for the 'u ' inline assembly constraint and for X87 floating point inline assembly .
The X86 - 64 backend does not yet support the LLVM IR instruction va_arg .
Currently , the llvm -gcc and front - ends support variadic argument constructs on X86 - 64 by lowering them manually .
The Linux PPC32 / ABI support needs testing for the interpreter and static compilation , and lacks support for debug information .
Thumb mode works only on ARM v6 or higher processors .
On sub -ARMv6 processors , thumb programs can crash or produce wrong results ( PR1388 ) .
Compilation for ARM Linux OABI ( old ABI ) is supported but not fully tested .
There is a bug in QEMU - ARM ( <= 0.9.0 ) which causes it to incorrectly execute programs compiled with LLVM .
Please use more recent versions of QEMU .
The SPARC backend only supports the 32 - bit SPARC ABI ( - m32 ) ; it does not support the 64 - bit SPARC ABI ( - m64 ) .
The O32 ABI is not fully supported .
64 - bit MIPS targets are not supported yet .
On 21164s , some rare FP arithmetic sequences which may trap do not have the appropriate nops inserted to ensure restartability .
The Itanium backend is highly experimental and has a number of known issues .
We are looking for a maintainer for the Itanium backend .
If you are interested , please contact the LLVMdev mailing list .
The C backend has only basic support for inline assembly code .
The C backend violates the ABI of common C++ programs , preventing intermixing between C++ compiled by the CBE and C++ code compiled with llc or native compilers .
or native compilers .
The C backend does not support all exception handling constructs .
The C backend does not support arbitrary precision integers .
llvm - gcc does not currently support Link - Time Optimization on most platforms " out - of - the - box " .
Please inquire on the LLVMdev mailing list if you are interested .
The only major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm - gcc is the __builtin_apply family of builtins .
However , some extensions are only supported on some targets .
For example , trampolines are only supported on some targets ( these are used when you take the address of a nested function ) .
If you run into GCC extensions which are not supported , please let us know .
The C++ front - end is considered to be fully tested and works for a number of non-trivial programs , including LLVM itself , Qt , Mozilla , etc. Exception handling works well on the X86 and PowerPC targets .
Currently only Linux and Darwin targets are supported ( both 32 and 64 bit ) .
Fortran support generally works , but there are still several unresolved bugs in Bugzilla .
Please see the tools / gfortran component for details .
I ’ve been taking astrophotographic pictures for a few months now , and while I ’m certainly no expert , there are a few things I ’ve learned .
I ’d like to share some of the insights I ’ve had taking such pictures with my Nikon D200 .
Most of the advice should be translatable to any digital SLR .
To begin with , yes , you can take good photos of astronomical objects with a digital SLR .
But , no , you ’re not going to get closeups of planets with such a setup .
The longest lens you ’re likely to have is a slow 500 mm .
Not accounting for any crop factor your camera might have , that ’s only a 10 x magnification .
Most planetary observers use telescopes in the 20x to 30 x range .
That would be equivalent to a 1,000 mm to 1,500 mm lens !
So do n’t expect to resolve even planetary objects , much less extra-solar ones , with your SLR setup .
But you can get great pictures of constellations , asterisms , or convergences .
Let ’s talk a bit about exposure .
As you hopefully know , exposure is the combination of shutter speed , aperture , and ISO .
For a primer , I recommend Photo . net ’s wonderful article on exposure .
Astrophotography brings three additional complexities to exposure calculation :
1 ) What is a proper exposure ?
In most photography , a proper exposure can be determined within a relatively small band of potential exposures .
Sure , some might prefer a darker image and others a lighter one .
Or the calculation might be particularly complex , as with some landscapes where you can have ten or twelve stops from the lightest to the darkest areas .
In any of these cases , the exposure can be determined , whether by the camera itself or something like the zone system .
Toss this out the window in astrophotography .
You might want a relatively short exposure that will match what you and I see when we look up at night .
Or you might want a much longer exposure that will reveal things hidden to human eyes .
It ’s up to you .
In general , all objects are at basically the same light level ( e.g. dark ) .
This changes with the moon , especially as it gets fuller .
Gaining a proper exposure of the moon while properly exposing any other night sky object can be very difficult .
In all cases , bracket like crazy .
I would shoot at least a couple of stops lighter and darker ( in one - half or one - third stop increments ) to make sure you get the shot .
2 ) Adjusting for low light conditions .
If you ’ve even been outside at night anywhere other than downtown Las Vegas , you ’ve probably noticed that it ’s dark .
And even the most expensive lenses on the market do not pick up light as quickly as the human eye .
Astrophotography can lead to some rather long exposure times .
You do n’t want to turn your ISO up too high as that leads to more digital noise in the image .
Unfortunately , longer exposures also generate digital noise .
You need to find a balance that works for your equipment .
With my D200 , I generally shoot at ISO 400 ( occasionally ISO 800 , if I must ) with my lens preferably half a stop down from wide open ( not always easy with a longer lens ) , and in - camera noise reduction turned on .
3 ) Dealing with subject movement
You ’ve decided how light or dark you want your image to be , and you ’ve done your best to account for digital noise , but then you notice that your subject is actually moving .
Unlike a friend or family member who might hold still if you complain , or a pet who will probably just run off if you do so , stars and planets do n’t much care how much you bitch at them .
They ’re going to keep moving at their slow and steady pace ( yes , I know it ’s technically the earth ’s turning that is causing the motion ) .
In the scheme of things , they ’re not moving all that slowly .
Even exposures as short as five or six seconds can show blurring due to subject movement .
There are fancy motorized systems that can adjust your rig to stay locked on the subject , but if you have such a thing , you probably are using a telescope for your astrophotography anyways .
Did I mention that you should bracket like crazy ?
I would bracket adjustments on the exposure , as well as shooting with various ISO’s .
Few things are more frustrating then heading out to shoot at night , and realizing that you did n’t capture a single good image .
Take a lot of pictures , with a wide variety of settings , to make sure you get some good one .
Now let ’s look at some of the equipment concerns :
Tripod
A good solid tripod is a must .
The heavier , the better , or you may find that a stiff breeze ruins your shot .
Tripod Head
You need a tripod head that can quickly and easily be adjusted in any of the three directions .
It also needs to be able to lock down tight exactly where you want it .
The heavier and longer the lens , the greater concern this is .
I have a Bogan pan / tilt head , with a knob to lock down each of the three axes .
With longer lenses , however , it shifts some as I turn the knob to lock it , sometimes taking the subject all the way out of the picture .
I ’m hoping to replace this head with a better one in the future .
Cable Release
You do n’t want to spend several hundred on a premium tripod and tripod head assembly and then blur your image when you trip the shutter .
If your camera supports a cable release ( the D200 does ) , spend the $ 15 to get one .
If if does not , get the wireless release system .
If there is n’t one available ( or you ca n’t afford it ) , I suppose you could use a shutter delay , but realize that your subject is moving out of frame while your delay ticks by .
It ’ll also make taking a large number of shots just that more difficult .
You ’ll be much happier with a cable release .
Lenses
Bring the longest you have .
I ’ve got the Sigma 50 mm - 500 mm and it works well , although I wish I ’d bought the 170 mm - 500 mm instead as it ’s a bit sharper .
That one actually was less expensive , although it is now discontinued .
The next lens in your kit should be a fast 70 mm - 200 mm .
You ’ll shoot most of your constellations and asterisms with this lens .
I use the Nikkor 70 mm - 200 mm f/2.8 VR .
You also want a 24 mm - 70 mm .
Faster is better .
Some of the asterisms need more a field of view wider than the 70 mm - 200 mm gives ( especially with the crop factor of most digital SLRs ) .
I use the Sigma 24 mm - 70 mm f/2.8 VR .
Lastly , if you own one , bring an ultrawide for truly majestic shots , either with or without star trails .
I ’ve got the Sigma 15 mm - 30 mm for this .
I ’ve never used anything funky like the Pro-Optic 420 - 800 mm , so I could n’t really tell you whether it ’s worth a damn .
Light Source
Unless you have every bloody control on your camera memorized , you want to bring a light source with you .
Preferably one that does n’t completely blow out your night vision .
I find that the iPhone ’s LightPad application does a good job on this .
You can also get small flashlights that are tinted red so that they do n’t screw up your night vision .
I ’ve got one somewhere , but never seem to remember to bring it .
Star Maps
You ca n’t take pictures of things unless you know where they are .
A star map tells you how to find stars , planets , and other interesting objects .
I ’m too lazy to read one .
So I use another iPhone application called GoSkyWatch .
It gives you a live map of the sky , based upon the time and your location .
If you can find the moon and a couple of the constellations , this may be all you need to orient yourself and find your target .
Once you have all your equipment ready , you need to know what ’s going on in the sky .
There are any number of websites devoted to this subject , but I often forget to visit them .
So , I have my iTunes subscribed to a number of podcasts on astronomy including :
What ’s Up in Astronomy
Astronomy News from The University of Manchester ’s Jodrell Bank
Science @ NASA Feature Stories Podcast
Between these three , you ’re unlikely to miss something notable happening such as an interesting convergence or a visiting comet .
In closing , do n’t forget to bracket , bracket , bracket .
Both for total exposure and for different ISOs .
You ca n’t judge the quality of one of these photos on the camera ’s screen , so take lots and lots of pictures .
Coming on the heels of Canada 's Big Mac Snack Wrap , which looks a little bit iffy , is a Big Mac with a whole wheat bun .
The French are behind this merde .
From French fast - food blogger Christian Thomas ( who blogs bilingually ) about what is officially known as the Big Mac au Pain Complet :
On paper , it has the same characteristics as the Big Mac , same sauce , pickles , cheese , the only change is at the level of the buns are whole wheat bread .
The Big Mac has never changed to my knowledge , this is a mini revolution but still remain honest in order to please the more the bread feels it so much ?
Thomas says there 's hardly a difference — except that it tastes a bit less salty .
( There 's 18 percent less salt . )
A healthy Big Mac ?
That 'll be the jour .

As you ’ll recall , yesterday we wrote about the Republican House member in charge of opposing the hate crimes amendment , Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R - NC ) , who referred to the brutal murder of young gay college student Matthew Shepard as “ a hoax . ”
Well , Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews both had a few things to say about Ms. Foxx .

And just to remind everyone , America already has a hate crimes law .
We ’ve had it for decades .
But it only covers race , religion and national origin – in other words , it covers the religious right .
It does n’t cover everyone else .
The amendment , which passed in the House yesterday , would add gender , disability , sexual orientation and gender identity to the already - existing law .
Regardless of your feelings towards hate crimes laws , if America is going to have one on the books – and it does already – the law should cover everyone , and not just give special rights to the Christian fundamentalists at the Family Research Council , the American Family Association , and the men at the Concerned Women for America .

" For far too long , businesses like ours have been effectively shipping water around the globe , " says Gavin Neath , a spokesperson for Unilever .
He leans across a table in the firm 's London office , as if confiding something secretive .
Like other multinational firms , Unilever is assessing its environmental impact , including how it uses water .
In doing so the firm is reassessing the way it does business , but this also creates a number of benefits .
The firm singles out two detergents - Small and Mighty , and Surf Excel - as examples of this shift .
Small and Mighty , for example , requires half as much water per bottle and half as much packaging .
Shift in size
As we arrive at the firm 's Port Sunlight factory , near Liverpool , Keith Rutherford - who has been closely involved in developing small & mighty in the UK - has set up a display of detergents to illustrate the change .
Brands sold in different countries over the years are neatly arranged .
What would have been considered the norm now appear absurdly big in scale .
" In the past , especially in the US , big was always best , " explains Mr Rutherford .
In the past , especially in the US , big was always best
Keith Rutherford , a director of Unilever 's laundry R&D " And the more bubbles and foam the better . "
Making goods smaller challenges such assumptions .
As we enter liquid factory number one , we are hit by an intense waft of perfumed detergent .
As a robotic arm lifts bottles into a cardboard box , Mr Rutherford lists the benefits across the supply chain of making the detergent more concentrated .
Smaller bottles mean less packaging , meaning fewer carbon emissions .
" It also means more can be transported on fewer lorries which reduces fuel , which in turn lowers emissions .
" And making a more concentrated liquid means more goes further , so customers do n't have to lug as much detergent from the supermarket as often . "
' Whole puzzle '
As part of its overall environmental assessment , the firm has also looked at the consumer 's role .
EMBEDDED WATER
Item Litres per unit Size of unit Litres per kg Sheet of paper 10 A4 sheet of 80gsm 2000 Cup of tea 30 250 ml 2400 Apple 70 100g 700 Cup of coffee 140 125 ml 21,000 Bottle of beer 150 500 ml 300 Slice of bread 440 400g 1100 Chicken fillet 683 175g 3900 Packet of sugar 1500 1kg 1500 Chunk of cheese 2500 500g 5000 Packet of rice 3400 1kg 3400 Beef steak 3875 250g 15,500 Pair of jeans 10,850 1kg 10,850
This is effectively about looking at water used across the supply chain .
While embedded carbon has been much talked about , embedded water , the water that is used in the life cycle of the product , has not .
It is also called virtual water .
Water consumption at all stages is calculated ; irrigation of the raw materials , the manufacturing process , water per consumer use , waste and greenhouse gas emissions .
" By looking at water we have an opportunity to look at the whole puzzle , " says Mr Rutherford , gleefully .
A brief look at the firm 's range of goods , from brands such as Knorr stock to Dove soap , underlines how important the end user 's role is .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It might be through boiling a kettle for tea , or making stock cubes or putting on the laundry " , he lists .
Even pasta in tomato sauce needs water , albeit indirectly , since pasta needs to be boiled in water .
In fact , Unilever estimates that the water added by end users represents around 45 % of the total water used for its products .
For detergent that figure is even greater - around 95 % of the water is used by the consumer , mostly for rinsing .
Education " But you ca n't just abdicate that aspect , you need to raise awareness , " says Mr Neath .
In countries such as India , washing clothes can represent around a quarter of the domestic water used and most water is used in the rinsing phase .
ENVIRONMENTAL SAVINGS SMALL & MIGHTY
Water : 41 million litres
Shelf space : 36 football fields Carbon dioxide : 1 030 000 kg Plastic : ( equivalent ) 272 million bags Card : ( equivalent ) 383 million A4 sheets Surf Excel Quick Wash , used in India , produces less lather , so the clothes need less rinsing , saving around two buckets of water per wash .
Some parts of the world where Unilever operates are water stressed , and many areas have no piped water .
Reducing the amount of water needed not only cuts the water required , it also means less physical work , with women and girls standing to benefit the most since they do most of the water carrying , said Mr Neath .
So reducing the water in goods not only stands to benefit the environment .
It also has social implications .
Much has changed since the days of William Hesketh Lever , who co-founded the eponymous soap firm with his brother long before it was incorporated into Unilever .
But he might smile to think that aspects of his mission statement had been carried out .
" To make cleanliness commonplace ; to lessen work for women ; to foster health and contribute to personal attractiveness . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Democratic - led U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday approved an expansion of federal “ hate crime ” laws -- an effort that former Republican President George W. Bush had opposed .

On a vote of 249- 175 , the House passed and sent to the Senate a bill backed by the new Democratic White House to broaden such laws by classifying as “ hate crimes ” those attacks based on a victim ’s sexual orientation , gender identity or mental or physical disability .
The current law , enacted four decades ago , limits federal jurisdiction over hate crimes to assaults based on race , color , religion or national origin .
The bill would lift a requirement that a victim had to be attacked while engaged in a federally protected activity , like attending school , for it to be a federal hate crime .
House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer urged passage of the Federal Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 .
“ Hate crimes motivated by race , religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation , and identity or disability not only injure individual victims , but also terrorize entire segments of our population and tear at our nation ’s social fabric , ” Hoyer said .
Bush had helped stop such a bill in the last Congress , arguing existing state and federal laws were adequate .
But President Barack Obama asked Congress to send it to him to sign into law .
“ I urge members on both sides of the aisle to act on this important civil rights issue by passing this legislation to protect all of our citizens from violent acts of intolerance , ” Obama said in a statement before the vote .
Conviction of a hate crime carries stepped up punishment , above and beyond that meted out for the attack .
The bill would allow the federal government to help state and local authorities investigate hate crimes .
Representative Lamar Smith , ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , helped lead the charge against the bill , arguing it was misdirected and discriminatory .
“ All violent crimes must be vigorously prosecuted , ” Smith said .
“ Unfortunately , this bill undermines one of the most basic principles of our criminal justice system -- ‘ equal justice for all . ’ ”
“ Justice will now depend on the race , gender , sexual orientation , disability or other protected status of the victim , ” Smith said .
“ It will allow different penalties to be imposed for the same crime . ”
Earlier this year , Congress passed two other major bills derailed during the Bush administration .
One , vetoed by Bush , would have expanded a federal health insurance program for children .
The other , blocked by Bush ’s fellow Republicans in the Senate , would have reversed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to make it easier to sue for discrimination in the workplace .
With Democrats having won the White House and expanded their control of Congress in the 2008 election , both measures were among the party ’s top 2009 legislative priorities .
And they became among the first bills Obama signed into law .
The Red Hot Chili Peppers , fittingly , are singing about the City of Angels on the jukebox when Dexter Holland walks into a Long Beach bar at lunchtime , pulls off his sunglasses and reaches for a menu .
Like the members of the Chili Peppers , Holland is a signature star on the Southern California rock scene -- his Orange County punk - pop band , the Offspring , has sold 17 million albums in the U.S. alone -- but on this day he is more focused on his other gig as an up - and - comer in the quirky world of boutique hot sauces .
His indelicately named Mexican - style sauce , Gringo Bandito , made its debut in late 2006 after two years of exhaustive experimentation by Holland to get just the right taste , texture and all - important zing .
Bandito is now being bottled at the brisk pace of 300 gallons a month and is even being sold through Albertsons supermarkets in Southern California and Las Vegas , a triumph for a venture that faced a dizzying array of competitors and started as a spicy lark .
“ Growing up here I was always into Mexican food and culture , Day of the Dead , all of it , and one day I looked at a hot sauce bottle and wondered if I could do better , ” the 43 - year - old Holland says as he munches on tacos at Lona ’s Wardlow Station , a Long Beach landmark when it comes to cantina cuisine and cervezas .
“ Making a good hot sauce turned out to be far harder than I thought , ” Holland says with a weary smile .
“ Going to Google and typing in ‘ salsa ’ and finding a recipe is one thing , but trying to figure out how people make a quality hot sauce is a lot tougher .
It ’s guarded , somewhat , and it ’s more difficult , because there ’s cooking involved . ”
Holland had the advantage of a background with beakers -- he has a master ’s degree in molecular biology from USC , which may surprise many of his young concert fans who pogo while he belts out such Offspring hits as “ Hammerhead ” and “ Come Out and Play . ”
He ’s also designed and patented software for BlackBerrys , owns a record label and happens to be an experienced pilot who owns three planes .
None of that , though , matters in the burn - or - get - burned business of hot sauce .
“ People take it so seriously , especially here in Southern California , where Mexican food is part of the way of life , ” says Holland , who noted that youth culture in the beach towns is especially drenched in the binding sauce .
“ It brings all kinds of people together .
The hard - core hot sauce guys carry their own bottle around with them in the glove compartment or their work box . ”
What you think of when you hear “ hot sauce ” depends on what table you ’re sitting at .
There are the dips and pastes of Asia , the Scotch bonnet sauces and mustards of the Caribbean and , by far the most popular in the U.S. , the family of Louisiana - style vinegar - based hot sauces , which Tabasco dominates like Coca - Cola and Pepsi put together .
Mexican - style hot sauce historically has put more emphasis on flavor than heat and tones down the vinegar , compared to the bayou counterparts .
Holland says that with his Gringo Bandito , he stayed away from the contemporary how - hot - can - you - go competition that has led certain restaurants to ask customers to sign waivers before taking that first bite .
Holland is reluctant to critique competitors ( he does admire an import called Amazon Hot Sauce , a green , mild , mango - flavored sauce ) or to describe his own recipe too precisely -- and who can blame him after so many months of struggle ?
But Bandito ’s “ official ” ingredients as listed on its website : vinegar , water , habanero peppers , jalapeño peppers , red Japanese chile peppers , more peppers , salt , mojo , spices and xanthan gum .
“ It ’s a witch ’s brew .
There are a dozen types of peppers in all , and some secret stuff , ” said Matt McCollum , who is part of Holland ’s Bandito team , along with Florencia Arriaga , who oversees production .
Twice a month , Arriaga shops for peppers and , over six hours , cooks up 150 gallons of the sauce in a caldron at Da’kine Foods , a Newport Beach professional kitchen for boutique sauces and other bottled goodies .
The right sauce can make a meal light up , and sometimes , the more expensive concoctions can’t hold a culinary candle to the tried - and - true , often cheaper , stalwarts .
Lona Lee , owner of Wardlow Station , says her customers reach most often for Tapatío , the Guadalajara - style salsa picante that launched in 1971 and is bottled in Vernon , or Cholula , with its trademark wooden cap and pequin peppers .
Also popular are Pico Pica , a Mexican sauce with no vinegar at all , and El Yucateco , the best - selling brand south of the border .
Holland has skipped the advertising route , instead taking a grass - roots approach to his peppery venture .
“ We took it to fire stations and electrical unions and gave it away , ” he says .
“ I leave it at beach bars in Huntington and Redondo .
The best way is to get one person to taste it and then tell their friends .
Ads do n’t sell hot sauce .
Friends do . ”
Holland ’s Bandito , Lee says , is catching on , but she adds that it ’s hard for newcomers in the sector to gain traction , because many of her diners never stray from tradition or , on the opposite end of the scale , never want to try the same thing twice .
That safari mentality explains shops such as Hot Licks , the hot sauce specialty store in Long Beach ’s Shoreline Village that has hundreds of brands promising the best flavor or the worst oral crisis .
“ There ’s something really fun about hot sauce .
It makes a great gift and it ’s fun to talk about , ” Holland says as he trails some Bandito across a chicken taco .
“ When I started , I did n’t know how hard it would be .
But hey , when we started the band , we did n’t know how to play guitars either . ”

O arcebispo de Olinda e Recife excomungou nesta quarta - feira ( 4 ) a mãe , os médicos e outros envolvidos no aborto sofrido por uma menina de 9 anos .
Segundo a polícia , o padrastro confessou que abusava da garota .
Ele seria o pai dos gêmeos que ela esperava .
Veja o site do Jornal da Globo
Ao justificar sua ação , dom José Cardoso Sobrinho disse que , aos olhos da Igreja , o aborto foi um crime e que a lei dos homens não está acima das leis de Deus .
A menina está em uma maternidade pública do Recife .
Assim que foi internada , na terça - feira ( 3 ) à noite , começou a receber doses de um medicamento para interromper a gravidez .
No fim da manhã desta quarta , o aborto se consumou , segundo direção de hospital .
" Se a gravidez continuasse , o dano seria pior .
O risco existiria até de morte ou de uma sequela definitiva de não poder mais engravidar ” , explica o médico Olímpio Moraes .
Mas , para a equipe médica , não foi uma decisão simples .
A realização do aborto passou a contar com oposição declarada do arcebispo de Olinda e Recife , dom José Cardoso Sobrinho , um integrante da ala conservadora da Igreja .
“ A lei de Deus está acima de qualquer lei humana .
Então , quando uma lei humana , quer dizer , uma lei promulgada pelos legisladores humanos , é contrária à lei de Deus , essa lei humana não tem nenhum valor ” , acredita .
“ Há duas indicações legais no abortamento previsto em lei , que é o estupro e o risco de vida .
Ela está incluída nos dois e , como médico , a gente não pode deixar que uma menina de 9 anos seja submetida a sofrimento e até a pagar com a própria vida ” , rebate o médico .
A reação do arcebispo foi imediata .
Assim que soube que o aborto havia sido consumado , dom José Cardoso Sobrinho disse que a Igreja Católica considera que houve um crime e um ato inaceitável para a doutrina .
E decidiu : todas as pessoas que participaram do aborto , com exceção da criança , estão excomungadas da Igreja .
“ Para incorrer nessa penalidade eclesiástica , é preciso maioridade .
A Igreja , então , é muito benévola , quer dizer , sobretudo , com os menores .
Agora os adultos , quem aprovou , quem realizou esse abordo , incorreu na excomunhão .
A Igreja não costuma comunicar isso .
Agora , a gente espera que essa pessoa , em momentos de reflexão , não espere a hora da morte para se arrepender ” , afirma .
Entidades de defesa da mulher , da criança e do adolescente não concordam com a decisão do arcebispo .
“ Há organizações que não levam em consideração a vida dessa menina em um momento como esse e fazem um enorme desserviço em criar uma polêmica em torno de um caso que está garantido por lei e que há uma decisão da responsável pela menor no sentido de encaminhar dessa forma como está sendo encaminhado ” , afirma a educadora do SOS Corpo Carla Batista .
O teólogo e ex-professor da PUC de São Paulo João Batistiole comentou a excomunhão dos envolvidos no aborto legal .
“ Acho que é uma posição dura , difícil de entender , uma posição institucional .
Acho que a igreja perde um pouco da credibilidade perante seus fieis ” , avalia .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - A Chinese virologist who helped fight SARS and bird flu warned on Monday of a possible swine flu pandemic that the most populous countries in Asia , China and India , would be ill - prepared to handle .
“ We are counting down to a pandemic , ” said Guan Yi , a professor at the University of Hong Kong who helped trace the outbreak of SARS in 2003 to the civet cat .
“ I think the spread of this virus in humans cannot possibly be contained within a short time ... there are already cases in almost every region .
The picture is changing every moment . ”
Guan , who has been studying and tracking the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus ever since it was discovered in people in Hong Kong in 1997 , said there would be “ many problems ” if swine flu reached China and India , “ where populations are so dense and health infrastructure is still insufficient . ”
The virus , which carries swine , avian and human DNA and the designation H1N1 , has already killed up to 103 people in Mexico , infected 20 in the United States and six in Canada .
There are many questions surrounding this virus , such as why it appears milder in the United States and deadlier in Mexico .
“ It may seem weaker for now in the United States , but we do not know if it will get more virulent when it goes to another place as it mutates constantly , ” said Guan .
“ When it goes into a place like China , there will be very high transmissibility among people . ”
Microbes like viruses mutate all the time and can swap or mix DNA with other viruses they come into contact with .
And nobody knows whether they could become more or less deadly , experts say .
Guan said the swine flu virus was very different from the seasonal human H1N1 flu virus .
“ It is almost a new subtype , ” he said , adding that as it was already transmitting efficiently among people , the world already had a pandemic on its hands .
Currently the World Health Organisation classifies the virus as a “ public health emergency of international concern ” that could become a pandemic , or global outbreak of serious disease .
“ This is what I am very worried about .
The WHO is always very cautious ( about raising its alert system ) but it is wasting time , ” Guan added .
The current phase of alert is 3 on a scale of 1 to 6 .
A full - blown pandemic , level 6 , denotes sustained human to human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus .

A total outlay of just under $ 48,000 laid the seeds of this courtroom confrontation between the 26 - year - old Bolton and BrisConnections , the company mandated to build the ambitious 6.7 kilometre toll road .
Those listed BrisConnections units were designed to help fund the construction of the road , but are now among the most toxic assets tradeable on Australian markets .
Each 0.1 ¢ stapled unit comes with two $ 1 instalments to be paid , which means the modest outlay of $ 500 lumbers a buyer with a $ 1 million debt .
Melbourne housewife Fang He felt the sting of BrisConnections in October .
She turned a $ 32,300 investment into a $ 65 million nightmare after buying units without investigating what liabilities were owed on them .
Countless other Australian families face losing their home after spending just a few hundred dollars on the units .
According to his own testimony to the Victorian Supreme Court , Bolton says he knew he was picking up $ 94 million of debt he did not have the finances to pay .
He even contemplated a takeover move for the embattled project , he testified .
Bolton had grand plans , but he has instead been forced into legal combat with BrisConnections , the Queensland Government , investment bank Macquarie Group and construction giant Leighton Holdings .
His only perceivable ally in court is a co-underwriter of the float , Deutsche Bank , which is hoping that his punt may cause the next $ 1 call to be halted , and absolve it from covering the shortfall when retail investors are unable to pay .
The other result of Bolton 's BrisConnections gamble is unintended , but just as visible .
He has shone a light into the most disastrous float in recent history — a deal stitched together by Macquarie , and one of the last major infrastructure deals done before the global financial crisis hit .
The capital raising for BrisConnections is very much the famed " Macquarie model " in action , with huge leverage involved .
The $ 4.8 billion project cost is funded by $ 3.2 billion of debt , and gearing of about 65 per cent .
It was also a typical Macquarie model in another way — for putting together one of the worst - performing floats Australia has seen in decades , the investment bank picked up $ 110 million in lucrative fees .
That includes an advisory fee of $ 56.1 million , a sponsor development fee of $ 12.5 million , an equity underwriting fee of $ 28.2 million and a dividend reinvestment plan underwriting fee of $ 14 million .
Macquarie will also be BrisConnections ' exclusive financial adviser for a decade .
Before the global meltdown , institutions were queuing for a piece of the action .
The consortium that won a 45 - year contract to build and operate the tunnel and toll - road project was led by the giant Queensland Investment Corp , which invests the superannuation funds of the state 's public servants , and is chaired by ASX director and Future Fund custodian Trevor Rowe .
The initial public offering priced shares at $ 3 each — $ 1 up front , and two further $ 1 payments — and was fully subscribed .
The structure of partly paid shares is not uncommon , but under this initial offer BrisConnections borrowed against the future instalment payments .
A distribution was to be paid to investors from borrowed funds even though the company was not generating revenue .
However , cash flow from the project was aimed at eventually paying down the debt over the long term .
But the units tanked on the first day of trade , June 30 last year , as institutions became nervous about the global meltdown .
BrisConnections opened at 65 ¢ .
By the end of trade , they had dipped to 40 ¢ .
Almost 20 per cent of the issued units — about 36 million securities — changed hands in the first 48 hours .
Macquarie took a stake in the project equivalent to 18 per cent of the issued units , but sold out soon after the float , dumping 60 million units at a heavy loss .
In doing so it dodged a further $ 120 million of instalment payments .
Others followed Macquarie out the door .
When BrisConnections listed , just 12 per cent of the units were in the hands of retail investors .
That figure now exceeds 80 per cent .
As a result , BrisConnections ' share price has fallen from from $ 1 to just 0.1¢ , the lowest tradeable price on the ASX .
A promised 5.95 ¢ per share distribution , payable before the second $ 1 instalment was due , has been slashed to 0.05 ¢ and postponed until after the next instalment , as part of the board 's efforts to save cash .
To cap off the mess , half - year results released on February 3 reveal that a decision to hedge interest rates on its loans , using derivatives called interest rate swaps , has caused a $ 476 million black hole , given the recent round of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank .
In all , the failed float has put the board of BrisConnections and its major backers , Macquarie Group and Leighton Holdings , in a hole .
The company has drawn $ 231 million of its IPO bridging finance facility with Macquarie , and on Monday a further $ 91 million is drawn on that facility .
A $ 200 million facility with Leightons has almost been exhausted .
BrisConnections needs to collect the next $ 390 million of its instalment payments from unit holders on April 29 , or have the co-underwriters pay the shortfall , to pay off its loans .
The problem is , many of the unit holders simply do n't have that money .
Unit holders are claiming they did n't know that BrisConnections ' five - letter ASX code , BCSCA , instead of a usual three - letter code , meant it was a partly paid unit with further payments due .
That includes Yallambie couple Steven and Violet Csutoros , who bought $ 600 of units via their CommSec online trading account and now owe $ 200,000 by April 29 .
" I just simply clicked and they were mine , " Mr Csutoros said .
" There should have been a warning , but there was none . "
FOR months the board of BrisConnections , and primarily Trevor Rowe and chief executive Raymond Wilson , have searched for an answer to the dilemma .
They commissioned Goldman Sachs JBWere to try to find new backers , or create a new financing model , but to no avail .
What Rowe and Wilson did n't expect was the arrival of Nick Bolton .
Bolton announced to the ASX that his private company Australian Style Investments had become a substantial shareholder on November 24 .
For weeks , BrisConnections company secretary Tamira Herbst tried to contact Bolton , but with no luck .
But even if they did speak , 26 - year - old Bolton was not a person Rowe and his team could easily communicate with .
There is a substantial cultural chasm between the generation Y internet entrepreneur with a penchant for vintage suits and riding a bicycle inside his office , and hard - nosed pre-baby boomer Rowe and his advisory team .
It took months , but the protagonists finally did get to have a conversation .
That was at 3.30 pm on February 13 , and it was Rowe who picked up the phone .
The reason for the call was simple .
Bolton had played a card that no one at BrisConnections had expected — he had called for an extraordinary meeting of unit holders to vote on a series of resolutions , which included having BrisConnections ' unit trusts wound up .
This made Bolton a white knight for BrisConnections ' embattled unit holders .
Websites and online forums buzzed with hope that the biggest shareholder in the toll - road operator might have found a way out for them .
Many had already tried , or suggested online , several methods to avoid making the instalment payments .
These included off - market transfers to terminally ill patients , or homeless people , or overseas residents .
Csutoros was one who attempted the off - market route , transferring his units to a $ 2 shelf company that was set up by his accountant .
But he soon received a letter threatening legal action from BrisConnections and telling him he still had to pay .
With Bolton threatening to gather the unit holders together for a vote , Rowe needed to act .
" I was surprised he took the call , " Rowe later told BusinessDay .
The pair had four discussions that day , and Rowe agreed to organise a meeting between Bolton and the company 's underwriters , Deutsche and Macquarie , in Melbourne .
When the meeting went ahead , representatives from Deutsche wanted to know what " value " Bolton wanted .
They had anticipated some kind of play , but Bolton did not bite .
Instead , he wanted Rowe to use his contacts to set up a meeting with the Queensland Government .
For Rowe , that was a step too far and communication with Bolton soon ended .
" To this day , I still do n't know what he wanted , " Rowe told BusinessDay .
It is from this moment that negotiations turned into a game of brinkmanship that led the parties to court .
After failing to negotiate a deal with underwriters , Bolton issued a second notice of meeting , this time with a series of cascading resolutions — including a vote to remove the BrisConnections board as manager of the trusts .
BrisConnections then started legal action , seeking orders in the Victorian Supreme Court to have Australian Style wound up , and the proposed EGM abandoned because it had been improperly called by Bolton .
In response , Bolton started to increase his holding — and offered to take units off the hands of holders via a deed of gift .
Unit holders had to pay Australian Style a $ 1305 administration fee , but it meant they were free from paying the calls on their units .
Then , during discovery , came the biggest bombshell of all .
Bolton announced that he had an existing put option agreement with John Howard Williams , friend and business partner of his father , John Bolton .
It allowed him to transfer his entire BrisConnections holding , which was by now approaching 77 million units .
By the time he walked into court on St Patrick 's Day , Bolton and his own legal team faced 30 - odd rival lawyers in court .
In front of Bolton sat the counsel for BrisConnections , led by Joseph Santamaria , QC , and barrister Phillip Crutchfield , and instructed by law firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth .
To Bolton 's left sat counsel for Macquarie Group , and next to them lawyers for the state of Queensland .
To Bolton 's right sat the representatives of Leighton Holdings .
All wanted to make submissions to the court .
At Bolton 's very right sat counsel for Deutsche Bank — maybe his only corporate ally in this case .
Indeed , there were so many lawyers that a company put together to solve a traffic jam in Brisbane had merely created one on the street outside Melbourne 's old High Court building , as juniors pushing document trolleys queued to get into court .
The disaster that is BrisConnections does not start with , or end with , Nicholas Bolton , but his entry in the story has been remarkable .
Bolton testified that his purchase of BrisConnections shares was part of a grand scheme to make a takeover bid for the toll - road builder .
Indeed , a strategy document emailed by Bolton to Ernst & Young , ANZ and Deloitte detailed a plan to increase his holding in BrisConnections up to 49.9 per cent .
Bolton was seeking an adviser for the detail , but none was forthcoming .
The first day of the trial ended without Bolton having to take the stand , and when he did he appeared nervous and could n't open the door to get into the dock .
Eventually he swore an oath , leaned on one elbow , and looked both Justice Robson and barrister Phillip Crutchfield in the eye when he answered their questions .
Bolton was cross-examined by Crutchfield over three days .
He testified that he entered into a verbal put option agreement with Williams , his father 's best friend , on November 18 last year , in a meeting over a glass of red wine at the Melbourne Wine Room .
For an upfront premium of $ 12,100 , Williams agreed to sign a deed to take up to 77 million BrisConnections units from him at 0.1 ¢ each .
A two - week hunt for Williams by BrisConnections 's lawyers had failed to track him down .
They did hear his voice on an answering machine at his home in Brighton , but he had since left the address .
Williams did finally appear in court , walking in at 4 pm last Friday afternoon , to the surprise of all but Bolton 's lawyers .
He denied he had been avoiding being served , testified that he had known John Bolton since 1951 , they were great mates and , yes , he had agreed to the put option with Nick .
According to the two men , the final written version of the put option deed was signed in the living room of the home of John and Dayle Bolton , Nick 's parents , on March 7 , just days before the court case was was to begin .
But under cross-examination by Crutchfield , some testimony about the dates of meetings , and who was present , varied and changed .
Santamaria , for BrisConnections , represented the put option as a " sham " and part of an " exit strategy " designed to send millions of dollars of liabilities " to the bottom of Port Philip Bay " .
Justice Robson expressed his own view .
" What person in their right mind would pay $ 70,000 for the benefit of incurring bankruptcy ? " he said .
Throughout his testimony Bolton was selective with his language .
He would say what was " an intention " for his BrisConnections holding , but never revealed what was " the intention " .
But there is little doubt that his intention now is to have BrisConnections wound up .
Late yesterday , submissions in the case were finally heard and Justice Robson will now consider the facts ; but he also seems to be aware of a bigger issue — who is looking out for the interests of unit holders ?
In the words of Justice Robson , these are people in " a very difficult situation " due to the very entity — BrisConnections — that is supposed to be representing their interests .
Hugh McLernon , managing director of litigation funding firm IMF Australia , has agreed to pay for a senior counsel to represent several unit holders in the matter next week .
IMF successfully bankrolled a class action against Sons of Gwalia in 2003 , and has recently been involved in litigation surrounding Opes Prime and Firepower Australia .

Next week , when Bolton , who appeared as a white knight for unit holders takes his favourite position in the middle of court , he might just have a white knight of his own .
At a live diggnation show at SXSW , Kevin Rose claimed that the new iPhone 3.0 software update will include support for copy and paste .
With Apple ’s scheduled presentation on the iPhone 3.0 software update just 2 days away , the rumors about what the update will have are piling up .
One of the more interesting , and perhaps credible , rumors comes from Digg co-founder Kevin Rose who recently said at a live Diggnation taping that the new iPhone 3.0 software will support Copy and Paste .
( Insert applause here ) .
And how will Copy and Paste work ?
According to Rose ,
You double click on a word .. you double tap on a word , and it brings up the magnifying glass , and it has 2 quotes on the end , and you drag the quotes around the [ section ] that you want to copy ..
Seems simple enough .
One issue that comes to mind , though , is how the phone will differentiate between double taps intended to initiate a cut or paste , and those intended to zoom in on a webpage ?
Rose also mentioned that there wo n’t be any support for running apps in the background .
But one of the more interesting tidbits from Rose ’s source was that “ everything that the Palm Pre software had on Apple has now gone away . ”
Interesante mi amigos .
The Palm Pre looks really slick , and it ’ll be interesting to see which features from the Palm Pre Apple has chosen to include in the latest iPhone software update .
Rose ’s track record regarding Apple rumors has generally been hit or miss , so take the above report with a grain of salt .
I , however , am inclined to believe it .
The Palm Pre has been getting lots of good press lately , and many are touting it as a worthy competitor to the iPhone , in part because it has features that the iPhone currently lacks , namely cut and paste and the ability to multitask .
Apple has repeatedly stated that it views the iPhone as a software platform , and as such , significant upgrades to the iPhone OS are inevitable .
Apple would n’t have a big iPhone media event unless it had big news to deliver , and cut and paste definitely fits the bill .
The only other question is what other tricks Apple might have up its sleeve .
Earlier this week , Boy Genius Report said that support for MMS messaging and tethering will also be included in the new iPhone OS .
Anyways , check out this video clip from Diggnation and see for yourself .

Imagine what our economy would be like if almost half of our electricity came from renewable energy resources .
No fuel price shocks , no foreign control , no worries about climate change — just clean , abundant , affordable electricity .
Before World War II , Americans actually lived that way , thanks to hydropower .
The massive public works projects undertaken during the Great Depression built a fleet of huge facilities on some of the country ’s biggest waterways .
Job creation , electrification and inexpensive power modernized the rural South and helped to industrialize the West .
Then , the story goes , after the war ended and the atomic age began , hydropower growth slowed to a trickle .
A myth that hydropower could n’t expand any further gained currency .
Well , get ready for some myth - busting .
Hydropower is the largest renewable resource in the U.S. , providing about 8 percent of the nation ’s electricity .
Analysts say that capacity can double in 30 years , rivaling the growth predicted for the nuclear power industry and at a fraction of the cost .
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is reviewing more than 30,000 megawatts ’ worth of new projects , equal to a third of all existing hydropower capacity and big enough to power the New York metropolitan area .
Surprised ?
Many people are , because they still think of hydropower only on a scale of the giant Hoover Dam .
The fact is , new technologies are creating ways to generate electricity in all kinds of waterways .
For example , turbines that rotate slowly like underwater windmills can sit in rivers , aqueducts or other locations where water flows freely .
Other units in oceans or tidal waters generate electricity as they bob up and down .
Even existing dams hold promise for energy production .
Only about 3 percent of the country ’s 80,000 dams generate electricity .
Power - generating turbines could be added to many of these structures .
The hydropower industry is encouraging the federal government , which owns many of these nonpowered dams , to begin assessing the potential .
Beyond that , engineers are finding ways to generate more electricity at existing hydroelectric dams by installing more efficient turbines and other technologies .
The Grant County ( Washington State ) Public Utility District is almost halfway through a project to replace 10 turbines at its Wanapum Dam that will increase the facility ’s capacity by more than 10 percent .
The new turbines , developed through a public - private partnership , also offer a more “ fish friendly ” design .
Projects such as this one that maximize efficiency and reduce environmental impact are starting to attract support from environmentalists , who appreciate hydropower ’s ability to provide reliable , affordable energy resources without greenhouse gas emissions .
The U.S. hydropower industry is pleased to see the Obama administration take a closer look , and we ’re urging officials to invest in federal research and development that can propel new water power technologies to market .
As the administration examines public works projects that can jump - start the economy , it should consider hydropower initiatives , just as its predecessors turned to hydro development during tough economic times 75 years ago .
The industry is also asking Congress to ensure that such development receives the same tax incentives given to other renewables .
Hydropower should be part of state and federal policies , too .
From renewable portfolio standards to comprehensive energy and climate strategies , hydropower offers a proved resource .

BUSINESS BUSH POLICIES STILL DIVIDE BUSH POLICIES STILL DIVIDE Enlarge By Alex Wong , Getty Images By Jill Lawrence , USA TODAY
The Bush administration 's anti-terrorism policies have generated controversies , lawsuits and indelible images such as those of abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
They 've also given rise to multiple opinions on whether to investigate , prosecute or just move on .
In his inaugural address , President Obama said that " we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . "
In his first three weeks as president , Obama altered several Bush administration policies .
He has ordered that the CIA close its detention facilities , that Guantanamo Bay prison close within a year , and that U.S. officials abide by treaties and domestic laws that prohibit torture or degradation of prisoners .
He also has named a special task force to look into whether standard military interrogation procedures are sufficient , and whether rendition — sending prisoners to other countries — compromises U.S. compliance with bans on torture .
A poll of MoveOn.org members suggests that even among liberals , there are more pressing priorities right now .
Asked their top goals for 2009 , members put " hold the Bush administration accountable " in seventh place .

WASHINGTON  Even as Americans struggle with two wars and an economy in tatters , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds majorities in favor of investigating some of the thorniest unfinished business from the Bush administration :
Whether its tactics in the " war on terror " broke the law .
Close to two - thirds of those surveyed said there should be investigations into allegations that the Bush team used torture to interrogate terrorism suspects and its program of wiretapping U.S. citizens without getting warrants .
Almost four in 10 favor criminal investigations and about a quarter want investigations without criminal charges .
One - third said they want nothing to be done .
CALLS TO MOVE ON : Even reversed , Bush policies divide Even more people want action on alleged attempts by the Bush team to use the Justice Department for political purposes .
Four in 10 favored a criminal probe , three in 10 an independent panel , and 25 % neither .
The ACLU and other groups are pressing for inquiries into whether the Bush administration violated U.S. and international bans on torture and the constitutional right to privacy .
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers and his Senate counterpart , Patrick Leahy , have proposed commissions to investigate .
Asked Monday about Leahy 's plan , President Obama said he would look at it .
He added , " my general orientation is to say , let 's get it right moving forward . "
Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have declined to rule out prosecutions .
Leon Panetta , named to head the CIA , said this month that CIA officers would not be prosecuted for harsh interrogations authorized by the Bush White House .
Leahy , D - Vt. , this week proposed a " truth commission " to assemble facts .
He said the panel could offer immunity from prosecution for everything but perjury .
" We need to get to the bottom of what happened and why , " he said .
Conyers , D - Mich. , has called for a panel that would gather facts and make recommendations , and could possibly lead to prosecutions .
" This is n't payback , " he said .
" We are getting things straightened out for the future . "
The Republican viewpoint was summed up recently by Sen. Arlen Specter , R - Pa .
" If every administration started to re-examine what every prior administration did , there would be no end to it , " he said .
" This is not Latin America . "
The politics of any investigation would be delicate .

Eventually , I 'd like to install solar panels on our house , but I want to know that it will be worth it before I commit the money .
Back in 2007 , I wrote a library for calculating the path of the sun given the time and your location on the earth .
Since then , I 've been thinking about the next step , which is calculating how much neighboring houses and trees would obstruct the sun at different times of the day .
In a nutshell , I wanted to replicate the calculations performed by devices like the Solmetric Suneye without paying $ 1500 for the device .
To do the job right , I still need a quality circular fisheye lens ( $ 680 new ) , but I 've got a first approximation working with a $ 13 door peephole from McMaster .
( I do realize that I could just get a solar contractor to do all the site evaluation for me for free .
That misses the point .
If all I wanted was some sort of fiscal efficiency , I 'd get a job as a financial executive or maybe something different from that , like a bank robber . )
Back to the task at hand .
Below is the image I started with , which I took back in the fall , before the leaves fell off the trees .
This was using a Canon SD450 camera and the aforementioned peephole .
I did n't take particular care to level the camera or center the peephole .
Using the Python Imaging Library , I cropped the photo to be square and switched to black and white mode .
Then I mapped concentric rings in the image below to the subsequent straightened image .
Here 's the straightening code .
The guts are in the nested for loops near the end .
( If there are any Pythonistas out there who know how to iterate over concentric rings using a list comprehension or map ( ) , please let me know .
The code below is functional and reasonable clear , but a little slow . )
# Code under GPLv3 ; see pysolar.org for complete version .
def despherify Image ( im ) : ( width , height ) = im .
size half _width = im . size [ 0 ] / 2 half_height = im . size [ 1 ] / 2 inpix = im . load ( ) out = Image .
new ( " L " , ( width , half_height ) ) outpix = out .
load ( ) full_circle = 1000.0 * 2 * pi for r in range ( half_width ) : for theta in range ( int ( full_circle ) ) : ( inx , iny ) = ( round ( r * cos ( theta / 1000.0 ) ) + half_width , round ( r * sin ( theta / 1000.0 ) ) + half_width ) ( outx , outy ) = ( width - width * ( theta / full_circle ) - 1 , r ) outpix [ outx , outy ] = inpix [ inx , iny ] return out
The straightening works pretty well , but there is a little distortion that I think is caused by the peephole not being a perfectly spherical lens .
Also , because the peephole is not centered on the camera lens , my concentric ring transformation is n't centered either .
From here , I needed to figure out where the sky ends and the buildings or trees start .
Unfortunately , the buildings and trees are both lighter and darker than the sky in different places , so I can't just look for one type of transition .
To detect the edge , I scan down each column of pixels and calculate the difference in darkness between consecutive pixels , ignoring whether the change was from light to dark or the reverse .
The image below shows those differences , amplified by 10 x to increase the contrast .
The mathematicians call this calculation a finite forward difference .
Here 's the finite difference code .
# Code under GPLv3 ; see pysolar.org for complete version .
def differentiateImageColumns ( im ) : ( width , height ) = im .
size pix = im . load ( ) for x in range ( width ) : for y in range ( height - 1 ) : pix [ x , y ] = min ( 10 * abs ( pix [ x , y ] - pix [ x , y + 1 ] ) , 255 ) return im
The last step is to scan down each column looking for the first large value .
The first change that crosses a threshold is recorded .
The final output is an array of values that measure the angle of the highest obstruction as a function of direction .
As a sanity check , I drop a red dot on each value .
It 's hard to make out in the thumbnail below , but if you click on the image below , you 'll get a larger version where you can see the red dots work pretty well .
I think the next step will be to calculate the total energy delivered per year using Pysolar .
Here 's the full code .
This is the fourth of a series of blog posts introducing the new C++0 x thread library .
The first three parts covered starting threads in C++0 x with simple functions , starting threads with function objects and additional arguments , and starting threads with member functions and reference arguments .
If you 've read the previous parts of the series then you should be comfortable with starting threads to perform tasks " in the background " , and waiting for them to finish .
You can accomplish a lot of useful work like this , passing in the data to be accessed as parameters to the thread function , and then retrieving the result when the thread has completed .
However , this wo n't do if you need to communicate between the threads whilst they are running — accessing shared memory concurrently from multiple threads causes undefined behaviour if either thread modifies the data .
What you need here is some way of ensuring that the accesses are mutually exlusive , so only one thread can access the shared data at a time .
Mutual Exclusion with std::mutex
Mutexes are conceptually simple .
A mutex is either " locked " or " unlocked " , and threads try and lock the mutex when they wish to access some protected data .
If the mutex is already locked then any other threads that try and lock the mutex will have to wait .
Once the thread is done with the protected data it unlocks the mutex , and another thread can lock the mutex .
If you make sure that threads always lock a particular mutex before accessing a particular piece of shared data then other threads are excluded from accessing the data until as long as another thread has locked the mutex .
This prevents concurrent access from multiple threads , and avoids the undefined behaviour of data races .
The simplest mutex provided by C++0 x is std::mutex .
Now , whilst std:: mutex has member functions for explicitly locking and unlocking , by far the most common use case in C++ is where the mutex needs to be locked for a specific region of code .
This is where the std::lock_guard <> template comes in handy by providing for exactly this scenario .
The constructor locks the mutex , and the destructor unlocks the mutex , so to lock a mutex for the duration of a block of code , just construct a std::lock_guard <> object as a local variable at the start of the block .
For example , to protect a shared counter you can use std::lock_guard <> to ensure that the mutex is locked for either an increment or a query operation , as in the following example :
std::mutex m ; unsigned counter=0 ; unsigned increment ( ) { std::lock_guard<std::mutex > lk(m ) ; return ++ counter ; } unsigned query ( ) { std::lock_guard<std::mutex > lk(m ) ; return counter ; }
This ensures that access to counter is serialized — if more than one thread calls query ( ) concurrently then all but one will block until the first has exited the function , and the remaining threads will then have to take turns .
Likewise , if more than one thread calls increment ( ) concurrently then all but one will block .
Since both functions lock the same mutex , if one thread calls query ( ) and another calls increment ( ) at the same time then one or other will have to block .
This mutual exclusion is the whole point of a mutex .
Exception Safety and Mutexes
Using std::lock_guard<> to lock the mutex has additional benefits over manually locking and unlocking when it comes to exception safety .
With manual locking , you have to ensure that the mutex is unlocked correctly on every exit path from the region where you need the mutex locked , including when the region exits due to an exception .
Suppose for a moment that instead of protecting access to a simple integer counter we were protecting access to a std:: string , and appending parts on the end .
Appending to a string might have to allocate memory , and thus might throw an exception if the memory cannot be allocated .
With std::lock_guard <> this still is n't a problem — if an exception is thrown , the mutex is still unlocked .
To get the same behaviour with manual locking we have to use a catch block , as shown below :
std::mutex m ; std::string s ; void append_with_lock_guard( std::string const& extra ) { std::lock_guard<std::mutex > lk(m ) ; s+=extra ; } void append_with_manual_lock ( std::string const& extra ) { m.lock ( ) ; try { s+=extra ; m.unlock ( ) ; } catch ( ... ) { m.unlock ( ) ; throw ; } }
If you had to do this for every function which might throw an exception it would quickly get unwieldy .
Of course , you still need to ensure that the code is exception - safe in general — it 's no use automatically unlocking the mutex if the protected data is left in a state of disarray .
Next time
Next time we 'll take a look at the std::unique_lock <> template , which provides more options than std::lock_guard <> .

The Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , introduced Mr. Geithner , making the case that “ he understands the enormity ” of the financial crisis in a booming voice that contrasted with Mr. Geithner ’s initially nervous start .
Mr. Geithner , gaining some confidence , delivered his remarks in simple sentences using a teleprompter , suggesting the importance of communicating a complex issue both to markets and to taxpayers who are reluctantly financing the bailout .
Mr. Paulson was widely criticized as being inarticulate and faulted for sending mixed signals that occasionally disturbed markets and investors .
In his testimony , Mr. Geithner acknowledged that he risked criticism for not providing more details .
He told senators that he wanted to address the public ’s desire for a clearer idea of the new administration ’s thinking but that he wanted to get the details right — and not repeat what he has called “ the zigs and zags ” and mistakes of the past .
Among those was Mr. Paulson ’s redefinition of the bailout program after he had sold it to Congress , a shift that unsettled financial markets further .
Mr. Geithner did not specify that episode and otherwise has declined to criticize the predecessor with whom he worked .
Instead , he has come in for blame as well , both for his role in the miscalculations of the initial efforts and , at the New York Fed , for being complicit in failing to counter abuses that gave rise to the credit crisis .
In his speech , he acknowledged the criticism .
“ Policy was always behind the curve , always chasing the escalating crisis , ” he said , adding that the first effort had proven “ inadequate . ”
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama , the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , told Mr. Geithner that he and other regulators “ failed the American people . ”
The Pentagon is pioneering micro technology for just about every device , from 10g video cameras to tiny atomic clocks on a chip
Would n't it be handy if everything we needed to build the next generation of portable devices and robots were available on a microchip ?
You could just plug in a navigation system , a radar sensor , cryogenic cooling system , or even a miniature power unit .
For laboratory applications , there would be micro versions of everything from mass spectrometers to magnetic sensors .
The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) , the Pentagon 's extreme science wing , aims to provide all this , and more , in handy " matchbook size " electronic packages .
Forty years ago , Gordon Moore , the co-founder of Intel , accurately predicted that the cost of processing power would halve every two years .
We have come to expect devices to get smaller , cheaper and more powerful over time .
Now the revolution is spreading to other types of device .
The development of mems ( microelectromechanical systems ) has already paved the way for " lab - on - a- chip " chemical analysis .
Such breakthroughs tend to come from the military rather than industry .
" Darpa was instrumental in helping support much of the initial development of lab - on - a- chip in the early 90s , " says Jon Cooper , Wolfson chair of bioengineering at the University of Glasgow .
" The technologies enabled a number of US startup companies to develop miniaturised chips for faster biological analysis , giving them the necessary long - term support to grow . "
Cool runnings
Now Darpa is miniaturising many new devices .
Some electronics require very low temperatures , such as superconducting circuits and infra-red sensors , and the entire component is chilled by a bulky cooling system .
The low - power micro-cryogenic cooler program will cool only the exact spot needed .
The key element is a " micro - machined thermal isolation structure " , a tiny deep - freeze made of bismuth telluride .
This cools by the thermoelectric effect when a current is applied .
The micro-cooler will chill a space of about four cubic centimetres down to 200 degrees below zero , using just 0.1 watts .
Lab - on - a - chip devices already use pumps to move gas or liquid .
But these pumps are not able to maintain the " hard " vacuum required for devices such as mass detectors for analysing airborne chemicals and bolometers to measure irradiation .
The chip - scale vacuum micropumps program aims to produce pumps capable of producing a pressure of one millionth of an atmosphere .
Some items are for specific applications .
Microsensors for imaging will deliver an infrared video camera on a chip weighing just 10g ; this is specifically for uncrewed aircraft and night - vision goggles .
But most of the technology will simply be made available to industry for use in future military electronics .
Other programs include an atomic clock on a chip , radar on a chip , gas analysers and other sensors , radio - frequency and photonic devices .
Some would have multiple uses , such as the chip - scale atomic sensors program .
These tiny , high - resolution sensors can be reconfigured instantly to measure temperature , pressure , magnetic fields or other environmental factors .
It 's an ambitious program , but the US defence sector has a record of getting the microtechnology it needs .
In recent years , the possibility of bioterrorism prompted Darpa to provide chip - based analytical tools for homeland security .
Cooper cites several developments , including advances in rapid polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) used to analyse DNA .
This technology now has a much wider use in diagnosing infectious diseases .
However , chip - based does n't always mean portable .
" The concept of lab - on - a - chip is of an analytical system which benefits from its reduced size , although many instruments are chips - in - a - lab , rather than labs - on - a- chip , " says Cooper .
" Often the instrument needs to be plugged into the mains . "
" Truly handheld lab - on - a - chip technology is still elusive , " agrees Matt Mowlem of the National Oceanography Centre at Southampton .
" Building stand - alone systems requires integrated systems and solutions to the problematic engineering issues surrounding system design , interconnects between the chips and off - chip systems , packaging and support systems , etc . "
But Darpa wants it all to be self - contained , enthusing in budget documents about " matchbook - size , highly integrated device and micro- system architectures " , including " low - power , small - volume , lightweight microsensors , microrobots and microcommunication systems " .
Much of the effort is to integrate different components so that " electronic , mechanical , fluidic , photonic and radio / microwave technologies " all work together on the same chip .
Socket to 'em
Then there is the need to plug into that wall socket .
Darpa is addressing the need for mobile power with tiny heat engines and devices that scavenge energy from the environment .
Being military , it also walks where others fear to tread .
The micro isotope power source is a tiny atomic battery , occupying less than a cubic centimetre and generating 35 milliwatts .
Industrial funding is limited .
Darpa , which is not looking for profit , can sink money into unlikely schemes .
" As with all blue - sky research there is a high risk of failure , " says Mowlem , " but a small chance of a world - changing discovery . "
Darpa is not afraid of failure , and has its eye on world - changing success .
After all , it did invent the internet .
Sean Avery has screwed the pooch almost everywhere he 's been , and it 's usually messy .
Last night , Avery 's out - of - control ways worked to New York 's detriment , as the Caps brushed him aside with unconcerned poise , aided by the cockiness of a leading superstar who made his presence known at the Rangers ' morning skate .
Sean
Avery wanted to come out and show who " Sean Avery " was , a flaming hot - head .
Instead , the fashionista stumbled down the runway like his dress was on too tight .
It started in the second period when Avery allowed himself to be goaded into a roughing penalty by John Erskine .
The Caps defenseman dealt with the type A by letting him play into his hands , and not the other way around .
Avery then exploded with four more penalties .
Two minutes for high - sticking , two for goaltender interference , two for roughing again , and capping the game with a 10 - minute misconduct , Avery headed to the showers early .
Avery 's final transgression involved him getting into the face of Simeon Varlamov with a slobbering mess of mouth - piece , teeth , and least of all , words .
The slick Russian goalie played it off as if ignoring a child , probably not understanding what the rabid Canadian was saying anyway .
The man with his own rule got in a parting cheap shot on Varlamov , which triggered the 10 - minute misconduct , but it was too late .
The 20 - year old , groomed in the land of vodka and iron curtains , proved to be an Avery - proof goalie , blanking the boys in blue .
Avery should consider last night an open invitation for his continued idiocy .
The refs will be watching him , as usual , and the Caps could care less -- their mission of rocking the red is much more important than the sloppy antics of a red - faced jerk .

It is fatherhood that makes childhood possible .

A judge will try a divorce case in the morning and place the
children in the mother ’s custody .
He will try a criminal case in
the afternoon and send a man to prison for robbing a liquor store .
The chances are three out of four that the criminal he sends to
prison grew up in a female headed household just like the one he
himself created that morning when he tried the divorce case . [ 1 ]
He
ca n’t see any connection between the two cases .
The time lag
prevents him : the kids he placed in the mother ’s custody were
toddlers and the criminal he sent to prison was in his teens or
twenties .
Toddlers do n’t rob liquor stores .
Besides , most fatherless boys do n’t grow up to rob liquor
stores and most fatherless girls do n’t grow up to breed
illegitimate children .
Therefore what ?
Therefore the legal
policy of giving custody to mothers is OK ?
Therefore we can ignore
the increased probability that fatherlessness will create
delinquency ?
This is the “ safe drunk driver argument . ”
Most drunk drivers
do n’t get in accidents .
They get home safely and sleep it off .
Therefore drunk driving is OK .
It ’s not OK .
And exiling fathers from families is not OK .
The fact that will not go away is stated by sociologist David
Popenoe in his book Life Without Father :
The negative consequences of fatherlessness are all around us .
They affect children , women , and men .
Evidence indicating
damage to children has accumulated in near tidal - wave
proportions .
Fatherless children experience significantly
more physical , emotional , and behavioral problems than do
children growing up in intact families .
Why do Judges routinely award custody of children to mothers
when they try a divorce case ?
Two reasons .
The first is that
motherhood is more solidly based in biology .
Motherhood is a
biological fact , as Margaret Mead says , fatherhood merely a social
invention .
Mammals and motherhood originated two hundred million
years ago , when the dinosaurs were young .
Fatherhood in the sense
of major male participation in reproduction is , from the point of
view of evolution , a recent development .
Fatherhood in the sense
of male headship of the stable patriarchal families which make
civilization possible is only about five thousand years old , as
feminist Dr. Gerda Lerner has shown in her book The Creation of
Patriarchy .
Prior to the Patriarchal Revolution human reproduction
followed the ghetto pattern , where the mother was the primary
parent , and the father was a mere boyfriend who could be discarded
when the mother got tired of him .
The second reason why judges favor mother custody is their
recognition that women and children are dependent creatures .
This
was formerly understood to mean they needed husbands and fathers .
But husbands and fathers require authority if they are to function
as providers and protectors .
( “ He shall rule over thee , ” God says
to Eve , Genesis 3:16 . )
Without the sexual loyalty of wives there
can be no family .
Patriarchal civilization depends on female
chastity .
Without it men cannot have families and children cannot
have fathers .
This is the hitch , the reason we have a feminist revolution :
Females dislike sexual regulation .
Feminists say “ A woman needs
a man like a fish needs a bicycle , ” “ A woman has a sacred right
to control her own sexuality , ” “ End human sacrifice !
Do n’t get
married ! ” Women ’s primary object , according to feminist Anne
Donchin , is to create a society in which “ women can shape their
reproductive experiences to further ends of their own choosing . ”
This is the feminist program .
It ’s succeeding .
Marriage is
becoming meaningless .
“ Family law , ” says Brenda Hoggett , former
British law commissioner responsible for family law ,
no longer makes any attempt to buttress the stability of
marriage or any other union .
It has adopted principles for
the protection of children and dependent spouses which could
be made equally applicable to the unmarried .
In such
circumstances , the piecemeal erosion of the distinction
between marriage and non-married cohabitation may be expected
to continue .
Logically we have already reached a point at
which , rather than discussing which remedies should now be
extended to the unmarried , we should be considering whether
the legal institution of marriage continues to serve any
useful purpose .
The emphasized sentence means marriage no longer grants the husband
any rights whatever–only the obligation of giving up his children
and accepting slavery –laboring for the benefit of another person ,
his ex-wife .
( Or equally his ex-girlfriend , since marriage makes
no difference . )
“ The courts have abandoned , ” says Ms. Hoggett ,
the concept of breach of matrimonial obligations–and their
powers of adjustment of property interests in the long term
are now so extensive that ordering one spouse from his own
home no longer seems so drastic .
Far from ordering spouses
to stay together , courts are increasingly able and willing to
help them separate .
This is the female kinship system , matriarchy , the condition of
the ghettos–made tolerable for the female by the male ’s acceptance
of slavery .
A Georgia judge named Robert Noland shows how the legal system
thinks : “ I ai n’t never seen a calf following a bull .
They always
follow the cow .
So I always give custody to the mammas . ”
The
reason Judge Noland never saw a calf following a bull is that
cattle do n’t live in two - parent households .
If we want to live
like cattle , Judge Noland has the right idea .
But human beings
differ from cattle and the difference is created by fathers .
A green turtle–a reptile–begins its existence as an egg and
never learns it has a mother or a father .
Its mother ’s
participation in its existence consists of conceiving and gestating
it and burying the resulting egg in the sand .
After remaining
there and maturing awhile , it emerges from the sand and waddles
down to the water to find a meal–or to become a meal for some
other creature .
It is self contained and lives on its own
inherited resources or it dies .
Mammals came into existence during the Age of Reptiles .
Mammalian mothers cherish their young , feed them from their own
body , protect them , educate them .
If you have a cat with kittens
you can witness how mammalian motherhood works –how meaningful
motherhood is , and how irrelevant merely biological fatherhood is
once the father has performed his minuscule sexual function .
Motherhood enables the kitten to have an infancy .
This is the
relationship which Judge Noland understands and seeks to preserve
by awarding custody to mothers .
The kitten has no childhood .
After a rather short period of
helpless infancy , the kitten is almost suddenly a mature adult
capable of fending for itself like the baby turtle after it emerges
from its egg .
It was John Fiske , the nineteenth century American historian
and philosopher , who pointed out what made human beings special –
and more successful than other mammals : the prolongation not only
of infancy , but the creation of a whole additional era of life ,
childhood , something unknown in any other species–so that human
children can enjoy an enormously long period during which they are
protected , cherished , educable , playful , exploratory , sensitive and
aware , a period during which they can reach out and learn about and
come to love the world they live in .
It is fatherhood which makes childhood possible .
It is father
absence which creates ghettos and gangs and messed - up kids–boys
trying to find their identity through violence , girls trying to
find their identity through sexual promiscuity , which will lead to
the violence of the next generation .
They need real fathers ,
“ sociological fathers , ” not mere studs interested in sharing a one -
night stand with Mom .
Sociological fatherhood is real fatherhood ,
as Margaret Mead says , “ a social invention . ”
In the ghettos the
biological fathers are seldom sociological fathers .
They are n’t
good for much because Mom ’s sexual disloyalty denies them the role
of sociological fatherhood .
Lawmakers and politicians do n’t
understand what Margaret Mead tells them , that fatherhood is a
social invention , that it must be created and maintained by
society .
They suppose , as Judge Robert Noland supposes , that
humans can live like cattle , without fathers .
Until lawmakers and
judges see that they must support the father ’s role because it is
the weak link in the family we will have more matriarchy–along
with its familiar accompaniments : crime , educational failure ,
illegitimacy , teen suicide , gangs and the rest .

Caroline Kennedy was reportedly among the list of vetoed candidates
The Vatican has rejected at least three possible candidates proposed by Barack Obama to serve as US ambassador to the Holy See , say reliable sources in Rome .
None of the three candidates informally proposed by the Obama administration so far is acceptable to the Pope because of their support for abortion rights .
One of the potential nominees vetoed by the Vatican is Caroline Kennedy , daughter of the former US president .
Conservative Catholics in the US had already criticised her candidacy .
They say her outspoken pro-choice views on abortion made her an unsuitable choice .
The Vatican is unhappy about President Obama 's support of abortion rights and his lifting of a previous ban on embryonic stem cell research in the US .
The Vatican spokesman , Father Federico Lombardi , has described media speculation about the selection of the next US ambassador to the Holy See as " unreliable " .
He said that no names have yet been officially submitted to Rome by the Obama administration .
And a US official repeated the standard administration position that the White House has not announced any names for ambassadorial candidates to the Vatican .
However , the BBC's David Willey in Rome says that even the informal dismissal by the Vatican of the first names whispered in confidence within the Obama inner circle is a sign that choppy waters may lie ahead in official US - Vatican relations .
The White House may be running out of time to find a suitable future American envoy to the Pope before President Obama travels to Italy in July , when he is expected to meet Pope Benedict XVI for the first time , before or after attending a G8 summit to be held in Sardinia .
Since the US established formal diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1984 , the ambassadorial post has always been held by pro-life Catholics under both Republican and Democrat administrations .
The ambassador will replace Mary Ann Glendon , a Harvard University professor who held the post during George W Bush 's presidency .

Whether you are a newcomer to the field of SEO , or have been doing this for years , chances are that you occasionally fall into one of the 12 most common mistakes that are made in the effort to gain rank in search .
Based on the mistakes we ’ve made in the past , and mistakes we see others making , we ’ve compiled this list to help us all become better at SEO by avoiding the common pitfalls .
1 – Keyword Stuffing
It ’s hard to believe people are still doing this , but it happens .
When a page does n’t rank naturally high for a keyword they will often try and stuff keywords into the page to make it rank higher .
Not only does this not work , but it also makes your content fall to near worthless .
2 – Repetitive Keyword Targeting
So you ’re not stuffing the keywords into your content , but are you targeting the same keyword on every page ?
Avoid using the same keywords over and over for multiple pages throughout your site .
Focus on creating content that matches your subject matter and target audience and forget about trying to rig the search engines – jus to follow good SEO practices and let your quality content do the rest !
3 – Blocking Bots
It ’s hard to rank when you are blocking the very guys who are trying to rank you !
Instead of blocking off parts of your site to content that might not be 100 % up to snuff , use nofollow tags for the links to alert the search engine bots that you do n’t think the content is worthy .
4 – Not Using XML Sitemaps
Every search engine worth talking about uses XML sitemaps nowadays , so you need to make sure that you provide one and that it is updated with every change to your site .
It ’s a great way to get noticed and get ranked with little effort .
5 – Thinking Google is the Only Game in Town
So many people fall into the trap of thinking that Google is the only search engine in town .
Just think about it – if you could increase your traffic from Live Search by 15 % how much would that add to the bottom line ?
Get your site registered for the webmaster tools from the other big search engines such as Yahoo and MSN .
6 – Avoiding Google Webmaster Tools
Remember , we did n’t say ignore Google !
Make sure you get registered with Google webmaster tools if for no other reason than to get some really good data about what is working and what is n’t with your site and keywords .
7 – Falling into the DoFollow Trap
Way too many sites are chasing after blogs and other sites that always follow links .
Of course , we all know what happens to content that is linked like this – it becomes another link farm and your site will suffer the consequences .
8 – Submitting Articles for Links
It ’s great to be known as the expert in something and have your articles linked to and features on prominent sites .
It ’s another thing to submit the same content to sites over and over again .
The search engines devalue content that is found all over the place .
Remember your best content should always be on your site – and when you do submit content to other sites chose sites that are worthy of the value your content provides .
9 – Placing too much Faith in Google ’s Link Command
I ca n’t tell you how many people that rely on the Google link command as the authority of what is linking to and what is n’t for their site .
While it ’s a useful tool , it should n’t be thought of as more than just a tool – not the final authority .
10 – Blocking Bots from Duplicate Content
This falls in line with # 3 , with a twist .
People are often afraid that duplicate content is the worse things they can have .
While it ’s true that it can cause a penalty in rankings , blocking bots is likely to do more harm than good .
Consider instead using 301 redirects for such content .
11 – Splitting Content

Ballmer critiques Apple : “ $ 500 more to get a logo ”
When the economy is down , the gloves come off , and we ’ve always suspected Steve Ballmer harbored deep - seated grudges about the perceived value of a partially - eaten apple .
The Microsoft CEO struck out at Apple during a conference in New York this week , describing the company ’s products as “ $ 500 more to get a logo ” .
“ Apple gained about one point , but now I think the tide has really turned back the other direction .
The economy is helpful .
Paying an extra $ 500 for a computer in this environment — same piece of hardware — paying $ 500 more to get a logo on it ?
I think that ’s a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be ” Steve Ballmer , CEO , Microsoft
The comment came in response to a question regarding Apple ’s momentum in the desktop and notebook computer market , which prompted Ballmer to highlight a recent report that suggested the Cupertino company had seen its market - share drop .
Ballmer was then asked whether he or his family own any Apple products , to which he explained to the audience that he was particularly brand - loyal .
Writing off Apple ’s appeal as merely a logo choice seems a little short - sighted , what with the significant difference these days being the software – i.e. OS X versus Windows – rather than the hardware .
While most are used to Ballmer ’s outspoken comments , the tension between Apple - lovers and Microsoft - fans means it ’s likely to restart old arguments about differences between the two companies .

For quite a few years now , Apple has offered an educational desktop machine at a lower price point than the rest of its desktop line .
That machine was first the eMac , followed by the 17 - inch iMac , but now there 's a new educational model in town .
Apple has quietly announced ( PDF ) that it has replaced the 17 - inch polycarbonate education iMac with a new , low - end 20 - inch aluminum model , marking the end of the polycarbonate iMac case .
Previously , Apple was offering educational institutions the 17 - inch iMac model for the same $ 899 price , so the switch is a nice upgrade .
The new model includes a 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo processor , 1GB of RAM , a 160GB hard drive , a SuperDrive , and the NVIDIA 9400 M graphics package .
All in all , not a bad deal for nine Franklins .
The new educational iMacs are supposed to ship in about four weeks , but even if you want to just order one now , they 're pretty hard to get .
The low - end 20 - incher is n't currently available to individual students or educational buyers , so you may need to make friends with your institutional buyer if you want to get your hands on one ( an iMac , that is ) .
Focusing on the Big Stuff
There 's so much movement on the torture front these days that it 's hard to keep track .
It also can be hard to distinguish between what has long - term significance and what does n't .
A big media focus today is on whether President Obama 's reversed himself on Tuesday when he said he is not opposed to some " further accounting of what took place during this period " and said he could not rule out criminal prosecution for senior officials .
There 's also a lot of attention on whether Obama has lost control of the message .
No one will remember either of these issues a few days from now .
What is significant , however , is that the idea of launching some sort of investigation into torture and other abuses committed by the Bush administration is now very much back on the national agenda .
So which way should we go ?
It 's an exciting debate we have ahead of us .
Also significant is yesterday 's release of a new official timeline establishing that waterboarding , which is nearly universally considered to be torture , was explicitly approved by senior White House officials in the summer of 2002 .
But to me , the most significant news of the day can be found on today 's New York Times op - ed page , where former FBI supervisor Ali Soufan persuasively and memorably rebuts the misinformation being spread by those complicit in torture .
A question from a reader in my live chat yesterday helped me clarify my own response to the dead - enders , led by former vice president Dick Cheney , who insist that what they call " enhanced interrogation techniques " averted further terrorist attacks .
The point is this :
Any assertions from these people should presumptively be considered misinformation .
These are the same people who lied to us over and over again about the reasons for going to war , about the war , about our entire detainee policy ( remember : " we do n't torture " ? ) -- and about who was responsible for the endemic abuse .
As most of us recoiled with horror over the soulessnes of the legal memos released last week and their repulsive attempts to rationalize the indefensible , it was easy to overlook how much of what the lawyers said they 'd been told by the CIA was lies .
Among the many lies that jumped out for me , but has n't gotten attention , was the CIA 's assurance to Justice Department lawyers , quoted in the August 1 , 2002 , memo that Abu Zubaida , the first detainee to be tortured by direct order of the White House , was mentally healthy enough to be able to withstand waterboarding and the like without any long - term mental health effects .
Here 's what the memo said , documenting the CIA 's recitation of facts : " Through reading his diaries and interviewing him , you have found no history of ' mood disturbance or other psychiatric pathology [ , ] ' ' thought disorder [ , ] ... enduring mood or mental health problems . '
He is in fact ' remarkably resilient and confident that he can overcome adversity . ' "
And yet , according to investigative reporter Ron Suskind , in his book The One Percent Doctrine , Zubaida was overtly mentally ill .
In fact , in that diary the CIA mentioned , Zubaida " wrote of his exploits in the voice of three people : Hani 1 , Hani 2 , and Hani 3 " -- a boy , a young man and a middle - aged man , Suskind wrote .
He also quoted the FBI 's top al Qaeda analyst as saying : " This guy is insane , certifiable , split personality . "
Anyhow , so along comes Soufan , who shares his first - hand knowledge of the interrogations .
" One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based , " he writes .
The first , dated August 2002 , grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high - ranking terrorist , Abu Zubaydah , on the grounds that previous methods had n't been working .
The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use .
" It is inaccurate , however , to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative .
Along with another F.B.I. agent , and with several C.I.A. officers present , I questioned him from March to June 2002 , before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August .
Under traditional interrogation methods , he provided us with important actionable intelligence .....
" There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that was n't , or could n't have been , gained from regular tactics .
In addition , I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions — all of which are still classified .
The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods , the nature of the threat , the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists , and due process .
" Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al - Shibh , a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , and [ Jose ] Padilla .
This is false .
The information that led to Mr. Shibh 's capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods .
As for Mr. Padilla , the dates just do n't add up : the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002 , Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May . "
Soufan concludes : " It was the right decision to release these memos , as we need the truth to come out .
This should not be a partisan matter , because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world 's foremost defenders of human rights .
Just as important , releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice . "
Scott Shane writes in the New York Times : " Senior Bush administration officials , led by Vice President Dick Cheney and cheered by many Congressional Republicans , are fighting a rear - guard action in defense of their record .
Only by using the harshest methods , they insist , did the intelligence agency get the information it needed to round up Qaeda killers and save thousands of American lives .
" Even President Obama 's new director of national intelligence , Dennis C. Blair , wrote in a memorandum to his staff last week that ' high value information came from interrogations in which these methods were used , ' an assertion left out when the memorandum was edited for public release .
By contrast , Mr. Obama and most of his top aides have argued that the use of those methods betrayed American values — and anyway , produced unreliable information .
Those are a convenient pair of opinions , of course : the moral balancing would be far trickier if the C.I.A. methods were demonstrated to have been crucial in disrupting major plots . "
I disagree :
The moral balancing is n't the least bit tricky if torture did n't work .
In fact , in that case , there 's no argument at all .
Even if it did " work , " of course , there are plenty of reasons to oppose it .
But this is why Cheney is trying so desperately to keep his argument alive ; if he concedes it , it would be like forfeiting the whole game .
Shane also points out , by the way , that the CIA apparently did n't give traditional interrogation much if any time to work on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
" The memorandum says that ' before the C.I.A. used enhanced techniques , ' Mr. Mohammed ' resisted giving any answers to questions about future attacks , ' Simply noting , " Soon , you will know . " '
" But the same memorandum reveals in a footnote that Mr. Mohammed , captured on March 1 , 2003 , was waterboarded 183 times that month .
That striking number , which would average out to six waterboardings a day , suggests that interrogators did not try a traditional , rapport - building approach for long before escalating to their most extreme tool . "
Meanwhile , R. Jeffrey Smith and Peter Finn write in The Washington Post about a new timeline released by the Senate intelligence committee last night .
" Condoleezza Rice , John D. Ashcroft and other top Bush administration officials approved as early as the summer of 2002 the CIA 's use of harsh interrogation methods on detainees at secret prisons , including waterboarding ...
" At a time when the Justice Department is deciding whether former officials who set interrogation policy or formulated the legal justifications for it should be investigated for possible crimes , the new timeline lists at least a dozen members of the Bush administration who were present when the CIA 's director or others explained exactly which questioning techniques were to be used and how those sessions proceeded ....
" After the leak in 2005 of a Justice Department memo that narrowly defined the type of activity that would constitute torture , Rice traveled to Europe in an effort to quell the international uproar .
As her trip was getting underway , she said : ' The United States government does not authorize or condone torture of detainees .
Torture , and conspiracy to commit torture , are crimes under U.S. law , wherever they may occur in the world . ' "
And there 's an awful lot being written on how all this effects Obama .
Dan Balz and Perry Bacon Jr. write in The Washington Post : " The legacy of George W. Bush continued to dog President Obama and his administration yesterday , as Congress divided over creating a panel to investigate the harsh interrogation techniques employed under Bush 's authorization and the White House tried to contain the controversy over the president 's decision to release Justice Department memos justifying and outlining those procedures ....
" Obama has drawn sharp criticism from former vice president Richard B. Cheney , former CIA directors and Republican elected officials for releasing the memos .
Those critics see softness in the commander in chief .
He faces equally strong reaction from the left , where there is a desire to punish Bush administration officials for their actions and to conduct a more thorough investigation of what happened .....
" Obama apparently believed he could avoid what is now playing out . "
But now , Obama and his aides " have been drawn into a debate they did not foresee .
The president has a full plate , domestically and internationally .
He had hoped that , in winning the election and moving quickly to change his predecessor 's policies , he could close the books on Bush 's presidency .
" Instead , he has found in his first months how difficult that is .
Hopes for an immediate change in tone have withered .
Republican opposition to his economic policies remains nearly unanimous .
With this latest controversy , he is learning that neither the opponents nor the defenders of Bush 's presidency are ready to move on . "
John Dickerson writes for Slate : " It may be time for an Obama do - over speech on the issue of torture .
It 's a form we 've come to recognize — whether on the issue of bonuses for AIG executives or his relationship with his former pastor .
He makes a declaration , the issue gets away from him , the political pressure builds , and he must rush in with a new declaration to contain the fallout . "
Howard Fineman writes for Newsweek : " His response has been halting and hesitant .
His message has been uncharacteristically muddied .
And he is paying the price , at least in terms of message control . "
Howard Kurtz writes for The Washington Post : " President Obama , who has called for looking forward , not backward , now finds himself in the situation he had hoped to avoid .
By first ruling out and then opening the door to prosecuting officials from the previous administration , Obama has triggered political passions on both sides .
At a time when his focus ought to be on the moribund banking system and the ailing economy , he has unleashed a furious debate about the past . "
Sam Youngman writes for the Hill : " The day after opening a can of worms by saying he is open to a truth commission to investigate the authors of the controversial Bush - era enhanced interrogation memos , the White House stressed Wednesday that President Obama is neither proposing nor initiating those proceedings or the formation of a truth commission .
" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as the president traveled to Iowa , said any decision to prosecute the authors of the legal memos would come from the Justice Department and ' it has to be done outside of the realm of politics . ' "
Stephen Collinson writes for AFP : " Gibbs said flatly that a flurry of news reports proclaiming the administration had switched course on delving further into those behind methods like near drowning , or waterboarding , were wrong ....
" The spokesman also rejected calls by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) for the appointment of an independent prosecutor to probe the torture issue .
" ' The lawyers that are involved are plenty capable of determining whether any law has been broken , ' Gibbs said . "
For what it 's worth , I have a fairly benign explanation for the ostensible reversal , as I articulated yesterday in my live chat .
Here 's my guess .
Obama has no appetite for " looking backward " as he has so much on his plate " looking forward . "
So he was never going to be the guy pushing for an investigation .
On the other hand , he was n't going to be the guy who actually blocked an investigation , either .
He thought he had found an acceptable compromise by releasing memos he was indeed morally bound to release , while making clear that the front - line guys who did what they were told was legal would n't be prosecuted .
This was clever because the advocates of prosecution are focusing their efforts much higher up the chain of command .
Then , I think , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel stepped on it .
His statement on a Sunday talk show indicated that all prosecutions were off the table .
Not only was that not Obama 's view , but it's not the White House 's call to make .
It 's the Justice Department's .
Then Gibbs , who lest we forget reports to Obama through Emanuel , chose not to disagree publicly with his boss .
At that point , Obama had no choice but to clarify a position that he had been trying to leave vague .
Meanwhile , Sam Stein writes for Huffingtonpost.com : " The central debate dominating discussions of a possible investigation into torture by the Bush administration seems to have shifted sharply in the past few days : from whether such an investigation should take place , to now what form it will have when it comes . "
So what are the options ?
There 's remarkably little discussion of that in the mainstream press .
Although CQ notes that " Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy said Wednesday that if Republicans do not back an independent commission to investigate the George W. Bush administration 's detainee interrogation program , he will launch a committee probe .
" ' If we can't get a bipartisan commission to do this then we 'll do it in the usual way , ' Leahy said . "
The New York Times editorial board writes : " When he was vice president , Dick Cheney never acknowledged the public 's right to know anything .
Now , suddenly , he has the full disclosure bug ....
" Mr. Cheney claims that the waterboarding saved thousands of lives .
Most accounts that do n't come from officials involved in the formation of those policies suggest that that is not the case .
The question needs to be answered so Americans can decide if they want to buy into Mr. Cheney 's view that the ends always justify such barbaric means . "
Gary Kamiya writes for Salon that torture can work -- but is still always wrong .
The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes : " Mark down the date .
Tuesday , April 21 , 2009 , is the moment that any chance of a new era of bipartisan respect in Washington ended .
By inviting the prosecution of Bush officials for their antiterror legal advice , President Obama has injected a poison into our politics that he and the country will live to regret . "
And CNN host Ed Schultz , via Daily Kos , argues : " I think that Dick Cheney wants this country to get hit again for political gain ... I think Cheney is that mean . "
Reporter jumps ropeline after signing
A reporter was escorted out of a White House event by Secret Service agents on Wednesday afternoon after he approached President Obama to seek an autograph .
At the end of an East Room signing ceremony for legislation funding the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , an unidentified member of the media jumped the rope penning off reporters from invited guests in an apparent attempt to get Obama 's autograph , according to a White House aide .

Secret Service agents swooped in and stopped him .
The Obama aide said the man was held by Secret Service — but he was later seen in the White House press briefing room under escort of a White House press aide , apparently to retrieve personal belongings and make his way out of the complex .
Secret Service agents were later seen examining the journalist 's drivers ' license , which suggests he was not a holder of a so - called hard pass , which are given to journalists permanently cleared to enter the White House complex .
The reporter also had a black briefcase with him .
There are no details yet on the reporter 's name or publication .

Energy Efficiency Could Save Us $ 168 Billion
March 23rd , 2009 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
Energy efficiency initiatives that reduce electricity and gas usage could save consumers and businesses up to $ 168 billion , says the American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy ( ACEEE ) .
The report comes on the heels of the Campaign for an Energy - Efficient America : a group of business leaders , industry groups , and environmental advocates calling on Congress to enact a federal energy efficiency target .
“ Energy efficiency is one of the most effective ways to address our nation ’s energy and climate challenges while creating jobs and saving Americans money , ” stated Steven Nadel , Executive Director of ACEEE .
“ In these difficult economic times , investment in energy efficiency makes more sense than ever and should be a top priority for our nation ’s leaders . ”
ACEEE ’s report , Laying the Foundation for Implementing a Federal Energy Efficiency Resource Standard , analyzes both 2008 economic and energy data .
If a federal energy efficiency resource standard ( EERS ) were adopted , one that demanded a electricity reduction of 15 - percent and a natural gas reduction of 10 - percent , 262 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions could be prevented .
That is the equivalent of taking 48 million cars off the road for one year .
Other benefits include 220,000 net permanent jobs and 390 power plants that wo n’t need to be built .
The Campaign for an Energy - Efficient America supports a federal EERS , included in both House and Senate versions ( H.R. 889 and S. 548 ) of the Save American Energy Act , introduced by Rep. Edward Markey ( D - MA ) and Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D - NY ) .
“ As this coalition shows , the idea of a national energy efficiency standard draws support from a wide range of business and environmental groups in order to save money for consumers , create long - term jobs that cannot be outsourced , and reduce greenhouse gas emissions , ” said Reid Detchon , Executive Director of the Energy Future Coalition , a nonpartisan public policy initiative that seeks to speed the transition to a new energy economy .
Currently 19 states have adopted individual EERS programs , but the real potential comes from a federal implementation .
ACEEE analyzed the benefits of a federal EERS for each state by 2020 .
For example :
Florida will create more than 19,500 new jobs and save $ 14 billion in energy costs .
Illinois will create more than 6,500 new jobs and save $ 3.6 billion in energy costs .
Indiana will create more than 5,000 new jobs and save $ 3.6 billion in energy costs .
North Carolina will create nearly 6,500 new jobs and save $ 3 billion in energy costs .
Tennessee will create more than 5,000 new jobs and save $ 3.5 billion on energy costs .

What is it with Amazon , anyway ?
Why does n't it seal the deal by making the Kindle look stunning and sleek ?
The Kindle 2 is better than the original , but it still looks like it was designed by the makers of the Commodore 64 .
Second , the Sony Reader 700 has two things many people sorely wish the Kindle had : a touch screen , which lets you turn pages by swiping your finger , and built - in illumination , so you can read in the dark .
( The Kindle screen requires external light to read -- like a book . )
So it 's a total Kindle - killer , right ?
Actually , not in the least .
The beauty of the E - Ink screen on both the Kindle and the Reader is that it simulates the look of ink on paper .
The black particles that form the images on the page are right there on the surface of the glass , as though printed there ; it 's extremely satisfying to read at long stretches .
But in order to add the touch screen and the lighting , Sony had to add new layers on top of that screen -- and it totally ruined the effect .
Now you 're painfully aware that you 're looking at the words through a couple of transparent layers , and contrast suffers as a result ; worse , the touchscreen layer introduces an annoying reflective glare that 's almost impossible to eliminate in any light .
It 's deeply frustrating .
Now , let me hasten to point out that the 700's touchscreen and side lighting are n't mandatory .
Sony sells a $ 300 model , the 505 , without these elements .
A Sony rep explains that on this model , " the screen resolution and lack of back light allow for comfortable , long - form reading ; the 700 is designed more for interactive reading -- searching , jumping around in the text , highlighting and taking notes . "

Oh , suh -nap !
Hillary caused a little damage to the Nation of Dick .
Looks like he just got owned by a giiiirl :
I am watching SOS Hillary Clinton 's testimony to the House Foreign Affairs committee on CNN.com whereupon some Republican congressman ( Dana Rohrabacher ) asked about the wisdom in releasing the torture memos , and went on to quote Dick Cheney 's statement to Fox News that torture works to keep us safe .
He continued with Cheney 's claim that there are memos that show that torture techniques work .
Hillary abruptly cut the congressman saying acerbically : " It wo n't surprise you that I do n't consider Dick Cheney a particularly reliable source ... I believe we ought to get to the bottom of this " [...]
It shut up the guy instantly .
Here are a couple of bonus quotes , this time regarding The Marxist Commie Handshake between President Obama and Hugo Chavez :
She just right now knocked away all that silly huffing and puffing about " handshake - gate . "
She described the book gift - giving incident as a case of Hugo Chavez camera hogging , including the way he deliberately positioned the book cover so that the title would catch the camera lens .
She said : I found it all amusing ... President Obama was right ; why should we be afraid of shaking somebody 's hand ... Iran is seeking influence in our hemisphere ... we buy their ( Venezuela ) oil ... let 's see if we can turn some of this ( animosity ) around ... [ laughter ]
To another " concerned Republican " about the Hugo Chavez handshake , she just said : 8 years of isolation has n't worked .
We 've isolated him ( Hugo Chavez ) , so he 's gone elsewhere .
He 's a sociable guy , so he 's found the sorts of friends we do n't like .
Eight years of isolation has n't worked so let 's try something else .

By glazou on Wednesday 4 March 2009 , 15:09 - CSS and style - Permalink
I got this morning an interesting email .
In substance , the fallback mechanism is not enough to Web Designers because there is for instance no way you can specify - in clean CSS w/o hacks - display : table - cell for browsers that support it and something else for those that do n't support it w/o having major interactions between the two style sets ...
The question asked by the sender was " why ca n't we have something like the following ? "
if ( display table - cell )
CSS stuff here
else
CSS stuff here
endif
My first reply was of course " nah , that not CSS 's role to fix browsers ' holes " .
Thinking a bit more about it , I took it as a mental exercise :
add some controls to CSS that can filter in / out based on the availability in the current rendering engine of a ( property , value (s ) ) pair do that of course in a cross - browser JS chunk make sure that a stylesheet containing such a beast is still parsable from a CSS point of view
I took an hour to write it and I must say that even if this is probably not the kind of things one will ever use in a production environment , it 's a funny exercise .
See the test document , the test " stylesheet " and the JS code .
View the result here .
Warning , it 's a 0.1 I wrote in an hour .
Still successfully tested on IE6 , IE7 , IE8 , FF3 , Safari 4 and Opera 9 .
Under the heading of The Massed Gadgets of Auximenes , with a clarification of sorts that this was " More Furious Madness from " Pink Floyd , the band 's show at the Royal Festival Hall , London , on April 14th 1969 , saw the introduction of two new suites of music built around existing and new works : ' The Man ' and ' The Journey ' .
It also saw the newly built ( replacement ) Azimuth Co-ordinator pressed into action for the first time , to provide the audience with music and effects panned all around the venue .
Film of the rehearsals , shot by Anthony Stern , emerged a couple of years ago , and shows the band working through some aspects of these new pieces .
Sadly , he was prevented from filming the evening 's performance by venue management , and it is left to the reminiscences of people like John Baxter , who shares his memories below , that we get a glimpse at this early show ...
1969 : I 'm sixteen years old , I 've just finished playing the part of John Proctor in our school production of The Crucible and I 've just had my heart broken by Ruth Turner my girlfriend of four months who gave me the elbow .
However , salvation is at hand in the shape of Pink Floyd .
My best friend at school , Dave Stewart , has an older brother who is into all this underground music and in particular Pink Floyd , and with everyone else listening to Motown , The Equals and Amen Corner , Dave and I are listening with frightening intensity to Pink Floyd .
It is the music that defines who you are and we did n't want to be part of a crowd blindly following the herd .
Piper at the Gates of Dawn had been poured over time after time .
The lyrics were studied for their true meanings ; little did we know that Syd had a disarming way of writing so simply - how could we accept that ' Matilda Mother ' was about a mother reading stories to her children ?
Then the great news : ' The Floyd ' are to tour with something called ' The Massed Gadgets of Auximenes ' featuring the ' Azimuth Co-Ordinator ' .
Saturday job money is saved for the trip of a lifetime to see them in London , at The Royal Festival Hall , the first date of the tour .
Fifteen bob the tickets cost – 75 p to you .
The train fare from Wigan was £ 4.10 shillings ( £ 4.50 ) .
For comparative prices remember a gallon of petrol was 6 /- ( 30 p ) and a pint of beer 10d ( about 4 p ) .
The date of the concert was April 14th , right in the middle of our school holiday .
We caught a train at about 11.30 am and got to Euston Station around 2.30 pm .
Then it was on the underground to Waterloo .
Remember we were just simple Northern lads and this was only the second time I had ever been to London , and the first time on our own .
How we spent our time up to the start of the show I can't remember .
I do know we went into the Festival Hall foyer and could hear tantalising sounds of the band practising .
Now when I watch the bits of film on Youtube of the band rehearsing in The Festival Hall I do like to think that I was only the other side of the door at that precise moment in time .
We also went round the back of the hall and found the Floyd 's van , the one that later featured on the cover of ' Ummagumma ' .
Rather charmingly we wrote a fan note to them and shoved it through a ventilation slit in the side ; we never got a reply .
Gradually as the time approached the crowd began to gather .
Here were truly the ' Beautiful People ' .
We were dressed in very conservative fashion ; I think I was even wearing a tie and a brown cardigan .
Now we saw such sights as never before .
Crushed velvet , trench coats , John Lennon style ' granny glasses ' proliferated .
Then the doors were opened and were admitted .
The whole space was full of the sound of bird song to set the mood .
On stage , two stools were set in front of four mic stands .
We were sat on the side of the stage , on the balcony that offers a side view .
As the lights dimmed and the band emerged we could finally see just who was who .
Our only pictures up to now had been from the cover of ' Piper ' and , although we had worked out which one was Syd ( ! ) , the identity of the others was still a mystery .
Roger Waters was dressed in a pink vest like shirt ; David Gilmour , Rick Wright and Nick Mason were all dressed in tie - die shirts so beloved at the time .
David Gilmour ’s guitar seemed connected to a whole train of effects pedals , which trailed around behind him as he moved around the stage .
They began with ' Daybreak ' aka ' Grantchester Meadows ' .
From then on the music flowed unceasingly from piece to piece as they went through ' The Man ' suite , footsteps resounding around the hall as the ' Azimuth Co- Ordinator ' did its stuff .
Nothing in the first section was familiar to us : ' Biding My Time ' , ' Quicksilver ' , and the other tracks had n't been released yet , and it did seem to us as if there was an over reliance on the pre-recorded effects .
After the interval we were back and the first bit we recognised was ' Careful with that Axe Eugene ' , which had been released on the ' B ' side of ' Point Me At The Sky ' , although now it had become ' Beset by Creatures of the Deep ' .
Other familiar tunes began to appear , such as ' Pow R Toc H' , and then Rick climbed up to the Festival Hall organ to begin the closing organ theme from ' Saucerful of Secrets ' to bring the half to a close .
This was much better we felt .
Here the band were really playing and creating a magical atmosphere .
After a few moments they were back as Roger Waters approached the mic to announce the encore .
A strong cockney voice called out , " Do Interstellar Overdrive ! "
Whether Waters had sensed that the show had been slightly sub-standard ( in an interview later he had confessed that a friend had commented to him that it was like paying 15 bob to watch them rehearse ) and felt they had to do something to make amends or not I can't say but he responded very quickly , and announced , " This is called Interstellar Overdrive " .
Then it was back on the underground to Euston and the 11.45 pm ' milk train ' home .
We arrived back at 5.30 am .
Later , in June 1969 , we saw the Floyd at The Manchester Free Trade Hall , sat on row C in front of Rick .
In fact , the bootleg tape that now does the rounds of that show , was recorded by us .
By now more of the material embedded in the suite was familiar to us through the release of ' More ' and through performances on John Peel 's ' Top Gear ' lovingly recorded by holding a mic up to the speaker of the radio .
This show still remains the best show I ever saw the Floyd do .
The suite performance went really well and was truly polished by now ; the pieces segued from one to the other seamlessly .
An abiding memory is the link from ' Sleep ' ( Quicksilver ) into ' Nightmare ' ( Cymbaline ) .
It seemed we could hear the tune emerge minutes before it finally arrived .
Rick played trombone on ' Afternoon ' ( Biding My Time ) , then xylophone during ' Teatime ' and for part of ' Sleep ' .
At the time we were all members of The Pink Floyd Fan Club , which was run by somebody called Carol Oliver , address Randall Drive , Hornchurch .
The only missive we had ever received from this fan club included the news that the band had all been to see " 2001 - A Space Odyssey " and declared it to be " a groovy movie " .
Now here was Roger Waters breathing heavily into the mic at the start of ' Sleep ' : was this a rip off from the sequence when Dave enters the space ship through the airlock to turn HAL , the super - computer , off ?
Next time you watch the film have a listen to his tortured breathing and you 'll see what I mean .
The encore of ' Set the Controls ' was a wonderful charge through the song .
Finally Waters said , " Thank you , thank you .
Bye bye " , and they were gone .
Last night the dreaded Conficker worm finally got the update we 've been waiting for since April 1 .
But cyber Armageddon will have to wait another day .
The botnet , as predicted here , is now dedicated to spam .
( If you think that 's going to keep us from running our awesome Conficker War Room banner , you 're nuts . )
Further disappointing doomsayers , the new download – which seems to have been first spotted by Trend Micro – took place through Conficker 's longstanding peer - to - peer functionality , rather than the DNS lookups that gave us that delicious April 1 ticking clock .
Kaspersky Labs ' analysis of the new payload concludes this morning that Conficker is now serving victims a fake anti-virus product that offers to remove malware for $ 49.95 .
The worm also downloaded an existing e-mail worm called Waledac , which steals passwords and sends spam .
Both worms " are now present on infected machines as part of the gigantic botnet designed to conduct spam mailings , " Kaspersky writes .
The last thing the internet needs is more spam .
But you have to give Conficker credit for not believing its own press .
And I 'm personally grateful that it brought to mind a moment from the original Die Hard film .
" You want money ?
What kind of terrorists are you ? "

In a press release issued by Greenpeace the organization states that Sinar Mas corporation security guards “ brutally kicked and punched ” peaceful protestors in Jakarta , Indonesia on March 19th .
Greenpeace activists had chained themselves to the entrance of Sinar Mas headquarters and hung a banner labeling the corporation a ‘ Forest and Climate Criminal ’ .
“ The excessive violence today by Sinar Mas security is testament to the way this company does business .
Sinar Mas may think they are above the law , but the right to peaceful protest is enshrined in the Indonesian constitution , ” said Bustar Maitar , Greenpeace Southeast Asia , Forest campaigner .
The largest logging and palm oil company in Indonesia , Sinar Mas and its subsidiaries have been accused of numerous environmental and human rights violations .
Asian Pulp and Paper , an infamous subsiderary of Sinar Mas group , has been dropped by numerous US and Australian companies due to its environmental record .
“ [ Greenpeace ] took action today because Sinar Mas and the Indonesian Government are failing to do so .
We are facing the greatest threat to humanity – climate chaos – yet still companies like Sinar Mas continue to destroy forests and peatlands , rather than protecting them for future generations and , as is becoming increasingly clear , for climate stability , ” said Maitar .
According to Greenpeace , Sinar Mas currently owns 20,000 hectares of rainforest in Indonesia which they plan to turn into oil palm plantations .
In addition , the corporation is planning to acquire a further 1.1 million hectares in Papua New Guinea .
“ Indonesia ’s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is saying internationally that he will reduce Indonesia ’s greenhouse gas emissions , yet Sinar Mas continue their forest destruction unabated .
If he is serious about Indonesia being a global leader in solving the climate crisis , he must take immediate action to stop this company destroying Indonesia ’s greatest asset – carbon rich forests and peatland , ” urged Maitar .
Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian government to put a moratorium on all forest conversion .

Linux vendor Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) is ramping up for its next community Linux release as Fedora 11 , codenamed " Leonidas " hits its preview milestone release today -- showing off the future of Linux technologies .
Fedora 11 includes new open source technologies that accelerate the Linux desktop from a number of different perspectives .
Boot time is improved , as is device connectivity , while server - side installations will benefit from a new Linux filesystem and enhanced virtualization capabilities .
The Fedora 11 Preview milestone comes at a closely watched time in the operating system market , as Linux rival Ubuntu ramps up its efforts while Microsoft 's ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) Windows 7 nears release following Windows Vista 's lackluster reception .
" Fedora 11 preview is a snapshot of the future of Linux technologies throughout the field , " Fedora Project Leader Paul Frields told InternetNews.com .
" When you look at the virtualization or kernel features in Fedora 11 , you 'll see the sort of things that are going to be important to business users and enterprise customers down the line . "
Today 's milestone release of Fedora 11 is officially called the " Preview Release " -- the final version of Fedora 11 is currently scheduled to be available on May 26 .
" The preview release is the third in our set of test releases for Fedora 11 , it 's a way for a broader set of people to set of community members and the public to see how things are progressing , " Frields explained .
" The preview tends to be very close to our final release .
It still has some issues in it that we 're trying to resolve , but it represents our best take on what the final release will look like . "
While Red Hat is often thought of as concentrating on the enterprise server with its Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) releases , Frields argued that Fedora 11 has more of desktop focus , continuing efforts that Fedora 9 and Fedora 10 introduced to make the Linux desktop experience better for users .
Still , the agency ’s regulations would take months to write and years to become fully effective .
Meanwhile , Congress is already starting work on energy and climate legislation , though without significant guidance from the White House , at least in public .
Carol M. Browner , the White House coordinator of energy and climate policy , issued a surprisingly bland statement last week when two top House Democrats unveiled a far - reaching plan to cap greenhouse gases and move the nation toward an economy less dependent on carbon - rich fuels like coal and oil .
Ms. Browner stopped short of endorsing that plan , issued by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts , saying instead that Mr. Obama “ looks forward to working with members of Congress in both chambers to pass a bill that would transition the nation to a clean - energy economy . ”
She gave little clue as to what she and the president believe such a measure should say .
At an international climate conference in Germany that ended Wednesday , some delegates said they were disappointed in the Obama administration ’s lack of robust leadership .
The explanation offered by Jonathan Pershing , a leader of the American delegation , was that the administration was waiting to measure the American technological and political capacity to address climate change and was looking to Congress to set specific targets for reducing carbon pollution .
Business lobbyists welcome the White House ’s go - slow approach , saying the issue is too complicated and too costly to be rushed , especially in a recession .
“ We have not until now had a national debate on a climate change proposal , period , ” said Karen A. Harbert , a former senior Energy Department official who now heads the United States Chamber of Commerce ’s energy institute .
“ That has to happen for any piece of legislation to achieve broad support across the country . ”
Ms. Harbert and other business lobbyists also welcomed the administration ’s hesitancy to undertake regulation of climate - altering gases under E.P.A. authority , saying the matter should be fully aired before Congress so that all interests and regions could be heard .
PRINCETON , NJ -- A new Gallup Poll finds 51 % of Americans in favor and 42 % opposed to an investigation into the use of harsh interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects during the Bush administration .
At the same time , 55 % of Americans believe in retrospect that the use of the interrogation techniques was justified , while only 36 % say it was not .
Notably , a majority of those following the news about this matter " very closely " oppose an investigation and think the methods were justified .
These results are based on an April 24 - 25 Gallup Poll .
The Obama administration recently released documents that revealed the Bush administration 's legal justification for using so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation that many consider to be torture .
Congress followed that release by issuing a report saying Bush administration officials in fact authorized the use of such techniques .
The release of the documents was controversial , and now momentum is growing in Congress for an investigation into the Bush policy on interrogating terrorism suspects .
Sixty - one percent of Americans say they are following news about this issue closely , including 26 % who are following it very closely .
Republicans and Democrats are about equally likely to be paying close attention to this matter .
While a slim majority favors an investigation , on a relative basis the percentage is quite low because Americans are generally quite supportive of government probes into potential misconduct by public officials .
In recent years , for example , Americans were far more likely to favor investigations into the firing of eight U.S. attorneys ( 72 % ) , government databases of telephone numbers dialed by Americans ( 62 % ) , oil company profits ( 82 % ) , and the government 's response to Hurricane Katrina ( 70 % ) .
Support for an inquiry into the Bush - era interrogation policy may be relatively limited because a majority of Americans believe the use of the techniques for questioning terrorism suspects was justified .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney has probably been the most prominent person to argue that the information that may have been obtained from such practices kept Americans safe from further terrorist attacks .
Cheney , not surprisingly , opposes an investigation .
To gain a better understanding of how Americans feel about the matter , Gallup combined the results of the questions on whether the techniques were justified and whether the government should investigate .
All told , the greatest number of Americans , 30 % , seem to agree with Cheney 's position that the ends justified the means and that no investigation is necessary .
Nearly as many ( 25 % ) , though , would appear to side with many congressional Democrats who say the techniques should not have been used and an investigation is warranted .
Twenty - three percent think the techniques were warranted yet still favor an investigation , while 10 % think the methods should not have been used but nevertheless oppose an official inquiry .
If ( as seems likely ) the government does undertake an investigation , Gallup asked Americans which institution they would prefer conduct it .
Given a choice among Congress , a bipartisan commission , or the Justice Department , 43 % say they have no preference .
Those who do have a preference are slightly more likely to prefer a bipartisan commission to the Justice Department , while relatively few say Congress .
Those who favor a probe are no different from the broader public in their preferences for who should conduct it .
Party Differences
Americans ' opinions on this matter vary depending on their party affiliation , generally in line with the views of the leaders in each party .
Most Democrats favor an investigation , while most Republicans are opposed .
Independents are evenly divided .
Republicans overwhelmingly believe the use of harsh interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects was justified , and a majority of independents agree .
Democrats are more likely to say these actions were not justified than to say they were .
The plurality of each party group has no preference as to who should conduct an investigation , but of those who choose one of the three institutions , Republicans are more likely to favor a bipartisan commission and Democrats would most want the Justice Department to lead the probe .
Implications
One of the key findings of this Gallup Poll is that a majority of Americans in retrospect believe the use of harsh interrogation techniques by the Bush administration was justified .
Some of those who believe the techniques were justified still believe that an investigation into what transpired would be appropriate , but when all is said and done , just a bare majority of 51 % of Americans support an investigation , while 42 % oppose it .
President Obama did not call for an investigation when releasing the details of the Bush team 's legal opinions on the use of harsh terrorism techniques , but seemed to leave open the possibility last week .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,044 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted April 24 - 25 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
U.S. troops may be leaving Iraq .
U.S. gear – maybe not .
Today , President Obama gave the word that two - thirds of American forces would be gone from Iraq by August , 2010 .
The remaining troops will focus on training and supporting the Iraqi army , Obama announced .
But to do that job right , those forces are still going to need mountains of equipment .
" You 'll need a huge logistical backbone to maintain even a modest training force throughout the length and breadth of the country , " says one administration official .
Not only will those residual forces still need their fair share of food , fuel , spare parts , and medicine .
They 'll also need to be defended , in case they 're attacked .
Which means keeping attack helicopters on alert in Baghdad , Basra , Kirkuk , and Mosul .
Those guys will need chow and gas and gear , as well .
The end result is that the exodus of equipment predicted by some may not be all that grand .
Nor that difficult .
After all , the administration official says , U.S. forces are constantly exiting Iraq , at the end of their tours of duty .
" Every unit in Iraq leaves Iraq eventually , " the official notes .
" We do this all the time .
In fact , it might actually be simpler now , because their are fewer units coming in . "

Nearly two - thirds of the world 's mobile traffic will be video by 2013 , according to the latest visual networking index forecast by international networking giant Cisco .
The Asia -Pacific region is expected to account for one - third of all mobile data traffic within the next four years and will have the strongest annual mobile growth of 146 per cent , second only to Latin America at 166 per cent .
Europeans will consume more video than Americans , the report predicts .
These are among the key findings of the Cisco Visual Networking Index ( VNI ) Mobile Forecast for 2008 - 2013 which projects global mobile traffic to increase 66 - fold from 2008 - 13 with a compound annual growth rate of 131 per cent over that period .
The Cisco VNI mobile forecast highlights a variety of Internet protocol ( IP ) networking trends driven largely by the increased use of mobile broadband applications .
250 million DVDs
It predicts that global mobile traffic will exceed two exabytes -- the equivalent of 250 million full DVDs -- per month by 2013 .
The research forecasts that mobile broadband handsets , with higher than 3G speeds and laptop air or data cards , will constitute more than 80 per cent of global mobile traffic by 2013 .
" The Cisco Visual Networking Index Mobile Forecast findings reflect the trend that consumers will use a variety of services , applications and devices to drive an increase in mobile traffic we 're predicting , " said Suraj Shetty , vice president of service provider marketing , Cisco .
" The evolving 4G mobile Internet transformation is further diversifying how people access and experience the Internet and is causing an undeniable surge in bandwidth growth , " Shetty said .
4G transition inevitable
" The projected increase in mobile rich media points to the inevitable transition to 4G .
This will shift the industry 's focus towards all - IP networks . "
Kelly Ahuja , Cisco 's senior vice president , service provider routing technology group , said more personalised services and applications were becoming available on a wide range of devices .
" The key to success will be delivering video - rich any - play services to users , enabling them to move freely throughout the world while maintaining connectivity to others , " Ahuja said .
" As a result , service providers will have to take into account the need not only for more bandwidth when planning their network architecture but for greater network intelligence as well . "

Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University .
He co-writes Marginal Revolution , a popular economics blog .
This discussion can be followed in its entirety here .
I AGREE with Olivier Blanchard that fear and lack of confidence are major problems behind the current economic downturn .
I also agree that the banking sector requires recapitalisation and that this is hard to do .
But I dissent from his analysis in a few key regards .
First , to the extent that the real problem is fear , this militates in favour of placebo policies .
By that I mean initiatives which appear bold and have great symbolic value , but which do n't necessarily cost us very much .
I have n't seen us make a major attempt to identify such proposals , but it is unlikely that an $ 800 billion stimulus fits the bill .
I would sooner beef up automatic stabilisers , and aid to state and local governments , and claim that this , along with some regulatory changes , will help the economy .
Unorthodox monetary policy , as the Fed is intent on pursuing , should be presented in this guise as well .
The reality is that we do n't actually know what will work , precisely because the problem goes beyond just stimulating aggregate demand .
I 'm not opposed to the idea of “ ring fencing ” the bad assets on bank balance sheets , but that alone does n't solve any problems .
If the assets are to be bought , the question is at what price .
Buying at a low price does n't help any .
Buying at a high price means a giveaway to the banks .
Such giveaways might be necessary at this point but they could cost trillions .
Today the key problem is that we do n't know how to turn zombie banks into real banks .
I 'm not sure we should be encouraging consumers to spend so much more .
We need to make the painful adjustment to lower levels of spending and debt .
Consumers have to spend less at some point and I believe that point is now , however painful the results may be .
Mr Blanchard focuses on insufficient spending as a key problem but I am more likely to see the economy as needing to adjust to real shocks .
We need to reallocate resources out of construction , finance , and debt - financed consumption .
Boosting aggregate demand could make that adjustment harder rather than easier .
Mr Blanchard never tells us when he thinks that consumer spending should fall .
Most generally , we all need to keep in mind that trying to restore public confidence is tricky .
If you try hard and fail , confidence then plummets and it is even harder next time around .
This is a potential problem with both the stimulus approach and the placebo approach .
Most of all , I do n't think we are paying enough attention to the placebo idea .
It is well known in the medical literature that sometimes placebos work as well as the drugs themselves .
As games have become more and more expensive , a focus on longevity has naturally become increasingly important .
When we spend $ 60 on a videogame , we expect to get our money 's worth , and that means we do n't want a game that 's finished in less than three hours .
While we are quite right to demand a certain amount of gameplay to justify the money spent , it unfortunately means that developers have had to come up with creative time - wasting schemes that do n't give us the value we want , but merely create the illusion of value .
All too regularly , a game comes along that takes time - wasting to a whole new level , and you realize that what you 've purchased is nothing but vapidity masquerading as substance , inconsequential padding that 's desperately trying to fill an arbitrary length quota with meaningless activities and regurgitated setpieces .
Developers have almost made an art form of tricking consumers into believing they got their money 's worth .
In this list column , itself an ironically cheap and easy way of filling up article space , we pay tribute to some of the most obnoxious and blatant attempts at wasting a player 's time in the name of longevity .
These are games that may advertise themselves as eight to fifty hour - long experiences , but typically only provide about thirty minutes of actual fresh material .
Join us as we look at the ten cheapest ways of extending a game 's length .
1 : Collecting Meaningless Shit
Notable Offender : Sonic Unleashed
Replayability is a magic word in the games industry .
If your game has replay value , then you can be certain that money was well spent .
However , some people confuse " replayability " with " forcing players to do the same thing over and over again until they throw the disc at a wall . "
Popularized by Mario 64 but taken to absolute extremes by more recent games such as Sonic Unleashed , the whole " collect a convoluted amount of shiny things in old levels to unlock new ones " is one of the most lazy and obvious ways of falsely extending a game 's length .
Sticking with Sonic Unleashed as our prime example , a number of Sun and Moon Medals are hidden throughout each level .
They can be incredibly well hidden , and even conflict with the main gameplay , since Sonic is usually too busy running fast to stop and hunt for obscure collectibles .
You need both these Sun and Moon Medals to unlock night and day stages , respectively .
Bear in mind that there are around 200 Sun and Moon Medals in the game each .
Later levels can take hours of repeating old bits of gameplay ad nauseum in a meaningless search for shit , and just because Sonic Team wanted to make the game appear longer .
A game should be replayed because a player wants to replay it , not because they were forced to .
A developer that uses this tactic clearly has no faith in his own ability to design a good game .
2 : Grinding
Notable Offender : Most RPGs
Roleplaying games are famed for their length .
Epic fifty - hour quests are boasted with glee on the back of many RPG packages , and players are sucked in by the promise of a game that will literally last them months .
However , if you decide to discount the parts of an RPG where you are walking back and forth over a piece of map and randomly waiting to input the same commands until the number next to your name gets bigger , you 'll find that many of those fifty hours are absolutely nothing .
Grinding is one of the oldest tricks in the book .
So popular is the idea of gaining experience points and strengthening a character that genres outside of RPGs have cottoned on and exploited it .
Tacking on a grinding leveling system to a generic action game suddenly creates the illusion of depth , and keeps players hooked for longer as they level up their heroes in endlessly repetitive battles .
I enjoy RPGs and typically dig acquisition - of - power gameplay , but let 's not pretend that the idea of grinding is anything more than filler .
It 's not fifty hours of epic questing if most of that " journey " is spent walking around outside a town for thirty of those hours .
3 : Backtracking
Notable Offender : Prince of Persia
Why bother developing 50 % of a game when you can just repeat the first 50 % but at NIGHT TIME ?
Backtracking is an all - too common little scheme found in many action games , where a game is falsely extended by simply repeating levels , usually with a few quick and easy changes to the color scheme .
Recent examples include X - Blades , which makes you go forward through the levels , then back through all of them , Devil May Cry 4 , which repeats many levels with the Niero and Dante characters , and of course , the most recent Prince of Persia , which is just one big backtracking simulator .
The change of color and a few new enemies can obscure the lazy development , but most studios are n't clever enough to hide their blatantly obvious recycling .
When a game 's repetition accounts for an entire half of the experience , that 's just plain rubbish .
Do n't even get me started on RPGs that make you fight your way to the heart of a dungeon , have a huge boss battle and then demand you FIGHT YOUR WAY BACK OUT AGAIN !
DAMN YOU !
4 : Reincarnation
Notable Offender : Breath of Fire : Dragon Quarter , Dead Rising
This is a rare technique , but no less irritating for it .
Some games are designed to not be completed the first time around , and force players into a Groundhog Day series of reincarnations .
These rare games allow players to carry over their increased stats with each new game , and think that then gives them carte blanche to extend the game 's length by making it so that you might as well keep dying , restarting the game , and getting stronger .
Making the player repeat the first hour of gameplay several times over is pretty clever , even if it is irritating .
Also , I do n't care what anybody says , Dragon Quarter was a load of crap , and this was a big reason .
5 : Repeated Animations
Notable Offender : Project Altered Beast
A nice and cheap way of filling up time is to make some sort of animation sequence , and then repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again .
The absolutely terrible Project Altered Beast had repetitive transformation FMVs every time you switched between human and beast form , which confused me since the game was so unbearable that decreasing the length would have worked in its favor .
Lengthy attack sequences in RPGs and various special moves in action games that take ages to charge up or perform are all guilty of doing this , and those extra seconds of animation can really pile up to make a game feel longer , even if the players themselves are bored of seeing the same old long - winded finishing move time and time again .
Watching a sword go through a generic soldier 's face is great the first time , but it loses its appeal on the on the fortieth rehash .
6 : Trial and Error
Notable Offender : Mega Man 9
I hate trial and error gameplay with a passion .
It 's cheap design , and a big reason why old games seem to be so short when they once felt really long .
A game designed to kill the player until they become trained to learn the one and only way to complete a level is just sub - par game design , in my opinion , and it takes far more intelligence to design a well balanced game that challenges without ambushing players .
Resident Evil 5 had a particularly inventive and infuriation method of doing this by sneaking instant - death Quick Time Events in the middle of cutscenes .
Nearly all of them caught me off guard during the game because I was doing what most people do during a cutscene and watching them .
Recent Sonic games also use Sonic 's speed as a way of falling back on trial and error , since you need to play levels constantly to know when to turn and when not to fall into the ridiculously numerous pitfalls .
Many old school players love this kind of thing , and when Mega Man 9 came along , they openly wept with gratitude .
I just do n't have time for that kind of design , unfortunately .
Trial and error is bullshit .
7. Walking .
Lots of Walking
Notable Offender : Gears of War
Why have gameplay when you can have walking ?
A number of action games have cottoned on to the fact that you can accumulate huge amounts of " play time " simply by making the character walk through parts of a level with absolutely no action whatsoever .
I suppose we 're to marvel at the architecture or something , but it can get really dull and there are games out there who unashamedly add in extra , unnecessary segments of just ... walking .
Gears of War invented a really good way of using this " nothing walk " mechanic .
Epic
Games did n't even have to make impressive environments and long pathways to simulate the act of walking while doing fuck - all , they just made the characters walk really , really slowly .
A number of times during the game , Marcus Fenix and pals all stop and put their fingers in their ears to talk to someone on a radio .
Of course , the only way to talk on the radio is to move at a snail 's pace , and in doing so , you can add some impressive minutes to your game clock .
I expect to see that technique used more and more .
A recent game I played ( but can not talk about due to embargo ) has made liberal use of the tactic .
Walking for the win !
8 . The " Jason Voorhees " School of Boss Battles
Notable Offender : Devil May Cry
Very much like a good slasher film villain , some videogame bosses just do n't seem to die .
However , unlike a good slasher film villain , the repetition of a boss battle is usually quite unwelcome .
The Devil May Cry series is famed for its reliance on rehashing boss battles .
Viewtiful Joe even went so far as to make you play the entire game 's worth of bosses , one after the other , right before the end battle .
Capcom 's pretty good at this shit , I 'd say .
Many of these battles are just straight repeats .
The boss looks practically the same , does the same attacks , and is killed in the same way .
They are ostensibly pointless exercises in tedium , especially since we 're not going to be intimidated by something we 've already seen and beaten .
I grant you that , sometimes , a repeated boss is n't a bad thing .
A deliberately recurring enemy or a boss that does different things whenever you face it can be quite entertaining .
However , a boss battle that exists purely to distract you while the game does absolutely nothing new is shameful .
9. Opening Doors
Notable Offender : Most Action Games
I do n't generally consider Quick Time Events as cheap ways of extending a game 's length .
No , I consider QTEs as cheap ways of doing cool things that the studio is too lazy to make more interactive .
However , the QTE has spawned a bastard child that definitely has no justification in a game , other than to draw out the process of playing .
How many times have you had to hammer one of your controller 's buttons just to open a door ?
How many times in just one game ?
Yes , merely opening a door has been turned into a beautifully wasteful experience .
Examples I can quickly pull from the top of my head include Viking : Battle For Asgard and THQ's most recent Conan game .
Both games make opening a door look like some Herculean effort , as the character goes through the same mundane animation while you repeatedly tap a single button .
It 's not challenging , it 's not very fun , so why is it in my fucking videogame ?
The simple fact of the matter is that it does n't need to be in the game at all .
Nobody has ever raved about the awesome " door opening mechanics " in a game , and nobody will until there is a miraculously awesome door opening mechanic .
Hammering a button and watching a dreary animation is not awesome .
It 's certainly not gameplay .
It amazes me that so many games have been able to do this , too , and they 're all getting away with it .
This is mostly because it 's so boring and dull , that most players can't be bothered to talk about it when they review or discuss the videogame as a whole .
That almost qualifies as genius -- a gameplay element so tiresome that you actually forget it exists , so can't call the studio out on it .
Well , I 've remembered it this time .
There is no escape for rubbish faux - gameplay extensions .
10 . The Valkyrie
Only Offender : Too Human
One could argue that the entirety of Denis Dyack 's magnum opus , Too Human , is a futile exercise in wasting time , but our friends at Silicon Knights chose to hammer that point home by introducing one of the most blatant , despicable and trashy little bits of false game longevity known to mankind -- The Valkyrie .
In the spirit of this article , rather than present you with new material , I am just going to rehash a portion of our Too Human review .
If repeating yourself to extend length is good enough for games , it 's good enough for this article :
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I present to you the worst piece of game design I have had the displeasure of suffering through in the past five years .
Every time you die , you are forced to watch a 25 - second - long cutscene in which a Valkyrie descends and carries Baldur off .
It is the same scene every time -- the same animation , the same awful music , and the same length .
All of it unskippable , and all of it happening often .
It may not sound like much , but when you experience it for yourself , the frustration is almost unbearable .
The game itself has been designed to kill you , and often , and one can only surmise that it's because the developers have found this idea of the Valkyrie so important , so damn compelling , that we all have to pay attention to it over and over again .
Well it 's not important , nor is it compelling , and it 's not clever in the least .
If you are going to play Too Human , then it is advisable that you bring a book with you .
You are going to need something to do during the regular , obnoxious periods of forced downtime .
It 's great because it combined a number of things we 've already discussed .
The basic principals of trial and error gameplay , reincarnation , lots of walking and repeated animations all rolled into one antagonizing piece of pigshit .
Without the Valkyrie , Too Human might have been a bearable game .
It would n't be very long , though .

An ice bridge linking a shelf of ice the size of Jamaica to two islands in Antarctica has snapped .
Scientists say the collapse could mean the Wilkins Ice Shelf is on the brink of breaking away , and provides further evidence of rapid change in the region .
Sited on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Wilkins shelf has been retreating since the 1990s .
Researchers regarded the ice bridge as an important barrier , holding the remnant shelf structure in place .
Its removal will allow ice to move more freely between Charcot and Latady islands , into the open ocean .
European Space Agency satellite pictures had indicated last week that cracks were starting to appear in the bridge .
Newly created icebergs were seen to be floating in the sea on the western side of the peninsula , which juts up from the continent towards South America 's southern tip .
Professor David Vaughan is a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey who planted a GPS tracker on the ice bridge in January to monitor its movement .
He said the breaking of the bridge had been expected for some weeks and much of the ice shelf behind was likely to follow .
The ice bridge has splintered at its thinnest point " We know that [ the Wilkins Ice Shelf ] has been completely or very stable since the 1930s and then it started to retreat in the late 1990s .
But we suspect that it 's been stable for a very much longer period than that , " he told BBC News .
" The fact that it 's retreating and now has lost connection with one of its islands is really a strong indication that the warming on the Antarctic is having an effect on yet another ice shelf . "
While the break - up will have no direct impact on sea level because the ice is floating , it heightens concerns over the impact of climate change on this part of Antarctica .
Over the past 50 years , the peninsula has been one of the fastest warming places on the planet .
Many of its ice shelves have retreated in that time and six of them have collapsed completely ( Prince Gustav Channel , Larsen Inlet , Larsen A , Larsen B , Wordie , Muller and the Jones Ice Shelf ) .
Separate research shows that when ice shelves are removed , the glaciers and landed ice behind them start to move towards the ocean more rapidly .
It is this ice which can raise sea levels , but by how much is a matter of ongoing scientific debate .
Such acceleration effects were not included by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) when it made its latest projections on likely future sea level rise .
Its 2007 assessment said ice dynamics were poorly understood .

WE first posted about the Comer litigation here : Victim of Anti-Evolution Discrimination Files Lawsuit , and we followed up with this : Comer v. Scott — Background Information .
Simply put , Christina Comer sued the Texas Education Agency ( the “ TEA ” ) and Education Commissioner Robert Scott , alleging that she was fired merely because she forwarded an email from the National Center for Science Education ’s Glenn Branch announcing a talk by NCSE board member Dr. Barbara Forrest , who was to give a lecture that was critical of teaching of intelligent design in science classes .
One might say that she was “ expelled . ”
News of this litigation has been scarce in recent months , but now , in the Dallas Morning News , we read : Ex - Texas Education Agency employee ’s lawsuit tossed in ouster over creationism e-mail .
Here are some excerpts , with bold added by us :
A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Tuesday by a former state science curriculum director who alleged that she was illegally fired for sending out an e-mail on a lecture that was critical of those wanting to teach creationism in science classes .
Let ’s read on :
Comer said in her suit that the agency ’s neutrality policy [ regarding evolution and creationism ] had the effect of endorsing religion , and thus violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution .
State attorneys said Comer was fired for sending out e-mails from the TEA Web site that gave the impression the agency supported the views of a lecture speaker , Barbara Forrest , who wrote a book critical of the tactics of creationists and their attempts to inject religion into science classes .
They certainly would n’t want anyone getting that impression !
Now here ’s what happened in court :
U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel sided with the state and Scott on Tuesday , granting a motion for summary judgment and dismissing the lawsuit .
Yeakel had indicated during a hearing in December that he was skeptical of Comer ’s claims .
“ Summary judgment ” means that there was no issue of fact to be tried , so the judge could rule “ summarily . ”
Litigants frequently file motions for summary judgment , but ( unless one party ’s case is total nonsense ) the other side almost always convinces the court that some significant issues remain to be tried .
It ’s not unusual for summary judgments to be overturned on appeal , and then the case is sent back to the trial court for further proceedings .
Because trial judges do n’t like being reversed , they ’re often reluctant to grant summary judgment .
But it happens .
It ’s possible that the parties had stipulated to what all the events had been , in which case no trial was necessary and the judge was required to rule for one side or the other based on the uncontroverted facts .
At this point we do n’t know what the situation was in the Comer case , but we have our doubts that both sides stipulated to everything .
Hey , we were n’t there , so maybe that ’s exactly what happened .
One more excerpt :
TEA officials also said Comer made unauthorized remarks not connected to the debate over creationism during her tenure at the agency , another factor in her termination .
She was the science curriculum director for 10 years .
There ’s more to the article , but that ’s the essence of it .
Unless there ’s an appeal , and we suspect there will be , the Comer litigation is over .
Addendum :
One of our far - flung network of clandestine operatives supplied us with a copy of the judge ’s ruling , for which we are grateful .
We are now informed that both parties moved for summary judgment , so in effect , both agreed that there were no factual issues to be tried .
The judge took no procedural risk in granting such judgment .
Essentially , the facts were the existence of the Agency ’s neutrality policy , Comer ’s email , and her firing .
It all boiled down to whether the neutrality policy was unconstitutional .
It seems that the policy applied way beyond the evolution - creationism issue .
It applied to all curriculum issues , because the Agency had no role in designing the curriculum — that was the job of McLeroy ’s Board of Education .
Thus the neutrality policy had a secular origin , and if it advanced religion in this one instance , that was incidental to the policy ’s purpose .
So Comer ’s violation of a secular policy was n’t a constitutional problem , and therefore ( said the court ) she had no case .
Second Addendum :
The court pleadings have been placed online and can be found here : Legal Documentation for Comer v. Scott .

March 10 , 2009  --
If the voters in your state say it 's OK to do something , is it ?
Apparently not .
Charlie Lynch learned that the hard way , when federal authorities raided his home and small business in southern California in March 2007 .
" I hear the banging of my front door , " Lynch recalled .
" I opened the door and about 10 to 15 agents with shields , bullet - proof vests , guns , masks , they came barreling in . "
Drug Enforcement Administration agents seized 30 pounds of marijuana from Lynch 's business .
The action was n't a surprise to San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Pat Hedges , who had been investigating Lynch for about a year .
What tipped the sheriff off to Lynch 's operation ?
It may have been the ribbon - cutting ceremony that Lynch held when he started selling marijuana .
' It Is Nothing About Getting High '
Lynch was n't dealing drugs in back alleys .
He was selling medical marijuana .
He had applied for a business license , joined the Chamber of Commerce , consulted with attorneys and even called the DEA before opening his medical marijuana dispensary .
Thirteen states , including California , allow patients to use marijuana for medicinal use , and Lynch was selling marijuana to patients whose doctors had recommended the drug .
Hundreds of dispensaries across California have helped thousands of patients to access medical marijuana .
Singer Melissa Etheridge , now 47 , was one of those patients .
When she was diagnosed with cancer about five years ago , she underwent intensive rounds of chemo .
" It 's like putting acid in your body , " Etheridge said of the treatment .
" You lose your hair , you have absolutely no strength . "
With the chemo treatments came the side effects , and the drugs that doctors prescribed Melissa to treat them caused more side effects .
" Take the one drug for pain , it has the side effect of , it makes you constipated , " Etheridge said .
" So then you have to take the drug that helps you not be constipated .
But that drug , that 's going to make you get diarrhea , and so you have to take another drug to combat the side effects of that . "
Etheridge chose to use marijuana instead , and found that the drug helped her .
" When it comes to the medicinal use of this herb , it is nothing about getting high , " Etheridge said .
" You 're not getting high .
You are trying to get to a place of normal . "
The Benefits of Medical Marijuana
Medical marijuana also helped teenager Owen Beck , of Morro Bay , Calif. , when his leg was amputated to stop the spread of a cancerous tumor .
Beck , like Etheridge , found that chemo 's effects were devastating and the traditional medications did n't help .
" It destroys your appetite , " Beck said of the chemo , " and whatever you can eat , you throw up . "
His mother Debbie Beck said , " All those pills that we had , nothing was helping him . "
So , Beck tried medical marijuana , purchased from the dispensary run by Lynch .
" With the marijuana , you know , I could do what I needed to do during the day and just not be in pain , " Beck said .
" I could be comfortable . "
Beck and his parents were thankful for the service that Lynch provided .
" I 've always thought Charlie Lynch was , you know , the nicest guy in the world , " Beck said .
" He would always treat us with a lot of respect . "
Hauled Into Court
But not everyone liked Lynch 's dispensary .
Hedges had spoken out in public meetings against medical marijuana dispensaries .
After Lynch opened his business , Hedges sent officers to stake out the facility .
" They sent in undercover sheriff 's deputies to go encourage Charlie to break the federal law , " Lynch 's lawyer , John Littrell , said .
" In every case , what they found was that his employees always verified doctor 's recommendations .
No one could manage to get anybody , Charlie or anyone that Charlie was working with , to dispense marijuana in a way that violated state law . "
After a year , the sheriff handed information over to the federal government 's DEA that Lynch had been selling marijuana .
Even though California allows medical marijuana , federal law classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 narcotic -- the same as heroin .
Under federal law , Lynch was no different from a common drug dealer .
" Marijuana , under federal law , is a more serious narcotic than crack cocaine , " said Reuven Cohen , another of Lynch 's lawyers .
Lynch was hauled into federal court , which meant that his attorneys could not even mention the state law that permits the use of medical marijuana .
They also were n't allowed to mention that Lynch 's dispensary had helped people like Beck .
Facing 100 Years in Prison
" It 's complete bulls --- , but it 's the bulls --- that we live in , " Cohen said .
Lynch was convicted and faces up to 100 years in federal prison .
" It just seems so unfair what they 've done to me , " Lynch said .
" They put the fear of ' gov , ' I call that instead of the fear of God , fear of government into people . "
The DEA has raided five other medical marijuana dispensaries in California and Nevada this year , despite the various laws that legalized the substance for medical use at the state level .
But the Obama administration recently announced it would stop raiding marijuana dispensaries in states that allow medical marijuana , which is no help to Lynch .
His sentencing is now set for March 23 .
" They do n't come down on the state legislatures that gave us these laws , " Lynch said .
" They do n't come down on the city officials that let me operate the dispensary .
They come down on the little guy .
Me . "
( CNN ) -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease - fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday , warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders , a senior government official said .
Tamil demonstrators call for a cease - fire in Sri Lanka during a rally Saturday in Paris , France .
" The government is firm that ( the rebels ) lay down their arms and surrender .
We do not recognize this so - called offer , " said Lakshman Hulugalle , director of Sri Lanka 's Media Center for National Security .
The proposed cease - fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam ( LTTE ) in the country 's northern area .
Government troops made significant advances into rebel - held territory on Friday and Saturday , according to Sri Lankan Army sources .
A government - imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday .
Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country 's northeastern coast .
Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area , but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of " fresh displacement " has now exceeded 100,000 individuals .
" In the face of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and in response to the calls made by the U.N. , EU , the governments of the USA , India and others , the ( LTTE ) has announced an unilateral cease - fire .
All of LTTE 's offensive military operations will cease with immediate effect , " the rebel leaders said in a written statement issued earlier Sunday .
" We welcome the attempts by the U.N. and its agencies to assist the civilian population and are ready to engage and cooperate with them to address the humanitarian needs of the population .
...
We are in full agreement that the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by declaration of an immediate cease - fire . "
The Tiger leadership asked the international community to " pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate " on the cease - fire offer .
The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka 's northeast since 1983 .
As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began , and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries , including the United States and the European Union .

A debate over evolution education in Texas could shape science classes in the southern United States for years to come .
The Texas Board of Education will vote Thursday and Friday on amendments to the state 's proposed science curriculum .
The amendments convey doubt about evolution that , according to scientists , simply does not exist .
" They have n't mentioned creationism or the age of the Earth , " said Steve Schafersman , president of Texas Citizens for Science , a nonprofit science education and policy watchdog .
" It 's not openly creationist , but it 's anti-science .
It demeans and devalues science . "
The most recent prominent science - curriculum battle took place last year in Florida , where a statewide campaign engineered by intelligent - design supporters fell short of obtaining science curricula that called for classroom evolution education to be balanced with " alternatives . "
Members of the Discovery Institute , an intelligent - design think tank , helped draft critiques of evolution in Texas as well as Florida .
According to Schafersman , the seven Texas Board of Education members who 've supported the amendments are Young Earth creationists .
Because teaching creationism as fact in public schools is illegal , supporters have resorted to language about " alternatives " and " strengths and weaknesses " into science curricula .
There 's little danger of students learning that the Earth is 4,000 years old , or that a supernatural entity carefully arranged dinosaur fossils to look natural .
But students might not learn that science is a process of testing hypotheses and accumulating evidence to produce theories , like that of evolution .
And when a few outlying critiques are presented as valid alternatives to scientific consensus , critical thinking suffers .
The consequences of the Board of Education 's decision wo n't be limited to Texas , said Schafersman , but will affect students in other southern states .
" Texas schoolbooks are used throughout the south , " he said .
" If we win , this will be the standard . "
The amendments involve the Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills guidelines , which determine what the state 's public school students must learn .
A committee of science - education experts wrote the science section , and removed previous language referring to evolution 's " strengths and weaknesses " — a de facto* * code phrase for so - called creation science .
The draft guidelines passed by an 8 - 7 vote in January , but Board chairman Donald McLeroy , a Young Earth creationist , unilaterally added amendments that , though avoiding mention of " strengths and weaknesses , " fail to pass scientific muster .
One amendment requires biology teachers to " analyze and evaluate the sufficiency or insufficiency of common ancestry to explain the sudden appearance , stasis and sequential nature of groups in the fossil record . ”
That all complex organisms are descended from a common ancestor is commonly accepted by evolutionary biologists .
Other amendments to planetary - science guidelines " introduce unwarranted uncertainty to long - settled scientific issues , " wrote Alan Leshner , CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , and 23 leading members of Texas ' science community in a letter delivered to McLeroy on Tuesday .
" These amendments serve only to undermine sound science education in Texas , " they wrote .
Some observers of the Board of Education controversy have worried that Texas ' position as the nation 's second - largest purchaser of textbooks would result in changes to nationally used texts .
That was historically the case , said Schafersman , but publishers now produce region - specific books .
However , the demands of Texas schools still affect books used throughout the south .
The board 's vote will conclude Friday , and the resulting curriculum will be enforced for the next 10 years .
Right now , said Schafersnan , when a schoolbook " is stamped ' Texas edition ' on the front , that means it 's been censored to keep the students ignorant . "
But if the board votes as it did in January , that will no longer be the case .

Visiting Israeli professor Jeff Halper conducted a speaking tour of Australia in March .
His tour attracted strong criticism from some within the local Jewish community , with the Australian Jewish News describing him as a " hardline detractor of Israel " and refusing to run advertisements of his tour , and one Sydney synagogue withdrawing its invitation for him to speak .
Here Halper responds to his critics .
The uproar in the organised Jewish community over the prospect of my speaking in Australia is truly startling to an Israeli like me .
Granted , I am very critical of Israel ’s policies of occupation and doubt whether a two - state solution is still possible given the extent of Israel ’s settlements , but this hardly warrants the kind of demonisation I received in the pages of the Australian Jewish News .
Opinions similar to mine are readily available in the mainstream Israeli media .
Indeed , I myself write frequently for the Israeli press and appear regularly on Israeli TV and radio .
Why , then , the hysteria ?
Why was I banned from Temple Emmanuel in Sydney , a self - proclaimed " progressive " synagogue ?
Why did I , an Israeli , have to address the Jewish community from a church ?
Why was I invited to speak in every university in eastern Australia yet , at Monash University , I was forced to hold a secret meeting with Jewish staff in a darkened room far from the halls of intellectual discourse ?
Why , when the " leaders " of the Jewish community were excoriating me and my positions , did the Israelis who attended my talks express such appreciation that " real " Israeli views were finally getting aired in Australia , even if they did not all agree with me ?
Given the support for my right to speak that was evident in many of the letters published in the AJN , this all raises disturbing questions over the right of Australian Jews to hear divergent views on Israel ’s conflict with the Palestinians held by Israelis themselves .
It raises an even deeper issue , however .
What should be the relationship of Diaspora Jewry to Israel ?
Whatever threat I represented to the organised Jewish community of Australia had less to do with Israel , I suspect , than with some damage I might to do to the idealised " Leon Uris " image of Israel that they hold onto so dearly .
This might seem like a strange thing to say , but I do not believe that those in the Diaspora have internalised the fact that Israel is a foreign country that is as far from their idealised version of it as Australia is far from its image as kangaroo - land .
Countries change , they evolve .
What would Australia ’s European founders think — even those who until very recently pursued a " white Australia " policy — if they were to see the multicultural country you have become ?
Well , almost 30 per cent of Israeli citizens are not Jews ; we may very well have permanently incorporated another four million Palestinians — the residents of the Occupied Territories — into our country ; and , to top it off , it ’s clear by now that the vast majority of the world ’s Jews are not going to emigrate to Israel .
Those facts , plus the urgent need for Israel to make peace with its neighbours , mean something .
They mean that Israel must change in ways Ben Gurion , Leon Uris and Mark Leibler never envisioned — even if that ’s hard for the Jewish Diaspora to accept .
Yet I see this as a positive thing , a sign of a healthy country coming to grips with reality , some of it of its own creation , even if it means that Israel will evolve from a Jewish state into a state of all its citizens — a bi-national or democratic state .
Rather than " eliminating " Israel , this challenge is in fact a natural and probably inevitable development .
It will not be easy , but if Australia can become multicultural , so can we .
But that ’s our problem as Israelis .
So what ’s the Jewish Diaspora ’s problem ?
Why should discussing such important issues for Israel be the cause of such distress for them ?
Because , I venture to say , they have a stake in preserving Israel ’s idealised image .
In my view , Israel is being used as the lynchpin of their ethnic identity in Australia ; mobilising around a beleaguered Israel is essential for keeping their kids Jewish .
I would even go so far as to accuse them of needing an Israel in conflict , which is why they seem so threatened by an Israel at peace , why they deny that peace is even possible , why a peaceful Israel that is neither threatened nor " Jewish " cannot fulfill the role they have cast for it , and thus why they characterise my message as " vile lies " .
This , to be honest , is the threat I represent .
Only this can explain why rabbis , community " leaders " and Jewish professors choose to meet me secretly rather than have me , a critical Israeli , in their synagogues or classrooms .
This is all understandable .
The Jewish Diaspora does need a lynchpin if they are to preserve their identity as a prosperous community in a tolerant multicultural society .
I would just question whether the real country of Israel can fulfill that role , or even if it ’s fair to Israel to expect it to .
We are different peoples .
Israel can no more define Diaspora Jewish life than they can define Israel .
Rather than knee - jerk defense of an imaginary place , they need to develop a respect for Israel and Israeli voices , a respect that will come only when they start regarding Israel as a real country .
And they have to get a life of their own .
They have to develop alternative Diaspora Jewish cultures and identities .
Ironically , after all I have said , the Israeli Government will resist that , for it uses them as agents to support its policies , often extreme right - wing and militaristic policies that contradict the Jewish Diaspora ’s very values of cultural pluralism and human rights .
Remember : Israel does what it does in the name of the world ’s Jews .
Unless they take an independent position , they are complicit .
What befell me in Australia is just a tiny piece of a sad story of mutual exploitation : the Jewish Diaspora using Israel to keep their community together ; and Israel using them to defend its indefensible policies .
Perhaps something good can emerge from all this : robust discussion on the nature of Israeli - Diaspora relations .
I ’m going home to Jerusalem .
The Australian Jewish community needs to let Israel go and get a ( Jewish ) life .
Read our interview with Jeff Halper here .
A day after Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal ’s widely ripped Howdy Doody - meets - Mister Rogers response to President Obama ’s address , Max Blumenthal piled it on with an interesting article on The Daily Beast reiterating some things not widely known about the “ Bayou ’s boy wonder . ”
One of the most interesting facts in the piece , titled “ Bobby Jindal ’s Secret Past , ” was that Jindal said he witnessed , and then haltingly participated in , the exorcism of his very close friend ( a woman named Susan ) when he was in college .
( It should be noted that other bloggers have been making hay of this fact for a while . )
In 1994 Jindal penned a piece for the New Oxford Review , under the title “ Beating a Demon : Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare , ” in which he recounted what happened .
The account is straight out of the movies .
According to Jindal , Susan was a “ charismatic Christian . ”
She had recently been diagnosed with cancer .
Weeks before the diagnosis , one of her “ closest friends from home ” had committed suicide .
She was hysterical and erratic ( I wonder why ) , and started having “ visions ” and smelling like sulfur “ which supposedly accompanies the devil . ”
Everything came to a head at a prayer meeting organized for Susan .
Here are some excerpts from Jindal ’s article :
“ Suddenly , Susan emitted some strange guttural sounds and fell to the floor .
She started thrashing about , as if in some sort of seizure .
Susan ’s sister must have recognized what was happening , for she ordered us to gather around and place our hands on Susan ’s prostrate body . ”
“ I tentatively ap­proached the group and placed the edge of my finger­tip on her shoulder …
In a voice I had never heard before or since , Su­san accused me : “ Bobby , you can not even love Susan . ”
“ The students , led by Susan ’s sister and Louise , a member of a charismatic church , engaged in loud and desperate prayers while holding Susan with one hand .
Kneeling on the ground , my friends were chanting , ‘ Satan , I command you to leave this woman . ’
Others exhorted all ‘ demons to leave in the name of Christ . ' ”
“ Whenever I concentrated long enough to begin prayer , I felt some type of physical force distracting me .
It was as if something was pushing down on my chest , making it very hard for me to breathe .
Being a biology major at the time , I greeted this feeling with skepticism and rational explanations .
I checked my pulse for signs of nervousness and wondered what could cause such a sensation .
Shortness of breath is a common symptom that can mean very little or may signal the onslaught of a fatal stroke .
Though I could find no cause for my chest pains , I was very scared of what was happening to me and Susan .
I began to think that the demon would only attack me if I tried to pray or fight back ; thus , I resigned myself to leav­ing it alone in an attempt to find peace for myself . ” “… the students dared Susan to read biblical passages .
She choked on certain passages and could not finish the sentence ‘ Jesus is Lord . ’
Over and over , she repeated ‘ Jesus is L..L..LL , ’ often ending in profanities . ”
“ Just as suddenly as she went into the trance , Susan suddenly reappeared and claimed ‘ Jesus is Lord . ’
With an almost comical smile , Susan then looked up as if awakening from a deep sleep and asked , ‘ Has something happened ? ' ”
Wow .
That ’s incredible .
But is it politically problematic ?
This came up to some degree in his race for governor , but it did n’t appear to raise many eyebrows .
Then again , the election was in Louisiana , a state steeped in voodoo and hoodoo customs and full of charismatic Christians and religious hysterics .
( Case in point , months before Jindal ’s article was published , two sisters from Arcadia , La. , went on trial for gouging out the eyes of a third sister in an apparent attempt to rid her of a demon . )
The state also has a sizable Catholic population , and the church openly embraces the idea of exorcisms .
But how well would Jindal ’s exorcism experience be received elsewhere should he consider a national bid ?
Probably not as badly as some might suspect .
Judging by the number of Americans who believe in the devil and demonic possession , it might turn out to be a positive in heavily religious areas , helping Jindal become more relatable to like - minded voters .
According to The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life ’s 2008 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , nearly 70 percent of Americans believe that “ Angels and demons are active in the world , ” and nearly 80 percent believe that “ miracles still occur today as in ancient times . ”
Furthermore , while some measures of religiosity have been declining or holding steady , Americans ’ belief in the existence of the devil has surged 27 % since 1990 , according to Gallup .
And a 2005 Gallup poll found that more than 40 percent of Americans believe “ that people on this earth are sometimes possessed by the devil . ”

Report : Obama may keep some CIA torture details secret RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday April 14 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama is " wavering " on whether to fully release details of the Bush administration 's approved torture techniques , according to a report in Wednesday 's Wall Street Journal based on statements by " people familiar with the discussions . "
" Among the details in the still - classified memos is approval for a technique in which a prisoner 's head could be struck against a wall as long as the head was being held and the force of the blow was controlled by the interrogator , according to people familiar with the memos , " the paper reported .
" A decision to keep secret key parts of the three 2005 memos outlining legal guidance on CIA interrogations would anger some Obama supporters who have pushed him to unveil now - abandoned Bush - era tactics , " continued Journal reporters Evan Perez and Siobhan Gorman .
" It would also go against the views of Attorney General Eric Holder and White House Counsel Greg Craig , people familiar with the matter said .
" Top CIA officials have spoken out strongly against a full release , saying it would undermine the agency 's credibility with foreign intelligence services and hurt the agency 's work force , people involved in the discussions said .
However , Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair favors releasing the information , current and former senior administration officials said . "
In light of the startling revelations that came to light with the publication of a Red Cross report [ PDF link ] which documents in gruesome detail interrogation practices such as suffocation by water , beating by collar and prolonged nudity , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow that he would support a Department of Justice investigation into the reported torture .
" President Obama said he does n't want to spend all his time looking back .
Fair enough .
But he has also said egregious violations should be prosecuted , " said Schumer , who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" The most logical , best place to start is the Justice Department .
They have n't said if they are going to do it or not ...
If they wo n't do it , someone else is going to have to do it .
But they should be given the first crack . "
In a wide - ranging conversation with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) on Wednesday , April 9 , MSNBC host Keith Olbermann waited until the final moments of his interview to raise questions on the allegations of torture against the Bush administration .
Pelosi said that despite a difference in opinion between Congress and the Obama White House on the matter , " we believe that we have to take a look " to ferret out potential " criminal activity " in the treatment of detainees .

San Jose de los Perros , Nicaragua —
The snowball that was Obama ’s bailout plan rolled downhill this week , gathering to it all manner of trash and stones .
On Tuesday , President Obama signed the $ 787 billion bailout plan .
In a Churchillian moment , he admitted that the end of the war on depression was not at hand , and more sacrifices would have to be made , but today does mark the beginning of the end . 
At least , he has the whole world behind him .
America ’s mayors , for example , have enlisted en masse .
Heeding a call from the White House , they came up with 18,750 projects that are  shovel ready ,  meaning , they can begin digging holes within hours after the cash hits their bank accounts .
Las Vegas , for example , said it could use $ 2 million to put in more neon signs .
Shreveport , Louisiana , said that if had $ 6 million , it would put in three new aquatic centers with slides .
Whee !
These are the worst of times for many but they are best of times for some .
There is a bull market in claptrap ; politicians have n’t had it so good since the New Deal .
In France , the Sarkozy government recently announced a plan to bail out the nation ’s auto industry .
The government will lend 9 billion euros to Renault , PSA ( Peugeot ) and their related finance companies .
In return , the state hopes to collect interest and requires that the companies continue to employ French voters .
Slovakian autoworkers do n’t vote in French elections ; they can go to Hell .
In England , Gordon Brown announced yet another bank bailout this week — 37 billion pounds , he says , will provide a " rock of stability " for the system .
Traditionally , gold provides solidity to a banking system .
But Gordon Brown , when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer , sold off tons of British gold at barely a quarter of today ’s price .
When the going was good , people believed things that were n’t true .
Now , they still believe things are n’t true — but in the opposite direction .
Where they once believed they could get richer , eternally , by squandering money they had n’t earned , now , they look to the government to do it .
Depressions are so rare that there is no statistically reliable evidence about them .
They are like women who rotate their husbands ’ tires while preparing their dinners ; they are so infrequently encountered that there is no point in making generalizations or trying to form them up into a baseball team .
Each one is sui generis .
Hardly anyone is still alive who remembers the depression of the ’ 30s or what the feds ’ bailouts wrought .
Here at The Daily Reckoning , we have already given our version of the story .
A depression is not a pause , we recall explaining , it a time when debt is squeezed out of a saturated economy .
Bailouts , handouts , and government stimuli actually retard the process .
But ours is a minority view .
Only that great economist Fidel Castro seems to agree with us .
The geniuses can’t help , he says ; structural change is needed :  Even if Kant , Plato and Aristotle were resurrected together with the late brilliant economist John Kenneth Galbraight [ sic ] , they would neither be capable of solving the more frequent and deeper antagonistic contradictions of the system . 
But the burden of proof is on us .
Which is too bad ;
Fidel is retired and we have no proof of anything .
All we can do is marvel , and guffaw , at things so absurd they take our breath away .
In the bubble era people spent too much money they did n’t have on too many things they really did n’t need .
Then came the credit crunch .
Now , they hallucinate that if they spend even more money they do n’t have , on things they hardly even want , they will get what they really need — jobs , growth and inflation .
Even respected economists say they believe in miracles .
Resources have been made idle by the depression , they claim , like strong backs in an unemployment line .
Government spending is just putting them to work .
By this reasoning , things that were too expensive even in the boom years miraculously become cheap at any price .
And things that were n’t worth spending money on in the fat years become miraculously indispensable in the lean ones .
It is like a man who did n’t care for caviar when he had a good job ; now that he is unemployed , he must have it every night .
They are only taking up " idle resources " that would otherwise go to waste , explain the miracle workers .
In their minds , an umbrella is useless unless it is actually raining .
But sometimes capital needs to take a break and hang on coat - rack .
Every banker , householder and investor needs a reserve against mistakes .
Now , more than ever .
Until the crisis is over and a new economy takes shape any investment of labor or capital is likely be another mistake .
In normal times , residents of Chula Vista , CA , turned up their noses at spending a half a million on a public park for dogs .
But now that the hard times are here , a place where dogs can run off the leash seems a fitting a use for money the town does n’t have .
In the best of times , Lincoln Nebraska was in no position to spend $ 3 million on an environmentally friendly clubhouse for a municipal golf course .
But cometh the worst of times , and the golfers suddenly deserve not just a clubhouse , but one that is pals with nature .
Things we used to take for absurd we now take for granted .
But it is just one of the wonders of the human race that it is capable of believing anything .
The sunny years have passed .
Now , there are storm clouds on every horizon .
And instead of protecting its precious idle reserves the government turns them into dog runs .

The Best of Bill Bonner
In a 2005 memo , Bush administration lawyers argued that it was okay for CIA interrogators to keep terror suspects awake for seven and a half days straight – because " even very extended sleep deprivation does not cause physical pain . "
The attorneys backed up the claim by citing the work of a number of leading university researchers on sleep .
Now , those professors are saying that their work was horribly misused .
" To claim that 180 hours [ of sleep deprivation ] is safe in these respects , is nonsense . "
Dr. James Horne , with the Loughborough University Sleep Research Centre , tells the * Obsidian Wings * blog .
" Prolonged stress with sleep deprivation will lead to a physiological exhaustion of the body ’s defense mechanisms , physical collapse , and with the potential for various ensuing illnesses . "
In their studies , the researchers note , the subjects are well - fed , with ready access to video games and television .
The CIA 's interrogation sites did n't afford these niceties .
And that can have a major impact on the well - being of the sleep - deprived .
" It is total nonsense to cite our study in this context , " Dr. Bernd Kundermann , a psychiatry professor at the University of Marburg , tells Time .
He said using his research to evaluate the CIA program was like using a study about " the transient reactions of a little schnapps " to justify forcing prisoners to " drink large amounts of alcohol . "
Dr. S. Hakki Onen , a sleep specialist with the Hôpital Gériatrique A. Charial , notes that subjects under the researchers ' care were also allowed to rebound from the long periods of sleeplessness – and regain their strength , in the process .
That was n't the case in the CIA interrogation sites .
" When we treated these patients and restored their sleep , we also increased their pain thresholds .
That therapeutic objective of our study is therefore opposite to its application as described in the reports , " writes Dr. Onen - whose research , like Dr. Horne and Dr. Kundermann 's studies , were cited in the controversial 2005 memo .
" In a manner , it 's like giving a drug to a patient : if you administer it in small doses for therapeutic reasons , it helps them .
If you give it in huge volumes , it becomes toxic — and can even kill them . "
In fact , the scientists say , the psychological stress caused by sleeplessness may be more dangerous than the physical impact - despite the lawyers ' conclusion that " extended sleep deprivation cannot be expected to cause ' severe mental pain or suffering . ' "
After days and days of sleep deprivation , " the mental pain would be all too evident , and arguably worse than physical pain , " Dr. Horne notes .
Dr. Kundermann adds , " It can result in psychosis . "
According to a newly - declassified report from the Senate Armed Services Committee , sleep deprivation was one of a number of techniques " reverse- engineer[ed ] " from the U.S. special forces program to resist interrogation and torture .
Other techniques including " sensory deprivation , " " slapping , " and " waterboarding . "
But while those " fear based approaches " were generally unreliable , " a special forces " Behavioral Science Consultation Team " noted , " psychological stressors such as sleep deprivation , withholding food , isolation , and loss of time were ' extremely effective . ' "
Despite the memo's approval of up to 180 hours of sleeplessness , only three detainees had been subjected to sleep deprivation for more than 96 hours .
Many others would be allowed an irregular hour or two of rest here and there .
The Senate report refers again and again to suspects given " four hours of sleep every 24 hours , not necessarily consecutive . "
In conjunction with other pressures , that irregular sleep could have serious consequences .
" In December 2002 , two detainees were killed " while incarcerated at a facility in Bagram , Afghanistan , " according to the Senate report .
" Investigators concluded that the use of stress positions and sleep deprivation combined with other mistreatment at the hands of Bagram personnel , caused or were direct contributing factors in the two homicides . "
The lawyers for Guantanamo Bay detainee Salim Hamdan claimed that their client spent 50 days during 2003 in a sleep - interruption program known as " Operation Sandman . "
" Sleep deprivation of that nature for 50 days would constitute torture , " said one of Hamdan 's lawyers , Joseph M. McMillan .
In another detainee ’s case , a military lawyer claimed his client " was moved from cell to cell 112 times during a 14 day - period in 2004 to keep him in a state of sleepless disorientation , " according to the New York Times .
" A May report by the Justice Department inspector general said American military interrogators appeared to have collaborated with visiting Chinese officials at Guantánamo Bay to disrupt the sleep of Chinese Uighur detainees , waking them every 15 minutes the night before their interviews by the Chinese . "
In the 2005 memo , the lawyers appear at one point to acknowledge the psychological dangers of denying someone rest .
" It may be questioned whether sleep deprivation would be characterized as a ' procedure calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality ' ... we understand from OMS [ CIA 's Office of Medial Services ] and from the scientific literature that extended sleep deprivation might result in hallucinations in some cases . "
But , in the next breath , the attorneys brush such concerns aside .
" Any hallucinatory effects of sleep
deprivation would dissipate rapidly , " they write .
" Even assuming , however , that the extended use of sleep deprivation may result in hallucinations that could fairly be characterized as a ' profound ' disruption of the subject 's senses , we do not believe it tenable to conclude that in such circumstances the use of sleep deprivation would be said to be ' calculated . ' "
The intent of the interrogation is n't to make the subject see things that are n't there , the memo argues .
It 's to make him talk .
__UPDATE : __David Hambling here .
Sleep deprivation has been shown to have extreme effects in lab testing .
One 1983 study on rats to find out the consequences of continued sleep deprivation pushed this to the limit : " stimulus presentations were timed to reduce sleep severely in experimental rats but not in controls .
Experimental rats suffered severe pathology and death ; control rats did not . "
Researchers believe that the same effect will occur with humans .
Legally speaking though , treatment which may end in the subject 's dying may not necessarily count as torture .

Vassil Dichev , one of the community of programmers dedicated to developing ESME , talks about his experiences with Scala .
The Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment ( ESME ) is an important Open Source project that has become the foundation of a Siemens initiative to boost productivity in the Enterprise .
Having chosen Scala as their development language the ESME team has worked together to break new ground in company internal communications .
Read the interview to learn how this interesting project unfolded .
Git , the oft - referred to as " Linux , Rubyists , and Cool Kids source code control system " , is gaining ground so fast that there 's not enough room in this post to mention all the traction and good press it is achieving .
Yet , a common comment I hear over lunches and cubicle walls is
" Git does n't have good support on Windows yet . "
I politely disagree .
While the methods for putting Git on Windows have a slight variance from that of putting it on Mac or Linux , I have seen no real compatibility issues in my near daily use of it on all three aforementioned platforms .
Is there still room for it to get better on Windows though ?
Definitely !
The next lament I hear is
" If only there were a Tortise - like UI for Git . "
Let me also put that to rest and direct you to the TortiseGit homepage .
While TortiseGit is still a work in progress , I 've seen a handful of folks already putting it to productive daily use .
And if you do n't like TortiseGit , then try GitSafe .
And if you are using IntelliJ , support is built right into v8.1 , Eclipse has eGit as an official Eclipse project now , and NetBeans has an issue open and some ongoing work for support which , awesomely consumes parts of eGit ( JGit Libs ) from Eclipse .
And just to share the " Peanutbutter in my Chocolate " favorite story of the week , Maven is moving to Git in many directions at once :
If you have yet to explore or fully leverage the power of Git or Maven , now is a critical juncture of market acceptance for these tools , and accordingly , a perfect time to explore their benefits .
For the latest news on Git , Maven , iPhone development , and Open Source , join the conversation over at Twitter .
This is an assessment of its creditworthiness , not the trustworthiness of its political campaign coverage , but note this report :
The New York Times Co. reported a steep drop in third - quarter profits on Thursday , the latest gloomy earnings report in an industry battered by online competition and falling print advertising revenue .
The New York Times Co. said net profit fell by 51.4 percent in the third quarter to 6.5 million dollars , or five cents per share , from 13.4 million dollars , or nine cents per share , in the same period a year ago .
The company , which owns About.com , The Boston Globe , International Herald Tribune and 16 other daily newspapers besides the flagship The New York Times , said overall advertising revenue fell by 14.4 percent during the quarter .
Shortly after the release of its results , Standard & Poors said it was lowering the Times ’s credit rating to “ BB - , ” or junk status , while Moody ’s Investors Service said it was placing it on review for possible downgrade .
Moody ’s changed the rating outlook for the company to negative from stable in July .
A further downgrade would reduce it to junk status .
Both companies said the moves were based on the uncertain outlook for newspaper advertising .

The U.S. , Australia , Canada , Britain and New Zealand …
Is it a coincidence that these also happen to be the ECHELON states ?
Via : Stuff :
A leaked American study into military actions in Afghanistan reveals New Zealand is now plugged into the world ’s most secret intranet , allowing access to the Pentagon ’s battle plans .
“ Secret Internet Protocol Router Network ” , or SIPRNET , is a sophisticated alternative to the internet , allowing New Zealand frigate control rooms and armoured vehicles access to material seen on generals ’ desks in Washington .
Defence Minister Wayne Mapp refused to comment on the link .
“ We do n’t discuss security matters , ” he said through a spokesman .
A spokeswoman for the United States embassy in Wellington said it would not comment on security or intelligence matters .
“ What I can say is that the US considers New Zealand a partner , a team - mate and an extremely close friend .
“ Bilateral communication is an obvious part of such a friendship but the specific mechanisms we use for government - to - government communication are not something we discuss publicly . ”
New Zealand ’s place in the network has been revealed by whistleblower Wikileaks , which published a Rand Corporation study into intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Wikileaks says the study into counter - insurgency is a notable news and policy source for the wealth of revealing interview quotes it contains .
Rand says that , in Iraq and Afghanistan , coalition forces often did not have access to US intelligence and at times this put British soldiers at “ mortal risk ” .
As a result the US National Security Agency and Defence Department opened SIPRNET “ to a small pool of trusted allies ” , including Australia , Canada , Britain and New Zealand .
There are no New Zealand forces in Iraq , but a reconstruction team works in Afghanistan and at times the Special Air Service is deployed there .
New Zealand ’s high level of trust contrasts with the official political line that it is a friend but not an ally of the US as a result of its ban on nuclear weapons .
Few details of SIPRNET are public .
It is a closed system with no access to the internet , thus protecting it from virus attacks .
Last year Colonel Mike Convertino of the US Air Force Cyber Command told media : “ We conduct wars on SIPRNET , so it ’s very important that there is little to no chance that it can be interfered with . ”

TO LOSE one decade may be regarded as a misfortune ; to lose two looks like carelessness .
Japan 's economy stagnated in the 1990s after its stockmarket and property bubbles burst , but its more recent economic performance looks even more troubling .
Industrial production plunged by 38 % in the year to February , to its lowest level since 1983 .
Real GDP fell at an annualised rate of 12 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 , and may have declined even faster in the first three months of this year .
The OECD forecasts that Japan 's GDP will shrink by 6.6 % in 2009 as a whole , wiping out all the gains from the previous five years of recovery .
If that turns out to be true , Japan 's economy will have grown at an average of 0.6 % a year since it first stumbled in 1991 ( see top chart ) .
Thanks to deflation as well , the value of GDP in nominal terms in the first quarter of this year probably fell back to where it was in 1993 .
For 16 years the economy has , in effect , gone nowhere .
Was Japan 's seemingly strong recovery of 2003 - 07 an illusion ?
And why has the global crisis hit Japan much harder than other rich economies ?
Popular wisdom has it that Japan is overly dependent on exports , but the truth is a little more complicated .
The share of exports in Japan 's GDP is much smaller than in Germany or China and until recently was on a par with that in America .
During the ten years to 2001 , net exports contributed nothing to Japan 's GDP growth .
Then exports did surge , from 11 % of GDP to 17 % last year .
If exporters ' capital spending is included , net exports accounted for almost half of Japan 's total GDP growth in the five years to 2007 .
Exports boomed on the back of a super - cheap yen and America 's consumer binge .
Japan did not have housing or credit bubbles , but the undervalued yen encouraged a bubble of a different sort .
Japanese exporters expanded capacity in the belief that the yen would stay low and global demand remain strong , resulting in a huge misallocation of resources .
As foreign demand collapsed and the yen soared last year , Japan 's export “ bubble ” burst .
Total exports have fallen by almost half in the past year .
Japan 's high - value products , such as cars and consumer electronics , are the first things people stop buying when the economy sours .
Richard Jerram , an economist at Macquarie Securities , argues that the worst may soon be over for industrial production .
This year , output and exports have fallen by much more than the drop in demand , because firms have temporarily closed plants in order to slash excess stocks .
For instance , Japan 's vehicle production in the first two months of 2009 was 50 % lower than a year before , but global car sales fell by only 25 % .
Mr Jerram reckons that the inventory rundown is coming to an end , which will lead to a short - term bounce in output as factories reopen .
If so , car output in June could be around 50 % higher than in March ( but still down by 25 % on a year earlier ) .
This means that GDP growth might turn positive in the second quarter even if foreign demand remains weak .
Unfortunately , the economy is likely to totter again as the second - round effects of tumbling profits and rising unemployment squeeze investment and consumer spending .
According to the latest Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , in March business sentiment among big manufacturing firms was the gloomiest since the poll began in 1974 .
Manufacturers say they plan to cut investment by 20 % this year .
They are also trimming jobs and wages .
The seemingly modest unemployment rate of 4.4 % in February understates the pain .
The ratio of job offers to applicants has declined to only 0.59 , from around one at the start of 2008 , and average hours worked have also fallen sharply .
Average wages ( including bonuses and overtime pay ) went down by 2.7 % in the 12 months to February .
Household spending fell by 3.5 % in real terms over the same period ; department store sales plunged by 11.5 % .
The weakening domestic economy has prompted the government to man the fiscal pumps .
A stimulus of 1.4 % of GDP is already in the pipeline for 2009 , and a further boost of perhaps 2 % of GDP is expected to be unveiled in mid-April .
The package is likely to include measures to strengthen the safety net for the unemployed and so ease concerns about job security .
There will also be new infrastructure spending .
Much of the expenditure on public works in the 1990s is now considered wasteful , so this time the focus is meant to be on projects that boost productivity , such as an expansion of Tokyo's Haneda airport .
Better crafted stimulus measures which raise long - run growth are also less likely to spook bond markets concerned about the government 's vast debt .
So long as the extra measures are not delayed by an early election ( which must be called by September ) , Japan 's total fiscal stimulus in 2009 could be the largest among the G7 economies .
But it would not be enough to prevent a sharp widening of the output gap ( the difference between actual GDP and what the economy could produce at full capacity ) .
This had already risen to 4 % of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008 , and it is likely to approach 10 % by the end of 2009 , twice as much as in the 1990s downturn ( see bottom chart , above ) .
This gaping economic hole is again putting downward pressure on prices .
By late summer consumer prices could be more than 2 % lower than a year before — a faster decline than during Japan 's previous bout of deflation .
The risk is that deflation will squeeze profits and hence jobs , thereby further depressing demand and prices .
The BOJ cut interest rates to 0.1 % in December and it has introduced several measures to keep credit flowing , such as buying commercial paper and corporate bonds , as well as shares held by banks , which boosts their capital ratios .
In contrast to the 1990s , bank lending is still growing .
The BOJ has also stepped up its purchases of government bonds , but after its experience in 2001 - 06 , the bank remains sceptical that such “ quantitative easing ” can lift inflationary expectations and spur demand .
One big difference is that the previous episode of quantitative easing coincided with stringent budget - tightening under Junichiro Koizumi , the then prime minister .
The budget deficit was reduced from 8 % of GDP in 2002 to 1.4 % in 2006 ( which partly explains why domestic demand was weak ) .
The combination of fiscal expansion and government - bond purchases by the BOJ should work better .
The OECD predicts that public - sector debt will approach 200 % of GDP in 2010 , so the scope for further fiscal stimulus will be limited .
Nor can Japan rely on exports for future growth ; to the extent that it had enjoyed an export bubble , foreign demand will not return to its previous level .
Japan needs to spur domestic spending .
One possible option , which the government is exploring , is to unlock the vast financial assets of the elderly .
Japanese households ' stash of savings is equivalent to more than five times their disposable income , the highest of any G7 economy , and three - fifths of it is held by people over 60 years old .
Gifts to children are taxed like ordinary income , but if this tax were reduced , increased transfers could boost consumption and housing investment since the young have a much higher propensity to consume .
In theory , this could give a much bigger boost to the economy than any likely fiscal stimulus .
Of course , one reason why the elderly are cautious about running down their assets is concern about the mismanaged pension system and future nursing care .
Services for the elderly should be among Japan 's fastest growing industries and create lots of new jobs , but they are held back by regulations which restrict competition and supply .
Deregulation of services would not only help to improve the living standards of an ageing population , but by helping to unlock savings might also drag the economy out of deep recession .
Japan 's second lost decade holds worrying lessons for other rich economies .
Its large fiscal stimulus succeeded in preventing a depression in the 1990s after its bubble burst — and others are surely correct to follow today .
But Japan 's failure to spur a strong domestic recovery a decade later suggests that America and Europe may also have a long , hard journey ahead .
General Motors Corp. is readying plans to ditch its fabled Pontiac , an 82 - year - old division that last flourished selling sporty , muscle cars , people familiar with the matter said Friday .
During its heyday three decades ago , Pontiac was the launching ground for young auto designers and executives including John DeLorean .
But its sales have tumbled 70 % since their peak in 1978 , and the unit in recent years has been a steady money loser .

After years of silence , the Fallout massively multiplayer role - playing game has suddenly become major headline fodder .
Two weeks after the once - mighty publisher announced that it had entered into a partnership with Earthrise publisher Masthead Studios to codevelop Project V13 , the game 's code name , its once - nearly - bankrupt publisher Interplay announced that the project is in jeopardy .
We 'd like that MMORPG IP back , please .
In an April 15 10 - K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Interplay reports that Bethesda Softworks has announced its intent to cancel the deal that gave Interplay rights to make a Fallout massively multiplayer game .
The deal was struck in 2007 , when Bethesda - - after having licensed the right to make Fallout 3 from Interplay in 2004 -- bought the Fallout intellectual property ( IP ) outright .
The Maryland - based company then licensed the Fallout MMORPG rights back to Interplay , provided that the latter company began developing such a project within two years .
Now , according to the 10-K , Bethesda and Interplay 's deal is unraveling .
" Interplay recently received notice that Bethesda Softworks , LLC ( ' Bethesda ' ) intends to terminate the trademark license agreement between Bethesda and Interplay which was entered into April 4 , 2007 for the development of a Fallout MMOG , " states the filing .
" Despite the fact that no formal action is currently pending , Bethesda claims that Interplay is in breach of the trademark license agreement for failure to commence full - scale development of same by April 4 , 2009 and to secure certain funding for the MMOG . "
" Although the potential damages are currently unknown , if Bethesda ultimately prevails and cancels the trademark license agreement , Interplay would lose its license back of the ' Fallout ' MMOG and any damages resulting therefrom are unknown at this time . "
When asked for comment , Bethesda vice president of marketing Pete Hines declined to elaborate .
" As it 's a legal matter , none of that is stuff we can comment on , " he told GameSpot .
Hines also declined to comment on what would happen if the Fallout MMORPG license were to revert to Bethesda and its parent company , ZeniMax Media .
However , it 's unlikely that such a prized property would lie fallow for long .
In August 2007 , ZeniMax announced that it was opening its own MMOG studio , rumored to be working on a massively multiplayer spin-off of Bethesda 's popular fantasy RPG series , The Elder Scrolls .
In October of that year , the division scored $ 300 million in funding , although little has been heard about its project -- or projects -- since .
This weekend I found myself staring out the window at the abundant chives growing in my garden .
What could I possibly do with them , I wondered , except eat them on baked potatoes ?
And how many baked potatoes can I eat before I never want to see another spud again ?
Then it occurred to me that I 've made potato bread before , so why not add chives to potato bread ?
And , heck , while I 'm at it , why not throw in some other tater toppings like sour cream and bacon and have a full - on Baked Potato Bread ?
By the time I had second thoughts about it , all of the ingredients were mixed together .
But , you know what ?
It turned out excellent , the perfect accompaniment to a pot of corn chowder on a rainy day .
The full recipe is below .
Freestyle Baking
As I have written about time and time again , I think the real fun in baking comes once you have mastered the basics and understand how adding different ingredients in different proportions will change the character of your loaf .
Whether I am making up a recipe or checking out a new recipe in a cookbook , my point of reference is always the loaf I introduced in lesson 1 , which is 3 cups flour , 1 + a little cups of water , 2 teaspoons yeast , 2 teaspoons salt .
If I read a recipe and it has more water than , say , a cup and a quarter of water per three cups of flour I know it is going to a slack dough ; more fats ( butter , milk ) : a softer loaf ; contains sugars : a sweet loaf ; and so on .
When thinking up this recipe , I took the lesson one recipe , substituted potatoes for about 20 percent of the flour , substituted sour cream for about 50 % of the water , and added the chives and bacon and bacon fat .
It sounded easy enough , though I made some adjustments as I started baking , as you 'll see below .
Potato Bread
I do n't believe that I 've every posted about a potato bread on this site , so a little introduction is in order .
Replacing between 10 and 30 percent of your flour with mashed potatoes results in a wonderful soft , moist loaf of bread .
Potato flakes or potato starch can be used , as well , but leftover mashed potatoes work great even if they have some butter or milk or salt in them .
Do be careful , though : potatoes are considerably lower in gluten than wheat , so add too much potato and you will end with a dense , moist loaf , probably too much like a baked potato for anyone 's liking .
I find 1/2 cup potatoes to around 3 cups flour to be plenty .
In this recipe I used a couple of small red potatoes that we had steamed up as a side dish for dinner the night before .
All I did was mash them up with a fork and mix them into the flour .
I left the skins on before mashing them because I find the little red flakes speckling the loaf to be quite attractive .
Bacon is n't to everyone 's liking , either for dietary or religious reasons .
I see no reason why this recipe would n't be good even if you excluded it , but if it something you are able to indulge in I suggest you do .
I definitely think it improved the flavor and consistency ( and appearance , for that matter ) of the loaf .
Enough blabbing .
On to the recipe !
Baked Potato Bread
Makes 2 small ( one pound ) loaves or one large loaf
1/2 cup mashed potatoes
3 to 4 cups all - purpose unbleached flour ( I 'll explain the ambiguity below )
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cooked bacon
1/2 cup chopped fresh chives
To begin , chop up two or three slices of bacon and fry them up .
Remove them from the heat .
Mix the mashed potatoes , yeast , salt , and 2 cups of the flour together in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer .
If you have active dry yeast and want to substitute , read this .
Add the sour cream , water , chives , and bacon and mix together until all ingredients are combined .
I also mixed in the bacon fat , which there was about a tablespoon of in the pan , because it improves the flavor of the loaf .
At this point you 'll have a very wet , sticky mess , probably more of a batter than a dough .
Add additional flour a handful ( 1/8 cup ) at a time and mix or knead it in .
( I lost track of exactly how much extra flour I added , but it seems like it was around 9 or 10 hands full .
I added 4 or 5 hands full and mixed them in while the dough was still in the bowl , then I poured the dough out onto a well - floured cutting board and added more , kneading it with my hands which I repeatedly dipped in flour to keep the dough from sticking to them .
After 5 or 10 minutes of this I ended up with something that was still quite sticky , but was definitely in the realm of a dough and not a batter : it could be formed into a ball and generally held its shape . )
Once you have combined the ingredients well and gotten the balance of flour and water to a level that seems acceptable , return the dough to a well - oiled bowl .
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise for 90 minutes at room temperature or until it has doubled in size .
Remove the dough from the bowl and shape the loaf or loaves .
Notice how moist and gummy my dough was when I cut it to shape it into two loaves :
One probably could add more flour and make an acceptable loaf of bread with a drier dough , but I 've been finding that I get better results the wetter I am able to leave it .
But this really is an art , not a science , so use your own best judgement .
At this point you need to shape the loaves , cover them loosely and let them rise until they double in size again , about 45 minutes .
You could put them in greased baking pans and let them rise and bake them in those .
I wanted round loaves , so I put them in a couple of couche lined baskets :
Professional bakers use these kinds of baskets , which are very nice but completely out of my price range .
I found two small baskets at Goodwill for 49 cents each and have found that they help keep the shape of my rounds very well .
The baking couche I got from a neighbor who works in bakery .
It works very well , but you can fake the same thing with a well floured kitchen towel ( the linen kind , not a fuzzy one ) .
As you can see in the picture above , I placed the baskets on a table , the couche over the baskets , and the dough in the floured couche in the baskets .
I wrapped the edges of the couche around the balls of dough and let them rise .
When they had risen I simply unwrapped the loaves and shook them out of the couche onto my peel ( which I dust with semolina flour ) and threw them into the oven .
While the loaves are rising again , preheat the oven to 425 .
If you have a baking stone , be sure to put it in early to heat .
When they have doubled in size ( as I said before , about 45 minutes after shaping ) , put the loaves in the oven to bake .
I baked them at 425 for 5 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 350 and baked them another half an hour .
The loaves are done when the internal temperature reaches the 185 to 195 degree range ( as read with an instant - read thermometer ) or when they are nice and brown on the outside and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom .
For me this took about 35 minutes .
And there we have it .
The bread was wonderful while still warm with a pot of soup , but I actually think I preferred it the next day cold .
With the bacon fat and sour cream , there was plenty of fat in the bread so it did n't need to be buttered ; just plain it was rich and moist enough .
SAN JOSE , Calif. , April 1 ( UPI ) -- A
Texas couple who say Internet posters made their lives " torture " after they were charged with rape are closer to stripping away their tormentors ' anonymity .
A judge in California turned down a motion by Topix.com to quash a subpoena for identifying information on 178 anonymous posters , ABC News reported .
The judge ordered the Web site to discuss with the plaintiff couple which documents are relevant to the case .

The ruling was issued Friday in Santa Clara County .
Mark and Rhonda Lesher of Clarksville , Texas , and a man who works on their ranch were acquitted of rape .
But they say their legal vindication has not stopped the stream of anonymous posts on the Internet accusing them of even more serious crimes and their lives have been " torture . "
In a lawsuit filed in February , the Leshers named the 178 user names responsible for the most scurrilous comments on Topix .
They have been the subject of about 25,000 posts .
While in jail for a misdemeanor , a US citizen who is both mentally ill and illiterate , signed a waiver agreeing to be deported to Mexico as an illegal immigrant without a hearing .
For months his mother searched for him in Tijuana and for months he was homeless in Mexico .
He was found trying to cross the border back to the States .
In one month the U.S. government has deported at least 55 U.S. citizens according to an investigation by Associated Press ( AP ) .
However , immigration lawyers say there are actually hundreds of US citizens who have been deported .
But the exact number will remain unknown , as long as no one is responsible for , or has chosen to take record .
AP say that its investigation revealed U.S. citizens have been detained for periods ranging from a day to five years and that according to U.S. law it is illegal to deport U.S. citizens or detain them for immigration violations .
It says lack of resources to deal with immigration issues results in the detention of citizens who are mentally ill , minorities , poor , children , and / or have outstanding criminal warrants .
And that Americans of Hispanic decent are most likely to be illegally deported from the U.S. .

The ray guns of Edison Giacattoli
Shown above is the TG - 105 or " Super Thur " produced by famous Italian toy arms dealer Edison Giacattoli .
I owned one of these when I was a kid in the early 1980s , but I do n't quite remember where it came from .
I want to say Mom bought it for me either at a flea market or at the local Skaggs - Alpha Beta , which will forever be my personal prototype for a grocery store .
Anyway , I loved my TG - 105 because its styling was so much more sophisticated than any other ray gun I had ever seen , with its complex molded grip with integral fingerguards and its light - up targeting screen at the rear .
The unusual level of detail in the toy has attracted the attention of more than one sci- fi propmaster .
Notably , the Lassiter laser pistol prototype from Episode 110 of Joss Whedon 's Firefly is clearly built around a TG - 105 , or at least around a cheap knock - off thereof .
This happens to EG 's designs all the time .
I 've got a collection of interesting knock - offs I 'll post elsewhere .
Now flash forward about 15 years , when my interest in ray guns was rekindled by , among other things , Justin Pinchot 's fantastic site .
Although the site has changed format since that time , it used to include a photographic index of prominent designs by country and decade , and I was excited to discover that my beloved TG - 105 was actually part of a series of ray guns produced by Edison Giacattoli in the late 70s and early 80s as part of their " TH3 Project " line .
Also listed on Justin 's site , if I recall correctly , were the " Thur " and the ZN - NNN ( which I 'll get to later ) .
I set up automatic daily searches on eBay for these other models , and eventually , to use my friend Billy 's phrase , " the global stream of crap " brought them to me .
Shown above is the Thur .
This one , with snazzy metalized grip , came as part of a play - set with a considerably - less - well - made plastic thigh holster .
It also , luckily , came with its original packaging .
On the back of the box were pictures of the other guns in the TH3 line .
They all looked pretty cool , but the " Super Thur LR , " shown above , was by far the most drool - inducing .
Alas , as every collector knows , there 's always One That Got Away , and , in the five or so years I 've been collecting EG ray guns , I 've never even seen any evidence that a Super Thur LR was ever manufactured or sold .
I 've had a number of automatic searches running for years now without so much as a glimmer .
If anyone out there has one , I 'm prepared to pay handsomely for it .
Please contact me .
The other " back of the box " models fell more quickly .
Shown above is the " Tharos , " which is a smaller and arguably more " feminine " version of the Thur , which I believe exists at least in part to accommodate girls .
It only took a couple of months for one of these to appear in my daily eBay search results .
Like the Thur , the Tharos is a cap gun , distinguishable from the other electronic - noise - making ( " Spacetronic " ) guns in the TH3 line as part of EG 's so - called " Spacematic " series .
It fires EG 's proprietary plastic strip caps .
The " Super Tharos " ( aka " TH3 " ) , shown above , is to the Tharos what the Super Thur is to the Thur - - a kind of amplified electronic noise - making version .
These , too , are relatively common .
I own several of them , including at least one which I believe is a pirated knock - off .
This was a relatively recent find .
The " Thitan , " as it is called , appeared one day among the results of a daily search on the word " Giaccatoli . "
I 've seen at least two for sale on eBay .
These last three are from the " International Special Corp " ( ISC ) line .
They fire little foam bullets , either from a revolver - type magazine , as in the ZX - 271 , or from an automatic - feed " stack " type magazine as in the case of the other two .
The ZV - 263 was an especially pleasant surprise for me when it appeared amongst my eBay search results , because I 'd never seen it before and , let 's face it , it looks super wicked .
Reporter 's Note : President Barack Obama says if Americans have ideas on how to run the country , they should let him know .
So I am writing a letter a day , if only to show my dog what it means to respond to a command .
Tom Foreman | Bio
AC360° Correspondent
Dear Mr. President ,
Do you remember what I wrote a few days ago , about the extraordinary impact of everything a president does ?
You may recall I framed it in terms of your potential impact on hat sales .
Well , Bob ’s - your - uncle , here ’s an example coming down the pike !
The pro-legalization of marijuana crowd is dancing in the streets because you dissed their cause during that Online Town Hall Meeting of yours , and now the money is just pouring in .
Folks at The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws say donations have quadrupled , and I ’m willing to bet they have some ideas about how to celebrate .
Chips anyone ?
Anyway , see what I mean ?
Nothing seems to energize a cause , either for or against something , quite like a President stating his opinion .
That said , I noticed that you did n’t exactly say what I ’m sure a lot of people think they heard .
The question was something like , “ Do you think legalizing marijuana might be a good way to improve the economy and create jobs ? ”
And you laughed , made a crack about the inhaling - vs - not inhaling state of the on - line crowd , and then said , “ No , I do n’t think that is a good strategy to grow our economy . ”
It would be awfully easy for a casual listener ( and I should note , a lot of my colleagues in the media reported it this way ) to believe that you said you were flat out opposed to legalizing marijuana .
And while that would be consistent with what you ’ve said in the past , it also steps around some of the nuance in your position .
For example , it makes no mention of how you ran for Senate by generally favoring the idea of decriminalizing marijuana , as opposed to legalizing it ; then you campaigned for President saying there should still be criminal penalties .
I know your campaign insisted that you always said the same thing ; that you feel marijuana possession or use should not be legal , but the penalties should also not be so harsh as to be counter - productive … something like that .
But here ’s the thing : saying you do n’t think legalization “ is a good strategy to grow our economy ” leaves a lot of gray out there .
Are you opposing it as an economic concept ?
Are you opposing it as a health issue ?
Are you really opposing it at all , or just saying you do n’t think it is the right move at the moment ?
Meaning maybe it will be good in the future ?
Your position on legalizing marijuana is yours to decide and I would not presume to tell you what to do .
But I will suggest that statements which can be seen as ambiguous by those interested in the bigger question , or as slippery by those who suspect your pledge of transparency , will not serve you well in the long run .
You ’ve promised to be different than past presidents .
So either say you are for legalized marijuana , you are against it , or you do n’t want to talk about it .
Then hold your ground .
But make your position sharp , clear , and unmistakable .
For a President , that really would be a change .
Ahh …Monday .
Back to the grind , eh ?
Call if you can .
I think my schedule is pretty packed , but I ’ll always make time for a chat .
Regards ,
Tom
For more of the Foreman Letters , go here .
I wrote last week about Barack Obama further laying out his plans for renewable energy .
He states in that video that he plans to invest $ 15 Billion or more in renewable energy each year .
My question is , what can we start doing now ?
In order for him and the renewable energy community to hit the ground running on Jan 20th , we need to start planning some actions for the new administrations ( with or without funding ) .
Education —
Without a new crop of able young engineers , we wo n’t get far .
So how do you get involved in helping to make this a reality ?
Follow my volunteer idea and go to middle - and high - schools and share what it ’s like to be an engineer with young people .
Even better , I recently found out that I was right in thinking I was not original … there are many programs in place to allow engineers to easily reach out to their communities .
The one I am currently considering is the New Faces of Engineering Road Show , hosted by the Cleveland Engineering Society .
They travel to schools and promote engineering and science to young students , basically the exact thing I wanted to do .
Conserve —
The best way that individuals can help on a daily basis is to conserve , in general .
Use less utilities ( turn off your lights , turn down your heat ) , recycle your recyclables , carpool to work Stay involved —
This year has shown young people actually can make a difference in elections and in general .
This is due to the extreme influence of social media and how it connects people online and throughout the world .
Now use that power to go out and influence individuals and corporations that a green economy will benefit all Americans ( and the world ) .
Consider alternative and renewable energies —
Black silicon or not , photovoltaic ( PV ) cells are still expensive .
However , there are simpler methods , such as corn stoves , which have lower environmental impact and are definitely renewable year after year .
Keep them honest —
No matter how good their stump speeches are nor how honest they may seem , absolute power corrupts absolutely .
While the checks and balances were put in place by our forefathers to keep our branches of government watching one another , the true power in oversight will come from civilian oversight .
This has been further enabled by the internet in recent years and we must insist that our newly elected government officials do not take advantage of their positions for personal or nepotistic gain .
Join the fight —
Sure , there will be more political battles , notably with oil barons not wanting to relinquish their grasp on easy profits ; but the real battle is with innovation and design challenges .
Use online resources to go out and educate yourself on analog electronics .
The biggest challenges will be won by the groups with the most resources .
If we want a future filled with solar and wind generated power , go out and learn how to make that a reality by studying the basics .
Start something —
Been studying this stuff for so long that you think you have a great idea on improving an existing system ( the power grid , anyone ? ) or developing a disruptive renewable energy technology ?
Go for it .
In order for the green revolution to begin , America ( and the rest of the world ) needs entrepreneurs to step up to the plate and take risks in order to develop these emerging technologies .
Do you prefer the less technical side of engineering ?
Pair up with the entrepreneurs .
Technically minded people are just as important to take the time to introduce the new technology to the rest of the world .
Good luck President Obama .
You have a huge challenge ahead of you , a huge wreckage behind you and a huge nation standing and waiting for you to wave the green flag .
Let ’s all try and toe the line as soon as we can .
Stepping into my hands - on with Riot Games ' League of Legends , I was n't entirely sure what to expect .
I had n't really heard much about it other than that it was an RTS / RPG game that started out as the popular Warcraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients .
When I sat down and actually played with the game for a while , I quickly realized that this was one of the coolest games on display at this year 's Game Developers Conference .
The basic premise of the game is that players play the role of a summoner who enters into battles with other summoners : each summoner chooses a champion to fight on his behalf , and then players control the avatars in battle .
Each avatar possesses totally different abilities and combat styles : Nuna the Yeti-Rider is effectively a tank unit , Master Yi is a sneaky swordsman , and Alistar the Minotaur is a brawler .
The match I participated in had me playing as a healer / priest , but I learned that it was possible to use my champion as both a support and attack class once I learned her strengths and limitations .
Learning to control — and eventually mastering — any of these characters will take some time to learn , but once you 've got the basics down , they 're a ton of fun to play .
The game is built on the idea of creating an RPG / RTS title that utilizes the same concept of multiplayer matches in the way that games like Counterstrike and Team Fortress 2 do .
Players will choose their avatars and level them up during matches as they gain experience .
However , the avatars ' abilities will reset at the beginning of each match .
Meanwhile , as summoners earn experience points , they will earn new abilities and spells that wo n't reset at the end of a match .
When I first saw League of Legends , I was convinced that the developer had actually managed to adapt the World of Warcraft graphics engine to work with RTS gameplay .
The graphics feature the same cartoony style that dominates Blizzard 's games , but closer inspection revealed that the game featured differences in environment and character models .
I was informed that Riot had developed their own internal graphics engine and Hokyo Lim ( the man behind the graphics of the Sly Cooper games ) was League of Legends ' art director .
The game really looks great , featuring dynamic colors and an animation - like style .
Overall , I found League of Legends to be fast , fun , and stylish ; aspects that are lacking in many of the games that I 've seen on display during the week so far .
The game is tentatively scheduled for a release later on this year , and since it will provide fast - paced RTS / RPG action online ( sadly , no single - player campaign is scheduled ) with no subscription costs , it seems safe to say that anyone interested in games like Warcraft or Starcraft should definitely keep their eyes on this title .
Bill would limit ' overboard ' Patriot Act subpoena power Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 30 , 2009

This A bipartisan bill introduced to Congress on Monday aims to curtail " overboard " subpoena power given to federal authorities by the Patriot Act .
Congressmen Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) and Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) said in a release that National Security Letters , used by federal authorities to cull private information such as Internet histories and financial records , have led to " rampant abuse " and must be curbed .
" To ensure that Americans ' privacy and free speech rights are protected , there must be clear oversight and strict guidelines tied to the use of NSLs , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office , in an advisory on Monday .
" Mr. Nadler and Mr. Flake should be applauded for taking this legislative step .
Their bill will realign the current NSL authority with the Constitution .
Congress must take this opportunity to rein in the power of the NSL . "
" Government reports confirm that upwards of 50,000 of these secret record demands go out each year , " noted IPS News .
The ACLU 's press release follows .
####
Congressmen Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) and Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) introduced legislation today to narrow the overbroad subpoena power in the National Security Letter ( NSL ) provision of the Patriot Act .
The bipartisan bill , National Security Letters Reform
Act of 2009 , aims to curb rampant abuse of that power by federal law enforcement following the expansion of the Patriot Act and was introduced with 17 cosponsors .
NSLs are secret subpoenas used to demand personal customer records from Internet Service Providers , financial institutions and credit companies without prior court approval .
" To ensure that Americans ' privacy and free speech rights are protected , there must be clear oversight and strict guidelines tied to the use of NSLs , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Mr. Nadler and Mr. Flake should be applauded for taking this legislative step .
Their bill will realign the current NSL authority with the Constitution .
Congress must take this opportunity to rein in the power of the NSL . "
NSLs were originally crafted to gain information about suspected terrorists but the Patriot Act expanded the statute to allow the subpoenas , which are issued in secrecy , do not require court review , and contain a gag order , to be used to obtain personal information about people who are simply deemed " relevant " to an investigation .
After the statute 's expansion , the Department of Justice 's Office of the Inspector General released a series of reports over the last several years outlining systemic misuse and abuse of NSLs by FBI agents .
The ACLU is asking that Congress repeal the expanded NSL authorities that allow the FBI to demand information about innocent people who are not the targets of any investigation and reinstate prior standards limiting NSLs to information about terrorism suspects and other agents of foreign powers .
In December of 2008 , as a result of an ACLU lawsuit , the gag order provision was struck down as unconstitutional .
The ACLU is now advocating that Congress legislate a constitutional alternative .
The National Security Letters Reform
Act of 2009 would make these necessary changes .
" By expanding the scope of the statute 's power to collect information on innocent people , the Patriot Act failed to protect Americans ' privacy , " said Michelle Richardson , ACLU Legislative Counsel .
" It has become painfully clear that unchecked Patriot Act power inevitably leads to abuse , and National Security Letters are no exception .
Innocent Americans have been swept into investigations and recipients have been barred from speaking about it publicly .
Representatives Nadler and Flake should be praised for the introduction of this bill and we urge swift action by Congress to assure its passage . "
Earlier this month , the ACLU released a report entitled " Reclaiming Patriotism " that describes the widespread abuses that have occurred under the USA Patriot Act .
The report , authored by policy counsel Michael German and Richardson , was delivered to congressional offices on Capitol Hill , as well as posted to the newly re-launched site www.reformthepatriotact.org in anticipation of the upcoming congressional debate surrounding three Patriot Act provisions due to expire on December 31 , 2009 .
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
Four and a half years ago , a young scientist we ’ll call Otto B. Doing - Better began what he thought would be his dream postdoctoral appointment .
Otto is one of the tens of thousands of foreign scientific and technical workers in the United States on H - 1B visas , which admit nonimmigrant skilled workers for a limited number of years .
A lab chief we ’ll call Manny Grants had promised to help him get the prestigious publications needed for a shot at a faculty post -- and maybe even permanent residence in the United States .
Instead of the career he had hoped for , today Otto has a life in ruins , professionally and personally .
His employment prospects are stymied , and his permission to stay in this country is about to run out .
He sees no choice but to return to his native land and seek work outside of science .
“ I am a postdoc who has been ground up by the current system in U.S. academia , where most of us are foreigners who rely on visas to remain in this country , ” he tells Science Careers .
Postdocs hired at U.S. universities have become , for some time now , a new kind of cheap labor … who are most of the time only allowed to do those experiments that please their bosses , and , on the other hand , cannot many times contribute to the creative scientific process .
-- Otto B. Doing - Better
Professor Grants proved dictatorial and duplicitous when Otto “ made interesting and reproducible findings , ” the young scientist says .
Some of these results “ contradicted some of [ Prof. Grants ’] views . ”
The lab chief used his power , Otto says , to prevent their publication .
He gave Otto no raises and then , citing funding difficulties , fired him .
Lukewarm references kept
Otto from moving to another lab , ultimately costing him the right to remain in this country , which depends on his staying employed .
Most heartbreaking of all , Otto ’s American - born child will stay here with his estranged wife , who has filed for divorce .
H - 1B holders ’ vulnerability to their employers ’ whims is only one of the many features of this controversial visa that attract sharp criticism .
Just about everyone with a stake in the system -- American engineers , scientists , and IT professionals ; high - tech executives and their lobbyists ; influential U.S. senators and the Department of Homeland Security -- finds fault with the program ’s provisions , enforcement , or both .
Visa holders such as Otto complain of exploitation and abuse .
But many American scientists and technical professionals blame the H - 1B visa for allowing temporary foreign workers to drive down wages and displace them from jobs .
Employers , meanwhile , denounce limits on the number of H - 1B visas available , which they say keep them from finding the skilled employees they need .
In ordinary times , the controversy flares into public consciousness in the spring , during well - orchestrated industry lobbying and PR campaigns seeking more visas .
This year , with unemployment mounting and degreed workers feeling the effects more strongly than in past recessions , the issue appears likely to grow much hotter than usual .
Missing Data
Complicating the debate , as usual , is a shortage of basic facts about the H - 1B and its effect on the American scientific and technical labor market .
Complete statistics are not collected on how many temporary foreign scientific and technical workers are in the country , where they work , and whether they leave the country when their visas expire or , as critics suggest , move into the illegal immigrant pool .
One widely quoted report asserts a relationship between the presence of foreign workers and increased job opportunities for Americans , although another analysis debunks the claim .
Recently , the number of available engineering positions has fallen as H - 1B availability remained constant .
What those claiming a technical talent shortage lack in evidence , they make up for in well - funded persuasion .
Indeed , the industry view has won over most national politicians and policymakers .
The plan for science and technology proposed by the Obama campaign , for example , calls for “ comprehensive immigration reform that improves our visa programs to attract some of the world 's most talented people to America ” and supports an increase in the number of foreign scientists and technical people permitted to study , work , and stay in the United States .
Thousands of Americans struggling to start or maintain scientific and technical careers are unlikely to support such a plan .
The plan does , however , promise to answer some of Otto ’s complaints by ensuring that “ workers are less dependent on their employers for their right to stay in the country " and holding accountable employers " who abuse the system and their workers . ”
The Obama document goes on to note that “ while highly skilled immigrants make strong contributions to our domestic technology industry , there are Americans who could be filling those positions given appropriate opportunities for training . ”
These are encouraging words , but the statement does n't go far enough :
What about the thousands of Americans already able to fill those jobs without any further training ?
The United States routinely graduates several times more people with scientific and technical degrees than it employs in those fields , according to the National Science Board ’s Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 .
Even without importing scientific and technical workers from overseas , these figures indicate , employers can find a large supply of skilled talent .
But employers would very likely have to pay these workers more than they pay temporary visa holders .
The desire to pay lower wages -- and not a talent shortage -- is the real reason behind the demand for more H - 1B visas , critics insist .
And , though it may lack political clout , this view has some world - class intellectual backing .
" There is no doubt that the [ H - 1B ] program is a benefit to their employers , enabling them to get workers at a lower wage , and to that extent , it is a subsidy , ” the late Nobel Prize - winning economist Milton Friedman , godfather of market economics , has been quoted as saying .
“ If you get a number of computer programmers who are moving to the United States , as we do under the H - 1B program , … then computer programmers ’ earnings are either going to be hurt or not rise as much as otherwise , ” agreed Friedman ’s fellow economics Nobelist and University of Chicago faculty colleague Gary Becker in a lecture .
Reaching for Reform
When the H - 1B visa was established in 1990 , it was " intended to fill jobs for a temporary amount of time while the country invested in American workers to pick up the skills they needed .
…
Unfortunately , the H - 1B program is so popular that it's now replacing the U.S. labor force , ” said Senator Charles Grassley ( R - IA ) on the Senate floor in November 2007 , according to a press report .
" Some employers have abused the H - 1B and L - 1 temporary work visa programs , using them to bypass qualified American job applicants , ” added Senator Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) in a statement .
Recently , a report by the Department of Homeland Security ’s U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services found widespread fraud in the H - 1B system .
But far more important and damaging than dishonesty , critics insist , are the loopholes and abuses clearly permitted by existing law .
Indian outsourcing firms , for example , currently use large numbers of H - 1B visas to bring workers into the country to train for jobs that are then moved overseas .
In 2007 , Grassley and Durbin co-sponsored a bill , as yet unpassed , that would increase protections for both American workers and H - 1B visa holders .
As the recession deepens , bringing hiring freezes and furloughs to budget - strapped universities across the country and threatening the solvency of private - sector firms , supporters of the Grassley - Durbin proposals appear likely to press anew to pass the bill .
At the very least , H - 1B critics will have strong ammunition -- in the form of high unemployment rates -- against industry ’s annual campaign to get lawmakers to raise the H - 1B limit .
None of this , of course , is any help to current H - 1B casualties like Otto , who is leaving the country embittered by an academic system he believes harms not just powerless individuals but science itself .
“ Postdocs hired at U.S. universities have become , for some time now , a new kind of cheap labor … who are most of the time only allowed to do those experiments that please their bosses , and , on the other hand , cannot many times contribute to the creative scientific process , ” he says .
His former lab chief “ used his powerful position to impose his will and cover up some exciting results of mine , which could have moved the field of cancer research forward . ”
The H - 1B , Otto argues , made this possible .
If the Obama Administration truly wishes to inspire a new generation of Americans “ to excel in , and embrace , science and engineering ” without excluding " innovators from overseas ” as its science and technology document proclaims , then it needs to craft programs that protect both the many Americans hoping for decent - paying science and technology jobs and the foreign scientists coming to this country to work and learn .
An overhaul of the H - 1B is an obvious place to start .

The sturdy , deadening stench of losing had descended on the packed bar in Ann Arbor , where a cadre of students and recent graduates just watched their beloved underdog University of Michigan basketball team take on the University of Oklahoma .
I sat there , trying to bludgeon the irrational frustration — it was , after all , a blessing for the team to have come this far — with pitchers of Miller Lite .
While the beer may have distracted me from the annoying game , and even blurred the score , there is one thing that the beer was unable to accomplish : make Tim Brando shut the fuck up .
Tim Brando , you see , is a rather detestable , hyperbolic game announcer for CBS .
Brando is an in - game part of The Machine , an endless , symbiotic collective of sports announcers , commentators , talking heads , and columnists that decide what THE STORY is for each game or season and beat that story into the ground with a cartoon - sized hammer .
In her farewell column as ESPN ’s ombudsman , the brilliant Le Anne Schreiber broke down the trends she found among the tens of thousands of e-mails she received critiquing the hegemonic sports network .
The greatest concern was ESPN ’s tendency to overplay and over - cover a small amount of teams and storylines .
BONDS , MANNY , A - ROD , SPYGATE , YANKEES / RED SOX , PEYTON CHOKES — these are examples of THE STORY from years past .
Ask any diehard sports fan if they knew that Jerome Bettis was from Detroit — it will elicit an exasperated sigh , formed by the sports media ’s apparent pre-Super Bowl XL decision to expose sports fans to endless stories about how Bettis was born and raised in the same city as the Super Bowl .
Here ’s an example .
Oh , and here and here and here .
You get the idea .
When Bettis’ Steelers ended up winning the game , Bettis was front and center in the resulting coverage .
The commentators mentioned his lackluster performance in the game , but Bettis should never have featured so prominently in the coverage in the first place .
He was a second - string back getting minimal short - yardage carries throughout the season .
He nearly derailed the Steelers ’ championship run when his fumble was nearly returned for a season - ending touchdown ( famously causing a fan ’s heart attack ) .
Bettis became a bigger story than the team , and when that happens , sports fans suffer .
Important storylines get brushed aside ; everyone remembers Bettis ’ role in that Super Bowl , but few remember the prominent role of the horrendous officiating that produced one of the worst championship games in memory .
While it ’s frustrating to have these useless storylines crammed down my throat , there is a simple solution : stop watching all the sports shows .
And that ’s exactly what I did .
I stopped paying attention to most commentary and only have to suffer the frustrating trends for the two to three hours I spend watching an actual sporting event .
That does n’t mean that I do n’t get just as angry listening to Fox ’s Thom Brennaman fawn over Heisman - winning University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow by saying , “ If you 're fortunate to spend five or 20 minutes around Tim Tebow , you 're better for it , ” during this year ’s National Championship Game as if Tebow was a modern - day savior .
There is one sport , though , where I get very , very nervous about these storylines and what they can become .
That ’s basketball .
And that ’s because I lived through the 2006 NBA finals .
In this genius piece , ESPN ’s Bill Simmons explains the terrifying reality behind the middle games of those finals .
Bad refs , he explains , can be swayed by noisy home crowds and especially by star power .
It ’s easy to spot the bad refs during the course of a game — they interrupt the flow , you find yourself scratching your head during multiple calls , the players become visibly upset after several calls , the refs sort of lose control , and everything just feels … off .
Tim Donaghy aside , I remember that 2006 Suns - Spurs playoff game and it was awful to sit through , it felt as if The Man had intervened against the Suns at all cost .
It was bizarre .
Basketball is at the mercy of its refereeing in a way that is unlike any other sport .
It is the only sport where referees can grant uncontested opportunities for points , and do so dozens of time each game .
There is so much contact in basketball that quality refereeing can never really be about enforcing the rules to the letter but must be an attempt to maintain consistency for all players and teams , as well as not having a visible effect on the game .
Since the time of Michael Jordan , NBA stars have routinely gotten the benefit of the doubt when it comes to contact fouls .
This is especially beneficial to players that thrive off driving to the basketball or playing near the hoop — where contact is mostly routine and shooting fouls most commonly awarded .
Thus , in a star match - up between driving players Shaquille O’Neal and Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat against the Dallas Mavericks ’ outside shooter Dirk Nowitzki , as it was in the 2006 finals , the former are always going to benefit from poor - quality refereeing .
Unfortunately , as prognosticators grant star-status to younger and younger players , this phenomenon has trickled into the college ranks .
This is where the worlds of crappy refs and crappy coverage collide .
Leading up to the Michigan - Oklahoma game , star power forward Blake Griffin , thought to be the number one pick in this year ’s upcoming NBA draft , was anointed THE STORY .
I became a little nervous when I read about the brutal foul on Griffin in the previous game .
Would the refs , aware of Griffin ’s star power and the recently publicized hard foul on him , treat him with kid gloves ?
Would they give him the benefit of the doubt that can shift the tides in the momentum - dependent NCAA tournament ?
Would Michigan be allowed to touch him ?
I got my answer early on , and just to clarify that it was n’t the TV playing tricks , Michigan ’s normally even - keeled head coach , John Beilein , got a technical foul while yelling at the refs for allowing Griffin to run over Michigan players without penalty .
To be clear , Oklahoma was the better team and Griffin was outstanding ; Michigan did not and should not have won that game .
But it was still awful to sit there and watch Griffin run over double teams and be awarded foul shouts for what Michigan blogger Brian Cook described as “ someone look[ing ] sideways at him . ”
This then got compounded with Brando ’s constant yammering about Griffin ’s brilliance , while refusing to acknowledge the cushy treatment he was getting every time he went to the lane .
At one point , Brando , apparently forgetting the likes of Jordan , Wade , O’Neal , Carmelo Anthony , or even someone like last year ’s tournament star Derrick Rose , described Griffin as a “ once- in - a - lifetime talent ” during the two - hour lovefest .
This was Blake Griffin ’s game , and there was nothing I could do stop it .
All I ’m saying is we need to get some new basketball refs and sports historians , and I ’ll finally be able to sleep soundly again .

Boeing unveiled a new version of its F - 15 Eagle airplane , called the F - 15SE , which is aimed primarily for export .
The new design includes several improvements over earlier versions of the F - 15 , including improved stealth capabilities and a bay designed for carrying internal weapons as well as improved radar and electronic scanners .
The major innovation of the F - 15 Silent Eagle ( SE ) design is its new internal weapons bay .
Some of the current models of the F - 15 include the ability to carry extra fuel storage in the form of conformal fuel tanks ( CFTs ) , which are fuel cells located underneath the body of the plane and are shaped in such a way that will minimize the drag on the aircraft .
The new F15SE substitute the CFT module with a similar unit which can carry weapons internally instead of fuel .
The new system can house either air - to - air missiles , such as the AIM - 9 and AIM - 120 , as well as small air - to - ground weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) and Small Diameter Bomb ( SDB ) .
Every new tank will be able to hold two air - to - air missiles or 1,000 / 500 - pound JDAMs ; alternatively up to four 250 - pound SDBs can be carried per tank .
Another design change is the addition of canted vertical tails which improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the craft while providing more lift and reducing the weight of the aircraft frame .
The new F - 15SE also incorporates a BAE Systems Digital Electronic Warfare System ( DEWS ) and the Raytheon Advanced Electronic Scanning Array ( AESA ) to improve situational awareness and electronic countermeasures capabilities .
Improvements in stealth using special coating and other treatments are also promised although no specific details have been provided at this time .
The F - 15SE will be available to international customers ( unlike the F - 22 which is currently limited to the USAF only ) .
The F - 15SE is still in the design phase ; early testing of the internal weapons carriage including live weapons testing is planned for early 2010 .
Young , In Debt , and Falling Behind : The Plight of New Graduates
Created : April 21 , 2009 09:42 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
It should be no surprise that the weak economy is making it especially tough for new college graduates trying to find jobs .
But huge student loan debts are adding to their dilemma — the payments do n’t go away just because the job market is tough .
The Wall Street Journal reports today that student loan defaults are soaring to their highest rates in over a decade :
According to new numbers from the U.S. Department of Education , default rates for federally guaranteed student loans are expected to reach 6.9 % for fiscal year 2007 .
That ’s up from 4.6 % two years earlier and would be the highest rate since 1998 .
The situation is mirrored in the smaller private student - loan market .
In 2008 , SLM Corp. also known as Sallie Mae , wrote off 3.4 % of its private loans that were already considered troubled , according to its latest annual report — more than double the figure in 2006 .
Student Loan Corp. , a unit of Citigroup Inc. , wrote off 2.3 % of those loans in 2008 , compared with 1.5 % a year earlier .
“ The volume of people in trouble is definitely increasing , ” says Deanne Loonin , a staff attorney at the Boston - based National Consumer Law Center who counsels low - income consumers on student loans and other debt issues .
What ’s particularly disturbing is how much debt some students have as soon as they leave college .
From The Journal :
Sarah Kostecki , a 24 - year - old sales associate in New York , graduated last year from DePaul University with a major in international studies and $ 87,000 in debt , translating to monthly payments of $ 685 , the vast majority of which are private loans .
The payments represent more than a third of her take - home pay , and to help her make ends meet , her grandparents are giving her $ 200 a month toward her debt this year .
Beginning in January , she ’ll be on her own , and she worries about falling behind .
“ It feels like I ’m being punished for having gone to school , ” Ms. Kostecki says .
She has contemplated some of the options offered by private loan companies , such as temporary interest - only payments .
But after two years , her payments would jump by almost $ 200 a month on top of what she ’s paying now , she says .
“ I do n’t want that . ”
Owing nearly $ 700 a month as soon as you graduate is insane .
No wonder some new graduates feel like they are drowning in a mountain of debt .
The options for those who ca n’t pay right now are n’t that great , either , because the interest on their loans keeps growing and they ’ll just face higher payments in the future .
The problem , of course , is rising college costs .
If they are n’t brought under control soon , only the wealthy will graduate without facing mountains of debt .
That situation could discourage some high school graduates from even trying to pursue a college degree .
And that would be a tragedy .
One of this country ’s greatest strengths is its higher education system , which traditionally has been open to everyone , regardless of income .
But tuition costs , combined with the credit crunch , are threatening the entire system .
States do n’t have the money these days to help keep tuition down at public universities .
Graduates with mountains of debt can’t easily refinance .
Private loans are expensive and hard to come by .
Rising default rates are just the start of what is becoming yet another crisis , one that will hit families with big dreams of higher education for their kids especially hard .

Ending the War on Drugs would save countless lives from being lost or ruined .
An enormous drain on our economy would cease .
It would be great .
Ending the War on Drugs would be a tremendous first step , but then what ?
The government would still have all the police powers it used to have .
Perhaps they could be convinced to cut them back a bit , but we know from painful experience how hard it is to get the government to give up a power it has acquired .
No doubt it would n't take them long to find other laws for their bloated police agencies to enforce on us .
They have to justify those big budgets somehow .
A key point here is that the source of the problem is not the War on Drugs , that is merely the symptom .
The problem is that the government has the means to enforce laws like the drug prohibition .
Once it had the power it then passed the bad laws .
( Of course , once they had these bad laws to enforce they then used the higher crime rates these bad laws created to justify more , and more powerful , police . )
The only way to ensure that there wo n't be a repetition of the War on Drugs fiasco is to abolish policing as we know it today .
The ending of the prohibition of alcohol proves this point .
They merely switched from punishing bootleggers and drinkers to punishing drug dealers and users .
We need to move to a system of private security .
There is no need for local police .
History has already proved that private security is better at protecting us than the government is .
A shining example is Oro Valley , Arizona .
In 1975 they hired Rural / Metro Fire Department , Inc. to essentially be their police department providing the services previously provided by the county sheriff .
Crime rates where greatly reduced at a fraction of the cost of a government police force .
( See Guns for Protection , and Other Private Sector Responses to the Government 's Failure to Control Crime , page 22 of the PDF page counter )
There is no need for national level law enforcement .
Agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation ; the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives ; and the Drug Enforcement Administration are merely instruments of oppression enforcing mostly unconstitutional laws .
One is reminded of Thomas Jefferson 's words about the distant and overly powerful capitol , “ When all government , domestic and foreign , in little as in great things , shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power , it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated . ”
So not only is private security better able to protect people and property , they have a provider / client relationship with them .
Under this scenario there is no incentive for private security to enforce something like the Drug Prohibition and the government would n't have the means to do so .
Policing as we know it today got its start in the mid 19th century .
It was n't truly about preventing crime as crime rates were quite low back then .
It was all about expanding the government 's power .
Fast forward to today and we find that the greatest threat to our lives , liberty , and property is the government .
This is due to their tremendous police power .
The only way for us to preserve ( restore ? ) our rights is to take that power away from the government .
The inspiration for this article was the presentation given by the Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) speaker Neill Franklin at the Montgomery County Libertarian Party ( PA ) Liberty Forum on 4/20/09 .
This is a great organization composed of courageous individuals trying to right one of the worse wrongs of our time .
I thank them for their tireless efforts .
Carry on , I 'm with you , my friends at LEAP .
Just remember that ending the War on Drugs is merely the first step .
Of all the essays I ’ve written for Ebon Musings , one of my favorites is “ Into the Clear Air “ : a chronicle of the stages of deconversion , as told by people who were going through them .
What shines through from these testimonies again and again is the pure relief , the freedom experienced by people who left behind their oppressive , confining religious beliefs and found exhilaration and joy in finally taking control of their own lives .
Closely intertwined with this feeling is a newly arisen sense of awe and wonder at life , an atheist spirituality that is rooted in the grandeur of the cosmos , the intricacy and diversity of nature , and the poignancy and fragility of our conscious existence .
Many newly deconverted atheists have found out , to their amazement , that this feeling equals or surpasses anything to be found in religion .
As one of my favorite deconversion stories puts it :
“ Due to my total change of world view I also had some very weird experiences that were not like anything I had expected .
I was struck enormously by what I called ‘ existential shock . ’
I was completely amazed at the mere fact of existence .
Not in a ‘ wow that ’s impressive ’ manner but in a feeling that I only had religious words for .
It was being struck by the amazing ‘ sacrament ’ of life – or the utter shock and opportunity of existence over its alternative .
It was totally numinous and an almost disturbing feeling that existence is the case .
I felt transformed , awed , excited – the whole world seemed more special than can ever be said .
Life was far more poignant without Christianity than it had ever been with it .
I was not expecting this to happen to me .
I thought these experiences were what converted people to religion , not what you got when you left ! ”
I think testimonies like this are immensely helpful to our cause , demonstrating that atheism is a positive worldview in a more eloquent and compelling way than any merely academic argument ever could .
That ’s why I ’ve collected as many as I could find for Ebon Musings , but we can always use more .
With that in mind , I ’m creating this open thread for what I hope will become an ongoing post series , chronicling the stories of people who ’ve broken free of religion and found happiness and fulfillment by becoming an atheist or humanist .
If you have such a story , I invite you to tell it here .
You can also e-mail me with your story , if you ’re more comfortable with that .
The best stories will ultimately be featured either here on Daylight Atheism or on Ebon Musings .
In a state that gave America its 2008 Republican presidential candidate and regularly elects conservative policy makers , a snapshot survey of 950 Arizona teenagers indicates that they are leaning decidedly left .
Among the results of a survey released today : 75 percent support giving illegal immigrants a chance to become citizens , 72 percent believe global warming is long - term and human - caused , and 65 percent say women have a right to choose abortion .
Greater legal restrictions on gun ownership get a nod from 56 percent .
Although nearly half report that religion plays an important role in their lives , half also agree religious faith is n't necessary to live a moral life and nearly 60 percent say religion should not play a large role in public policy .
Arizona State University 's Morrison Institute surveyed young people ages 13 to 19 .
Although not a scientific poll , the written survey is a large sampling , a good snapshot of the kids surveyed and reflects a national trend , said Fred Solop , a Northern Arizona University political scientist .
" There is greater liberalization taking place on these greater issues , " said Solop , adding that he thinks this young generation will hang on to their politically left leanings .
" People are socialized into their thinking about the broader world in their teen years , and they tend to hold onto those attitudes , with some variations , as they age . "
As people age and enter the job market and pay taxes , their political opinions on financial matters are more likely to change than their social attitudes , said Margaret Kenski , a political pollster based in Tucson .
Social attitudes change with each generation , she said .
" There 's greater exposure to different media and different ideas , and you would have more acceptance of abortion , you would certainly have more acceptance of a gay American , and you 'd also be raised in an atmosphere that was more ethnically diverse than one your parents came from , " Kenski said of today 's teenagers .
Those surveyed were born from 1990 to 1996 .
Most remember the shooting deaths of 12 students and a teacher at Colorado 's Columbine High School in 1999 , the attack on the World Trade Center and the invasion of Iraq , as well as the introduction of the iPod , Xbox , iTunes , MySpace and YouTube .
The survey also indicates that these teens understand they are living in deeply troubled economic times but are steeped in American optimism and have high educational expectations .
��Most agree students should pass the high - school AIMS exam before they get a diploma , and 88 percent said a college education is essential to their future .
��Only 16 percent chose " bad schools " as the No. 1 problem facing Arizona , overwhelmingly choosing the weak economy , followed by crime and poverty .
��Although 64 percent reported that most of what they are learning in school is worthwhile , the teens agreed there are plenty of ways to make their schools better .
At the top of their list : a better selection of courses , smaller classes and better teachers .
Most teens blame parents for not encouraging or requiring students to finish high school .
��Nearly 60 percent chose " a job you enjoy " and " a happy family " as essential to a good life .
Only 20 percent said lots of money .
Only 4 percent saw " celebrity " as their ticket to happiness .
The dark side of Arizona life for teens is buried in the minority responses .
One in three of the kids surveyed reported not trusting neighbors , and the same percentage reported his or her family lacks money to live comfortably .
One in four teens does n't feel safe walking in his or her neighborhood at night .
The entire report will be available Wednesday at www.morrisoninstitute .org .

There 's No Place Like Gold By Richard Daughty " The Mogambo Guru "
Mar 18 2009 5:13 PM www.dailyreckoning.com
03/17/09 Tampa Bay , Florida I was captivated by the Wall Street Journal headline “ Bearish Big Investors Catch Gold Bug� ? by Gregory Zuckerman , because I do n’t ever expect to see anything favorable about gold in the WSJ since it is concerned primarily with providing information and news about stocks and bonds so that you will be motivated to constantly buy and sell stocks and bonds .
So I was surprised to read where it starts out with , “ Large investors , including some who anticipated deep troubles for the housing and financial sectors , have been buying gold , concerned that moves by governments world - wide to shovel money at problem areas could cripple leading currencies .�?
This is exactly true !
That is exactly why I am buying gold , and why smart people are buying gold and why large investors are buying gold !
Well , since the WSJ is traditionally concerned with stocks and bonds and so is historically unconcerned and disdainful of gold , I figure that Mr. Zuckerman will follow that “ gold bug� ?
news with some disparaging remark like “ which only proves how stupid large investors are , since everyone knows that gold is for morons and raving lunatics like , for instance , The Mogambo , who is forever wailing about how you should be buying gold , silver and oil with your very waking breath because the Federal Reserve , which caused all of the world ’s problems by their decades - old regimen of constantly over - creating money and credit which produced massive inflations in the prices of stocks , bonds , houses and size of government , is now going to make the money supply go Freaking Super - Nova ( FSN ) with even MORE excess creation of money and credit to accommodate the panicky , unbelievable , desperate deficit - spending plans measured in the multi-trillions of dollars by the incompetent , brain - damaged Congress and the ridiculous Obama administration comprising , as it does , the worst of the worst , and that means consumer prices are going to explode one day – say people like The Mogambo , within a year or so , and for a long , long time afterward , too .�?
Although Mr , Zuckerman does not mention me directly , he says , “ For years , big gold fans were fast - moving traders and so - called gold bugs , a crowd of bears ever - convinced that the underpinnings of global economies and markets were set to crumble� ?
which not only describes me to a freaking T , but is exactly what happened !
He also describes me pretty well , too , when he says , “ Gold has disappointed some investors because it has n’t been a home - run investment despite continuing financial ills� ?
which is also the fault of the Federal Reserve , which is on record as saying that “ the Fed stands ready � ?
to dump as much gold onto the market as is needed to keep its price from rising .
And the reason they are openly manipulating the price of gold , which is the advice of former Fed chairman Paul Volcker , is because they are concerned about the price of gold rising , which is a clear signal that inflation is raging because the Fed is a bunch of money - maddened morons and the economy is in Big Freaking Inflationary Trouble ( BFIT ) because of them and their mismanagement of monetary policy with their ridiculous neo-Keynesian econometric stupidities !
Hahahaha !
And it is going to get worse , as Junior Mogambo Ranger ( JMR ) Wayne T. sent a clip from ft.com that announced that “ Barack Obama ’s top economic adviser has urged world leaders to pump more public money into the economy in a coordinated effort to boost demand and lift the world out of recession .�?
And how are we going to do this amazing feat ?
By engineering a “ global demand - led recovery � ?
where everybody starts buying !
Buying !
Buying !
And in fact , Laughable Larry Summers thinks , “ There ’s no place that should be reducing its contribution to global demand right now .
It is really the universal demand agenda .�?
I cannot believe what I am reading !
Perhaps in a feeble attempt to make me shut up my screaming in outrage at the inflation in prices that such irresponsible economic stupidity will cause , he does allow that , as ft.com terms it , “ While the US and other western nations should return to living within their means in the medium term , everyone should raise spending sharply now .�?
Hahaha !
Unbelievable !
And why in the hell would anyone in their right mind say such a bizarre thing that is directly contraindicated by the entire stinking corpus of world economic history for the last 4,500 years which proves that , 100 % percent of the time , increasing the money supply of a fiat currency with government deficit - spending has been what we in the economics biz officially call a Big , Big , Bad , Bad , Bankrupting Bust ( BBBBBB ) .
Well , do n’t look at me for an answer as to why someone would say such a ridiculous thing and make us laugh with scorn and contempt , but , “ In an interview with the Financial Times , Lawrence Summers said the urgent need for a short - term increase in spending by governments temporarily overrode the longer - term goal of tackling the global imbalances many economists believe caused the financial crisis .�?
Hahahaha !
“ Temporarily overrode � ?!
Hahaha !
This is the economics of Larry Summers ?
Hahahaha !
No wonder he wound up in the Obama administration !
Hahaha !
No wonder we are so freaking doomed !
I am struggling to contain my laughter , as I want to make sure that I write this down because people in the future are not going to be satisfied with me merely recalling the moment and laughing and guffawing all over again , but probably drooling more than I do now .
So I officially make note that Larry Summers , “ Barack Obama ’s top economic adviser� ?
thinks that things will be better by having the government spend more money !
Hahahaha !
This is after , I assume , getting it from the Federal Reserve , which can merely push a button to create all the money and credit one can even imagine , at perpetually low interest rates , so that untold trillions of dollars of new money can be borrowed from banks so that untold trillions of dollars in new Treasury bonds can be bought , worsening horrific imbalances that are already so staggering that they could only have been produced during rampant government corruption and / or pandemic stupidity !
Hahaha !
I knew I could not get into the interview itself , and , as usual , am stopped long before I can even get near , although sometimes I can break free of the grasp of security guards long enough so that you can barely hear me in the background yelling , “ We ’re freaking doomed , you morons !
The damned increase in the money supply by government deficit - spending will increase prices and produce Really , Really Weird ( RRW ) economic distortions !�?
Well , this is not one of those times , and I could n’t hear a thing they were saying , and thus they could not hear me , and I had to read in the Financial Times article that Mr. Summers says , in another of those things that must be written down because nobody is going to believe it , that “ The US administration had no choice but to take strong public action to ‘ save the market system from its own excesses .’�?
Hahahaha !
“ Save the system from its own excesses� ?
with more excesses !
Hahahaha !
But this is not about how much disrespect I have for Mr. Summers ’ opinion ( because , as Milton Berle said , “ Never trust the opinion of a man in trouble� ?
as to the necessity of more governmental deficit - spending to correct the bankrupting imbalances of previous governmental deficit - spending until fully half – half !
– of the economy is now composed of local , state and federal government spending , which is not even to mention all the borrowing by the local and state governments floating bonds to pay for sewers and fire houses and playgrounds where most of the “ children� ?
are probably drug - addled adolescent criminals and brain - damaged mutants , judging by the way they look , dress and act .
No , this is about how you should buy gold ; but perhaps the best reason to buy gold is provided by Mr. Zuckerman himself , who says , “ Since 1971 , the dollar has been backed not by gold but by faith in the U.S. government �?!
Hahaha !
Faith in the U.S. government !
Hahahaha !
If anybody has any faith whatsoever in the U.S. government , then they have not been paying attention and deserve to lose their money , as the price of freedom , they say , is eternal vigilance , but that is not exactly true .
It looks like the saying should be “ The price of freedom is either eternal vigilance or all your money .�?
The good news is that the real , lazy man ’s secret is that gold is “ eternal vigilance � ?
in a handy , compact yellow metal , and sometimes , like now , you will actually get richer in terms of fiat money due to the depreciation of the over - produced fiat money !
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !

Mr Zaidi's lawyers say he was making a legitimate protest
An Iraqi journalist hailed as a hero in the Arab world for throwing his shoes at the then US President George W Bush has been jailed for three years .
Muntadar al - Zaidi had told the court his actions in December were " natural , just like any Iraqi " against a leader whose forces had occupied his country .
Shoe hurling is a grave insult in Arab culture , but Mr Bush - on a farewell trip to Iraq - shrugged off the attack .
Defence lawyers described the sentence as " harsh " and said they would appeal .
The head of Zaidi's team Dhiaa al - Saadi said the sentence was " not in harmony with the law " because his client had not meant to cause injury , but rather to express contempt for Mr Bush .
There has been no statement about the verdict from the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , which correspondents say suffered acute embarrassment over the incident .
' Response to occupation '
The BBC's Mike Sergeant who was at Thursday 's court hearing says relatives and supporters of the defendant came to court expecting him to be released .
Asked by presiding judge Abdul - Amir al - Rubaie if he was innocent or guilty , Zaidi replied : " I am innocent .
What I did was a natural response to the occupation . "
After the final arguments by the defence lawyers , everyone was told to leave the room .
The judges deliberated for a further 15 minutes , and an increasingly frustrated crowd gathered outside .
When news of the sentence filtered through , some relatives began to cry and scream insults at the judges .
They shouted " It 's an American court " , " He 's a hero " , " Down with President Bush " and " God is great " .

One report says Zaidi shouted " long live Iraq " as the verdict against him was read out .
In mid-December 2008 , a news conference with Mr Bush and Mr Maliki was drawing to a close when Zaidi , of al - Baghdadiya TV , called Mr Bush " a dog " and threw his shoes as " a farewell kiss " from Iraqis who had been killed , orphaned or widowed since the US - led invasion .
He was overpowered and arrested .
His actions were condemned by the Iraqi government as " shameful " .
But the shoe attack , at a the globally televised news conference , were celebrated across the world by critics of the the outgoing US president who ordered the 2003 invasion of the Iraq .
In an opinion poll carried out for the BBC and ABC - the full results of which appear next Monday - 62 % of Iraqis considered Zaidi a " hero " .
Twenty - four percent of the sample viewed him as " criminal " , while 10 % agreed he was a hero and criminal equally .
Lesser charge
Since his arrest , his lawyers say Zaidi has been beaten and tortured , although he appeared in good shape at court hearings .
Defence lawyers had argued that since the shoes did not hit Mr Bush , Zaidi should not be charged with assault against a foreign head of state on an official visit , under article of 223 of Iraq 's penal code .
I had the feeling that the blood of innocent people was dropping on my feet during the time that he was smiling and coming to say bye - bye to Iraq with a dinner
Muntadar al - Zaidi
Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult Profile : Shoe - throwing journalist
In pictures : ' Shoe - thrower ' support
He faced five - to - 15 years if jailed for that crime , but would only have risked one - to - five years if charged with attempted assault of a foreign leader .
There has been no confirmation from the court , but it appears Zaidi was found guilty of the lesser charge .
Judges adjourned the trial on 19 February to rule on whether Mr Bush 's surprise arrival in Baghdad in December had constituted an official visit .
Judge Abdulamir Hassan al - Rubaie told the court that government ministers had declared the visit official .
Lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that Zaidi should be tried under article 227 of the penal code , covering public humiliation of a representative of a foreign country , which carries a two - year jail term .
At the earlier court hearing , Zaidi said he had been unable to control his emotions when Mr Bush had said in Arabic " thank you very much " to the assembled journalists .
" I had the feeling that the blood of innocent people was dropping on my feet during the time that he was smiling and coming to say bye - bye to Iraq with a dinner , " he said .
In an interview afterwards , Mr Bush described the incident as " interesting " , " weird " and " unusual " , but he insisted he did n't harbour any ill feeling about it .
" It was amusing - I 've seen a lot of weird things during my presidency , and this may rank up there as one of the weirdest , " Mr Bush said .

Flashes of light may one day be used to control the human brain , and that day just got a lot closer .
Using lasers , researchers at the MIT Media Lab were able to activate a specific set of neurons in a monkey 's brain .
Though the technique has been used to control and explore neural circuits in fish , flies and rodents , this is the first time the much - hyped technology has ever been used in primates .
" It paves the way for new therapies that could target a number of psychiatric disorders , " said MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden , who led the research with postdoctoral fellow Xue Han .
" This is very exciting from a translational standpoint . "
The beauty of this optogenetic technique is its specificity .
By using a combination of lasers and genetic engineering , scientists can control , to the millisecond , the firing of a specific class of neurons , allowing them to pinpoint problematic cells and circuits while leaving innocent bystanders alone , thus minimizing potential side effects .
Viruses are engineered to infect neurons with a special type of channel , originally discovered in algae , which is sensitive to blue light .
Once a blue laser shines on the infected neurons , the channels snap open , ions rush into the cell , and the neuron fires .
Crucial to the technique is that the virus is only injected into a very small part of the brain , and only a certain class of neurons , once infected , actually turn the channel on .
The sharp laser beam further zeros in on a small portion of the brain .
This precise aim is in contrast to current techniques , such as drugs and electrodes , both of which have a much broader reach .
The optogenetic method was pioneered in 2005 by Boyden and Karl Deisseroth at Stanford University and has since been used to understand how circuits of neurons control various behaviors , such as learning in mice and predator escape in fish .
But until now , scientists had never demonstrated the technique in primates — a move essential for developing therapeutic uses for the technology in humans .
Boyden 's new research , published Wednesday in Neuron , demonstrates not only that the technology works in primates , but also that it is safe .
The rhesus macaques received multiple rounds of injections and laser stimulations over the course of eight or nine months without damaging the neurons or activating the brain 's immune system , an obvious concern when viruses are involved .
" Many disorders are associated with changes in specific cell types , " said Boyden .
“ For therapeutic purposes , you want to affect certain cells , but you want to leave normal cells intact .
The ability to use light to turn specific cells on and off with very precise timing could in principle allow new therapies . ”
Future applications could involve using light - emitting neural prosthetics to replace the electrodes used in deep brain stimulation , which currently activate or silence a broad range of neurons .
Deep brain stimulation has shown promise in treatments of Parkinson 's disease , epilepsy and depression , but it has a number of side effects , stemming in part from its lack of specificity .
“ Our ability to remedy problems in the brain may ultimately be limited by how many side effects occur , ” said Boyden .
“ We could find ways to shut down seizures but the side effects might be intolerable .
By pinpointing specific cell types , we could craft therapeutic neuromodulators and directly develop therapies , while preserving a high degree of well - being . ”
Proving the method works in primate brains paves the way not only for cleaner therapies , but also for understanding the relationship between specific neural circuits and behaviors , particularly higher cognitive functions .
Genetically , mice are ideal model organisms — but their behavioral repertoire is n't very sophisticated .
If neuroscientists hope to understand and treat problems like ADHD , schizophrenia , depression and compulsive behaviors like addiction , they can run far - more - powerful experiments using primates .
“ This is a very important and exciting step forward for all systems neuroscience , ” said a neuroscientist who preferred to remain anonymous due to recent attacks against primate researchers .
“ There are many limitations with the current way we try to understand neural circuits , primarily the lack of specificity .
The hope is that as this sort of research continues in labs around the world , it will become possible to specifically target many different classes of neurons .
We can learn how each of them contributes to specific cognitive functions . ”

Can it be done ?
In the year 2009 , in a hopelessly wired world , can a small group of willing but nervous Los Angeles 10th - graders survive one long week without using any electronic devices ?
“ I suspect that people will be going crazy , ” said student Jamila Mohedano , who doubts her own ability to go unplugged without becoming unglued .
The torture at Guantanamo Bay was nothing compared to this .
Beginning today at a downtown college - prep charter school , the homeroom class of teacher Shannon Meyer will go cold turkey for seven endless days .

We ’re talking no TV .
No iPods .
No iPhones .
No BlackBerrys .

No computers , which means no MySpace and no Facebook .
And it gets worse .
No cellphones .
Oh , the humanity !
That means -- weep if you must -- no texting .

“ I like texting a lot , ” said Angie Gaytan , who sleeps with her cellphone under her pillow and responds immediately if she gets a message in the middle of the night .
“ It ’s an addiction , ” Cesar Rodriguez said .
“ You do n’t have to use it , but you get that temptation and it controls you . ”
Even if you do n’t immediately respond , he said , you ca n’t help but check a text message the moment you hear the electronic beep .
“ You wonder who it is , ” he said .

This is the way her students live their lives , said teacher Meyer .
They ’re wired to everything but connected to nothing meaningful .
If she sees a student in class take a little too long searching for a pencil in a backpack , she knows what ’s really going on .
“ They ’re texting , ” which is not allowed on campus .
Meyer had tried what she called a brief “ media fast ” at another school last year , but she wanted to grow the challenge this year at the California Academy for Liberal Studies Early College High School .
By her rules , students can only use a computer for homework and a cellphone for an emergency , and they will chronicle their experience in journals .
“ These kids are really bright , but they ’re quickly bored , ” Meyer said .
She believes the constant electronic stimulation and sensory overload make kids ill - equipped to follow the slower rhythms of classroom dialogue or to interact with one another in meaningful ways .

Student Andres Lopez -- no relation -- agreed with her , so Meyer asked him to get hold of someone at an old - fashioned newspaper before print media ends up in the dark wing of a dinosaur museum .
Andres , bless his rebel heart , reads this newspaper and asked if I would care to write about the one - week challenge .
I was more than happy to oblige , but had my doubts about whether any of the 22 homeroom students would stay unplugged after next Wednesday .
“ I think they ’ll find that their quality of life is better , but they ’ll go back to their old habits anyway , ” Meyer said .
Still , I said , maybe it ’s true that an unexamined life is n’t worth living .
Advertisement
“ Who wrote that ? ” Meyer asked .
“ Socrates , ” Andres said .
After reading a news story titled “ I tweet , therefore I am , ” Andres and his classmates concluded it might be true that they do n’t feel as though they exist unless they constantly share their thoughts and experiences , even if all they ’re doing is brushing their teeth .
“ I want to break free from it because it ’s annoying , ” said Angie , who listens to music on MP3 players , watches the 42 - inch surround - sound TV in her living room or the 32 - inch in her bedroom , has an electronic PlayStation , a computer and two cellphones that take pictures and link her to the Internet .
Advertisement
And for all that , she said , “ I do n’t talk to my family anymore , and I do n’t know what ’s going on in the world . ”
“ I think this is prompting us to get out of our bubble and get some Vitamin D , ” Jamila said .
But she also said there are lots of gangbangers in her neighborhood , and when her parents do n’t let her outside for fear of violence , her only connection to friends is by cellphone or e-mail .
Jesus Alonzo does n’t know if he can make it through a week of the NBA playoffs without knowing what the Lakers are up to .

“ I ’ll have to wait till the next day to read it in the paper , ” he said with a long face .
What , and there ’s something wrong with that ?
Angie may have to eat dinner locked in a closet because at her house , the kitchen is arranged so the family can watch TV while eating .
“ For some people this is going to be peaceful , ” said Andres , who likes a cleansing walk on the beach and said he thinks a good hike can put you back in touch with yourself .
“ Others are going to hear voices in their head they did n’t know they had . ”

I happen to think Meyer ’s electronic media fast is a great idea , and there ought to be a citywide challenge to see which students can go off the grid the longest .
Anybody game ?
Among Meyer ’s students ,
Angie plans to play a lot of guitar this week and Jesus is going to train for the L.A. Marathon .
Jamila figures she ’ll be the first to crack and reach for her BlackBerry , but she intends to focus on writing if she gets the shakes .
With all his free time , Andres said , he intends to do more reading .
And one more thing , as well :

Psychological Warfare , by Paul M. A. Linebarger I am happy to report that Psychological Warfare is back in print .
Clicking on either the title or the image will take you to its page on Amazon.com .
It is a facsimile of the second revised edition , from the 1950s , brought back into print by Gateways Books and Tapes .
Many other publishers have thought of reprinting it , have even emailed me that they were definitely going to do it , but fell through .
Kudos to these folks for actually doing it !
Long out of print , this book retains a timeliness .
Here are three bits from the book .
First , two serious ones , and then my favorite , an amusing one .
Where my father says " the Communists " I think you can substitute any fanatic extremists .
Here he goes : Whatever PsyWar does , it certainly does not and should not increase the bitterness of war .
Fighting itself is the supreme bitterness .
Radio broadcasts and leaflets even in wartime only rarely should promote hatred .
The situation which the world faces is dangerous because of technological development , not because of psychological knowledge .
PsyWar ranks as a weapon , but it is almost certainly the most humane of all weapons .
Apart from PsyWar , what military weapon destroys the enemy soldier 's capacity to fight by saving his life ?
PsyWar tries to bring him over alive and tries to send him home as our friend .
No rival weapon can do this ...
Since 1945 , we Americans have written more , studied more , and talked more about Psywar than have any of the other free peoples .
This is a hopeful sign .
It can be read as an indication that the American love of the gadget , the American quest for a novelty , can be turned to the arena of the soul .
The Communists are better liars , better schemers , better murderers than we shall ever be ; they start off by being better fanatics .
Is it not in the American spirit that we should out - trick them , out - talk them , and out - maneuver them ?
From practically the first minute that I heard the news on September 11 , 2001 , I wondered what perspective my father would have had on it .
I pulled out my copy of Psychological Warfare and was drawn towards a chapter that included mention of the future .
He speaks [ 1955 edition , page 285 ] of " the relief [ of tension ] offered within each civilization by the opportunity to discharge hatred against members of other civilization [s ] instead of recognizing self - hatred for the very real problem that it is . "
He continues :
In other terms , it is tough to be modern ; the difficulty of being modern makes it easy for individuals to be restless and anxious ; restlessness and anxiety lead to fear ; fear converts freely into hate ; hate very easily takes on political form ; political hate assists in the creation of real threats such as the atomic bomb and guided missiles , which are not imaginary threats at all ; the reality of the threats seems to confirm the reality of the hate which led to it , thus perpetuating a cycle of insecurity , fear , hate , armament , insecurity , fear , and on around the circle again and again .
It is possible , but by no means probable , that the rapid development of psychological and related sciences in the Western world may provide whole new answers to the threats which surround modern Americans , including the supreme answer of peace as an alternative to war or the secondary answer of victory in the event of war ....
Too specific a concentration on the problem of winning a war may cause a leader or his expert consultants to concentrate on solutions derived from past experience , therewith leading him to miss new and different solutions which might be offered by his own time .
My Favorite Bit from Psychological Warfare
One day I talked with someone who called to order a couple of the CS books .
( I used to sell them directly myself . )
He mentioned that he had worked in Korea and that his favorite story about Paul Linebarger was the one told by J.J. Pierce in his introduction to The Best of Cordwainer Smith .
I looked it up , and it reminds me so much of my father 's way of thinking that I 'm quoting Pierce here : " While in Korea , Linebarger masterminded the surrender of thousands of Chinese troops who considered it shameful to give up their arms .
He drafted leaflets explaining how the soldiers could surrender by shouting the Chinese words for ' love , ' ' duty , ' ' humanity , ' and ' virtue ' -- words that happened , when pronounced in that order , to sound like ' I surrender ' in English .
He considered this act to be the single most worthwhile thing he had done in his life . "
Well , that got me curious , and I pulled out my 1954 copy of Psychological Warfare .
I did n't find that story in there but here 's one that he used to tell , and it always made me laugh :
The temper of the U.S. forces in Korea was demonstrated by a Reserve sergeant who scarcely knew he was in the Reserves until he was on a boat bound for Pusan .
He was a practical man , anxious to get home , but willing to do his share in this war as long as he had to .
He was given the assignment of testing the voice plane of U.S. headquarters at Taegu .
The loudspeaker was not working quite right , and he was instructed to test the plane at 500 , 1,000 , and 1,500 feet .
The plane flew low over U.S. Headquarters
The roar of the engines almost deafened everyone within the building , yet even above the roar of the engines there could be heard the bone - chilling hum of the silent loudspeaker -- an immense magnification of the noise one hears from a radio set which is turned on without being tuned to a station .
Everyone expected the sergeant to say , ' This is the EUSAK voice plane testing ; one - ah , two - ah , three - ah ! '
" Instead the immense voice came through clearly , through brick , and plaster , and wood , through air and trees .
It must have reached four miles .
The gigantic voice of the sergeant seemed to roar over half of South Korea as he said , ' Why - - do n't - - you - - imperialist -- sons o ' bitches - - go -- back - - to -- Wall - - Street - - where - - you - - belong ? '
It was said that fifty colonels grabbed for their phones simultaneously , but the purely American gimmick to the whole story lay in the fact that the sergeant was not punished .
No damage was done .
The Americans thought their enemies were funny or silly .
We had shown that we were not afraid of Communist ideas .
Several South Koreans told the author that they regarded the Americans as inscrutable people indeed .
Psychological Warfare may be found at Alibris ... the link is set up to show this search .
And here is the link again for Amazon.com : Psychological Warfare by Paul Linebarger .
I first learned about Neal Horsley when he sent me an email telling me he had been following my articles on secession and wondered if I could help him get in contact with the head of the Georgia Militia .
I told him , sadly , no , but was curious about a link to a website he gave me for his campaign for governor .
And then , there was the mule thing , which I 'll get to .
He is running on the " nullification platform " , which is kind of secessionist lite .
Though , looking over his platform , there does n't appear to be anything lite about it .
But we 'll get to that later .
Now , about the mule .
Here 's a snippet of his confession on Alan Colmes :
NH : " Absolutely .
I was a fool .
When you grow up on a farm in Georgia , your first girlfriend is a mule . "
AC : " I 'm not so sure that that is so . "
NH : " You did n't grow up on a farm in Georgia , did you ? "
AC : " Are you suggesting that everybody who grows up on a farm in Georgia has a mule as a girlfriend ? "
NH :
It has historically been the case .
You people are so far removed from the reality ...
Welcome to domestic life on the farm ... "
Colmes said he thought there were a lot of people in the audience who grew up on farms , are living on farms now , raising kids on farms and " and I do n't think they are dating Elsie right now .
You know what I 'm saying ? "
Horsley said , " You experiment with anything that moves when you are growing up sexually .
You 're naive .
You know better than that ...
If it 's warm and it 's damp and it vibrates you might in fact have sex with it . "
Yep .
There was no way we were n't going to ask about that one .
It was just a matter of how .
We worked in the question somewhat delicately this way : " So , as a candidate for Governor , are you worried about any skeletons in your closet that might get aired in the course of the campaign ? "
" No , that 's why I 'm running for Governor because I do n't have any skeletons in my closet , " he says . " I ’ve talked about things people would never have talked about .
Any skeletons I have , I take them out and rattle them around . "
" What kinds of things ? " I ask .
Without missing a beat , he says , " You know what you ’re thinking about has been out there ... "
" We 're talking about the mule now ? "
Yes , he says .
The mule .
" A small mule ? " I ask .
" No , a full grown mule , " he says .
" She loved me , though . "
We both laugh , but I 'm still trying to figure out the logistics .
How big is this thing ?
The size of a horse , he says .
" All I had to do was give her an ear of corn . "
He laughs again .
" She was a [ prostitute ] mule . "
" How did you reach ? "
" I do n't know ... I stood on something .
The kicker is , as soon as I was done she pissed all over me .
It was embarrassing .
I never told anyone that before . "
That 's right , my friends .
This is an Underground exclusive .
Not only that , but Horsley has had sex with men .
He was in the Air Force , it was a cold night , yadda , yadda , yadda , he had sex with him , ahem , the way he did the mule .
" It was gross , " he says .
Really ?
He had n't described the mule that way .
" I 've [ screwed ] a watermelon , " he says .
And that 's just for starters .
He 's had sex with just about everything it 's physically possible to have sex with , and some that is n't .
" How many times have I masturbated in my life ? " he asks .
Now he 's 65 and orgasm - free for two years ( his wife finally divorced him -- too much " drama " , she said ) .
" The bottom line is , I never treated it as if it were not a sin . "
Good to know .
Now that we got that out of the way , we can talk about his campaign to secede from the Union .
Tomorrow .
( Follow up : Secessionist Ready to Kill Own Son . )
Calling Glenn Beck !
Here 's another " frustrated Americans " event for you to champion !
David Weigel at the Windy happened to catch the latest idea from the militiamen who are starting to see their paranoid ranks rising :
A peaceful demonstration of at least a million — hey , if we can 10 million , even better — but at least one million armed militia men marching on Washington .
A peaceful demonstration .
No shooting , no one gets hurt .
Just a demonstration .
The only difference from any typical demonstration is we will all be armed .
As Weigel says , lotsa luck getting a permit for that .
It 's all very reminiscent of Linda Thompson :
[ I ] n 1994 , Thompson declared herself " Acting Adjutant General " of the " Unorganized Militia of the United States " and announced plans for an armed march on Washington , D.C. which was to be held on September 19 of that year , in which an ultimatum demanding the repeal of such laws as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and the Brady Bill would be delivered to members of the United States Congress , and those members refusing to comply with the ultimatum would be arrested and tried for treason .
The proposed march was almost universally denounced by groups on the right wing , from the John Birch Society to the militia organizations .
Thompson canceled the march , claiming publicly that the announcement was never anything more than a publicity stunt and the march was never intended to actually happen , while claiming to her supporters that operatives in the Federal government had plans to detonate a small nuclear device in D.C. and blame her organization for the act .
Publicity stunt or not it effectively spelled the end of her time in the limelight .
It may have ended her time in the limelight , but Thompson 's legacy is still with us ; a video she shot in the 1990s has been one of the primary sources of the " FEMA concentration camps " conspiracy myth .
Still , there 's no doubt militias are bubbling back up to the surface these days .
In Stockton , California , the militia being organized in the event of a police shortage this summer is sounding increasingly scary :
I was most interested to hear from Alan Pettet himself .
Pettet , 66 , is the organizer of this group , which he said numbers 270 .
Pettet said he has a rainbow coalition ( my words , not his ) of rifle - wielding men and 11 women ready to be sworn in by an unidentified federal judge on the steps of Stockton City Hall on July 1 .
That 's scary enough , although you have to question why any judge would participate in this ceremony .
Now here is a turn that sounds even more ridiculous .
But do n't take my word for it , here it is in Pettet 's own words : " Five minutes after we 're sworn in , we oust the mayor and City Council and then we can declare martial law . "
Over in Michigan , militiamen are preparing for the depredations of the evil Obama administration too :
" Am I angry ? " asked the unemployed commander , with a semi-automatic rifle strapped across his pectorals .
" Yeah , it sets you off a little bit . "
Come to a Michigan Militia picnic and you realize the commander is not alone .
The farm where they rallied was chockfull of people like him , people boiling on the back burner , struggling to make ends meet , carrying around a knapsack of resentment for a government that they claim has taken almost everything from them and given nothing in return .
" Liberty , " says the commander , 33 , whose Christian name is Matthew Savino , of Adrian .
" You can not take my liberty .
Eventually a man draws a line in the sand . "
Why , he sounds just like Glenn Beck !
Indeed , does n't all this seem right up Beck 's alley ?
That 's how you make those dire prophecies conveniently self - fulfilling .
In America , people who claim vaccines cause autism are a major health threat .
Some of these folks are just parents , people concerned about their kids , people desperately looking for a cause for a devastating illness .
Others are vocal advocates of nonsense , saying things that are proven beyond reasonable doubt to be untrue .
The end result ?
Kids , including infants , are getting sick , and some of them are dying .
Never , ever forget that , no matter how loudly these people yell , and no matter what garbage they spout ( including , inevitably , in the comments that will follow this very post ) .
Babies are dying .
In Australia , this movement is taking root as well .
Calling the alarm to this , a TV program in Oz called " Sunday Night " aired an excellent exposé of what happens when parents do n't vaccinate their kids : they risk their children 's lives , and those of others .
In the case shown on the TV show , a four - week - old baby , Dana McCaffery , died of whooping cough .
This innocent infant was n't eligible for vaccination yet , but the lack of herd immunity -- that region has lower - than - average vaccination rates -- sealed her fate .
The fact that other parents did n't vaccinate their kids gave that little girl a death sentence .
Here 's the segment from that program .
Warning ( and I 'm serious ) : if you are a parent , or any kind of feeling human being , this segment is seriously disturbing .
I could barely watch it .
Maggie at Sceptic 's
Book has written quite a moving article about this report and the result .
The reporter in this TV program , Rebecca Maddern , did a pretty good job , though giving way too much time and credence to antivax mouthpiece Meryl Dorey , who spouts the usual antivax mendacities about vaccination , including bragging -- bragging -- that she was exposed to diseases when she was a kid , and did n't get sick .
At the six minute mark of that clip , she chillingly says that no one dies from measles or whooping cough .
Ms. Dorey , please tell that to the parents of Dana McCaffery , the baby who was just one month old when she died from whooping cough .
The Australian skeptics are trying to get the word out about this , including giving praise to the reporter ( who , it should be noted , cut to a picture of Dana McCaffery right after Dorey spouted her awful , horrifying garbage ) .
I encourage you to watch that clip ( if you can stomach it ) , read what Maggie wrote , and then email the station about this very , very serious problem .
The antivaxxers claim to be concerned about children ... but their total lack of critical thinking , their denial of the research , and their wholesale belief in conspiracy theories and antiscience rhetoric is making children sick .
And some of these children are dying .
It 's that simple .
Vaccinate your kids .
The life you save may be your own child's , and it may very well be the life of a child of some other parent who does n't have the choice you have .
Vaccinate .
Friends , family and local officials welcomed home 27 members of the 116th Air Control Squadron Saturday after their five - month deployment to Iraq .
The team , one of the most deployed in the Oregon Air National Guard , was officially deactivated in a ceremony at the Rilea Training Facility in Warrenton .
"
They are an example of what I 'm looking for out of the rest of the Oregon Air National Guard , " said Brig .
Gen. Bruce Prunk .
" I 'm very proud of what they do . "
The airmen worked in a region northwest of Baghdad known as Qayyarah , providing communications and radar support and working with Balad Airbase .
Gov. Ted Kulongoski , Sen. Betsy Johnson , D - Scappoose , and Rep. Deborah Boone , D - Cannon Beach , all attended the ceremony , along with officials from the Oregon National Guard .
The unit was awarded several medals for their support of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
The film " 300 , " portrays the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. , in which a force of 300 Spartans held off a massive Persian army at a mountain pass in Greece for three days .
It angered many Iranians for the way Persians are depicted as decadent , sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks .
Software requirements elicitation , budgeting , and scheduling are highly interrelated - take the wrong approach with one of them and your entire software development process falls like a house of cards .
This article argues that although traditional approaches are comforting to senior managers , the research shows that they do not ensure predictability and worse yet result in spectacular levels of waste .
Agile approaches to change management , modeling , and documentation are required if your organization is to succeed at becoming more agile with its approaches to budgeting and scheduling .
This will require a significant paradigm shift on the part of both IT and business management .
Everyone claims they want to be agile , but when push comes to shove most people will choose the politically expedient approach over actual effectiveness .
For example , what is more important to you : to try to estimate the actual costs of a project and then bring the project in on budget or to spend your IT investment wisely ?
If your answer is the first then you had might as well stop reading .
If your answer is the second then this article is for you , and if you think that it 's possible to achieve both then you desperately need to read this article to dispel you naivetÃ .
In this article I describe , and then compare , three approaches to budgeting and scheduling :
The traditional approach to budgeting and scheduling is to invest the time to develop what is considered to be an " accurate " budget and detailed schedule early in the lifecycle .
To do this , a comprehensive definition of the requirements is typically produced during the initiation phase of the project , often simply called the requirements phase .
Sometimes a detailed design document is developed , providing more information for the budgeting and scheduling process .
" Smart " organizations will develop an initial budget and schedule early in the project , then refine it over time as more information becomes available .
Not so smart organizations will assume that the initial budget and schedule are official , and actually hold the project team to them .
This is particularly true of organizations which take a fixed bid approach to software development , a spectacularly questionable practice at best .
Traditional project teams take a ( near ) serial approach to development in which requirements are defined and documented early in the project , the requirements may or may not be reviewed and accepted by the project stakeholders , and then they 're provided to developers who are expected to build a system based on those requirements .
Scope creep , also known as requirements creep , is contained by requiring stakeholders to follow a change management process .
Traditional change management processes typically involve one or more people , often referred to as a change control board ( CCB ) , who act as a gateway through which change requests are evaluated and potentially accepted .
The goal is to minimize , if not prevent , scope creep so as to stay on budget and schedule .
This approach sounds great in theory , but in practice proves to work poorly .
In Examining the Big Requirements Up Front ( BRUF ) Approach I describe Figure 1 in detail , which shows that when you take a traditional approach to requirements elicitation and management that 45 % of functionality delivered is never used and a further 19 % is rarely used .
In other words , a serial approach to development results in nearly 2/3 wastage ( and that 's only considering the projects which actually deliver into production , so the actual figure is much worse ) .
Figure 1 .
The cost of serial approaches to requirements .
Fixed price bids / contracts are bad ideas for both IT and the business stakeholders .
Sadly , the business thinks that it 's reducing its financial risk with a fixed bid , but the reality is that it forces them into a position where their money is almost always wasted ( see Figure 1 ) .
For IT , it almost always motivates them to reduce the delivered quality due to the realities of the iron triangle .
2. An Agile Approach to Budgeting and Scheduling
Now let 's consider the other end of the spectrum .
Here , we stop worrying about how much things are going to cost , or how long it will take , and instead focus on spending your money wisely and working in a timely manner .
Easy to say , but hard to do .
Agile software development teams do this by accepting the fact that requirements change and therefore choose to adopt practices which allow them to react accordingly to those changes .
These practices include an agile approach to change management , to modeling , and to documentation .
However , to achieve this management must adopt new ways of budgeting and scheduling in parallel .
Because requirements change frequently you need a streamlined , flexible approach to requirements change management .
Agilists want to develop software which is both high - quality and high - value , and the easiest way to develop high - value software is to implement the highest priority requirements first .
Agilists strive to truly manage change , not to prevent it , enabling them to maximize stakeholder investment .
Figure 2 overviews the agile approach to managing requirements , reflecting both Extreme Programming ( XP ) 's planning game and the Scrum methodology 's approach .
Your software development team has a stack of prioritized and estimated requirements which needs to be implemented - many XP teams will literally have a stack of user stories written on index cards although some teams use spreadsheets or databases to manage their requirements stack .
The team takes the highest priority requirements from the top of the stack which they believe they can implement within the current iteration .
Each requirement is initially estimated when it is identified and put on the stack , but when it comes time to implement the requirement some model storming may occur to ensure that the estimate is accurate .
Scrum suggests that you freeze the requirements for the current iteration to provide a level of stability for the developers whereas in XP the current requirements can also change as long as you 're willing to drop some requirements out of the iteration / timebox if needed .
Figure 3 . Agile change management .
Developers are responsible for estimating the effort required to implement the requirements on which they will work .
Although you may fear that developers do n't have the requisite estimating skills , and this is often true at first , the fact is that it does n't take long for people to get pretty good at estimating when they know that they 're going to have to live up to those estimates .
Smaller requirements are easier to estimate .
Shall statements , such as “ the system shall convert feet to meters ” , are an example of very small requirements .
User stories are a little larger but still relatively easy to estimate .
Use cases , a staple of the Rational Unified Process ( RUP ) , can become too large to estimate effectively although you can reorganize them into smaller and more manageable artifacts if you 're flexible .
I describe a wide array of modeling techniques , including the requirements models mentioned in this paragraph , at www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts.
So how does this pertain to budgeting and scheduling ?
An agile approach to requirements enables you to take an agile approach to budgeting and scheduling because of the higher level of control it provides business stakeholders :
Stakeholders get working software on a regular basis , enabling them to determine if the project is going in the right direction .
Stakeholders get their requirements implemented in the priority order which they define , enabling them to prevent wastage .
Stakeholder can control how their money is being spent because they can always reduce / remove funding to the project team .
In other words , if you do n't like what you 're getting for your IT investment you simply reduce funding to the project , and even potentially stop funding it .
If you like what you 're getting you can increase funding to the project team .
In other words , stakeholders now have complete control over how they invest their money in IT , enabling them to get the best value for their investment .
With this approach , your budget is always whatever stakeholders are willing to spend and the schedule is always however long it takes to build .
When you think about it , is n't that the true answer for any software development project , regardless of the approach ?
The primary difference is that with the agile approach we maximize stakeholder investment .
With this level of control , do you really need to develop a fictional budget , or schedule , at the beginning of the project ?
Unfortunately , the answer is probably still yes in most organizations .
Even though the financial people within your organization hold out little hope that the IT department will actually get the estimates and schedules right , they naively think that they 're reducing financial risk by doing so .
This leads us to the " middle of the road " approach to budgeting and scheduling .
3. A " Middle of The Road " Approach to Budgeting and Scheduling
With a middle of the road approach you do just enough requirements envisioning up front to identify the scope of the project , and just enough architectural modeling to determine a potential strategy to build the system .
This modeling efforts provides just enough understanding to put together an initial budget and schedule without paying the price of excessive documentation .
The most effective strategy to put the initial budget and schedule together is to gather a small group of people who have relevant experience from similar projects in the past , and more importantly have a stake in the new project ( e.g. they 're on the team and accountable ) , and ask them to provide a good guess .
Realistically at the beginning of the project this guess should have a +/- 30 % range , some research suggests a 50 % range , but unfortunately on average organizations ask for a +/- 11 % initial estimate even though their actuals come in at +/- 19 % after considerable " fudging of the numbers " in many cases ( see the DDJ State of the IT Union July 2009 survey results for details and Lies , Great Lies , and Software Development Plans for an overview of the ethically questionable fudging strategies ) .
Agile modelers understand that because requirements evolve over time that any early investment in detailed documentation will only be wasted .
Instead they will do just enough initial modeling to identify their project scope and develop a high - level schedule and budget : all you can really hope to achieve at this point is a good “ ballpark ” estimate , so you should only do enough work to get you to that point .
Figure 3 overviews this Agile Model Driven Development ( AMDD ) approach .
Figure 3 . The AMDD lifecycle .
During development they will model storm in a just - in - time ( JIT ) manner to explore each requirement in the necessary detail , and at that point produce an accurate estimate for that bit of work .
The developers should still be responsible for estimating their work , as described above , and stakeholders responsible for prioritizing the requirements .
The good news is that is still reasonably agile : remember , agility is situational .
At first , you only need a high - level , loosely detailed schedule ; the details are identified throughout the project JIT .
Similarly , at first your estimate will involve a large range ( if " greater accuracy " is needed , provide a figure closer to the top of the range and hope for the best ) which will be narrowed down as the project progresses .
The end result is that based on your actuals you will update your estimates throughout the project , narrowing the estimate range over time .
These narrowing estimates are referred to as a " cone of uncertainty " , a phrase coined by Barry Boehm .
Better yet , forgo the questionable concepts of schedules and estimates completely and simply choose to spend your money wisely as implied by Figure 2 .
4. Comparing the Approaches
The following table compares and contrasts the three approaches .
Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages , you need to identify which one is most suitable for your situation and then tailor it to meet your exactly needs .
Approach Advantages Disadvantages Traditional Accepted within many organizations .
With significant up front work , it 's possible to develop accurate estimates and schedules .
In practice , this approach results in significant wastage .
Projects are often over budget and / or schedule anyway .
Agile Stakeholders in complete control over how much money is spent , for how long , and on what .
Currently not well accepted by senior management because it is different from their existing ( and typically wrong ) expectations .
Requires a trustful relationship between IT and their business stakeholders .
Requires the development team to work in a disciplined manner .
Requires business stakeholders to be actively involved with the team and accountable for their decisions .
Combination Possible to create a reasonable estimate and schedule without much effort

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Bush - era interrogation techniques that many view as torture may have yielded important information about terrorists , President Obama 's national intelligence director said in an internal memo .
A memo attributed to Intelligence Director Dennis Blair addresses Bush - era interrogation techniques .
" High - value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al Qaeda organization that was attacking this country , " Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair said in a memo to personnel .
The memo , obtained by CNN late Tuesday , was sent around the time the administration released several memos from the previous administration detailing the use of terror interrogation techniques such as waterboarding , which simulates drowning .
Obama left open the possibility of criminal prosecution Tuesday for former Bush administration officials who drew up the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques many view as torture .
Obama said it will be up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether or not to prosecute the former officials .
" With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions , I would say that is going to be more a decision for the attorney general within the parameter of various laws , and I do n't want to prejudge that , " Obama said during a meeting with Jordan 's King Abdullah II at the White House .
" There 's a host of very complicated issues involved there .
As a general deal , I think we should be looking forward and not backward .
" I do worry about this getting so politicized that we cannot function effectively , and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations . "
Watch as Obama says U.S. can be protected and live up to its ideals »
The president added that any congressional " accounting of what took place " should be done " in a bipartisan fashion outside of the typical hearing process that can sometimes break down ... entirely along party lines . "
It is important , he said , for the " American people to feel as if this is not being dealt with to provide one side or another political advantage . "
Polls conducted shortly after Obama 's inauguration seem to reflect a split among Americans on the issue .
A Gallup poll in early February showed that 38 percent of respondents favored a Justice Department criminal investigation of torture claims , 24 percent favored a noncriminal investigation by an independent panel , and 34 percent opposed either .
A Washington Post poll about a week earlier showed a narrow percentage of Americans in favor of investigations .
Obama 's remarks on Tuesday came five days after the administration released four Bush - era memos detailing the use of terror interrogations such as waterboarding , a technique used to simulate drowning .
One memo showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding -- which Obama has called torture -- at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects .
The author of one of the memos that authorized those techniques , then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , is now a federal appeals court judge in California .
U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler , D - New York , a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee , has called for Bybee 's impeachment , while Sen.
Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , chair of the Senate Judiciary committee , called for his resignation .
" If the White House and Mr. Bybee told the truth at the time of his nomination , he never would have been confirmed , " Leahy said .
" So actually , the honorable and decent thing for him to do now would be to resign .
If he 's an honorable and decent man , he will . "
For now , Bybee 's fate remains unclear .
Obama reiterated his belief that he did not think it is appropriate to prosecute those CIA officials and others who carried out the interrogations in question .
" This has been a difficult chapter in our history and one of [ my ] tougher decisions , " he added .
The techniques listed in memos " reflected ... us losing our moral bearings . "
The president 's apparent willingness to leave the door open to a prosecution of Bush officials seemed to contradict White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , who indicated Sunday that the administration was opposed to such an action .
Obama believes " that 's not the place that we [ should ] go , " Emanuel said on ABC's " This Week . "
" It 's not a time to use our energy ... looking back [ with ] any sense of anger and retribution . "
On Monday , Obama asserted during a visit to CIA headquarters that he had released the documents primarily because of the " exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos , particularly the fact that so much of the information was [ already ] public .
...
The covert nature of the information had been compromised . "

Taxpayers may have been shocked to learn from House Republicans that President Barack Obama wants to pay for health care by charging them to turn on a light .
" The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes , including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $ 3,128 a year , " the House Republican Conference said in a Web post and press release titled " Questions on the Budget for President Obama , " distributed March 24 .
" What effect will this have on Americans struggling to pay their mortgages ? " it asked .
This alleged " light switch tax " is a reference to Obama 's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions , and allow companies to trade emissions credits among themselves .
That 's called a cap - and - trade program , and Republicans say the companies would just pass the tax on to electricity consumers .
So any revenue raised by a cap - and - trade program amounts to a " light switch tax " on consumers , the House Republicans alleged .
To back up the claim , their staff pointed us to an M.I.T. report that says a similar a cap - and - trade proposal ( the administration has not yet detailed their own version ) would raise $ 366 billion per year .
If you divide that by the 117 million households in the United States , you find it would cost each household $ 3,128 , they said .
But is it that simple ?
Can you just assume consumers would be out $ 366 billion since that 's how much the program would raise from fuel companies ?
No .
" It 's just wrong , " said John Reilly , an energy , environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report .
" It 's wrong in so many ways it 's hard to begin . "
Not only is it wrong , but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him .
" Someone from the House Republicans had called me ( March 20 ) and asked about this , " Reilly said .
" I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it , but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time . "
It continues to float .
That 's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal , Reilly said .
The tax might push the price of carbon - based fuels up a bit , but other results of a cap - and - trade program , such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources , would put downward pressure on prices .
Moreover , consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form .
The report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals , called the " welfare " cost .
It would be $ 30.89 per person in 2015 , or $ 79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people .
The cost would grow over time as the program ramps up , but the average annual cost over time in today 's dollars — that is , the " average annual net present value cost " — is still just $ 85 per person , Reilly said .
That would be $ 215.05 per household .
A far cry from $ 3,128 .
And that is n't the only inaccuracy in the claim .
The Republican press release said the cap - and - trade program would pay for " nationalized health care . "
But Obama 's health care proposal is not for " nationalized health care . "
It does call for a " National Health Insurance Exchange " with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress — but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want , as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign .
Even if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care , he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap - and - trade program as the Republicans alleged .
Rather , his $ 634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper - income taxpayers , according to Obama 's proposed budget .
The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim , changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap - and - trade program would pay for " increased spending " rather than health care .
But it still calls cap - and - trade a " light switch tax " and claims the whole cost would come from consumers .
If the Republicans had simply misstated the results of the MIT study , the Truth - O - Meter would have been content giving this one a False .
But for them to keep repeating the claim after the author of the study told them it was wrong means we have to set the meter ablaze .
Pants on Fire .
Update , May 6 , 2009
Two days after we published this item , Reilly sent a letter to Rep.
John Boehner , the Republican leader in the House , complaining that his study " has been misrepresented in recent press releases distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee .
The press release claims our report estimates an average cost per family of a carbon cap and trade program that would meet targets now being discussed in Congress to be over $ 3,000 , but that is nearly 10 times the correct estimate , which is approximately $ 340 . "
( The $ 340 is a cost per family of four , comparable to the $ 215 we used as the cost per household of 2.56 people . )
Reilly said it was " simplistic and misleading " to interpret the statistics the way the Republicans did because the administration 's cap and trade proposal has " been designed to offset the energy cost impacts on middle and lower income households . "
A day later Boehner responded with a statement that insisted $ 3,128 was accurate .
" In reality , it would be a tax of up to $ 3,100 per family on every American family that drives a car , buys products manufactured in the United States , or flips on a light switch , " Boehner said in the statement .
On April 22 , the conservative Weekly Standard came to the defense of the Republicans and published an article that said Reilly had erred in calculating the cost .
It said that Reilly had since corrected the figure from the original $ 340 to $ 800 .
The article by John McCormack , an editorial assistant at the publication , said that even with the corrected figure , Reilly was " still low - balling the cost of cap and trade by using some fuzzy logic .
In reality , cap and trade could cost the average household more than $ 3,900 per year . "
The Weekly Standard noted that Obama plans to use some of the cap - and - trade revenues to fund his " making work pay " tax credit of $ 400 per individual and $ 800 per family per year but then did not reflect that plan in the ultimate cost to households .
It said there was no proof that Reilly is correct to assume that " the $ 3,128 will be ' returned ' to each household . "
The article also said that our PolitiFact item was incorrect because we relied on Reilly 's numbers .
Several PolitiFact readers who apparently believe that Reilly 's corrected figure means the Republicans are now accurate , wrote to us and urged us to publish a correction .
So we have revisited the numbers to provide this update .
First , we should emphasize that our original item was simple and straightforward .
The Republicans said their claim was based on the MIT study .
But Reilly , the author of that study , said the Republicans were misrepresenting his work .
And not only that , he said he'd told them they were misrepresenting his work before they made the claim , and they made the claim anyway .
That struck us as an egregious falsehood .
And it 's important to recognize that our Pants on Fire rating was on the overall statement that , " The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes , including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $ 3,128 a year . "
The first part of that statement about nationalized health care is completely false .
The Obama administration is not proposing nationalized health care , a phrase we believe is meant to invoke fears of socialized medicine .
Yet Republicans have repeatedly made that inaccurate claim .
So that part of the claim was and remains ridiculously false .
Now , in light of Reilly 's revised number and Boehner 's refusal to change what he says , let 's reconsider the second part of the claim , that the Obama administration is proposing " a light switch tax that would cost every American household $ 3,128 a year . "
First , calling it a light switch tax remains incorrect .
That implies that it is a federal tax levied on consumers when in fact it is an extrapolation of the per-family burden of a new federal charge that would be levied on energy companies .
To say it " would cost every American household $ 3,128 a year " suggests tremendous precision .
But we have found virtually no precision about anything to do with the cap and trade proposals because they are still very much just in the talking stages .
Indeed , the House Democratic version is known as the " discussion draft " and , although there are some broad concepts , key details about how the program would work , its ultimate cost and how Americans would be reimbursed for higher energy costs are still far from final .
But , given Reilly 's corrected number , is it now accurate to say it will cost every household $ 3,128 a year ?
No , it 's not .
As we said in our original item , Reilly 's analysis has produced two different ways to measure the cost of a cap and trade system .
One way is the total estimate of federal revenues from a cap and trade auction , which indeed works out to $ 3,128 per family in the United States .
That 's the amount of money the energy companies would have to pay the federal government , and presumably the companies would pass those costs to consumers through higher prices .
The issue then becomes whether or not the Obama administration intends to offset that cost to families .
Republicans take the position , which was echoed by the Weekly Standard , that the Obama administration has no such plans .
Reilly says the administration does .
Who 's right ?
Of course , we can't really know what the administration intends to do , but the available record makes it pretty clear that the White House has made plans to return to families the money the cap and trade program might cost them in energy bills .
Some of it -- $ 400 per year for individuals , $ 800 for families -- would go directly back to families through the " making work pay " tax credit totalling $ 65 billion per year , according to the Obama budget proposal .
An additional $ 15 billion per year would benefit them indirectly through research and development on clean energy technologies .
And the budget specifies that " all additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public . "
That backs up Reilly 's claim that the $ 3,128 is effectively returned to people .
The second way to look at the cost of cap and trade is through the impact the proposal would have on the overall economy -- the extent to which the new system would constrain the economy and slow its growth .
That 's the source of Reilly 's $ 340 number , which he has corrected to $ 800 .
That number is still far short of the very precise $ 3,128 the Republicans have been using .
And Republican leaders continue to toss around the $ 3,100 number , often with no caveats or qualifiers -- or mention of the $ 800 .
We called Reilly to get his reaction to the article in the Weekly Standard and the Republicans ' latest claim .
He said the Weekly Standard editorial assistant who wrote the story " just completely twisted the whole thing . "
He said his correction to the $ 800 figure did n't substantially improve the accuracy of what the Republicans are contending .
Their claim " is a misrepresentation .
They are basing ( the $ 3,128 ) on our study and that is an incorrect use of our study .
It 's false . "
Here at PolitiFact , we 're sure there will be plenty of other claims in the next few months that will allow us to further examine the cost of a cap and trade proposal .
This claim has centered on Reilly 's two - year - old study , but other studies have been done more recently and will soon be in the political mix .
But for now , this claim remains a serious distortion in many ways .
It is a ridiculous falsehood to say the money is being used " for nationalized health care . "
It is inaccurate to call it a " light switch tax . "
And it is incorrect to cite a precise " tax " of $ 3,128 -- with no caveats or qualifiers -- when the Obama administration has specified how the money would be returned to people .
Given Reilly 's comments that they are using his numbers improperly , we see nothing to change our conclusion .
So our original ruling stands : Pants on Fire .

SLEEP PARALYSIS
Updated January 26 , 1999
See our updated article about sleep paralysis on the new Stanford Sleep and Dreams website .
Sleep paralysis consists of a period of inability to perform voluntary movements either at sleep onset ( called hypnogogic or predormital form ) or upon awakening ( called hypnopompic or postdormtal form ) .
Sleep paralysis may also be referred to as isolated sleep paralysis , familial sleep paralysis , hynogogic or hypnopompic paralysis , predormital or postdormital paralysis
What are the symptoms ?
A complaint of inability to move the trunk or limbs at sleep onset or upon awakening
Presence of brief episodes of partial or complete skeletal muscle paralysis
Episodes can be associated with hypnagogic hallucinations or dream - like mentation ( act or use of the brain )
Polysomnography ( a sleep recording ) shows at least one of the following :
suppression of skeletal muscle tone
a sleep onset REM period
dissociated REM sleep
Is it harmful ?
Sleep paralysis is most often associated with narcolepsy , a neurological condition in which the person has uncontrollable naps .
However , there are many people who experience sleep paralysis without having signs of narcolepsy .
Sometimes it runs in families .
There is no known explanation why some people experience this paralysis .
It is not harmful , although most people report feeling very afraid because they do not know what is happening , and within minutes they gradually or abruptly are able to move again ; the episode is often terminated by a sound or a touch on the body .
In some cases , when hypnogogic hallucinations are present , people feel that someone is in the room with them , some experience the feeling that someone or something is sitting on their chest and they feel impending death and suffocation .
That has been called the  Hag Phenomena  and has been happening to people over the centuries .
These things cause people much anxiety and terror , but there is no physical harm .
What else can you tell me about sleep paralysis ?
Some people with disrupted sleep schedules or circadian rhythm disturbances experience sleep paralysis
A study found that 35 % of subjects with isolated sleep paralysis also reported a history of wake panic attacks unrelated to the experience of paralysis
Sixteen percent of these persons with isolated sleep paralysis met the criteria for panic disorder
How can I stop the sleep paralysis ?
In severe cases , where episodes take place at least once a week for 6 months , medication may be used .
You may be able to minimize the episodes by following good sleep hygiene :
getting enough sleep
reduce stress
exercise regularly ( but not too close to bedtime )
keep a regular sleep schedule

The President of the United Nations General Assembly has told delegates at the 5th World Water Forum ( WWF ) in Istanbul , Turkey , that , " those who are committed to the privatization of water , making it a commodity like oil , are denying people a human right as basic as the air we breathe . "
In a speech delivered by his senior advisor on water Maude Barlow , UN president Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann said , " We must work quickly to guarantee that access to drinking water constitutes a fundamental right of all peoples ... "
" Water belongs to the people , to the ecosystem and the species and it belongs to the future " had said Maude Barlow earlier this week in Istanbul .
Ms Barlow , who is also the national chairperson of the Council of Canadians , delivered the president 's message to the People 's Water Forum , a counter - forum being held by hundreds of civil society members from nearly 70 countries whose voices have not been at the WWF .
The speech was later released to the World Water Forum , which is being attended by 20,000 delegates from 150 countries .
The UN president also questioned the legitimacy of the forum itself .
His speech stated , " The forum 's orientation is profoundly influenced by private water companies .
This is evident by the fact that both the president of the World Water Council and the alternate president are deeply involved with provision of private , for - profit , water services . "
He added that future forums should , " conduct their deliberations under the auspices of the United Nations . "
D'Escoto Brockmann also criticized the World Water Forum 's draft Ministerial Declaration , which sees water as a " human need " rather than a human right .
He said , " As it stands , this important statement undermines the efforts of those who are struggling for access to clean water and sanitation . "
" Global water justice movement advocates welcome this being the last World Water Forum in its present format , " adds Barlow .
" There is an urgent need for an accountable and legitimate global water forum to be held regularly to address the grave threats facing our blue planet . "
Earlier last week , a group of 118 organizations from 33 countries had signed and issued a letter to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon that calls on him to withdraw his support for the ' CEO Water Mandate ' , a corporate driven water initiative under the ' UN Global Compact ' that facilitates corporate control of water resources .
Representatives of the letter 's signatories had delivered a copy of the letter to the Deputy Director of the UN Global Compact , Gavin Power at the 5th World Water Forum .
The CEO Water Mandate 's leading endorsers currently include water bottlers Coca - Cola , Nestlé , and Pepsi , as well as Suez , one of the world 's largest privatizers of water services and systems .
" All of these corporations have a vested interest in controlling water resources and profiting from water scarcity , so there is a great danger in leaving international water policy in such hands , " said Richard Girard , researcher for the Polaris Institute .
" Those who are dealing with corporate control of water 's manifold downsides – water takings , water shut - offs , price hikes , short cuts on water treatment – are people deeply affected by the water crisis and corporations ' actions , " said Mark Hays from Corporate Accountability International .
" Yet these same people , who are going thirsty , do n't have a true voice at these meetings – their voices need to be heard , and they should be in the drivers ' seat . "
The Global Water Justice Movement activists are calling on the United Nations to take the lead in creating transparent , democratic space to decide international water policy .
But to date , the UN continues to be in a contradictory position by , on the one hand , raising awareness about the world water crisis and calling for needed change , and on the other housing the CEO Water Mandate .
Groups like the Polaris Institute and Corporate Accountability International are challenging the CEO Mandate because it allows corporations to undermine democratic control of water under the aegis of the United Nations .
Cosmic close - up : Sensational images of Saturn show the ringed planet in incredible detail
Advertisement
These stunning images of Saturn taken by Nasa 's Cassini spacecraft show the ringed planet , its moons and rings in the most incredible detail yet .
Extraordinary glimpses of the planet 's atmosphere and surfaces add to our expanding understanding of the sixth planet in the solar system , as the Equinox mission approaches its second year .
The images show the incredible differences within the Saturn system .
In one image , serene - looking rings are elegantly stacked up around its equator , making a striking contrast to the cratered appearance of its plethora of moons .
SCROLL DOWN TO SEE VIDEO OF HOW CASSINI SCANS THE PLANETS
This image was taken by Cassini as it moved above the dark side of the planet .
As very little light makes its way through the rings , they appear somewhat dark compared with the reflective surface of Saturn .
This view combines 45 images taken over the course of about two hours
Pan , a 17 - mile - wide moon coasts into view from behind Saturn ( the small white dot within the black horizontal strip in the centre of the image ) .
This photograph was captured from a distance of 1.1 million miles away
The body of the planet itself cuts an even more striking contrast with its moons , with swirling vortexes revealing a seething cauldron of activity .
It also shows its largest moon , Titan , to have intriguing parallels with Earth .
‘ We 're looking at a string of remarkable discoveries - about Saturn 's magnificent rings , its amazing moons , its dynamic magnetosphere and about Titan 's surface and atmosphere , ’ said Dr. Linda Spilker , deputy project scientist .
Rhea , another moon , drifts in front of Saturn .
The image was taken at a distance of approximately 358,000 miles away
The Cassini spacecraft looks through Saturn 's translucent inner C ring to capture its yellow - blue atmosphere
‘ Some of the mission highlights so far include discovering that Titan ( Saturn 's largest moon ) has Earth - like processes and that the small moon Enceladus has a hot - spot at its southern pole - jets on the surface that spew out ice crystals and evidence of liquid water beneath its surface . ’
The Cassini spacecraft first blasted off from Earth in 1999 .
In the first five years of its illuminating voyage , it photographed the moon , Mars and Jupiter , only approaching Saturn on June 30 , 2004 .
The first close - up study of the ringed planet , which ended in June last year , provided such opportunities for exploration and discovery that the space agency extended it for another two years .
One of Saturn 's moons , Rhea , passes in front of the planet 's largest moon , Titan ( lit from behind by the Sun ) .
The Cassini mission found Titan to have parallels with Earth .
This composite of two images shows Pan , left , and Prometheus , right , in nearby rings .
Pan is trailed by a series of edge waves in the outer boundary of the gap .
Prometheus just touches the inner edge of Saturn 's F ring , and is followed by a series of dark channels
This image was taken during Cassini 's close approach to the moon Iapetus .
It was taken with a wide - angle camera at a distance of approximately 2,400 miles
The extended mission has been called ‘ Cassini Equinox ’ in anticipation of Saturn ’s approaching equinox in August this year , when its equator and planetary rings will align vertically below the sun .
Saturn ’s equinox , like that of Earth , is a period of change in the planetary system .
The space agency believes monitoring seasonal shifts in the atmosphere , oceans and land at that time is critical to gain the most insight into the planet ’s workings .
Cassini tracks the moon Prometheus as it orbits Saturn .
Prometheus is just about to pass behind the planet , and a faint streamer of ring material lies below and to the right of it , in the faint , inner strand of the F ring
Saturn 's high north is a seething cauldron of rolling cloud bands and swirling vortices .
This image was taken at a distance of approximately 336,000 miles
During the extended mission , the spacecraft will orbit Saturn a further 60 times , fly past Saturn 's moon Titan 26 more times , Eleceladus seven , and once past each of the moons Dione , Rhea and Helene .
Using a collection of powerful instruments , Cassini scientists will focus on seasonal changes in particular on Titan and Saturn , and unique ring events during the passing of the equinox , including the shadows seen in the rings as the sun passes .
The complex Saturn system has 61 known moons plus hundreds of ‘ moonlets ’ concealed within its rings .
Small , battered Epimetheus before Saturn 's A and F rings , and and smog - enshrouded Titan beyond .
The colours here are artificial in order to approximate the scene as it might appear to human eyes
This bizarre scene shows the cloud - streaked area of Saturn in front of the planet 's B ring .
The ring 's image is warped by the diffuse gas in Saturn 's upper atmosphere
Observations of Titan , Saturn ’s largest moon , have shed new light on the likely appearance of Earth before life evolved , Nasa believes .
Experts claim the many parallels can be seen in its land formations , which include lakes , rivers , dunes , mountains and possibly volcanoes .
Weather patterns also show striking similarity to those on our own planet , with clouds , rain and snow .
This image shows Saturn 's rings and the shadow of nearby Mimas .
They are now nearly edge - on toward the Sun , and long moon shadows drape across them .
Scientists are now studying the clumpy , disturbed ring material , stretching up to two miles above the ring plane - contrasted with an estimated normal ring thickness of only six feet
This image shows Saturn through the thick smoggy haze of the upper atmosphere from its largest moon , Titan
The shadow of Tethys drifts across the face of Saturn .
Nearby , shadows of the planet 's rings form a darkened band above the equator
Saturn 's northern hemisphere is seen here against its nested rings .
The rings have been brightened relative to the planet to enhance visibility
Stars provide a serene background in this view of Enceladus while it was in eclipse , with Saturn 's shadow moving over it .
The view shows the moon 's south pole
In this image of Saturn 's F ring , taken shortly after its ring particles encountered the shepherd moon Prometheus , the disruption to the ring caused by the moon is evident .
The bright core of the ring and its neighbouring faint strands show kinks where the moon 's gravity has altered the orbits of the ring particles
Cassini looks toward Rhea 's cratered , icy landscape with the dark line of Saturn 's ringplane and the planet 's murky atmosphere as a background .
Rhea is Saturn 's second - largest moon
The spacecraft Cassini looks through the fine , smoke - sized ice particles of Saturn 's F ring toward the cratered face of Mimas
Mimas appears to hover above the colourful rings .
The large crater seen on the right side of the moon is named after William Herschel , who discovered Mimas in 1789

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - About 30 U.S. Marines in southern California on the biggest military base in the United States have been quarantined after one of them was confirmed to have contracted the swine flu virus , the Marine Corps said on Wednesday .
The case was identified at the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center and was confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control , the base said in a statement .
The base has 8,000 active - duty Marines and is the primary training center for Marines and sailors deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan .
The ill Marine is being treated as an outpatient at the base and will remain isolated at his barracks .
“ He is doing well , and his condition continues to improve , ” the base statement said .
About 30 other Marines who had been “ active socially ” with him are being quarantined as well , the statement said .
They will be permitted to return to full duty after five days if they display no flu - like symptoms , it added .
“ The Marine Corps , along with all of the armed forces , is monitoring the health of our force to ensure we ’re taking the necessary precautions to educate and safeguard military and civilian personnel , as well as family members , ” the statement said .
At a Pentagon briefing earlier in the day , Marine Corps commandant General James Conway said the ill Marine at Twentynine Palms had not been to Mexico , where as many as 159 deaths have been attributed to the virus .
Researchers at New York University 's interactive telecommunications program have come up with a device that allows plants to tell owners when they need water or if they 've had too much via the social network blogging service Twitter .
WASHINGTON - Chances are you 've never had a conversation with your house plants but if they could talk , what would they say ?
" Water me . "
Researchers at New York University 's interactive telecommunications program have come up with a device that allows plants to tell owners when they need water or if they 've had too much via the social network blogging service Twitter .
" Obviously plants can't talk or Twitter directly , so we have to help them along with that , " said Rob Faludi , co-creator of the device called Botanicalls .
The device is made of soil - moisture sensors that are connected to a circuit board .
They measure the level of moisture , and then communicate the information to a microcontroller .
" There are settings in the software that allow you to set what kind of plant you 're using and also adjust for characteristics of the soil , different soil has different qualities , " said Faludi .
The device determines whether moisture levels are too low , or too high , and then transmits a wireless signal to Twitter , via the Internet , which lets people send short , 140 - character text messages to their network of friends .
Botanicalls co-creator Kate Hartman said the language used in the Twitter messages can be personalized to suit the owner , or the type of plant .
" There 's always a basic " I 'm thirsty , could you please water me " message .
But they also accelerate in terms of need , so there 's an urgent message : " I 'm desperately thirsty , please water me , " " Hartman told Reuters .
GROWING TWITTER FOLLOWING
Due to word of mouth , Hartman 's plant , ' Pothos , ' has more than 2,300 subscribers on Twitter ( http://twitter.com/pothos).
Every day followers receive messages updating them on the plant 's soil moisture content , and whether it 's being cared for .
" I feel a bit more guilty when I do n't water Pothos , because everybody knows , " laughed Hartman .
To date , Hartman and Faludi have sold nearly 100 of the Botanicalls kits for $ 99 each with the device needing to be assembled from basic parts which Faludi said can be challenging but worthwhile in the end .
" Actually receiving a message from a plant is just very engaging , and I think kind of unexpected .
There 's a magic to it that people really enjoy , " said Faludi .
The new technology follows on from an earlier Botanicalls model released in 2007 that enabled plants to make a phone call to their owners when they needed water .
Each plant had a ' voice ' to match the plant type , such as the Scottish moss , which had a Scottish accent .
But the earlier model required expensive hardware , and was n't practical to sell which prompted the Twitter version .
" There 's a lot of interest right now in smart objects - basically , devices that have the ability to communicate .
This is a type of technology that is becoming much more prevalent as the cost of wireless communications goes down , " said Faludi .
" The spirit of Botanicalls is not creating a robotic plant .
The spirit of Botanicalls is really re-engaging people with nature and getting them to pay attention . "
Here is the protocol from the Queen of England 's website -- which applies even to her own subjects :
" The Queen meets thousands of people each year in the UK and overseas .
Before meeting Her Majesty , many people ask how they should behave .
The simple answer is that there are no obligatory codes of behaviour - just courtesy .
However , many people wish to observe the traditional forms of greeting .
For men this is a neck bow ( from the head only ) whilst women do a small curtsy .
Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way .
On presentation to The Queen , the correct formal address is ' Your Majesty ' and subsequently ' Ma'am ' . "
Facebook users have lower overall grades than non-users , according to a survey of college students who also ironically said the social networking site does not interfere with studying .
That disconnect between perception and reality does not necessarily mean that Facebook leads to less studying and worse grades -- the grades association could be caused by something else .
However , it does raise more questions about how students spend their time outside class on activities such as Facebook , part - time jobs and extracurricular activities .
" I 'm just saying that there 's some kind of relationship there , and there 's many third variables that need to be studied , " said Aryn Karpinski , an education researcher at Ohio State University .
Her study found that Facebook user GPAs were in the 3.0 to 3.5 range on average , compared to 3.5 to 4.0 for non-users .
Facebook users also studied anywhere from one to five hours per week , compared to non-users who studied 11 to 15 or more hours per week .
However , Karpinski emphasized that correlation does not equal causation , meaning Facebook use might not be the culprit behind lower GPAs or less study time .
For instance , students who spend more time enjoying themselves rather than studying might tend to latch onto the nearest distraction , such as Facebook .
Or students who use the social networking site might also spend more time on other non-studying activities such as sports or music .
The study did show that students who work more hours at jobs spend less time on Facebook , while students involved in more extracurricular activities were also more likely to use Facebook .
Such results may help Karpinski and other researchers better understand the profile of the average user on the popular social networking site .
Early findings show that over 85 percent of undergrads use Facebook , compared to 52 percent of grad students .
Karpinski herself does not use Facebook , although her coauthor does .
She expressed some bemusement over how quickly students rose to the defense of their online activities , even though she took care not to introduce a positive or negative bias into her survey questions .
" They 're very territorial about their Facebook , " Karpinski told LiveScience .
The research will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Education Research Association on April 16 .

Remember the “ Big Mouth Billy Bass ? ”
You ’d press a button ( or trigger a proximity sensor for a surprise ) and the fish would start singing either Al Green ’s “ Take Me To The River , ” or Bobby McFerrin ’s “ Do n’t Worry , Be Happy . ”
Jeff Foxworthy once quipped that if you had more than three singing fish , “ you might be a redneck . ”
Texan Richard Carter took a Volvo , 5 miles of wire , five 6 - volt golf cart batteries , a screw drive mechanism using 12v DC reversible motor , a lifting frame he made from scratch , a Linux server and approximately two hundred synchronized singing fish , and created what can only be described as an awesomely effective assault on good taste .

When machines become too much like us : Exploring the " Uncanny Valley "
Image credit : Image credit : BradBeattie
How are new technologies influencing marketing and consumer privacy ?
We love cute dogs , cute monkeys , clairvoyant websites , smart voice mail systems .
But we get totally wigged out when a website knows too much about us , when we start talking to a voice mail attendant like she 's a real person or when a photo or a robot is just too good .
A magician is fine , an actual mind reader we burn at the stake .
The relevant issue here for marketers is what happens when our databases and predictions get too good .
I do n't want the hotel to automatically serve me the same breakfast that I ordered during my last trip , or for the doorman to pretend he's my friend just because he read a database entry about me .
How can you navigate this environment -- and what 's the upside ?
Where does your Uncanny Valley begin ?
What in - store technologies are you looking forward to as a shopper , and which ones do you think are just plain creepy ?
There 's been a lot of talk lately about " billboards that watch you back . "
Some of the news comes from the trade side , with new companies announcing products that identify individuals ( either uniquely or generally along some demographic lines ) , and then serve them targeted content or record their presence .
However , a growing part of the discussion is taking place in the mainstream press -- the likes of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal -- who are starting to wonder what effect all of this covert surveillance and tailored advertising is having on society .
Since these entities are commercial and ad - sponsored themselves , I would n't count on them for an unbiased review .
But one thing 's for certain : people are starting to realize that we 're entering the age of surveillance , and that for better or worse , this transition will change the way we work , play and shop .
Maybe .
When it comes to shopping and marketing at - retail , people generally like personalization .
We know that loyalty card holders spend more , and that they rate their visits as more pleasant .
( There 's some self - selection going on there , of course , but that can't be helped . )
We know that trade promotion and sampling programs work well and score high on customer satisfaction polls .
And we know that people like getting personalized coupons , and are more apt to use them compared to generic coupons .
But at some point , it seems like it will all break down .
I 'd probably be OK with a digital signage screen identifying me as a clean - shaven male and playing back a spot for new Gilette Ninja Xtreem Ultra Pro shaving gel .
I 'd be less comfortable with it knowing that I was shopper # 12345 , and that my Dr. Scholls might need replacing .
And if it knew my name and started telling me about any of the more unmentionable products in the health care aisle , I 'd turn around , leave the store , and never come back .
Where do we draw the line ?
Well , I 've been getting calls and emails from tech vendors , journalists and privacy advocates asking what kinds of services can be offered at retail to help the shopper without seeming pushy , creepy , or violating their privacy .
I let these requests stack up for a while now because , quite frankly , I just do n't know .
After thinking it over some more , I put together this chart to help illustrate the challenge : Worried yet ?
Yeah , me too , a little .
But let 's take a step back and consider how the whole idea of the Uncanny Valley came to be , and how this relates to privacy and personalization .
Back in the 1970s , sci-fi was entering mainstream culture and the field of robotics was just getting off the ground .
In this early period , Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori first described the Uncanny Valley .
As Wikipedia tells us , " When robots and other facsimiles of humans look and act almost like actual humans , it causes a response of revulsion among human observers .
The ' valley ' in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot 's lifelikeness . "
Basically , the more human - like something tries to appear or act , the more we scrutinize its non-human characteristics .
This is the effect that allowsto be cute and endearing , but makesseem creepy and ... well , creepy .
But ... As I started thinking about this , I discovered that Seth Godin already had it all figured out .
As usual , Seth also explained the issue more eloquently ( and less loquaciously ) than I could : The Uncanny Valley begins and ends in different spots for me than it does for you .
Heck , you might even havefor all I know .
But ensuring that marketers do n't overstep their bounds and shoppers continue to trust and enjoy their retail experiences is going to require a real , ongoing dialog between those that sell products and those that buy them .
This will have to go beyond mere disclosure of surveillance practices or robust opt- in and opt - out policies , though those will certainly need to exist and be enforced too .
But there 's real upside to be had , if the graph above is to be believed .
At some level of personalization , we ought to be able to get through the valley and deliver higher levels of service that people will genuinely appreciate .
While personal shoppers are probably going to be off - limits to all but the super rich for the near future , there may be some low - cost , low - touch method out there that gets past the valley , boosts sales or loyalty for retailers , and leaves shoppers with a warm , fuzzy feeling all at once .
California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) told a press conference in his home town Monday he had introduced a bill that would create a system of taxed and regulated legal marijuana sales and production .
If the bill were to pass , California would become the first state in the nation to break so decisively with decades of pot prohibition .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , sponsor of AB 390
Under the bill , AB 390 , the state would license producers and distributors , who would pay an excise tax of $ 50 per ounce , or about $ 1 per joint .
Anyone 21 or over could then purchase marijuana from a licensed distributor .
The bill also would allow any adult to grow up to 10 plants for personal , non-commercial use .
The bill would not alter California 's medical marijuana law .
Ironically it was California which passed the nation 's first marijuana prohibition bill , in 1913 , according to a history compiled by Drug WarRant 's Peter Guither .
Federal marijuana prohibition was enacted in 1937 .
As currently written , the taxation and regulation aspects of AB 390 would not go into effect until six months after federal marijuana laws were changed , but the removal of marijuana as a controlled substance under California law would go into effect upon passage of the bill .
That is likely to change .
" We 've just come through a torturous budget process in this state , and the marijuana industry in California is $ 14 billion going up in smoke , " said Ammiano .
" We need to capture some of that .
This would also allow us to save money on law enforcement , incarceration , and even the environment . "
According to research done by the state Board of Equalization , which handles taxes for the state , legalizing and taxing marijuana sales would generate about $ 1.3 billion in tax revenues a year .
It would also , the board said , lead to a 50 % decrease in retail prices .
Oakland City Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan
" This is a responsible measure for prioritizing law enforcement , " the board 's Betty Yee told the assembled media .
" These numbers are a credible new estimate . "
" It 's ironic that the largest cash crop in the state is not being taxed , " said Oakland City Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan .
" We need to devote our law enforcement resources to violent crime .
We 're losing the war .
It 's time for regulation and fiscal responsibility . "
" This bill is a winning proposition for California 's taxpayers , " said Dale Gieringer of California NORML ( CANORML ) .
" In this time of economic crisis , it makes no sense for California to be wasting money on marijuana prohibition , when we could be reaping tax benefits from a legal , regulated market instead . "
It also comes at a time when support for marijuana legalization on the West Coast has gained majority status .
In a Zogby International poll released last week , 58 % of West Coast respondents said they favored taxing and regulating marijuana .
" This is indicative of what an important moment we are at , " said Bruce Mirken , communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" This week , we saw Dan Walters , a middle of the road columnist for the Sacramento Bee do a column saying now is the time to do this .
The Los Angeles Times said it was time for the feds to rethink this .
There is a growing sense that Ammiano has captured that the way we 've been dealing with marijuana since 1937 does n't make a bit of sense and rethinking is required . "
Judge James P. Gray , Orange County Superior Court
" This is landmark legislation , " said Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
" There has never been a legalization bill in the history of marijuana law reform .
This is the first such bill . "
But , St. Pierre revealed , before summer is here , at least two more states will see similar bills .
" California is leading the country in the discussion , but it wo n't be by itself .
By June , there will be 45 or 50 million people having a discussion about legalizing marijuana -- not decrim , not medical , not lowest law enforcement priority , but marijuana legalization . "
" I think with the introduction of this bill , we have reached the tipping point in the discussion about marijuana , " said St. Pierre .
" When the largest state in the nation , facing crushing economic times , is forced to review the festering situation of all that untaxed marijuana and it already has the example of retail access through the dispensaries , the discussion has changed . "
" You do n't know if you 're at the tipping point until you 've gone past it , but we could be , " said Mirken .
" Nobody imagines it 's going to get done overnight , but we 've suddenly reached the point where it's no longer a fringe issue , and that 's huge . "
" I think this is the beginning of the end , " said Southern California legalization activist Clifford Shaffer , creator of the Let Us Pay Taxes web site , which pleads " Take our Money Please , " purportedly on behalf of the California marijuana industry .
" A number of factors have come together , such as public education , the obvious failure of the drug war , and the economy , and they are producing a ' perfect storm ' for reform .
We will see big changes in the coming year and this bill is a good start , " Shaffer predicted .
Acceptable progress this year , said Mirken , would be for the bill to move forward at all .
" A good year would be getting a couple of committee hearings and though a couple of committees , laying the groundwork for actual passage in a year or two .
The conversation was long overdue , but it has now been engaged . "
" I 'm not so naïve as to think it will pass this year , " agreed CANORML's Gieringer .
" I think the conflict with federal law will pose problems with law enforcement for sure , and we know the governor always supports law enforcement .
This is the opening shot in a process that could take several years to work out , but we have now opened the debate .
For all the years I 've been dealing with this issue , politicians have been afraid to say anything more than medical marijuana or decriminalization , but as long as you do n't move beyond decrim , you still get all the problems of prohibition , " he argued .
" It 's essential to get past decriminalization ; it keeps the problems of prohibition and does n't bring any revenue to the state , " Gieringer continued .
" We need a viable solution , not some half - baked one that would n't solve the problems .
And I think we 're close to having a majority here in California .
I know we have majority support in Oakland , San Francisco , and other parts of Northern California .
I think we 're getting there . "
It 's been 96 years since California passed that first marijuana prohibition law .
Can prohibition be ended before it enters its second century ?
Thanks to Assemblyman Ammiano's AB 390 , we can dream that maybe it just might .
CHARLOTTE , N.C. , April 13 ( UPI ) --
The birth of a baby conceived from sperm frozen for 21 years may tie the world record for the longest - frozen , viable sperm , U.S. fertility specialists say .
Thirty - eight - year - old Chris Biblis of Charlotte , N.C. , was treated for leukemia from age 13 - 18 .
In 1987 , at age 16 , his family encouraged him to freeze his sperm , even though there was no treatment for male infertility at the time .

It was not until 1992 that the first baby was born from intracytoplasmic sperm injection -- a breakthrough fertility technology in which scientists inject a carefully selected healthy sperm cell into a human egg in the lab -- fertility specialists of Reproductive Endocrinology Associates of Charlotte said .
Biblis has been clinically disease - free for more than 20 years .
Last May , he and his wife , Melodie , 33 , also in excellent health , sought fertility treatment with Reproductive Endocrinology Associates of Charlotte founder and fertility specialist Dr. Richard L. Wing .
" They achieved pregnancy on their first cycle of intracytoplasmic sperm injection used in conjunction with in vitro fertilization , a now - routine procedure for male infertility , using her eggs and his frozen sperm , " Wing said in a statement .
" We had every reason to expect a perfect baby but are thrilled nonetheless . "
Baby Stella Biblis was born in excellent health March 4 , Wing said .

The World of Trends , the Stock Market , and Technology .
Leading climate scientist Dr. Jim Hansen , director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , and his wife Anniek have written a personal appeal to both Michelle and Barack Obama on the urgent need to come to grips with climate change .
The Hansens open the letter with appealing to the Obama ’s as parents and concerned citizens :
“ We write to you as fellow parents concerned about the Earth that will be inherited by our children , grandchildren , and those yet to be born … Jim has advised governments previously through regular channels .
But urgency now dictates a personal appeal . ”
A profound disconnect
[ social_buttons ]
The Hansens speak of the “ profound disconnect ” between current public policy on climate change “ … and what the science demands for preservation of the planet . ”
Hansen is particularly critical of the Kyoto Protocol strategy of global climate action , calling it “ ineffectual and not commensurate with the climate threat ” .
The continuing United Nations process of national emission reduction targets “ could waste another decade ” .
Of paramount importance , according to Hansen , is the need to quickly phase out coal power emissions :
“ The critical need to cut off the coal source soon must be recognized .
I was surprised that in 90 minutes I could not get the German Environmental Minister to understand that their proposed “ carbon cap ” would not allow them to build 20 more coal - fired power plants .
I kept saying “ if you burn more coal you must convince Russia to leave its oil in the ground ” and he would say “ we will tighten the carbon cap ” .
Japan thinks that it did fine in meeting its Kyoto obligations , even though its coal use and CO2 emissions increased .
[ Japan used Kyoto - allowed escape hatches .
The Earth has no escape hatch . ] ”
Hansen rejects carbon cap - and - trade schemes saying that a carbon cap “ that makes one more stinking millionaire on the backs of the public is going to infuriate the public .
Me too .
There is no need to support lobbyists , traders , and special interests . ”
Instead , Hansen favors a carbon tax “ across all fossil fuels at their source ” :
“ A rising tax ( with all the other needed measures such as building codes , vehicle efficiencies ,
renewable energies … ) will help constrain demand for the fuel .
When gasoline hits $ 4 - 5 / gallon again , most of that should be tax staying in the country and returned as dividend , providing the consumer the means to purchase more efficient products and incentive for entrepreneurs to develop them .
A rising tax will help keep the price paid for the oil itself ( or other fossil fuel ) lower , thus making it unprofitable to go to the most extreme places on the planet to extract the last drop of oil .
Instead we can move on sooner to the energies of the post - fossil - fuel - era .
… The tax should be proportional to the carbon amount and the dividend calculation will only require long division , which even a civil servant can do .
100 % of the tax should go into the dividends .
However , if some countries do not apply an equivalent tax , a duty should be collected on fossil - fuel dependent products imported from that country .
Such import duties might be used , in part , to finance reforestation , climate adaptation , or other climate or energy related needs . ”
The final point Hansen makes in his three - pronged approach outlined in the letter is , perhaps surprisingly to some , his support for “ fourth generation ” nuclear power :
“ It would be great if energy efficiency , renewable energies , and an improved ( “ smart ” ) electric grid could satisfy all energy needs .
However , the future of our children should not rest on that gamble .
The danger is that the minority of vehement antinuclear “ environmentalists ” could cause development of advanced safe nuclear power to be slowed such that utilities are forced to continue coal - burning in order to keep the lights on .
That is a prescription for disaster .
There is no need for a decision to deploy nuclear power on a large scale .
What is needed is rapid development of the potential , including prototypes , so that options are available .
We have to avoid a “ FutureGen ” sort of drag - out .
It seems to me that it is time to get fed - up with those people who think they can impose their will on everybody , and all the consequences that might imply for the planet , by putting this R&D on a slow boat to nowhere instead of on the fast - track that it deserves . ”
While in England with her husband , who was attending meeting , Anniek Hansen suffured a heart attack .
The couple wrote the letter while awaiting permission from Anniek ’s physician to make the trip home .
John Holdren , Barack Obama ’s pick for Whithe House Science Adviser , was given the letter with a request to personally deliver it to the Obamas .

How many arms does a spiral galaxy have ?
Can you spot a galaxy with a central “ peanut ” bulge ?
How about a galactic merger ?
You wo n't need a towel to write an astronomical ' Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy ' , just a computer .
Answers to these and other strange questions will be provided by worldwide web users in an online citizen science project called Galaxy Zoo 2 , which launches today .
The new initiative is a follow - up to the highly successful Galaxy Zoo project that enabled members of the public to take part in astronomy research online .
By working together , they proved to be just as good at spotting galaxies as professional astronomers .
But whereas the original site only asked users to identify whether a galaxy ’s shape was spiral or elliptical , and which way it was rotating , Galaxy Zoo 2 asks them to delve deeper into 250,000 of the brightest and best galaxies to search for the strange and unusual .
“ The first Galaxy Zoo provided us with a rough guide to the sky and now we want our users to fill in all the details and create a real Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxies , ” said Chris Lintott of Oxford University , one of the founders of Galaxy Zoo .
Astronomers came up with the idea of involving online volunteers because the human brain is better at pattern recognition than a computer .
What they did n’t expect was the huge enthusiasm for the project .
In the 18 months since Galaxy Zoo ’s initial launch , more than 150,000 armchair astronomers from all over the world have made 80 million classifications of one million galaxies .
Kevin Schawinski of Yale University , another of Galaxy Zoo ’s founders , said , “ The response from the public was absolutely overwhelming .
With their help , we ’ve been able to learn a lot about how galaxies evolve and how they relate to their environment .
With the detail from Zoo 2 , we 'll be able to discover even more about how galaxies work .
” Steven Bamford of the University of Nottingham said , “ Galaxy Zoo has given everyone with a computer an opportunity to contribute to real scientific research .
We want people to feel truly involved in the project and keep them up to date with what we ’re doing with the results they ’re generating .
” As with the original site , people are free to look at and describe as many galaxies as they like – even five minutes of work provides a valuable contribution , according to the site ’s founders .
Galaxy Zoo 2 is intended to be even more fun as galaxies are pitted against each other in “ Galaxy Wars ” ( over such questions as “ which one is more spiral shaped ? ” ) , and users can compete against their friends to describe more objects as well as record their best finds .
Proof that unusual discoveries can be made is the catalogue of merging galaxies provided by users – more than 3000 of these rare cosmic pile - ups have been caught in the act by Galaxy Zoo users .
The team has already used the IRAM radio telescope in Spain ’s Sierra Nevada to follow up the most exciting mergers , and are asking for more examples to study .
“ In this International Year of Astronomy , it ’s great to have so many people looking at these beautiful images of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , ” said Bob Nichol of the University of Portsmouth , spokesperson of the SDSS - III project and member of the original Galaxy Zoo team .
“ No single professional astronomer has ever looked at all these images and sometimes astronomers miss the wonder of what they are .
I think the public gets this better than us .
” The Galaxy Zoo team is led by scientists from the University of Oxford , the University of Nottingham , the University of Portsmouth , Yale University , Johns Hopkins University , UC Berkley , and Fingerprint Digital Media of Belfast .
The development of Galaxy Zoo 2 was funded by The Leverhulme Trust , and a grant from Microsoft .
The digital images used in Galaxy Zoo were taken using the robotic Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope in New Mexico .

But if that fate befalls me , I anticipate finding my cable provider roasting alongside me .
In fact , cable television service in general has a reek of Hades about it .
Consumers typically have only one cable company available to them , and that company often chooses its channel lineup based on business relationships instead of on what people want to watch .
The customer service would shame Stalin .
Plus , cable costs too much — and the price keeps rising .
So why not replace it with all the free video available on the Internet ?
After all , you can get new and old TV shows on the networks '
Web sites , movies on Netflix ( all - you - can - eat for subscribers ) , and everything else on YouTube .
The problem is that television is really best watched on , well , a television .
The canonical viewing position — horizontal — requires balancing a laptop on your belly .
Enter Boxee , an open source application that , according to CEO Avner Ronen , strives to be the Firefox of video .
The global browser funnels all that Internet content , as well as media you 've downloaded , to your television .
Though Boxee is still in its early stages , a couple hundred thousand head - firsters have already checked it out , most of them using the otherwise superfluous Apple TV box as the conduit for getting online content to the boob tube .
I wanted in .
Installing Boxee on a computer is straightforward .
But running it on an Apple TV requires a bit of perseverance .
You have to copy the software to a flash drive that can boot up the Apple TV .
After a restart , Boxee pops up in the menu choices .
But when I selected it , my screen briefly displayed an Apple logo sliced in half , then went black .
The fallback method uses a laptop to access the Apple TV 's operating system and paste in code to reprogram the device .
To my astonishment , this worked .
Boxee is alpha software , so it 's hard to assess its features fairly .
The social networking that 's built in , which lets you see what your friends have watched , looks promising .
And the clean interface lets you surf through not only your own media collection but also online video sources like CBS.com , CNN.com , and Hulu , as well as audio providers like NPR.org .
What I really wanted to do was watch 30 Rock , so I selected Hulu from the Internet Videos menu , then chose the most recent episode .
Too bad you can't do this anymore .
Hulu has since asked Boxee to remove its service , much to the chagrin of couch potatoes everywhere .
Thankfully , other video purveyors are n't so short - sighted .
If services like Boxee are to live up to our hi-def dreams , they wo n't just need content providers to let them grow .
They will also require broadband access with more speed and reliability than most people have now .
Unfortunately , most of us connect to the Internet via cable or telecom companies that are also in the business of selling video .
It 's hard to imagine these companies cutting themselves off by making it easy to get broadband without television .
" At the end , I do n't think cable is going away , " admits Boxee 's Ronen , even as his service shows how easy it would be for cable to disappear .
It makes sense to use the Internet as another way to distribute ad - supported content for free while letting users subscribe to premium services separately .
Platforms like Boxee would allow anyone to distribute a TV channel , without begging or buying permission from the cable , telecom , and satellite czars .
Sounds good to me .
And if the monopolists use their power to stave off progress , you know where I 'll see them .

Why Cable Will Survive the Meltdown
Pharmaceuticals Discovered In Fish In Five Major US Cities ; ' Highest Concentrations In Fish Livers '
WACO , Texas -- Baylor University researchers , working with the United States Environmental Protection Agency , have detected low - level residues of several human medications and personal care products in fish collected from effluent - dominated rivers , including the residue of one pharmaceutical in wild fish that has not been previously reported .
These findings are part of the first EPA pilot study designed to look for the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ( PPCPs ) in fish from our nation ’s waterways .
“ While this study found the residue of several pharmaceuticals and personal care products in fish tissue , it also demonstrated for the first time that fish from several different locations across the country are exposed to multiple PPCPs in effluent - dominated waterways , ” said Dr. Bryan Brooks , associate professor of environmental sciences at Baylor and an aquatic toxicology expert on PPCPs who is a Baylor co-lead investigator on the study .
The study ’s methodology is presented today at the spring 2009 National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Salt Lake City by Dr. Kevin Chambliss , a Baylor co-lead investigator with Brooks .
The study ’s results also are scheduled to be published on - line in a special edition of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry .
The special issue will be dedicated to PPCPs found in the environment .
The study was funded by a contract from the EPA with Tetra Tech , a leading provider of consulting , engineering and technical services .
The Baylor University team , led by Chambliss and Brooks , was contracted by Tetra Tech to use their innovative PPCP detection methodologies in fish tissue to conduct the pilot study .
Many aquatic systems throughout the United States routinely receive effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants .
Sometimes , the flow of streams and rivers can become dominated by these effluents .
Although there are federal standards for treated wastewater , no guidelines or federal testing standards exist for pharmaceuticals or most personal care products in wastewater because their effects in surface waters are not well understood .
EPA undertook this pilot study as a part of an overall strategy to better understand the occurrence of PPCPs in surface waters , sediment and fish tissue .
The study involved collection of fish from five effluent - dominated rivers in various parts of the country .
The sampling locations included discharge areas of wastewater treatment plants in Chicago , Dallas , Orlando , Fla. , Phoenix , and West Chester , Pa. , near Philadelphia .
The Gila River Wilderness Area in New Mexico provided a suitable reference site for the study , because it is isolated from human sources of pollution .
The Baylor researchers tested fish fillets and liver tissue for 24 different human medications .
The researchers also tested fish fillets for 12 chemicals found in personal care products .
The study results revealed that :
The residue of seven pharmaceuticals and two personal care products was present in fish at all five effluent - dominated river sites .
In many cases , multiple compounds were found in the same fish .
For the first time , gemfibrozil , used to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride levels , was found in wild fish livers .
No pharmaceutical compounds or personal care product chemicals were detected in any fish collected at the reference stream in New Mexico .
Diphenhydramine , an over - the - counter antihistamine also commonly used as a sedative in non-prescription sleep aids and motion sickness ; diltiazem , a drug for high blood pressure ; carbamazepine , a treatment for epilepsy and bipolar disorder ; norfluoxetine , the active metabolite of the antidepressant fluoxetine ; and sertraline , an antidepressant , also were detected in this study , confirming results of previous projects by the Baylor researchers .
Galaxolide and tonalide , both fragrances used in soap and other personal care products , were found in fish fillet tissue from all five effluent - dominated river sites .
The concentrations in the fish tissue for these fragrances were the highest of all compounds tested .
“ We found the highest concentrations and frequencies of compounds in the fish livers but considering that the liver is the primary site of metabolism for xenobiotics in fish , as in humans , this result is logical . ” said Chambliss , associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Baylor .
While the impact these compounds have on fish is not yet fully understood , it is documented in the scientific literature that antidepressant accumulation in fish may cause certain behavioral changes , which impact aggression , mating and other behaviors necessary for fish survival .
Based on the pilot study findings , EPA is expanding its investigation of PPCPs in fish under its National Rivers and Streams Assessment .
Fish collection began in 2008 and is continuing in 2009 .

For sheer gloating pleasure , you ca n’t beat the lunkheads on Free Republic trying to deal with the news that Palin ’s daughter not only is n’t going to marry Levi , but is breaking up with him .
It ’s what they call the whole spectrum of human emotion , or primate anyway .
They ’re so stunned they wander for a while through digressions like whether the sperm donor in question was named after a pair of pants or not .
One loyalist with the wonderful moniker “ Solid Wood ” insists it ca n’t be true , must be a liberal media lie , until someone sends the two - word death sentence : “ Fox confirms . ”
Then he settles for calling everyone who mentions the story a leftwing troll .
The problem with shutting down the story , a Freeper ’s natural response to embarrassing news , is that it conflicts with the social conservative ’s Prime Directive : butting in to everybody else ’s business as often and as loudly as possible .
So when one blushing Palin fan tries to dismiss the story as “ No biggie , ” another chastens him : “ Yeah it is ; the kid needs a father . ”
Others try blaming the media and the dems ( known as “ demonrats ” on FR ) for the pregnancy , as if Nancy Pelosi and Katie Couric were leaning over the back seat of Levi ’s F150 chanting to Bristol , “ Do it !
Do it ! ”
A poster calling himself Popdonnelly recalls with a sigh the happier days of his youth : “ Back in the day , they ’d get out the shotgun . ”
The shock of the story caused it to be posted a half dozen times on FR , and one of the more remarkable threads is the one responding to a suggestion by rightwing columnist Cal Thomas that the Palin family shut up for a while .
You do n’t say that about Sarah on FR :
“ Deannadurbin ” holds out for stigmatizing the kid the old - school way , because God has left clear instructions that bastards should be reminded of their status early and often :
“ It does reflect badly on Sarah ’s conservatism that her own daughter does n’t seem to realize the biblically right thing to do is to get married .
There has been ample time to do what God would have Bristol do .
Why the delay until after the baby is born ?
Right now the baby is illegitimate and that used to be a stigma and rightly so . ”
But the Biblical sharia solution is so cruel and stupid that all sorts of other posters , almost all women , react violently to “ deannadurbin ’s ” posts .
“ Tax - Chick ” points out the obvious : “ In the long run , her NOT marrying a loser might turn out to be the best thing for the baby , ” then goes on to paste a happy ending on the story : “ In a couple of years , Bristol might meet a nice man with an education and a future . ”
Another freeperette responds more aggressively : “ How nasty to brand an infant with a stigma when the infant had no say in the matter .
That was disgusting . ”
Deannadurbin stands her ground : “ Then you probably think past generations of your ancestors were “ disgusting ” too because they considered out of wedlock births illegitimate and shameful .
Such families were ASHAMED because they could n’t control their trampy daughters who opened their legs for men not their husband . ”
What upsets the relatively sane Freepers is that Deanna unquestionably has the ideology on her side : “ You ca n’t have it both ways , calling yourself a conservative and then say “ anything goes ” regarding social mores and principles . ”
This is too much for “ Ace of Spades ” : “ If my ancestors stigmatized children for conditions they had no control over , such as the marriage status of their mother , then they were disgusting , as a matter of fact .
And so are you . ”
Deanna ’s antagonist , “ phikapmom , ” simply breaks off the discussion : “ Do n’t ever reply to me again on this website and I will do the same to you . ”
Deanna wants the last word , implicitly conceding that history may not be on her side : “ If you are the future of conservatism then it is dead , woman . ”
Deanna ’s argument is based upon a rock , and is not susceptible to appeals to real people living on this planet .
She ignores the question of the pain her precious stigma would inflict — is entirely designed to inflict — on the baby in favor of Spike Lee ’s catchphrase , as filtered through the Southern Baptists : “ Do the RIGHT THING and the GODLY THING and give your baby his father ’s name . ”
The funny , creepy thing here is that Deanna really does have the Bible on her side , and ca n’t help saying so , even when the opposable - thumbs faction on FR would rather tiptoe past the matter .
She screams , “ I guess you call God Himself “ disgusting ” , for God is clear in His word that babies are conceived in SIN .
How dare
God be so mean to babies as to call them sinners ?
When you croak and face judgement will you have the temerity to tell God He was mistaken ?
‘ Behold , I was shapen in iniquity ; and in sin did my mother conceive me .’ – Psalm 51:5 ”
Yup , that ’s the real old - school sound of true scripture , all right .
There ’s no mistaking that combination of wordy pomposity with vicious misogyny .
Since very , very few Freepers are willing to say that God is , indeed , a disgusting old lunatic , the debate dribbles away into pure comedy .
One bright spark tries to disarm Deanna by reminding her that Jefferson was an adulterer : “ I guess you hate Jefferson too . ”
But she is not to be moved from that aged rock , replying with a response that would have Charles Portis scrambling for his notebook : “ I like Thomas Jefferson fine enough , but God ’s word is more important . ”
The funniest moment comes when one of FR ’s many pseudointellectuals tries to heal the rift by offering a compromise : stigmatize the mother , but not the baby .
“ People need to distinguish between stigmatising the illegitimate child , which I have n’t seen anyone advocating here , and stigmatising the parents . ”
That ’s thinking outside the box !
“ Kid , your mother is a filthy whore … but of course that ’s no reflection on you . ”

I own Tata Nano Twist , 2014 Model .
This car is less driven around 10700 kms till now .
I had a other car so not much used .
Yearly service was maintained as per the schedule .
Car is good to drive in cities and i didn"t feel that bad as people comment on this car .
Its a two cylinder engine , little noisier than other cars but its manageable .
At this price point the car has some good features and it has excellent space compared to my other car ( felt not to mentioned as i can purchase 2 Nano ;s from its price ) .
Nowadays it become my daily drive and i am really enjoying it .
Cheap to maintain and its strong than it looks .
little more feature like front disk breaks would be suggestible if they are again introducing it .
Euro policy makers continue to debate should we or should nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t we slash below 1 % .
Weber believes anything below 1 % will paralyze money markets .
It seems the ECB is the only one suffering from paralysis !
With UBS taking it on the chin and to - date - slashing 20 % of its global workforce , the markets will have to entertain both JP Morgan and Citi earnings this week .
What surprises lay in store for us ?
Creative accounting techniques are not new !
However , restoring consumer confidence in the US financial system would require a transparent accounting and stress test system .
Do you honestly believe we will get that ?
President Obama continues to temper optimism with realism .
He believes the US economy is in recovery mode , the consumer can expect to experience further setbacks along the way .
What is he preparing us for now ?
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 13 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
US March Retail sales were weak across the board yesterday .
The index registered a - 1.1 % m / m decline last month after the modest +0.3 % upswing printed in Feb .
( revised up from - 0.1 % m / m ) .
Analysts note that the headline number failed to post the 3rd - straight increase which would have reduced the risks of a grim decline in 1st Q GDP .
Core - Retail sales ( ex- autos ) fell by - 0.9 % m/m.
Digging deeper , we had hoped that sales at gas stations were to provide uplift , as fuel prices have risen , however they fell by - 1.6 % , m / m , from +3.1 % increase in Feb .
Most of the other sub - categories were also weak .
Clothing and electronics sales fell for the 1st- time in 3 - months .
On the flip side consumer confidence indicators edged a tad higher as expectations for the futures have brightened .
The current conditions index remains exceptionally weak , with rising unemployment and tight credit conditions .
This report highlights the strong evidence that the US consumer ’s perceived resilience at the start of the year is disappearing .
In concluding , it was a bad report and much worse than expected across - the - board .
Are deflation issues on the table again ?
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US PPI is signaling a weaker than expected pricing power amongst US businesses .
Headline prices fell - 1.2 % , m / m , on a - 13.1 % m/ m drop in gas prices , an overall - 5.5 % drop in energy prices , and a - 0.7 % decline in food prices .
Y/Y the headline are - 3.5 % lower , this is the 4th - month of negative readings and a further acceleration of the negative trend .
Core - prices were unchanged , on a year - ago levels , prices are +3.8 % higher which continues the weakening trend from a + 4.7 % y/y peak in Oct .
Digging deeper , everything fell except for prescription drug prices and tobacco prices .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that there is a solid decoupling between headline and core inflation figures .
The latter remains stubbornly high , despite the deep recessionary economic outlook .
On the other hand , headline inflation continues to fall at very rapid pace , reflecting positive base effects , we hope !
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.36 % , GBP - 0.29 % , CHF - 0.52 % and lower against JPY + 0.14 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.29 % and AUD - 0.67 % .
The loonie managed to print its highest levels in nearly 3 - months yesterday , amid signs the global slowdown may be moderating .
Also , option - related activity and the ability of the TSX to resist the downward pull of US equities contributed to the CAD spike .
With BernankeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s comments and GS profits , there seems to be cautious optimism that maybe the worst is over .
Technical analysts believe that if the currency could penetrate the 1.2050 support level , it opens it up for a 1.1875 print .
This may be a tad optimistic ahead of next weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s monetary policy meeting ( 21st April ) and the expected quantitative announcement by BOC governor Carney on April 23rd .
It is anticipated that the governor will want to Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœflood banks with cash to halt the hoarding of capital and expand lending Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
A quantitative easing method has seen currencies depreciate significantly when their governments started the program ( BOE , BOJ , and Fed ) .
For now look to buy USD on pull backs .
The AUD continued its slide from its 6 - month highÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s for a 2nd - day on the back of weaker US fundamentals that has deflated somewhat the past 5 - weeks of euphoria .
Couple this with both Japanese and US equities declining and convincing investors to reduce their demand for higher yielding assets .
For now , look for investors to sell on upticks ( 0.7202 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 50.29 up +88 c ) .
The worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s biggest energy consumer weaker than expected retail sales put crude prices under pressure yesterday .
Fundamental data and not supply issues ( that comes this morning ) is contributing to the black stuffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s less than stellar performance .
Crude started the week under pressure after an IEA report for this year shows that total global demand may fall to its lowest level in 5 - years .
They expect consumption to fall - 2.4 m barrels a day to +83.4 m , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a decline of +2.8 % as worldwide GDP falls by - 1.4 % .
The EIA report from last week showed a smaller inventory gain than the earlier API industry report .
Inventories increased + 1.65 m barrels to +361.1 m , while the API report said that stockpiles jumped +6.94 m barrels ( the highest in 20 - years ) .
The bullish report provided temporary market support but with inventories approaching record levels once again has investors thinking twice about investing .
It was the 24th gain in 28 - weeks .
Until we see inventories decline substantially and sustainable demand destruction , there will not be a sustainable price gain .
Again this morning we expect the EIA to report higher inventory levels for the week .
Industrial reports continue to show that rising oil inventories and falling demand signal that the worst of the recession may not be over .
Bernanke opens his mouth and gold falls .
He said that there are signs that the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsharp declineÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in the economy may be easing , and thus eroding the appeal of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative asset ( $ 891 ) , how long can this optimism hold ?
The Nikkei closed 8,742 down - 99 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,554 down - 2 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,016 up + 27 .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 6 bp yesterday ( 2.79 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries extended their gains yesterday as the Fed purchased $ 7.3 b off - the - run US issues maturing between 4 and 7 - years as part of its program to keep borrowing costs low ( to date just under $ 52 b buy - backs in 3 - weeks ) .
Weaker fundamental data combined with continuous buy - backs will in effect keep treasuries better bid on pull backs at the moment .
Expect traders to make the government pay up for off - the - run issues tomorrow .

' She ran around like a maniac '
By Nicola Fell
BBC News correspondent
Doña Porcela uses her own potions as a treatment Rain is pelting down on Doña Porcela 's treatment room in Puerto Cabezas , the main town on Nicaragua 's Northern Caribbean coast .
The room is barren except for a few plastic chairs , a wooden table and some old plastic bottles balanced precariously on timber beams .
Doña Porcela is a respected traditional healer here and the bottles are filled with her secret medicinal potions .
Her patient today is a teenage girl asleep on a piece of cardboard , serving as a mattress on the dirt floor .
" Grisi Siknis turns people into witches and they go crazy , " she said .
Last year there were 65 cases of Grisi Siknis , which translates from the local Miskito language as ' crazy sickness ' .
Exorcism
It behaves like a virus , sending teenager after teenager into a frenzied state followed by long periods of coma- like unconsciousness .
Lola Emberto's children had attacks
While Western doctors are at a loss as to how to treat this mysterious illness , Doña Porcela says she can cure people with her concoction .
" It can be drunk or bathed in , " she said .
" Within three or four days , they are normal again . "
Using her herbs and candles , she performs a cleansing ceremony on sufferers and , often , on their houses too - akin to an exorcism .
She travels anywhere anxious parents ask her to come , such as Lola Emberto 's home , set among palms trees and red earth in Barrio Pobre , a poor suburb of Puerto Cabezas .
" For four months , my children were affected , " said Mrs Emberto .
" I could n't sleep or eat .
My daughter was just running around like a maniac .
She tore off all her clothes .
" One time , she fell into the well while suffering an attack .
" Other times , she 'd run into the bush or into the river and people would try to catch her when they could . "
Both her 18 - year - old son and her 13 - year - old daughter were affected .
Black magic Mrs Emberto , like many Miskito people , believes in black magic and that Doña Porcela lifted a curse to cure her children .
Lola lives in the poor suburb of Barrio Pobre
The first recorded cases of this mass hysteria date back to the 1850s .
Until recently , it only affected Miskito people but 16 - year - old Anadina Smith is of Spanish descent .
" One day at school , I felt giddy , and found it difficult to breathe , " she said .
" Then , I saw something coming towards me - a kind of black man or a dragon that entered me and possessed me . "
Three other girls were affected the same day at Anadina 's school , where Reverend Harold Dixon is headmaster .
He has witnessed many attacks of Grisi Siknis .
" They get giddy and they faint and fall to the ground , " he said .
" Then , they start hollering and they hit their heads on the wall or desk .
They have an extra strength .
" You have to have five or six people to hold down one girl . "
Research
On the outskirts of Puerto Cabezas , at Uraccan University , Professor Pablo McDavis has been researching Grisi Siknis for the last few years , in the Indigenous Diseases Department .
" We have taken samples of blood from patients while suffering an attack and , in a lab , we can't detect anything , " explains a puzzled McDavis .
" Drugs or injections tend to only increase a patient 's aggressiveness .
Clinically we can't detect anything .
" It is like an outbreak .
If an attack is not contained quickly , it can spread throughout an entire community . "
So far this year there have been 46 cases of Grisi Siknis , and , as it continues to confound Western medical classification , business for Doña Porcela remains brisk .

We respond :
" Custom and usage since time immemorial " is generally what is behind the definition of common law .
There is no singular source of the common law as one would expect with statutes made by a legislature .
Having said that , consider also that law follows physical power .
Let 's pretend that you reset your brain almost to zero -- you have no knowledge but your natural knowledge of good and evil , your natural intelligence , and a language with which to communicate with others .
You are in your sovereign capacity , accountable to no higher authority , but acknowledging the sovereignty of others and that you may not diminish the sovereignty of others .
You are at peace .
Along comes another being like you who causes you pain for which you want fair compensation .
At this point you have a choice : you can do immediate battle , or you can round up other like beings ( we suggest 12 of them , a jury ) and ask them to join you in battle .
If you can get all of them to agree that you have a just cause , then it would be you and them against the accused ( you +them=13 against 1 ) .
They , not having been present at the time of the crime , being fair minded , demand that you justify your request ( provide the rule and prove your facts ) .
You make your presentation , and the accused makes his counter - presentation .
After the presentations ( the trial ) the jury retires to cogitate over two questions .
The first question :
Is the rule valid ?
If , in the opinion of the jury your rule is not valid ( jury nullification ) , then they will refuse to join you ( a not - guilty verdict ) .
But , if they , in their independent sovereign judgment agree with your rule , then they move on to the second question .
The second question : Did the actions of the accused violate the rule .
If , in the opinion of the jury he did not , then they will refuse to join you ( a not - guilty verdict ) .
But , if they , in their independent sovereign judgment agree that your rule was violated , then they will join you ( a guilty verdict ) .
If the jury 's decision is split , the issue remains unresolved , and a new trial may be needed with a new jury .
If the jury 's decision is unanimous , whether " guilty " or " not guilty " , the question is decided , and you now have 13 vs. 1 . Depending on the verdict , the " 1 " would be either the accuser or the accused .
Whoever lost the case would be foolish to do physical battle against 13 opponents .
Thus , through this process , we bring peace to the realm .
An accuser always has jurisdiction to accuse .
The accused always has jurisdiction to defend .
And , either one may grant jurisdiction to a jury to intervene .
That is the bare essence of the common law .
Anything more than that is an attempt to " improve " the process .
However , so - called " improvements " often are imperfect .
Although there is no singular authoritative source of common law , much has been written over the past thousand years .
Many have come to respect the thoughts and opinions of those who preceded them .
Having respect does not mean to quit thinking .
Education is the process of learning about prior conclusions .
Those conclusions are a valuable guide to use to arrive at our own conclusions .
In true common law , there are no obligatory rules or precedents .
A common law court ( a court of record ) has unlimited jurisdiction and is independent of government .
All external factors are , at best , advisory , not obligatory .
The founding fathers understood all that .
At his 1801 inaugural Thomas Jefferson said , " Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself .
Can he , then , be trusted with the government of others ?
Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him ?
Let history answer this question . "
And he wrote , " I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves : and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them , but to inform their discretion . "
[ Letter , September 28 , 1820 . ]
The self - correcting temporary imperfections of common law were preferrable to the entrenched imperfections of legislated written laws .
That is why they chose the common law as the law superior to statutes and all other forms law .
They expressed that choice through the Constitution 's 7th Amendment which essentially says that no court may second - guess ( review ) a decision of a jury .
Also , notice that , although the common law is outside of the Constitution , the Constitution authorizes the USA to support the common law with its judicial power .
See Article III , Section 2 - 1 .
A statutory or constitutional court ( whether it be an appellate or supreme court ) may not second guess the judgment of a common law court of record .
The Supreme Court of the USA acknowledges the common law as supreme : “ The judgment of a court of record whose jurisdiction is final , is as conclusive on all the world as the judgment of this court would be .
It is as conclusive on this court as it is on other courts .
It puts an end to inquiry concerning the fact , by deciding it . "

Be sure to read our latest SSD article : The SSD Relapse for an updated look at the SSD market .
The Prelude
I spent about three weeks working on my review of Intel ’s X25 - M SSD .
Most of that was research and writing and re-writing to not only review the product but also to talk about the rest of the SSDs in the marketplace and their deficiencies .
Truth be told , I spent more time working on SSDs that were n’t the X25 - M than the Intel drive itself .
The Intel drive just worked as it should , the rest of them did n’t .
If you read the article , you know I was pretty harsh on some of the SSDs out at the time and if you ’ve ever used any of those SSDs , you know why .
Needless to say , there was some definite fallout from that review .
I ’m used to negative manufacturer response after a GPU review , but I ’m always a bit surprised when it happens in any other segment .
I took a day or two off after that review went live , I think it was a day .
Afterwards , I immediately started working on a follow - up .
There was a strange phenomenon a few people noticed , something I unfortunately picked up on after the review went live ; if you filled the X25 - M up and re-benchmarked it , it got slower .
And I had no idea why .
A few weeks later , I had it figured out .
But then Nehalem was right around the corner .
I ’d tackle it after that .
But then a new batch of SSDs from OCZ and other vendors were almost ready .
I told myself I ’d do them all at the same time .
Then CES happened .
The More Things Change , The More They Stay The Same
If you look at the SSD market today , you ’d assume that it ’s very different from what it was just six months ago when the X25 - M launched .
People are worried that the Intel drive has issues with degrading performance over time .
Some vendors are now shipping “ revised ” JMicron drives with multiple controllers , supposedly fixing all of the problems I talked about last year .
I hate to break it to you guys .
As different as the world may seem today , it ’s all very much the same .
The Intel drive is still the best of the best .
Yes , it , and other SSDs do get slower over time and later in this article I ’ll explain why it happens and why it ’s not as big of a deal as you ’d think .
The issues I complained about with the JMicron drives from last year are still alive and well today ; they ’re just somewhat occluded .
Delay after delay kept me from writing this article , but I believe it ’s for the best .
What went in to what you ’re about to read is nearly six months of research , testing and plain old work with SSDs .
The timing could n’t be more perfect .
We ’re about to see a new wave of SSDs hit the market and it ’s time to separate the fact from the fiction , the benchmarks from reality and the men from the boys .
The last time I wrote an article about SSDs I ruffled quite a few feathers .
That ’s never my aim , but we ’ll see what comes of this one .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A new class of cheaper , smaller netbook computers might upset the IT establishment this year and potentially usher in new players in a hotly competitive market .

The biggest change in the new pint - sized laptops is what they wo n't have : Intel Corp INTC.O chips or a Microsoft Corp MSFT .
O Windows PC operating system , which dominate netbooks today .
The new netbooks , which use less energy , will run on the low - power ARM processor platform now used in nine out of 10 mobile phones , rather than Intel 's x86 - based Atom chip .
The U.K. - based ARM Holdings Plc ARM.L licenses the chip technology .
As many as 10 ARM - based netbook models could hit the market this year , according to ARM , which declined to identify specific manufacturers .
Major PC players and Asian contract manufacturers alike are interested , analysts say .
Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle called the new netbooks “ incredibly disruptive , ” saying : “ This is a market that puts the existing PC structure at risk . ”
While analysts say it ’s not yet clear if consumers will embrace the ARM devices , interest has been galvanized by the emphasis on power efficiency , prices as low as $ 200 and the promise of anywhere , anytime computing on PCs small enough to slip into a purse .
What ’s sacrificed is users ’ familiarity with PC - based interfaces and systems and sheer processing power .
The current $ 300 - $ 400 Atom netbooks are already mainly good for just surfing the Web and less graphics - intensive applications .
“ We ’re right in the middle of a huge shift in the market , ” said Eric Openshaw , U.S. technology leader for Deloitte LLP .
Openshaw said non-Windows netbooks will need to demonstrate a simple and accessible user interface at the application level if they hope to gain traction with consumers .
Windows XP can't run on ARM , so the new netbooks will have Linux - based software , including , analysts and industry executives say , Google Inc GOOG .
O Android , which has been used so far in smartphones .
But do n’t count Microsoft out just yet .
Although the software giant declined to comment when asked if it is planning an operating system for the new netbooks , analysts say it could easily enter the market if it chose .
Intel pointed out there are as yet no ARM netbooks on the market and that its
Atom chip has a full year ’s head start .
“ We ’re not slowing down , we fully expect competition and we continue to believe that Atom is the right choice for our customers and consumer , ” said spokesman Bill Calder .
NEXT WAVE
The still - evolving netbook market is growing thick with players from all over the tech sector .
Wireless carriers such as AT&T Inc T.N are helping lead the charge , while graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.O , wireless chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Freescale Semiconductor Inc have all designed ARM - based processors that can be used in netbooks .
The netbook phenomenon took off in 2008 to the tune of 11.7 million units , led by companies such as Acer Inc 2353 .
TW and Asustek Computer Inc 2357 .
TW that were quick into the market .
Nearly every PC vendor offers an Intel Atom - based netbook , including Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N and Dell Inc DELL.O .
Analysts forecast 20 million to 30 million netbooks will be sold this year , making up an ever larger part of overall laptop sales and marking one of few tech sectors still experiencing robust revenue growth .
“ It ’s definitely going to be a different sort of device than today ’s netbooks , ” said Phil Solis of ABI Research , who expects ARM netbooks to make up 15 percent of the overall netbook market in 2010 .
IDC analyst Richard Shim said the first wave of netbooks brought a PC feel to bridge the gap between laptops and smartphones .
ARM netbooks , he said , represent a push from the opposite direction .
“ The smartphones are now moving up , ” he added .
It is widely expected that the Computex trade fair in Taiwan in June will see a number of announcements about ARM - based netbooks .
With less expensive ARM chips and free or very cheap operating systems , the netbooks could sell for even less than $ 200 if , as expected , wireless carriers subsidize purchases bundled with a data plan .
Tech blogs were recently buzzing about a prototype netbook built by Taiwan contract laptop maker Wistron Corp 3231 .
TW shown at the recent CTIA show in Las Vegas .
The device was based on Qualcomm 's ARM - based Snapdragon platform .
ARM shares have risen about 35 percent in the year to date , compared with an about 14 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx European Technology Index .

The newest issue of Nintendo Power features details and first screens of Silent Hill : Shattered Memories , the Wii-bound " re-imagining " of the original Silent Hill for the PlayStation .
Konami says it 's far more than a remake .

According to details culled from the new issue , via GoNintendo , producer Tomm Hulett says that the Wii game wo n't necessarily play out story - wise like the original , but will be " twisted to betray your expectations , " with Shattered Memories modifying the game 's structure based on your decisions .
" The characters play different roles , things do n't necessarily happen in the same order , and the story is taken in lots of new directions , " Hulett says , noting that you 'll still play as protagonist Harry Mason and will run into familiar characters from the first Silent Hill .

Another major change , according to the report , is that there will be no permanently locked doors .
That means no obsessive checking of every single door knob in the game , apparently .
As you might expect , the Wii version of Silent Hill takes advantage of the console 's motion controller in unspecified ways .
Guess that confirms that rumor of the game 's development on the Wii .
Now what about that PSP remake ?

As a former banker , Norm Andreen knew his certificates of deposit were safe when regulators shut down Silver Falls Bank .
But he was disappointed to learn this week that Citizens Bank of Corvallis , which took over his deposits , was slashing interest rates from as much as 4 percent to 1 percent or less .
" I 've gone through three different mergers when I was in banking , " said Andreen , a former branch manager and internal auditor living near Oregon City .
" We never did anything like that . "
Normally , banks do n't change the terms of CDs midstream .
But when banks fail -- as 22 have nationwide this year -- the institutions that take over are free to reset interest rates , regulators say , because they 're essentially pulling the assets out of bankruptcy .
Depositors might experience that risk more often as the country endures a wave of bank failures that has yet to crest , regulators say .
Wilmington , N.C. - based Cape Fear Bank was closed Friday , the 49th U.S. bank failure in two years .
Oregon bank regulators declared Silverton - based Silver Falls insolvent in February and chose the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver , which then transferred deposits to Citizens .
" In receiverships or bankruptcies , all prior contracts are null and void unless they 're reaffirmed , " said Richard Renken , program manager for banks and trust at the Oregon Division of Finance and Corporate Securities .
However , Citizens was required to notify Silver Falls customers of any rate change and give them time to cancel their CD agreements without penalty , Renken said .
The bank did so .
Neither Spokane - based Washington Trust Bank nor Portland - based Umpqua Holdings Corp. changed rates when they acquired Beaverton - based Pinnacle Bank of Oregon and Bank of Clark County in Vancouver , respectively .
" Their boats have been rocked enough , " Umpqua spokeswoman Lani Hayward said of the bank 's newly acquired Clark County customers .
Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. also are honoring rates paid by the banks they took over from Wachovia Corp. and Washington Mutual Inc. , respectively , until the CDs mature .
Citizens Bank president and CEO William Humphreys Sr. said he 's cutting rates partly to be fair to existing customers and partly because he does n't want Silver Falls depositors who chased high interest rates .
Silver Falls opened seven years ago with a fast - growth strategy , luring deposits from all over the state with higher rates than their competitors offered , Humphreys said .
That required the bank to make higher - risk construction and development loans .
Those loans went bad during the downturn , which ultimately led to the bank 's failure .
Citizens has a much more conservative strategy , he said .
" We do n't want to do business with people in Seaside , " Humphreys said .
" We 'll take deposits from the community and make loans to the community .
We 're going to be there to stay .
The previous bank was n't a lasting institution . "
Andreen said he deposited money with Silver Falls four years ago when it opened its Oregon City branch .
He held three CDs totaling $ 150,000 .
His mother deposited two CDs totaling $ 250,000 .
Most recently , the interest rates on his one - year deposits were 3 to 4 percent .
Now , Citizens Bank is offering him rates of 1 to 1.25 percent , he said .
The average rate for a one - year CD nationwide was 2.35 percent Friday , according to www.bankrate.com.
Citizens offered customers with less of a banking relationship with Silver Falls even lower rates -- .65 percent , in some cases , Humphreys said .
" I do n't see how you build a loyal customer base if you 're going to break contracts with them , " said Andreen , who now owns Subtle Surfaces , an interior - wall - making business .
" My wife and I are going to be fine .
I 'll find someplace else to put those funds .
What concerns me is what they 've done probably to some older people on fixed incomes who were counting on those funds based on contracts entered into a year ago . "
Humphreys acknowledged that concern , but said higher - interest CDs also carry higher risks .
" This is the risk of doing business with an unsafe and unsound bank , " he said .
" The customer is the loser . "

The history of this episode is especially revealing about the way the public has become utterly disenfranchised in a world where bureaucrats arrogantly assume they know what is good for the rest us .
Although many people believe they already have fluoride in their tap water , only around six million actually do .
Most of them live in the West Midlands and the North East , where artificial fluoride was first added about 40 years ago and around half a million are in areas where fluoride occurs naturally in the water .
Successive governments have always wanted to increase coverage , believing it would be good for dental health .
But the water companies did not want to fluoridate the supply , fearing they would be sued .
They also did not consider public health to be their responsibility .

Time and time again I have found that in both Christian and secular worlds , those of us who are involved in the creation movement are characterized as “ young - earthers . ”
The supposed battle line is thus drawn between the “ old- earthers ” ( this group consists of anti-God evolutionists as well as many “ conservative ” Christians ) who appeal to what they call “ science , ” versus the “ young - earthers , ” who are said to be ignoring the overwhelming supposed “ scientific ” evidence for an old earth .
I want to make it very clear that we do n’t want to be known primarily as “ young - earth creationists . ”
AiG ’s main thrust is not “ young - earth ” creationism as such ; our emphasis is biblical authority .
Believing in a relatively “ young earth ” ( i.e. , only a few thousands of years old , which we accept ) is a consequence of accepting the authority of the Word of God as an infallible revelation from our omniscient Creator .
Recently , one of our associates sat down with a highly respected world - class Hebrew scholar and asked him this question : “ If you started with the Bible alone , without considering any outside influences whatsoever , could you ever come up with millions or billions of years of history for the earth and universe ? ”
The answer from this scholar ?
“ Absolutely not ! ”
Let ’s be honest .
Take out your Bible and look through it .
You ca n’t find any hint at all of millions or billions of years .
TAKE OUT YOUR BIBLE AND LOOK THROUGH IT .
YOU CAN’T FIND ANY HINT AT ALL of MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF YEARS .
For those of you who have kept up with our lectures and our articles in Answers magazine , you will have heard or read quotes from many well - known and respected Christian leaders admitting that if you take Genesis in a straightforward way , it clearly teaches six ordinary days of creation .
However , the reason they do n’t believe God created in six literal days is because they are convinced from so - called “ science ” that the world is billions of years old .
In other words , they are admitting that they start outside the Bible to ( re ) interpret the words of Scripture .
When someone says to me , “ Oh , so you ’re one of those fundamentalist , young - earth creationists , ” I reply , “ Actually , I ’m a revelationist , no - death - before - Adam redemptionist ! ” ( which means I ’m a young - earth creationist ! ) .
Here ’s what I mean by this : I understand that the Bible is a revelation from our infinite Creator , and it is self - authenticating and self - attesting .
I must interpret Scripture with Scripture , not impose ideas from the outside !
When I take the plain words of the Bible , it is obvious there was no death , bloodshed , disease , or suffering of humans or animals before sin .
God instituted death and bloodshed because of sin — this is foundational to the gospel .
Therefore , one cannot allow a fossil record of millions of years of death , bloodshed , disease , and suffering before sin ( which is why the fossil record makes much more sense as the graveyard of the Flood of Noah ’s day ) .
Also , the word for “ day ” in the context of Genesis can only mean an ordinary day for each of the six days of creation [ see Get Answers : Genesis for more information ] .
Thus , as a “ revelationist , ” I let God ’s Word speak to me , with the words having meaning according to the context of the language they were written in .
Once I accept the plain words of Scripture in context , the fact of ordinary days , no death before sin , the Bible ’s genealogies , and so on , all make it clear that I cannot accept millions or billions of years of history .
Therefore , I would conclude there must be something wrong with man ’s ideas about the age of the universe .
And the fact is , every single dating method ( outside of Scripture ) is based on fallible assumptions .
There are literally hundreds of dating tools .
However , whatever dating method one uses , assumptions must be made about the past .
Not one dating method man devises is absolute !
Even though 90 % of all dating methods give dates far younger than evolutionists require , none of these can be used in an absolute sense either .
[ See Get Answers : Radiometric Dating and Get Answers : Young Age Evidence for more information . ]
Question :
Why would any Christian want to take man ’s fallible dating methods and use them to impose an idea on the infallible Word of God ?
Christians who accept billions of years are in essence saying that man ’s word is infallible , but God ’s Word is fallible !
This is the crux of the issue .
When Christians have agreed with the world that they can accept man ’s fallible dating methods to interpret God ’s Word , they have agreed with the world that the Bible ca n’t be trusted .
They have essentially sent out the message that man , by himself , independent of revelation , can determine truth and impose this on God ’s Word .
Once this “ door ” has been opened regarding Genesis , ultimately it can happen with the rest of the Bible .
You see , if Christian leaders have told the next generation that one can accept the world ’s teachings in geology , biology , astronomy , and so on , and use these to ( re ) interpret God ’s Word , then the door has been opened for this to happen in every area , including morality .
Yes , one can be a conservative Christian and preach authoritatively from God ’s Word from Genesis 12 onward .
But once you have told people to accept man ’s dating methods , and thus should not take the first chapters of Genesis as they are written , you have effectively undermined the Bible ’s authority !
This attitude is destroying the church in America .
So , the issue is not “ young earth ” versus “ old earth , ” but this : Can fallible , sinful man be in authority over the Word of God ?
A “ young - earth ” view admittedly receives the scoffing from a majority of the scientists .
But Paul warned us in 1 Corinthians 8:2 , “ And if anyone thinks that he knows anything , he knows nothing yet as he ought to know .
” Compared to what God knows , we know “ next door to nothing ! ”
This is why we should be so careful to let God speak to us through His Word , and not try to impose our ideas on God ’s Word .
It ’s also interesting to note that this verse is found in the same passage where Paul warns that “ knowledge puffs up . ”
Academic pride is found throughout our culture .
Therefore , many Christian leaders would rather believe the world ’s fallible academics than the simple , clear words of the Bible .
At Answers in Genesis , we believe this message needs to be proclaimed to the church as a challenge to return to biblical authority , and thus stand tall in the world for the accuracy of God ’s Word .
Ultimately , this is the only way we are going to reach the world with the truth of the gospel message .
Let ’s put more and more pressure on our Christian leaders to take a long , hard look at how they are approaching the question of the authority of the Bible !
Please help us fulfill our mission statement : to bring about reformation in the church !

Will Misperceiving Evil be the End of Humanity ?
Some of the worst mass - murderers in history -- many of them , in fact -- are idols and folk heroes to millions of people , not for what the mass - murderers actually did , but for what those murderers and their supporters said about and wanted to believe about the mass - murderers .
In many cases , the people idolizing the mass - murderers are strongly in favor of a more compassionate world , yet they are unable to see the truth about the particular tyrants they admire .
This leads millions of otherwise compassionate people to support both tyrants and policies that cause harm , either directly or in the long term .
That is a huge problem for the world ; an even more terrible and dangerous problem than it might first appear .
In the next few decades , mankind will either resolve this problem ( an unlikely but not impossible outcome ) or quite possibly put an end to civilization or even to human life .
And yes : the problem really is that serious .
Most people have heard that power corrupts , but nearly everyone refuses to see the extent to which power destroys and kills .
Spend a moment on the topic :
Cold - blooded murder :
In the recently - ended 2oth Century , governments murdered roughly 262 million human beings ; an average of more than two million , six hundred thousand murders per year -- for the entire century .
Those figures do not include war dead .
As R. J. Rummel has extensively documented , far more people are simply murdered by governments than die in war -- astonishing considering the many millions of war dead .
War : 15 million dead in WWI , 50 to 70 million dead ( including " around 47 million " civilians per the linked article ) in WWII , and many millions more in the dozens of other wars fought by governments in the 2oth Century .
Vast fields of death are not the only evil wrought by the coercive power of government .
Many millions of people suffered in horrifying ways in the previous century ( and millions more already have in this century ) , both directly and indirectly , from government action .
Among other horrors , people were victimized by :
- Injury , maiming , or permanent disabling in war or other ways
- Torture , which is often systematic and widespread
- Rape , which is also often systematic and widespread
- Severe and needless poverty
- Malnutrition or near - starvation
- Unjust imprisonment
- Loss of one or both parents or other loved ones
In addition , reflect on the constant , daily restraint and bullying that defines " coercive government " even in the best of times , from drug prohibition laws to regulatory " protection " ( see also here , not to mention threatening cherry and cranberry growers and other farmers with fines and worse for providing truthful information about the health benefits of their products , including data from publicly - funded research ! ) , from confiscatory levels of taxation to eminent domain ( abusive even when used " as intended " ) , from censorship to " gun control " ( a.k.a. " victim disarmament " ) , from coercive schooling to corporatism and the general siphoning of money and power from the people to corporations , special interest groups , and government itself .
Today 's multi-trillion dollar " bailouts " and " stimulus plans " are only the most obvious and breathtaking recent examples of this legalized theft .
Large , powerful government is the biggest danger to human life on this Earth ; it is also the biggest danger to prosperity and to healthy society generally .
After spending decades researching the topic and writing Death by Government , Power Kills , and other works , professor R. J. Rummel has this to say about the importance of restraining government power :
" In light of all this [ in particular , mass murder and war ] , the peaceful , nonviolent , pursuit and fostering of civil liberties and political rights must be made mankind 's highest humanitarian goal .
Not simply to give the greatest number the greatest happiness , not simply to obey the moral imperative of individual rights , not simply to further the efficiency and productivity of a free society , but also and mainly because freedom preserves peace and life . "
-- War Is n't This Century 's Biggest Killer
Despite decades of work on the topic by Rummel and others , even academics in related fields seem unaware of the serious danger represented by coercive government -- which is to say , these academics , along with almost everyone else , are misperceiving the true nature of government power .
Rummel sums up his view of this state of affairs in typically direct fashion :
" I think the ignorance of the incredible murder by government is a moral , intellectual , and academic scandal .
It is the biggest and most significant black hole in our educational system and literature . " *
In addition to Dr. Rummel 's work , I recommend both The Black Book of Communism ( written by leftists , not Rush Limbaugh ) and Humberto Fontova 's ongoing attempts to educate the public about Che , Castro , and Communist Cuba in general , including his recent Hollywood Movie and Bestselling Book Parrot Castroite Propaganda .
Please note that Rummel 's work includes plenty of information on right - wing dictatorships and other non-leftist nightmares ; I am not simply picking on Communism .
It is Power itself , not a particular flavor of Power , that is the problem .
- - - - -
Imagine that a particular type of organization was both omnipresent around the world and the single worst danger to life , limb , prosperity , and physical and emotional health for all mankind .
Imagine that this violent , Frankenstein - like organization was based on the use of force and thus -- not surprisingly -- had a horrifying track record stretching back thousands of years to the edge of recorded history and beyond .
Then imagine that nearly everyone thought this deadly organization was somehow a " necessary evil " or , even more bizarrely , " beneficial " or " compassionate . "
There is no need to imagine such a thing ; we are actually living in that situation .
What a nightmare !

Confusing Twigs and Branches for Roots
A related problem is the misperception of secondary ( and even further - removed ) phenomena as primary causes .
Prohibition is a perfect example .
During the Prohibition years -- by which I mean alcohol prohibition in the United States , 1920 to 1933 -- violence quickly blossomed and then grew out of control when the alcohol business was handed to criminal gangs .
Instead of honest and peaceful competition between breweries and distillers , we had gang warfare between Al Capone , Dion O'Banion , Bugsy Moran , and other outright psychopaths .
Alcohol - related violence ( that is , violence between those who sold alcohol ) was so common that the machine - gun came to symbolize the era .
Corruption grew to staggering levels because paying off police , judges , and politicians was simply a business expense .
During the 1920s , when 20 dollars equaled -- by law -- roughly an ounce of gold , Al Capone 's operation was bringing in $ 100 million per year .
As I write this paragraph , 321gold.com reports ( via Kitco.com ) that it takes over 900 dollars to buy an ounce of gold , so Capone 's $ 100 million / year was a staggering income .
No wonder bootleggers found it so easy to bribe low - paid public servants .
Pop quiz : the corruption , violence , and other related problems ( including death or blinding from bad booze ) of the Prohibition years were caused by :
Demon rum ( i.e. , alcohol itself ) Scumbag criminal alcohol addicts Scumbag criminal alcohol pushers " Going too easy " on alcohol criminals
If you answered " none of the above " , go to the head of the class .
The correct answer to " what caused the problems of the Prohibition years " is E ) : " Prohibition itself , as enabled by the violence and coercion of the State . "
Proof ( although for the life of me I can't see why further proof would be necessary ) is that ALL of the problems associated with Prohibition vanished practically overnight when Prohibition was repealed in 1933 .
So we have the following situation : Almost immediately after making alcohol illegal , violence , corruption , and other problems ( including a truly dangerous lack of consumer protection ) emerged , then intensified , and then continued -- year after year and despite ever - harsher penalties , including the infamous life for a pint laws .
Thirteen years later , we ended Prohibition and the problems vanished overnight .
Was there any connection between using government laws to prohibit sale and use of alcohol , and all that " alcohol - related " violence and corruption ?
Nah .
Of course not .
That , apparently , was the actual conclusion most people ( both the public and , of course , government " experts " ) came to during the Prohibition years , and it remains the conclusion of most people today -- about not only the Prohibition years of the early 1900s but also about the modern version : the carefully misnamed War on Drugs .
" War on people who prefer certain types of mostly - quite - safe drugs and herbs to the far - more dangerous legal drugs , such as tobacco and alcohol and prescription chemicals " just does n't have the same catchy sound .
Let 's diagram the problem :
Government power --> Prohibition --> " Alcohol violence " and other symptoms
Today 's version would be :
Government power -->
War on Drugs --> " Drug violence " and other symptoms
Without government power , there is no Prohibition -- not the coercive , throw - you - in - jail version , anyway , although social sanctions , religious edicts , and other forms of prohibition could still be in effect -- and thus no widespread violence , corruption , and lack of consumer protection .
Government power is the root of the problem ; everything else is a leaf , a twig , or at most a branch .
But many people here in the 21st Century can apparently watch The Untouchables ( 1987 ; Kevin Costner , Sean Connery , Robert De Niro ) without any more understanding of this point than shown by the characters in the film .
Did I mention that we are actually living in a nightmare ?

Do you have a globe that you can look at ?
If not , use a ball or something round like an orange .
Take a lamp or a flash - light and turn it on and place it on a table where the light is shining toward the globe / ball / orange .
You will see that some of the globe is in the light and some is in the dark and if you slowly turn the globe you will see that the light and dark areas move .
This is what happened each day as the earth revolves - for part of the day we are in the area that is facing the light ( the sun ) and that is the hours of day - light and for other part of the day it is dark , which is night - time .
To make things easier we have divided the earth into 24 time zones that coincided with the 24 hours of each day .
As the earth revolves and it gets light , it becomes , for example , 6 am in New York , then an hour later it becomes 6 am in Chicago , then an hour later it is 6 am in Denver , then an hour later in Los Angeles .

Take a virtual trip inside the human body at a cellular level to see how blood vessels grow to feed tumors .
Stopping this growth is one of the primary lines of attack scientists take in trying to defeat diseases , cancer in particular .
Wired.com got an exclusive early look at Amgen ’s new website , launched Wednesday , which aims to explain blood - vessel growth , or angiogenesis , and how it relates to cancer .
The video above is just the first of 15 produced by Amgen that explore various aspects of angiogenesis and potential ways to control it in beautiful , lifelike videos .
Angiogenesis is critical for tumors to grow beyond a few millimeters , and for cancer to metastasize to other parts of the body .
Cancer cells use the blood vessels as conduits to other areas of the body , where a single cell can set up camp and begin forming a new tumor .
Stop angiogenesis , and you stop cancer .
Within the last 20 years neuroscientists have shown that new neurons are generated in the brain throughout the lifespan .
This finding opened a new area of research aimed at understanding if adult neural stem cells can be used in therapies for neurodegenerative diseases .
A challenge with this approach is that there are fewer neural stem cell in the aged brain and the loss of stem cells occurs at just the time when neurodegenerative diseases are most common .
But a new study is providing important information that neural stem from an aged brain still have the capacity to mature into functional neurons .
A team of researchers from the Wallenberg Neuroscience Center in Lund Sweden led by Dr. Zaal Kokaia examined the properties of neural stem cells at different stages of the lifespan .
In an elegant set of experiments they characterized changes in key genes that effect the ability of neural stem cells to proliferate and mature into functional neurons .
The research group confirmed that there are fewer neural stem cells in the aged brain .
It is both the environment in the aged brain and changes in the stem cells that reduce their ability to generate new neurons .
Stem cells from the aged brain express less of important neural stem cell markers , key transcription factors , and neurogenic factors .
But all is not lost .
The neural stem cell that remain in the aged brain can produce functional neurons if the cells are cultured outside of the aged brain environment .
Furthermore , the new neurons functioned just like those from younger brains .
Dr. Kokaia ’s research provides an important new finding about the capacity of neural stem cells to proliferate and mature into new neurons .
Embryonic stem cells give rise to the largest number of functional neurons and will continue to be the most suitable for transplant purposes .
But this new study shows that neural stem cells from aged brains can produce functional neurons .
A finding that opens the door for more research on how to use adult neural stem cells to develop new treatments for neurodegenerative disease in elderly patients .
For more information about Dr. Kokaia ’s research you can look at his website .

Centenarians get to be centenarians by surviving or not suffering the diseases that kill everyone else .
So what kills centenarians ?
This is n't an academic question , as we'd like to engineer a future in which none of us suffer the major diseases of aging , and all of us make it past a century in good health .
Understanding the processes that slay those who survive everything else the failing body can throw at us is just as essential to the future of longevity medicine as curing cancer and repairing mitochondria .
If forced to make an educated guess today , I 'd have to say that the best evidence is for amyloidosis to be the killer of the oldest old - a buildup of metabolic byproducts that eventually clogs the body 's systems to the point of failure .
The Supercentenarian Research Foundation outlines some of the case for that conclusion :
Coles argues [ that supercentenarians ] are n't perishing from the typical scourges of old age , such as cancer , heart disease , stroke , and Alzheimer 's Disease .
What kills most of them , he says , is a condition , extremely rare among younger people , called senile cardiac TTR Amyloidosis .
TTR is a protein that cradles the thyroid hormone thyroxine and whisks it around the body .
In TTR Amyloidosis , the protein amasses in and clogs blood vessels , forcing the heart to work harder and eventually fail .
" The same thing that happens in the pipes of an old house happens in your blood vessels , " says Coles .
Folk from the Biogerontology Research Foundation ( formed " to support the application of our knowledge of the mechanisms of ageing to the relief of disability , suffering and disease in old age " ) were kind enough to direct my attention today to a recent update from the amyloidosis research community :
Prof Pepys ’s persistence pays off
Amyloidosis is caused by the build up of abnormal " amyloid " proteins in body tissues .
Prof Pepys has long believed that the key to understanding the disease is a related blood protein called SAP , which sticks to amyloid fibres and stops enzymes removing them .
The FT has covered his work several times .
My predecessor David Fishlock described in 1990 Prof Pepys ’s discovery of a way to image SAP and amyloid fibres .
I wrote in 1995 and 2002 about progress in developing a drug called CPHPC , which aimed to clear the destructive amyloid deposits from patients by removing the protective SAP from their blood .
Prof Pepys was working then in collaboration with Roche .
But the Swiss pharmaceutical giant eventually pulled out .
" While we had promising early results [ with CPHPC ] they were not enough to benefit patients with advanced disease , " he says .
" Something more dramatic is needed . "
That something turns out to a combination of CPHPC with an antibody - a molecular guidance system designed to seek out amyloid deposits in vital organs .
Now Prof Pepys has reached an agreement with another big pharmaceutical group , UK - based GlaxoSmithKline , to collaborate on producing a treatment for amyloidosis based on the CPHPC - antibody combination .
Those of us interested in progress towards the tools needed to remove or repair changes in our tissues that accumulate with age should follow amyloidosis research with interest .
Some fraction of the degenerations of aging is caused by just this sort of buildup of unwanted chemical aggregates .
Strategies under development for dealing with specific aggregates may turn out be more broadly applicable to future engineered longevity therapies .
Police tactics of containing thousands of people for several hours at the Bank of England protests and using batons against climate camp protesters were condemned yesterday as an infringement of the right to demonstrate .
In the aftermath of the G20 protests in the City of London , politicians , demonstrators and a former police officer raised concerns about the methods used by the Metropolitan police to control crowds of more than 5,000 .
Eyewitnesses said hundreds of environmental demonstrators camping out along Bishopsgate in a peaceful protest during the day were cleared from the area aggressively by riot police with batons and dogs after nightfall on Wednesday .
The police had earlier said they would ask the protesters , whom they acknowledged were peaceful , to move as night fell .
Commander Simon O'Brien , said his officers would be " politely and proportionately " asking campers to move on .
But one eyewitness , Martin Horwood , the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham , said dogs were used on protesters near the camp .
James Lloyd , a legal adviser in the camp , said riot police forcefully cleared the area using batons around midnight .
" There was no announcement , the riot police just started moving forward very quickly from the south , " he said .
" They were pushing everyone back , pushing forward quickly .
They caused panic , people were screaming and shouting ...
There was a person in a wheelchair struggling to move , being pushed forcibly by them .
It was totally disproportionate . "
Another eyewitness , Ashley Parsons , said : " The violence perpetrated against so many around me over that hour was sickening and terrifying .
" Without warning , from around midnight , the police repeatedly and violently surged forwards in full riot gear , occasionally rampaging through the protest line and deliberately destroying protesters ' property , some officers openly screaming in pumped - up rage . "
Outside the Bank of England , thousands were held for up to eight hours behind a police cordon , in a practice known as " kettling " .
Parents with children and passers - by were told by officers on the cordon that " no one could leave " .
According to witnesses , when they were finally allowed to go on Wednesday night , they were ordered to provide names and addresses and have their pictures taken .
If they refused , they were sent back behind the cordon .
John O'Connor , a former Met officer , criticised the tactic .
" They are using this more and more , " he said .
" Instead of sending snatch squads in to remove those in the crowd who are committing criminal offences , they contain everyone for hours .
It is a retrograde step ... it is an infringement of civil liberties . "
The tactic was challenged in the courts by two demonstrators who were held for seven hours at Oxford Circus , central London , during the May Day protests in 2001 .
They claimed their imprisonment breached their rights to liberty but a House of Lords judgment ruled the tactics legal .
Senior police defended their actions , saying they were dealing with a small minority bent on violence , while allowing the demonstrations to go ahead .
They said the investigations were continuing .
Two squats in east London were raided yesterday after officers viewed video footage taken by special teams .
By last night the number arrested rose to 122 over three days .
Four people were charged with damage to a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland on Wednesday .
Mindaugas Lenartavicius , 21 , was charged with arson recklessly endangering life , Daniel Champion and Ben Shiells , both 18 , with burglary , criminal damage and theft of a computer , and a 17 - year - old girl with burglary with intent to cause damage .
O'Brien said the cordons were put in place because a group of about 200 people were violent .
" There was no real deliberate attempt to say you are all going to stay here for hours , " he said .
He said people had been allowed to leave throughout the day , and that by about 7.30 pm those left were people who wanted to be there , and they were asked for their names as they left as part of the inquiry .
" What I saw there at that time was a couple of hundred people who did not want to go .
They had ... been the agitators throughout the day , " he said .
The Guardian saw and spoke to many people who were clearly not agitators , but who were refused permission to leave .
David Howarth , the Liberal Democrat justice spokesman , said : " How did the police end up in a situation where they used the same degree of force on the most peaceful demonstration as they did for a violent protest at the Bank of England ?
They seem to only have one trick . "

前回、『世界最大のコンサル会社が最低の仕事をする理由』というエントリーで、小さい規模で機能していた優れたアプローチを大規模な形にスケールさせることで硬直化してしまうという話をしました。どんなに優れた人材や組織であっても規模の拡大によって生じる品質の低下（劣化）を生じてしまうということなのですが、10人や20人くらいの組織であれば個々人の連携によってそれなりのパフォーマンスは期待できます。「我々の間には、チームプレーなどという都合のよい言い訳は存在せん。有るとすればスタンドプレーから生じるチームワークだけだ。」と言ったのは攻殻機動隊の荒巻さんですが、では、一体何人を超えると組織のチームワークを期待することが難しくなってくるのでしょうか？これについて、とても興味深い数字を発見しました。それはダンバー数です。霊長類学者のロバート・ダンバー氏は、大脳新皮質の大きさと群れの大きさの関係について相関関係を調査した結果、「人間が形成できる群れの大きさ」を算出しています。人間の場合、所属する組織やコミュニティが150人を超えると、お互いを明確に識別しあうことが難しくなるため、組織としてのパフォーマンスが悪化し、生き残ることが困難になってくるそうで、事実、世界各地の狩猟民族は平均すると150人前後（130人〜250人の平均）に落ち着くとのこと。これを組織論に当てはめて論じると、社員同士が意識し合える部門内の人数は150人を超えないことが望ましい、という結論を導くことができます。ダンバーの150人理論について、松村崇さんがうまくまとめているので引用します。この理論を意識して組織を構成している企業は多いようで、事業規模をうまく拡大している企業の多くは一部門の人数を150人以下に抑えるようにしていると聞いたことがあります。しかし、これで話が終わってしまうと、組織は150人以上の単位でまとまることはできなくなってしまいますね。そこで登場するのが、前回のエントリーで触れた”方法論（メソドロジー）”というものです。人間の集落を調査すると250人（子供を抜くと150人程度）以下と1000人以上のいずれかに識別できる、というのは中山心太さんの発表資料に書かれていたことですが、これはとても面白い考察だと思います。（詳細はこちらから）中山さんによれば、1000人以上のコミュニティに共通していたのは、宗教や儀礼のような共通のルールが発達したからであるとしていますが、これはそのまま企業のメソドロジーにも当てはまることではないでしょうか。つまり、150人を超える組織をひとつのコミュニティとして発展させたいのであれば、そこに共通のメソドロジーが必要になるということです。それができない組織は人数の拡大とともにチームパフォーマンスの著しい劣化を招くことでしょう。あなたの組織、どうなってますか？

President Obama has thrown a kind of protective , legal “ invisibility cloak ” over C.I.A. officers who may have participated in torture or other war crimes , but whose actions were authorized by lawyers in the Bush Administration .
The reasoning goes that , if they were acting in good faith on the orders of superiors , it ’s unfair to hold them to a different standard .
But the unclassified report ( pdf ) from the Senate Armed Services Committee , released tonight by Chairman Carl Levin , raises questions about whether the C.I.A. was always operating with legal authorization .
Take .
for instance , the torment of Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah , the guinea pig for the C.I.A. ’s most abusive interrogation techniques , who was critically injured in a gunfight and captured on March 28 , 2002 .
The Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel authorized harrowing tactics for interrogating Zubaydah in the infamous “ Bybee Torture Memo ” of August 1 , 2002 , which Obama released publicly last week .
So , presumably , whatever happened to Zubaydah after August is indemnified by the Obama invisibility cloak .
But what about what happened to Zubaydah in the four months before ?
The Levin report provides some new details .
On April 16 , 2002 — a couple weeks after Zubaydah ’s capture , and three and a half months before the Bybee memo — a military psychologist named Dr. Bruce Jessen was already circulating a blueprint for cruelly coercive interrogations based on torture methods used by Chinese Communist forces during the Korean War .
The report describes Jessen ’s blueprint as a “ draft exploitation plan ” for U.S. - held captives .
( I wrote about Dr. Jessen ’s partner , James Mitchell , in the July 11 , 2005 , issue of The New Yorker . )
By June 2002 — again , months before the Department of Justice gave the legal green light for interrogations — an F.B.I. special agent on the scene of the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah refused to participate in what he called “ borderline torture , ” according to a D.O.J. investigation cited in the Levin report .
Soon after , F.B.I. Director Robert Mueller commanded his personnel to stay away from the C.I.A. ’s coercive interrogations .
What did the F.B.I. see in the spring of 2002 ?
And exactly who was involved ?
How high up was this activity authorized ?
Is it off - limits for criminal investigation ?
There are plenty of new names and details in the Armed Services Committee report , including a scene of two military men teaching the C.I.A. how to use Chinese torture techniques .
One of the instructors , Joseph Witsch , played the “ beater , ” while the other , Gary Percival , became the “ beatee . ”
By the mid-summer of 2002 , beating was no longer just an academic exercise .
Precisely when these tactics were used on live captives , and at what point top Bush officials endorsed them , may be a matter of serious interest to Attorney General Eric Holder .
Yet these limp little pouches are exactly the images that the mighty Tea Baggers are encouraging each other to duplicate and to raise on high at their intimidating Tea Parties .
This obsession with a tiny pouch of dried vegetation has led me to inquire whether the world of contemporary art might have something to reveal to us about such a curious symbol .
Can art illuminate the tea bag 's meaning and relevance in modern culture ?
Can it demystify or comment upon the tea bag 's hidden potency ?
Please join me for a very brief political tour of the tea bag in contemporary art .
In Tania Bruguera 's 2003 installation " Poetic Justice " , constructed entirely of used tea bags and displayed at the Istanbul Biennial , might we find a powerful image , perhaps , of political dead ends ?
Do its constricting walls of discarded tea bags tell us something about tired political slogans and recycled ideas ?
Does Shelley Grund 's January 2007 " Used Tea Bag " from the " Painting a Day " series of everyday objects , suggest , perhaps , the discolored corpse of conservative ideology ?
The ethical exhaustion and legislative lassitude of the religious right ?
Might Andrew Pini's " A Used Tea Bag " suggest the transparent self - interest of supply side economics and the dripping irony of compassionate conservatism ?
Finally , can we see in Alejandra Villasmil 's 2002 " Cojinette 1 " ( tea bag and mixed media on paper ) the moral straightjacket of evangelical politics and the stifling censorship of prescriptive patriotism ?
Perhaps the Tea Baggers need a few more lessons in contemporary art .

It used to be that a geeky wardrobe was embodied by suspenders and thick - rimmed glasses , but no longer !
21st century geeks have a wide array of t- shirts to choose from which will proudly display their inordinately high intelligence and tech - worshiping ways to the world .
So if you ’ve been looking for a way to advertise your geekhood to those around you , you ’ll be delighted at the 25 incredibly geeky t- shirts we rounded up for this article .
Enjoy !
How many times have you walked into someone ’s house and , instead of being greeted , were simply bombarded with requests to fix someone ’s computer ?
Are n’t you tired of it ?
Do n’t you wish that just once , you could summon the courage to say “ no ! ” the next time some dolt calls you up fretting about their broken Internet connection ?
Well thanks to this shirt , you can !
Never again will your friends and family take your superior computing knowledge for granted .
Oh , who are we kidding … they probably still will !
Star Wars + Newton ’s Second Law of Motion = WIN !
Everyone who has taken a networking or programming class has heard this joke at one time or another .
But until the pressing of this t- shirt , there was no way to carry it with you and identify your geekhood to others of like mind .
Luckily , you can now show everyone who passes by which of the 10 types of people you are …( not that they ’ll get the joke , of course . )
If you ’ve ever held the thankless job of setting up a home network ( either professionally or for your friends and family , à la the wearers of shirt number 1 ) , the “ There ’s no place like 127.0.0.1 ” t- shirt is right up your alley .
Few things are lonelier than sitting huddled in a cubicle all day writing SQL statements and retrieving information from databases .
And …well , okay , this shirt wo n’t do anything to change that , but you ’ll look a lot sharper and more geeky while you do it .
Maybe that will be enough to hold you over until you get that next promotion …( or get canned for not filing your TPS reports on time ! )
Have you ever been wandering the halls of your school , workplace , or just around town and wondered whether you could catch a wireless signal ?
We all have – but who wants the hassle of pulling out your laptop and booting it up to find out ?
Enter : the wifi shirt .
This t- shirt will literally tell you ( by lighting up bars across the chest of the shirt ) whether there are any wireless Internet signals close to where you are standing .
No laptop or cell phone necessary !
One of the timeless identifying marks of geeks from past and present is the pale color of their skin .
It ’s true – geeks are much more likely to be found huddled up at LAN parties and writing code than chasing a football down a beach .
So it ’s only fitting that you can now buy a shirt that advertises this already obvious fact .
Do n’t deny it – wear it proudly !
Some of the best geeky attire combines tech terminology with sexual innuendos , and ThinkGeek.com ’s “ Try Another Hole ” t- shirt is an excellent example .
Try wearing it to a bar , and who knows ?
You might just strike up a conversation with a pretty girl who gets you into a rousing conversation of the pros and cons of Firewire vs. USB !
( Hey , you can dream , right ? )
Admit it : if you ’re a geek , you ’ve probably fantasized about lording it over the jocks and popular cliques who teased you during high school .
It ’s why every nerd grows up telling themselves that someday , all of these jerks will work for them .
Well , now you have a t - shirt to encapsulate those comforting ( or not - so - comforting ) words that have been passed down from one generation of geeks to the next for decades .
Wear it and wear it often !
No collection of geeky t- shirts would be complete without the obligatory online “ LMAO ” shirt .
Perfect for those who find themselves thinking and talking in online lingo more than actual English , this shirt is sure to be a big conversation starter at the next party ( even if it is just a LAN party . )
ThinkGeek.com sums it up perfectly : “ no need for funny one - liners or obscure and geeky references here .
Just a simple homage to the markup language that makes the web go ’ round . ”
For a mere $ 17.99 , can any respectable web designer afford not to wear opening and closing tags on their chest and back ?
We think not !
Believe it or not , some geeks do , in fact , have girlfriends .
We know , we know – we were just as surprised as you !
But with Valentine ’s Day right around the corner , we can think of no better shirt for these lucky ladies to wear around than this one .
Now if she could only convince her binary - loving boyfriend that a Magic The Gathering party is n’t exactly the best idea for a romantic date …
If your girlfriend was n’t very fond of the “ I < 3 My Geek " shirt , perhaps a binary heart would do the trick .
We must warn you , though : bringing a girl with this shirt to any kind of computer fair , Harry Potter book signing , WoW tournament or video game store is just asking for her to be hit on !
One of the original geek t- shirt classics , the “ I > U ” equation shirt is perfect for those whose wardrobe is lacking in geek street cred .
You will also find this equation on multi-player gaming chat screens , Slashdot comments , and anywhere else the technically inclined congregate .
Cut from the same cloth as the “ There are 10 types of people in the world ” joke , the “ Johnny was a chemist ’s son ” chestnut is another timeless gem that is told and re-told in computer classrooms and IT departments every year .
But who knows ?
Maybe if enough geeks wear this shirt , your C++ professor wo n’t feel the need to trot it out each time he needs example text for your hello world program to generate .
Geeks love irony , and what better way to stitch irony into a t- shirt than to show the words “ Nanotechnology is huge ” in miniscule letters ?
Look no further , folks !
Few things get more laughs out of a bunch of stuffy , literalist geeks than a well - timed Stephen Hawking joke , and now you can wear one on your back at least once a week .
( We all know that geeks never , ever wear the same shirt twice in a week , or go without showering , or anything like that … )
Finally – a t- shirt for the geek who has yet to come to terms with his true nature .
If you find yourself walking around with extra swagger because of how many kills and “ pwns ” you scored in WoW last week , you will probably appreciate this t- shirt as well .
To the non-geek , it ’s baffling why anyone would think to put a “ p ” in the word “ owned . ”
But for those who know no other way , this t- shirt is the key to spicing up an otherwise boring wardrobe .
It is commonly believed that only males are geeks , but this is simply not so !
Fortunately , the makers of geeky apparel have not bought into this misbegotten stereotype , as evidenced by this snazzy “ Geek Girl ” shirt for females .
If you ’ve been looking for a way to join the testosterone - dominated party of brainy fashion , this shirt might be the missing link !
Okay , so this is n’t actually a wearable t- shirt , but we thought it would be criminal not to include it in the article .
After all , any geek can wear a t - shirt to show his true colors .
But it takes a real master of the craft to outfit his bedding in a button - up , pocketed work shirt !
Seriously guys , extra credit for anyone who actually finds this shirt and buys it .
( And we all know geeks never shy away from the chance to get extra credit ! )
23 ) “ Get Laid ”
Most of the t- shirts in this article try to portray geekhood in a positive light , making geeks feel better about the quirks that society has been ostracizing them for their entire lives .
Unfortunately , some t- shirts still serve to remind them of the all - too - painful truths they ’ve grown familiar with , and this is certainly one of ’em !
If your refrigerator is never without Red Bull and you consider it sacrilegious for a LAN party to begin without cracking open a case of Bawls , then you need to make the Caffeine Molecule t- shirt the next addition to your geeky wardrobe .
Let the rest of the unwashed masses consume things that they do n’t know the atomic structure of ; you ’re supposed to be smarter than that !
( You are smarter than that …are n’t you ? )
What – you did n’t really think you were going to make it through an entire article on the 25 most incredibly geeky t- shirts without at least one l337 - speak shirt , did you ?
Shame on you !
No respectable geek should be without one of these bad boys , and if you did n’t already know better , now you do .
So go out and get one .
Now !
Bonus # 1 : “ Lesbian Trapped in a SysAdmin ’s Body ”
By this point , you should know that a vital pillar of geek fashion is witty self - deprecation .
An excellent case in point is this t- shirt , emblazoned with the slogan “ I ’m a lesbian trapped inside the body of a crazy , mad , ugly system admin . ”
Of course , for all the innuendos , irony , playing - on - words , and suggestive language that makes so many of the above shirts funny and geeky , there ’s still no beating a t - shirt that comes right out and beats you over the head with a sobering dose of the obvious .
For that , we turn to the classic Periodic Table of Elements t- shirt , which removes all doubt that you were always picked last for competitive sports in gym class .
Writing web apps with Django can be a lot of fun , but deploying them can be a chore , even if you ’re using Apache .
Here ’s a setup I ’ve been using that makes deployment fast and easy .
This all assumes you ’ve got sudo access on a remote server running Ubuntu or something similar .
Mercurial
This setup assumes you ’ve got 2 mercurial repositories : 1 on your local machine , and 1 on the remote server you ’re deploying to .
In the remote repository , add the following to .hg/ hgrc
[ hooks ] changegroup = hg up
This makes mercurial run hg up whenever you push new code .
Then in your local repo’s .hg / hgrc , make sure the default path is to your remote repo .
Here ’s an example
[ paths ] default = ssh://user@domain.com /repo
Now when you run hg push , you do n’t need to include the path to the repo , and your code will be updated immediately .
FastCGI
Since I ’m using nginx instead of Apache , we ’ll be deploying Django with FastCGI .
Here ’s an example script you can use to start and restart your Django FastCGI server .
Add this script to your mercurial repo as run_fcgi.sh .
#!/bin/bash PIDFILE="/tmp/django.pid "
SOCKET=" /tmp/django.sock " # kill current fcgi process if it exists if [ -f $ PIDFILE ] ; then kill `cat -- $ PIDFILE` rm -f -- $ PIDFILE fi python manage .py runfcgi socket =$ SOCKET pidfile=$PIDFILE method=prefork
Important note : the FastCGI socket file will need to be readable & writable by nginx worker processes , which run as the www - data user in Ubuntu .
This will be handled by the fab restart command below , or you could add chmod a+w $ SOCKET to the end of the above script .
Nginx
Nginx is a great high performance web server with simple configuration .
Here ’s a simple example server config for proxying to your Django FastCGI process .
Add this config to your mercurial repo as django.nginx .
server { listen 80 ; # change to your FQDN server_name YOUR .
DOMAIN.COM ; location / { # must be the same socket file as in the above fcgi script fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/django.sock ; } }
On the remote server , make sure the following lines are in the http section of /etc/nginx /nginx.conf
include /etc/nginx/sites- enabled /* ; # fastcgi_params should contain a lot of fastcgi_param variables include / etc / nginx / fastcgi_params ;
You must also make sure there is a link in / etc / nginx / sites - enabled to your django. nginx config .
Do n’t worry if django.nginx does n’t exist yet , it will once you run fab nginx the first time .
you@remote.ubuntu $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled you@remote.ubuntu $ sudo ln -s ../sites-available/django.nginx django.nginx
Fab
Fab , or properly Fabric , is my favorite new tool .
It ’s designed specifically for making remote deployment simple and easy .
You create a fabfile where each function is a fab command that can run remote and sudo commands on one or more remote hosts .
So let ’s deploy Django using fab .
Here ’s an example fabfile with 2 commands : restart and nginx .
These commands should only be run after you ’ve done a hg push .
config.fab_hosts = [ ' YOUR.DOMAIN.COM '] config.projdir = '/ PATH/TO /YOUR / REMOTE/HG /REPO ' def restart ( ) : sudo ( 'cd %( projdir )s ; run_fcgi.sh ' , user= ' www - data ' , fail= ' abort ' ) def nginx ( ) : sudo ( 'cp %( projdir ) s/django.nginx /etc/nginx/sites-available /' , fail= ' abort ') sudo ( ' killall - HUP nginx ' , fail= ' abort ' )
restart
You only need to run fab restart if you ’ve changed the actual python code .
Changes to templates or static files do n’t require a restart and will be used automatically ( because of the hg up changegroup hook ) .
Executing run_fcgi.sh as the www - data user ensures that nginx can read & write the socket .
nginx
If you ’ve changed your nginx server config , you can run fab nginx to install and reload the new server config without restarting the nginx server .
Wrap Up
Now that everything is setup , the next time you want to deploy some new code , it ’s as simple as hg push && fab restart .
And if you ’ve only changed templates , all you need to do is hg push .
I hope this helps make your Django development life easier .
It has certainly done so for me 🙂
Mr Demjanjuk says he was a prisoner of war of the Nazis during World War II A US judge has blocked an order to deport an alleged Nazi concentration camp guard , two days before he was due to be extradited to Germany .
John Demjanjuk , 89 , is accused of involvement in the deaths of 29,000 Jews at a camp in Nazi- occupied Poland .
He denies any involvement and has asked for asylum in the US , arguing that deportation would constitute torture .
An immigration judge said the block would stay until a decision had been reached on whether to re-open his case .
Lawyers for Mr Demjanjuk say his health is far too poor for him to make the journey .
In March , Germany issued an arrest warrant for the Ukraine national over the deaths of thousands of Jews at the Sobibor camp during World War II .
But Mr Demjanjuk , who migrated to the US in 1952 , says he was a prisoner of war of the Nazis rather than a prison guard .
In 1986 , he was extradited to Israel and sentenced to death for war crimes , after being identified by witnesses as " Ivan the Terrible " - a notorious prison guard at the Treblinka camp .
But the Israeli Supreme Court overturned his conviction , when new evidence emerged suggesting he was not the same guard .
He returned to the US but was accused of lying on his immigration application about working for the Nazis .
In 2002 , a US immigration judge ruled that there was enough evidence to prove Mr Demjanjuk had been a guard at several Nazi death camps and stripped him of his citizenship .
German authorities now say they have new evidence linking him to the crimes of which he has been accused .

Scrubs was born in 2001 by taking us into the mind of the very quirky John “ J.D. ” Dorian , an intern at Sacred Heart teaching Hospital .
J.D. narrates ( and daydreams ) his adventures in treating patients along with his fellow intern and on again off again girlfriend Elliot Reed , best friend Christopher Turk , and his reluctant mentor Dr. Perry Cox .
Fast Forward to 2009 , the interns are residents now , Dr. Cox is now the Chief of Medicine , the show ’s moved to ABC from NBC , and it ’s still just as funny as it ever was .
March 18 ’th marked the Scrubs return after a month long hiatus , and a move to Wednesday nights , the final episode is currently scheduled to air on May 6 2009 .
In traditional Gunaxin style we have to take a look at the women who make this show possible .
Sarah Chalke
Sarah Chalke plays Dr. Elliot Reed , J.D. ’s on again off again girlfriend .
She ’s a little neurotic , has low self esteem ( sometimes ) , and she tends to shout her favorite expletive ( Frick ! ) when she ’s frustrated , but she ’s incredibly cute .
You might recognize her as “ Second Becky ” from Roseanne .
Judy Reyes
Judy Reyes plays Christopher Turk ’s wife Carla Espinosa .
Carla is the fiery Latina , who heads up Sacred Heart ’s nursing staff .
Christa Miller
Christa Miller plays Jordan Sullivan , Dr Perry Cox ’s ex-wife .
With the way those two bicker you can never tell why they got married in the first place , but you can certainly see why they got divorced .
You might recognize Christa Miller from her role as Kate on the Drew Carry show .
Along with the regulars there is a new crop of interns this year featured in a series of Webisodes on ABC ’s site .
Here ’s the first :
Eliza Coupe
Eliza Coupe plays Denise Mahoney , J.D. ’s intern .
He refers to her as Jo , because of an attitude similar to Jo from The Facts of Life .
She has trouble showing empathy for her sick patients , but she does get very excited when she sees overweight men .
Betsy Beutler
Betsy Beutler plays Katie Collins , Elliot ’s intern .
She might seem ditzy and cute , but she has a manipulative side .
Sonal Shah
Sonal Shah plays Sonja “ Sunny ” Dey , the cheeriest of all the interns .
She making a video diary for her mom , and she ’s the newest member of the Brain Trust .
Not only that but I was able to find way more pictures of her than the other two interns .

Gordon Brown has said MPs ' second homes expenses should be replaced by a flat - rate daily Commons attendance payment .
The prime minister said he wanted a Commons vote next week on the measures to " restore people 's confidence " .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is among MPs criticised over their use of the allowance , worth up to £ 24,000 a year .
The Tories and Lib Dems welcomed moves to change the system but expressed concern about a daily allowance for MPs to " turn up and do their jobs " .
And standards watchdog Sir Christopher Kelly , who is holding an independent inquiry into expenses , warned against a " quick fix " .
The government wants changes in place by July - the same month all MPs ' expenses claims , with receipts , dating back to 2004 are due to be published after a long Freedom of Information battle .
But Mr Brown says they will only be interim changes , ahead of Sir Christopher 's findings .
London MPs
Details were set out in a written statement to MPs from Commons leader Harriet Harman .
Among them , she said MPs should not be allowed directly to employ staff , instead the House of Commons would be responsible for contracts and salaries .
Instead of the second homes allowance MPs would get a " flat rate " allowance based on attendance at Parliament .
It is not known how much it might amount to , but it would be set by the independent Senior Salaries Review Body and Mr Brown has said the system should be " simpler and less generous " .
Ms Blears is feeling understandably sheepish .
She has apologised to the PM and takes it as a lesson to be extra careful in future
Hazel Blears ' spokesman
Blears almost blows PM 's surprise
In full : MP expenses reform plans Nick Robinson 's blog Labour backbencher John Mann told the BBC he believed it would save the taxpayer £ 20 m a year and amounted to " a cut " for MPs .
Ms Harman said ministers living in " grace - and - favour " homes would not be able to claim the new allowance .
Nor would MPs with constituencies " within reasonable distance of Westminster " who would instead be entitled to the supplement currently claimed by inner London MPs , worth up to £ 7,500 a year .
The statement was inadvertently revealed early to the press when Communities Secretary Hazel Blears held the document in her hand in Downing Street in full view of press photographers .
The Committee on Standards in Public Life , headed by Sir Christopher , is due to publish a review of pay and expenses by the end of the year .
BBC political correspondent Reeta Chakrabarti said the announcement had come as a big surprise to many in Westminster , the day before the Budget , as three weeks ago Mr Brown appeared to rule out any changes before that review was complete .
But Mr Brown , who has seen several ministers embarrassed by revelations about their expenses , said MPs had to " act urgently " to restore public confidence .
' Lost confidence '
In a video statement on the Downing Street website , he added : " The issue of expenses is casting a cloud over the whole of Parliament .
" So members of Parliament need to have the humility to recognise that the country has lost confidence in the current system . "

Sir Christopher told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the prime minister had assured him the plans were merely " interim recommendations " .
" If public confidence is going to be restored , what is required is ... a proper , independent , fundamental look at the issue and at all the issues not just those identified in the statement , " he said .
" I have warned on numerous occasions that this is not something that can be solved by a quick fix . "
Lib Dem MP
Nick Harvey , who sat on the committee which last year reviewed MPs ' expenses , told the BBC Mr Brown should have waited for the review rather than revealing proposals " for some sort of political advantage the day before the budget " .
He said a flat daily rate that covered MPs ' existing rental agreements was bound to be considered " quite high " and people might think paying out a lump sum was " more opaque and secretive " than filing claims for rent or mortgage payments .
Mr Brown has offered to meet Conservative leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in the next week to discuss the proposals .
Expenses revelations Mr Cameron said the announcement was " a significant and very welcome U - turn " from Mr Brown and said he was in favour of moves to " cut the cost of politics " .
He told the BBC : " This is progress but I do worry about this idea of paying MPs a per day amount to turn up and do their jobs .
I think that is open to exploitation , there will be loopholes and problems - I will go to this meeting and try to help sort them out . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was also concerned about the proposals for a daily allowance and said every pound claimed should be justified to the taxpayer .
I do n't think bringing the Brussels gravy train to Westminster is the answer to our problems
Nick Clegg
Lib Dems Mr Clegg , a former MEP , told BBC Radio 4's World at One : " This is what they do in the European Parliament and I do n't think bringing the Brussels gravy train to Westminster is the answer to our problems . "
Calls to reform second home allowances have increased , with revelations about several MPs ' use of the money .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and work minister Tony McNulty are both being investigated over their claims although both say they acted within the rules .
The furore over expenses began last year when it emerged Conservative MP Derek Conway had claimed thousands of pounds for employing his two sons as researchers , although they had done far less work than reported by him .
MPs voted last July to keep second home expenses and rejected proposals for a tougher auditing regime .
Mr Brown did not vote , while 33 government ministers backed keeping the allowances .

How could so many smart , successful people have been so spectacularly gullible ?
Ever since Bernard Madoff was arrested in December , it has been a puzzle to figure out how Wall Street 's $ 65 bn ( £ 44.5 bn ) crook got away with cooking the books for the best part of two decades .
One answer , according to newly disclosed legal documents , is that some of his closest associates blithely turned a blind eye to warning signs .
And they allowed themselves to be bullied and harangued by the 70 - year - old .
The Massachusetts ' secretary of state , Bill Galvin , has filed fraud charges against Fairfield Greenwich , a hedge fund which was among the biggest " feeder funds " to Madoff 's investment empire .
Fairfield had $ 14bn under management , including about $ 7.2bn in a fund that was 95 % dedicated to Madoff .
Galvin says Fairfield was criminally negligent .
He alleges it was profiting to the tune of $ 100 m annually from its connection with Madoff and it made only the flimsiest of efforts to check what the financier was doing with its customers ' money .
An intriguing insight comes in an email sent just three days before Madoff 's arrest by Jeffrey Tucker , the co-founder of Fairfield .
At the time , Madoff 's house of cards was beginning to collapse as investors , spooked by the financial crisis , pulled out large sums of money – known as redemptions .
Bernie wanted Fairfield to replace the outflow of money .
Tucker wrote to Fairfield 's executive committee : " Just got off the phone with a very angry Bernie who said if we can't replace the redemptions for 12/31 he is going to close the account .
His traders are ' tired of dealing with all these hedge funds ' and there are plenty of institutions who can replace the money .
They have been offered this all along but ' remained loyal to us ' . "
Shortly after midday on 8 December , Tucker signs off : " Not sure of our next step but we best talk .
I believe he is sincere . "
The last sentence is telling – Tucker who , ironically , is a former securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) official , fell hook , line and sinker for Bernie 's bullying bravado shtick .
It was a load of nonsense – there were no other institutions willing to provide money and Madoff confessed 72 hours later that his business was riddled with lies .
Madoff had hundreds of victims , most of whom were not financial experts .
They included members of the US Jewish community who were acquainted with Madoff through country clubs and social networks in Long Island and Palm Beach .
There were charities , benefactors and showbiz names such as Pedro Almodóvar , Steven Spielberg and Kevin Bacon .
Madoff abused their trust , took their savings and used the money to fund his lifestyle of four homes , six boats , four cars and lashings of bling ( he has 35 sets of watches and cufflinks , according to an inventory by the department of justice ) .
At least two suicides have been linked to Madoff 's crimes .
Fairfield Greenwich is in a slightly different category .
Fairfield was co-founded by Tucker and business partner Walter Noel , a Connecticut socialite who is a mainstay of the ponies and cocktails circuit .
His collection of attractive grown - up daughters have gained much attention – a Vanity Fair article devoted to them in 2002 described them as " glamazons " and raved about the family being " perfect " .
Fairfield had acted as a go - between for Madoff since 1989 , collecting money from investors and pumping it into Madoff 's fund .
For this , it took a cut of 1 % of deposits plus 20 % of all accrued profits .
To justify this commission , clients were promised that Fairfield was looking out for them by gaining " privileged access " to Madoff 's accounts and conducting deep " due diligence " including " onsight reviews " .
Yet the paucity of some of these checks is laughable .
In a marketing document for clients , Fairfield boasted it would never have invested in a crooked venture like Bayou – a notorious hedge fund run by Samuel Israel , who famously faked his suicide to avoid prison for fraud .
The reason ? : " We would question Bayou 's obscure auditing firm . "
This is fairly brazen since Madoff was audited by a single - man accountancy firm called Friehling & Horowitz based in a strip mall outside New York City .
A Fairfield client once asked about this auditing outfit , prompting Fairfield 's chief financial officer , Dan Lipton , to " investigate " .
He rang up Friehling 's only employee , then emailed his client the following reassurance : " Friehling & Horowitz CPAs are a small - to medium - sized audit and tax firm specialising in broker dealers and other financial services firms .
They have hundreds of clients and are well respected in the local community . "
Lipton 's subsequent interview with regulators is worth reproducing :
Q. How did you determine they had hundreds of clients ?
A . That 's what the partner said on the phone to me .
Q. Did you corroborate it in any way ?
A. No .
Q. How did you determine that they were well respected in the local community ?
A . That 's what our conversation – my conversation with one of the partners at Friehling & Horowitz – that 's what was told to me .
Hardly the due diligence skills of Hercule Poirot , are they ?
It is n't hard to imagine that Fairfield was lulled into a lucrative sense of security over a 20 - year relationship .
Others smelt a rat – including Harry Markopolos , a financier who brought concerns about Madoff to the SEC 's attention .
When the SEC felt moved to investigate , Fairfield 's chief counsel , Mark McKeefrey , had a phone conversation with Madoff to discuss what they should say to regulators during interviews .
According to a transcript , Bernie 's opener in that conversation was : " Obviously , first of all , this conversation never took place , Mark , okay ? "
In a statement this week , Fairfield attacked the Massachusetts regulator for making accusations with " 20/20 hindsight " .
The firm said : " Contrary to the allegations , FGG [ Fairfield Greenwich Group ] conducted vigorous and robust monitoring on an ongoing basis of the Madoff investments .
" The SEC , other regulatory agencies and every other investor in Madoff failed to detect his sophisticated fraud . "
Fair point , but not all investors were promising their clients deep , constant due diligence of Madoff .
At various stages , Tucker , Lipton and Fairfield 's chief risk officer , Amit Vijayvergiya , all received tours of Madoff 's market making operation – but they did n't see the floors where Madoff 's crucial so - called " split strike " trading operation was supposed to take place .
Nor did they meet any of the individuals supposedly involved in executing it , according to this week 's regulatory complaint .
How , inquired investigators , did they therefore know that such people existed or that Madoff 's strategy was being executed ?
Vijayvergiya replied : " Madoff , after , you know , 18 years of a very lengthy and trusted relationship , an individual who had a stellar reputation and great credibility in the industry , provided us with this information , so we had every reason to believe it was true . "
That 's not quite good enough , is it ?
Karl was positively freaking out yesterday afternoon over the prospect that some of his ex-colleagues at the White House might wind up being prosecuted -- or held responsible publicly -- for helping George W. Bush install a torture regime during his tenure , after President Obama 's statement earlier in the day indicating he'd leave the decision up to the Attorney General .
Rove , appearing on Sean Hannity 's Fox News show , was particularly frantic -- and when Rove gets frantic , he gets nasty :
Rove : Sure , as long as they 've released the limits to which America will go to extract this information , let 's share the information that was extracted , and saved America from further attacks .
We know , for example -- it 's already a part of the public record -- that the interrogation of these high - value targets kept them from being able to attack Los Angeles by flying airplanes into the Liberty tower , the tallest building in Los Angeles , which was one of their plans .
But look , let 's step back for a minute .
What the Obama administration has done in the last several days is very dangerous .
What they 've essentially said is ,
If we have policy disagreements with our predecessors , what we 're going to do is we 're going to turn ourselves into the moral equivalent of a Latin American country run colonels in mirrored sunglasses .
And what we 're going to do is prosecute , systematically , the previous administration , or threaten prosecutions against the previous administration , based on policy differences .
Is that what we 've come to in this country ?
That if we have a change in administration from one party to another , that we then use the tools of the government to go systematically after the policy disagreements that we have with the previous administration ?
Now that may be fine in some little Latin American country that 's run by , you know , the latest junta .
It may be the way that they do things in Chicago .
But that 's not the way we do things here in America .
Hmmmm .
Last I looked , Chicago was here in America .
But more to the point : Karl 's sounding like someone who 's already looking over his shoulder at congressional subpoenas .
And even more to the point : Sorry , Karl , but working for the White House is not a Get Out of Jail Free card .
If you broke the law -- and particularly if you and your pals are war criminals according to American law for having not merely permitted but avidly constructed a torture regime -- the appropriate justice needs meting out .
Of course , we keep hearing about how Torture Saved Us From Terrorists -- notably the overhyped
and debunked " Los Angeles Tower plot . "
Funny thing about that -- back in 2006 , it was Wiretapping Saved Us From Terrorists .
Yes , the same overhyped " plot . "
Rove will have to do better than that if he wants to stay ahead of those rapidly gaining footsteps .
Opening shots were fired Friday in the RealNetworks v. DVD - CCA case .
Unfortunately , the public was excluded from key parts of the battle , when the presiding judge , Marilyn Hall Patel , granted DVD - CCA 's request to close the courtroom .
Some quick background :
In September 2008 , the motion picture industry sued RealNetworks over its RealDVD software , which was designed to allow consumers to copy their DVDs to their computers for later playback .
Real had obtained a license from DVD - CCA for its Content Scramble System ( " CSS " ) software , following a path blazed by Kaleidescape in an earlier court fight , DVD - CCA v. Kaleidescape , where a California state court rejected the DVD - CCA ’s argument that Kaleidescape 's licensed digital DVD jukebox violated the DVD - CCA license .
Despite this precedent favoring Real , Judge Patel ordered a temporary halt to distribution of RealDVD in October 2008 .
At issue now is whether that temporary injunction will stay in place until the case is resolved .
Such an injunction , Real 's attorney told the court Friday , would sound the " death knell " for the product .
On Friday , the first day of what is expected to be a three day hearing , the movie studios claimed that Real deliberately circumvented several layers of technical protections built into DVDs , including not just CSS but also ARccOS , RipGuard , bus encryption and bus authentication .
Anticipating Real 's claim that its technology facilitates fair use , the studios also insisted that fair use never excuses digital copying of a DVD , and that they have a right to be paid for every additional copy made .
As the attorney for the DVD - CCA put it : " DVD - CCA does n't license copying . "
In fact , he argued , the license forbids it .
The technical , procedural and general " specifications " that accompany the CSS license describe what an authorized product can do .
If the licensee follows the steps laid out in the specifications , he said , it will get an legal player -- but not a copier .
The DVD - CCA also argued that Real knew the licensing consortium did n't intend to permit copying because of the positions it took in the Kaleidescape case .
The studios and DVD - CCA did their best to portray RealDVD as a massive threat to Hollywood , arguing that the technology will encourage consumers to " rent , rip and return " rather than buying DVDs , and that the 5 copy limit built into the technology was hardly an effective limit .
Judge Patel asked , as she did at the TRO hearing , whether those 5 copies can be copied .
Answer :
Yes and no .
They can be copied , but can only be played on an authorized computer -- but Real could " easily " change that .
Real , for its part , sought to frame the case as a dispute about legitimate competition .
The question , said Real 's attorney , is whether the studios ' copyrights can be extended to control competition and fair use .
But does n't copyright give the right to exclude ?
asked Judge Patel .
Yes , the attorney replied , but not when the use in question is a fair use .
" If someone wants to make a copy of something they own , " Real 's lawyer went on , " do they have to pay the studios again ? "
Real argued that it did not violate the CSS license because its product not only wraps CSS around every copy made , it adds a second layer of DRM , Advanced Encryption Standard , which is " 30 septillion times harder to break " than CSS .
( The studios argue that this second layer of protection is really intended to lock consumers into Real 's own business model ) .
This case is not about security , said Real ’s lawyer -- DVDs are " safer " when they are copied with Real technology than at any other time .
The studios and DVD - CCA then presented their first witness , Marsha King , an attorney who helped craft the original CSS license .
After a lunch break , they asked Judge Patel to close the courtroom before they presented their second witness , Dr. John Kelly .
Kelly ’s testimony , they claimed , would concern the CSS technology and the DVD - CCA licensing documents , and necessarily reveal closely held trade secrets .
Greg Sandoval of CNet challenged the closure , noting that much of the technology at issue in the case was already public , and that the trial in the Kaleidescape case had been open to the public ( although a few exhibits had been sealed . )
Real also opposed closure , although not " adamantly , " calling the court 's attention to a 2004 California Supreme Court ruling which recognized that CSS technology may have lost its trade secret status .
The defendants ( with DVD - CCA taking lead ) responded that while some technology might be publicly available , the DVD - CCA technical specifications are still a closely guarded secret .
Judge Patel ordered the defendants to present any testimony that did not involve trade secrets first , and then closed the courtroom .
The hearing will resume Tuesday , April 28 , so stay tuned for further reports .

BOGOTA , Feb. 5 ( UPI ) -- Fossilized remains of a 42 - foot - long , 2,500 - pound snake discovered in northeastern Colombia represent the biggest snake ever found , scientists say .
The researchers , led by Jason Head of the University of Toronto , estimate the snake , called Titanoboa cerrejonensis , lived 58 million to 60 million years ago , the BBC reported Wednesday .

By comparison , the heaviest snakes living today , the green anacondas , weigh only about 550 pounds and reticulated pythons can reach about 32 feet long .
The researchers used the mathematical relationship between the size of vertebrae and the length of the body in living snakes to project the size of the prehistoric serpent .
" At its greatest width , the snake would have come up to about your hips .
The size is pretty amazing , " said co-author P. David Polly of Indiana University in Bloomington , Ind .
The snake fossil was found at Cerrejon , one of the world 's largest open - pit coal mines .
It was related to today 's boa constrictors .
" Probably like an anaconda , it spent a lot of time in the water , " Polly said .
" It would have needed to eat a lot .
What its prey was exactly , we do n't know .
But it probably included alligators , big fish or crocodiles . "
The researchers ' findings were reported in the Nature scientific journal .
Think about it — an inexpensive Linux PC crammed inside a wall - wart plug .
Something like this SheevaPlug could open up a whole new framework of managing and sharing data that could be accessible to the masses .

Inside the SheevaPlug you will find a 1.2GHz , ARM - based Sheeva embedded processor , 512 M bytes of FLASH , 512 M bytes of DRAM , gigabit ethernet and a USB 2.0 port .
Plug it into a wall socket and bam — a fully - functional Linux server that can store digital media accessible remotely via the internet or function as a remote print or web server .
Plus , it supports " multiple standard Linux 2.6 kernel distributions " and it operates on only 5 - watts of power .
So running and developing software for the platform should be easy ( and there should be substantial savings on your power bill ) .
Currently , open source tinkerers can get the $ 99 SheevaPlug development kit on the Marvell website .
Several products based on the design ( like the Pogoplug ) are expected to arrive in the near future with price tags ranging from $ 79 -$ 99 .
Eventually , Marvell expects the price for these devices to dip below $ 50 .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that US policy towards Cuba has failed , welcoming an offer to talk from the Cuban president .
She said the US was " taking a serious look " at how to respond to President Raul Castro 's comments , which she called an " overture " .
Mr Castro had said he was ready for discussions covering human rights , political prisoners and press freedom .
The US passed a law this week easing restrictions on Cuban Americans .
The move will allow Cuban Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and send money home more easily .
Veto threat Correspondents say a series of exchanges between the US and Cuba suggest that both sides appear to be making efforts to find a way to end their 50 - year stalemate .
We view the present policy as having failed
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
Americas leaders head for summit US President Barack Obama has said it is now up to Cuba to make the next move if relations are to be further improved .
He said the US expected Cuba to " send signals that they 're interested in liberalising " .
He also cautioned that relations would not mend " overnight " .
Mrs Clinton made her comments about Cuba in the Dominican Republic , ahead of the Summit of the Americas that begins in Trinidad and Tobago later on Friday .
" We are continuing to look for productive ways forward because we view the present policy as having failed , " she said at a press conference .
" We welcome his comments and the overture they represent , and we are taking a very serious look at how to respond , " Mrs Clinton said .
Cuba is excluded from the summit , which includes 34 members of the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) , though Latin American leaders have been calling for the communist country to be readmitted .
OAS Secretary - General Jose Miguel Insulza said on Friday he would ask the organisation 's members to readmit Cuba , 47 years after it was suspended .
Mr Insulza said he would put the proposal to a meeting of the OAS general assembly in Honduras at the end of May .
Speaking to Latin American leaders in Venezuela on Thursday , President Castro said he had sent word to the US government " in private and in public " that he is open to negotiations as long as they are " on equal terms " .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he would veto the final declaration from the OAS summit because of Cuba 's exclusion .

PALMER , Alaska , April 22 ( UPI ) --
Officials of a rural Alaskan school district said they were looking into the death of a moose that was reportedly taunted by middle school students .
The animal , which was injured when it wandered onto the grounds of Colony Middle School in Palmer , may have panicked and charged repeatedly into a wall , the Mat - Su Valley ( Alaska ) Frontiersman said Wednesday .

A spokeswoman for the Mat - Su School District told the newspaper they could not provide too many details because of student privacy standards ; however they assured the public that Monday 's incident was not being ignored .
" People will say , ' Nothing 's being done , ' " said Catherine Esary .
" That 's not true . "
Alaska State Troopers told the Frontiersman that teachers apparently did n't see the moose until after an eighth - grade physical education class had been sent outside .
A group of students apparently surrounded the animal and taunted it to the point that it threw itself into a wall repeatedly until it died .
As the World Health Organization raised its infectious disease alert level Wednesday and health officials confirmed the first death linked to swine flu inside U.S. borders , scientists studying the virus are coming to the consensus that this hybrid strain of influenza -- at least in its current form -- is not shaping up to be as fatal as the strains that caused some previous pandemics .
In fact , the current outbreak of the H1N1 virus , which emerged in San Diego and southern Mexico late last month , may not even do as much damage as the run - of - the - mill flu outbreaks that occur each winter without much fanfare .
" Let 's not lose track of the fact that the normal seasonal influenza is a huge public health problem that kills tens of thousands of people in the U.S. alone and hundreds of thousands around the world , " said Dr. Christopher Olsen , a molecular virologist who studies swine flu at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine in Madison .
His remarks came the same day Texas authorities announced that a 22 - month - old boy with the virus had died in a Houston hospital Monday .
" Any time someone dies , it 's heartbreaking for their families and friends , " Olsen said .
" But we do need to keep this in perspective . "
Flu viruses are known to be notoriously unpredictable , and this strain could mutate at any point -- becoming either more benign or dangerously severe .
But mounting preliminary evidence from genetics labs , epidemiology models and simple mathematics suggests that the worst - case scenarios are likely to be avoided in the current outbreak .
" This virus does n't have anywhere near the capacity to kill like the 1918 virus , " which claimed an estimated 50 million victims worldwide , said Richard Webby , a leading influenza virologist at St. Jude Research Hospital in Memphis , Tenn .
When it was first identified , the similarities between the 1918 flu and the current virus seemed ominous .
Both arose in the spring at the tail end of the flu season .
Both seemed to strike people who were young and healthy instead of the elderly and infants .
Both were H1N1 strains , so called because they had the same types of two key proteins that are largely responsible for a virus ' ability to infect and spread .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health published genetic sequence data Monday morning of flu samples isolated from patients in California and Texas , and thousands of scientists began downloading it immediately .
Comparisons to known killers -- such as the 1918 strain and the highly lethal H5N1 avian virus -- have since provided welcome news .
" There are certain characteristics , molecular signatures , which this virus lacks , " said Peter Palese , a microbiologist and influenza expert at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York .
In particular , the swine flu lacks an amino acid that appears to increase the number of virus particles in the lungs and make the disease more deadly .
Scientists have identified several other differences between this virus and its 1918 predecessor , but the significance of those differences is still unclear , said Dr. Scott Layne , an epidemiologist at the UCLA School of Public Health .
Ralph Tripp , an influenza expert at the University of Georgia , said his early analysis of the virus ' protein - making instructions suggests that people exposed to the 1957 flu pandemic -- which killed as many as 2 million people worldwide -- may have some immunity to the new strain .
" They looked similar enough that there could be some protection , " said Tripp , who has already received a sample of the virus to study .
That could explain why older people have been spared in Mexico , where the swine flu has been most deadly .
The swine virus does appear able to spread easily among humans , which persuaded the WHO to boost its influenza pandemic alert level to phase 5 , indicating that a worldwide outbreak of infection is very likely .
And the CDC reported on its website that " a pattern of more severe illness associated with the virus may be emerging in the United States . "
" We expect to see more cases , more hospitalizations , and , unfortunately , we are likely to see more deaths from the outbreak , " Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on her first day at work Wednesday .
But certainly nothing that would dwarf a typical flu season .
In the U.S. , between 5 percent and 20 percent of the population becomes ill and 36,000 people die -- a mortality rate of between 0.24 percent and 0.96 percent .
Dirk Brockmann , a professor of engineering and applied mathematics at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , used a computer model of human travel patterns to predict how this swine flu virus would spread in the worst - case scenario , in which nothing is done to contain the disease .
After four weeks , almost 1,700 people in the U.S. would have symptoms , including 198 in Los Angeles , according to his model .
That 's just a fraction of the county 's thousands of yearly flu victims .
Just because the virus is being identified in a growing number of places -- the list now includes Austria , Canada , Germany , Israel , New Zealand , Spain and the United Kingdom -- does n't mean it 's spreading particularly quickly , Olsen said .
" You do n't ever find anything that you do n't look for , " he said .
" Now that diagnostic laboratories and physicians and other health - care workers know to look for it , perhaps it 's not surprising that you 're going to see additional cases identified . "
And a pandemic does n't necessarily have a high fatality rate .
Even in Mexico , the fatalities may simply reflect that hundreds of thousands of people have been infected .
Since the symptoms of swine flu are identical to those of a normal flu , there 's no way to know how many cases have evaded government health officials , Webby said .
As the virus adapts to its human hosts , it is likely to find ways of spreading more efficiently .
But evolution also suggests it might become less dangerous , Olsen said .
" If it kills off all its potential hosts , you reach a point where the virus can't survive , " he said .
Working to calm public fears , federal officials repeatedly stressed Wednesday that in a normal year , some 36,000 people die from flu .
Sebelius and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also rejected calls to close the borders , which several lawmakers reiterated Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
" We are making all of our decisions based on the science and the epidemiology , " Napolitano said .
" The CDC , the public health community and the World Health Organization all have said that closing out nation 's borders is not merited here . "
Though scientists have begun to relax about the initial toll , they 're considerably less comfortable when considering the fall flu season .
They remain haunted by the experience of 1918 , when the relatively mild first wave of flu was followed several months later by a more aggressive wave .
The longer the virus survives , the more chances it has to mutate into a deadlier form .
" If this virus keep going through our summer , " Palese said , " I would be very concerned . "
Times staff writers Noam N. Levey in Washington , D.C. , Thomas H. Maugh II in Los Angeles and Ken Ellingwood in Mexico City contributed to this report .
I ca n’t stand playing in a Star Wars RPG .
The problem , as I see it , is there ’s two types of players in any Star Wars game .
There ’s the 80 % of players who have seen some or all of the movies , know who the big names are , understand some of the bigger themes and plots , or have heard about the setting , acknowledge that it ’s pretty awesome and want to play in it .
Then there ’s the 20 % that ruin it for everyone .
Not content with being intimately familiar with the setting , characters , and details , they assume your lack of your familiarity with them is some sort of character failure on your part that must be corrected , balk at breaches to cannon , and get overt thrills simply from their characters being near a touchstone of the series ( which is n’t necessarily one that casual fans would even recognize ) .
The sad part is , that when they ’re present , it ’s this uncomfortable minority that usually ends up GMing the game .
Because they lust for their Star Wars fix more than anyone else in your group , and because no one less obsessed would be able to deliver a game without it being torn to shreds by them , Star Wars is a subject dodged as if the rest of the group had rings of protection + 5 .
When the rest of the group is finally worn down enough to give in and play under Das Ubergeek , the games usually end up featuring a GMPC who is clearly the real spotlight of the game , and relying on the sheer impressiveness of being in the setting itself for most of it ’s impact on the players .
While this works nominally well if today ’s setting is one that casual fans are familiar with , when the GM dumps you on Garflagle , and expects “ You ’re on Garflagle ” to not only suffice for description , but for you to immediately understand what that means about your current goals , because it was the setting of the third series of Jedi : Rebuked novels * , then sighs and rolls their eyes like there ’s something wrong with you because you do n’t know about the secret catacombs beneath the city that their entire adventure revolved around , there ’s a problem .
Let me clarify my position : the Star Wars setting and concept is a good one , and makes an excellent setting for RPGs .
It ’s not the setting itself , but the way people act about the setting that ruins it to the point that an RPG set in a futuristic space opera centered around the struggles of good vs evil as portrayed by mystic swordsmen ( you know : like Star Wars ? ) is a preferable option to a Star Wars RPG .
Of course , the phenomenon is in no way exclusive to Star Wars .
A lot of established intellectual properties have the exact same problem .
I have friends that love the DnD DragonLance setting , and every time they run a game set in it , I ’m lost in a giant cloud of Whuh ???
because I do n’t know anything about the world , characters , or concepts .
I get excited by thoughts of playing in some of these settings , but rarely actually enjoy playing in them as much as I should for precisely this reason .
If you recognize this as a problem effecting your group do n’t despair !
Star Wars is n’t forever out of reach .
Like the majority of problems involving a bunch of grown men sit around a table pretending to be space pilots – Zoooooom !** , the # 1 contributor to this problem is poor communication and there ’s steps that can be taken to correct the problem no matter what role you play in it .
As a GM , do n’t be afraid to run Star Wars if you want to run Star Wars , and do n’t let anyone tell you how to run your game .
If you want a game that stays as true to the source material as you can , use the Ubergeek in your midst as a tool .
Ask him ( out of gaming time ) for help with source material .
He ’ll jump through hoops to share his love for all things Star Wars with you .
However , be firm that even if you make a mistake , game time is NOT the time to tell you all about it , game time is for playing and having fun , and that means fun for everyone .
If you are n’t interested in staying close to the source material , just say so .
Tell everyone that you ’re playing Star Wars , but that you have no interest in quibbling over minor details , and that they should n’t worry about them either .
If Das Ubergeek complains , explain that you want to make the game as accessible as possible for everyone so that everyone enjoys it and it lasts longer .
Do n’t let them bully you into anything .
If they ’re persistent , you have a final trump card that will shut them down : Do n’t play Star Wars .
Instead , play a space opera game using the Star Wars rules , but set in a setting of your own design ( which is suspiciously similar to the Star Wars setting ) .
By switching settings , you can focus on the parts of the setting that everyone loves ( In fact , polling your players to find exactly what parts they like and focusing specifically on those can be a big help anyway , Star Wars is very complex . ) while ignoring all the stuff no one likes * cough gungans !* and all the nit picking that might arise .
As a player , your options are more limited .
Communicate clearly , but not offensively , what you do and do n’t like about the way the game is going .
If arguments about the distance between Hoth and Daruda * are taking over half your game session , bring it up .
If you were badgered into not buying a blaster pistol for your wookie because you did n’t want to listen to the half - hour rant on how wookies should stay pure to the original vision , bring that up too .
You should be able to have fun and play how you want to play .
If the rest of the players and / or GM wo n’t support you , and you ’re honestly not having fun , maybe it ’s best to sit out the rest of that campaign .
No one deserves to sit frustrated , annoyed , and bored because someone else wants their vision of an iconic setting forced on everyone else in the room .
If you ’re a fan of Star Wars , and yet your group never plays it , take a good hard look at yourself .
Are you the one with the problem ?
Try asking friends you trust .
It ’s not a forgone conclusion , so do n’t immediately assume it ’s you , but be honest with yourself .
And if you are the source , remember that relaxing on some of the details from time to time means you get to play more often .
Ask a buddy to nudge you every time you get too worked up over something no one else could care less about and the game will go better .
I promise it could be worse .
* As far as I know , that ’s all made up .
** Sad how our hobbies can be summed up , is n’t it ?
Zooooom ! borrowed from Andrew .
Franken wants Coleman to pay his legal costs in recount case Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday March 18 , 2009
Print This Email This Under mounting attorney fees in a case that could possibly stretch on for months , Democrat Al Franken is seeking to recoup some of his legal costs from Republican Norm Coleman , who filed suit to overturn the results of January 's Minnesota Senate recount .
In legal documents filed on Tuesday that summarize his side of the case , Franken asked the Minnesota state judges who heard the U.S. Senate trial to require his Republican opponent to pay court costs and some opposing attorneys ' fees if Coleman is unsuccessful in his lawsuit , according to a report from The Star Tribune .
The Tribune reports that Franken wants the Coleman campaign to pay the costs of the seven - week recount trial ( certified recount results had Franken leading by 225 votes ) .
Additionally in seeking " reasonable costs and attorneys ' fees " for the former SNL comedian 's lawyers , the document refers to sanctions that the judges earlier imposed on Coleman for not following court rules on disclosing information about a witness .
The witness was Minnesota election judge Pamela Howell , a Republican .
According to another report by The Star Tribune , she was dismissed from court because of undisclosed documents she provided to the Coleman campaign where she claimed votes were double - counted in Minneapolis .
Her testimony , though , was entered into court as evidence .
As of February , Franken was heavily outspending Coleman in terms of legal costs .
A report by The Am Law Daily had Franken outspending Coleman by a margin of 6 to 1 .
While Coleman 's campaign spent $ 105,000 on attorneys in the recount , according to The Daily 's report , Franken paid out approximately $ 661,000 in attorney fees .
Even if Franken 's case is upheld in Minnesota state court and the judges are so inclined to grant his request to recoup legal costs , the Coleman camp could forestall further by taking their suit to federal court , which they are already making strong noises about doing with the support of some top Senate Republicans .
The GOP is hoping to apply the ruling of the Supreme Court in 2000 in Bush v. Gore by arguing that Minnesota counties were in violation of the Constitution 's equal protection clause by using differing methods of counting absentee ballots .
 The Supreme Court in 2000 said in Bush v. Gore that there is an equal protection element of making sure there is a uniform standard by which votes are counted or not counted , and I think that s a very serious concern in this instance ,  said Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in a Tuesday Politico article .
 Im not making any predictions , but I wouldnt be surprised  if it ended up in federal court . "

The temperature seems to drop by 20 degrees when Mike Tyson and his minders enter the room .
" Have I got to be nice to this guy ? " he asks the film - maker James Toback .
" No , " Toback replies .
" You can be as hostile as you like . "
Yet Tyson does n't seem to have the energy to muster up much hostility .
He is wearing a baggy pinstripe suit that fails to disguise what 's going on underneath .
His belly squeezes out of his black shirt , and he can barely drag his size 15 feet along with him .
His almost - beard , white flecked , is more oversight than design .
His head slumps to the side as if his massive pit bull neck can't quite bear its weight .
Everything is such an effort .
He speaks quietly , lethargically , like a man who has been on a heavy dose of antidepressants for too long .
His Maori facial tattoo , once so warrior - like , looks benign today .
He could be Lennie in Of Mice And Men , the half - gentle giant who strokes the things he loves to death .
" Hello , legend , " I say .
Tyson looks confused , uneasy , says he does n't take compliments well .
But , for good or bad , Mike Tyson is a legend .
Many experts would argue that he was the greatest heavyweight boxing champion - or at least should have been .
Sure , he did n't have Muhammad Ali's wit or grace , but as a knockout puncher , none could match Iron Mike .
He won his first 19 professional fights by a knockout , he was the youngest world heavyweight champion at 20 , unbeaten in three years , so far ahead of the pack that there were no rivals .
Then things started to go wrong .
His wife , the actor Robin Givens , went on television in 1988 alongside him and announced that he was a terrifying manic depressive and that their marriage was pure hell .
In 1990 he lost his first fight to 42 - 1 underdog Buster Douglas .
He 'd become lazy and complacent , seduced by alcohol and drugs .
In 1992 he was convicted of rape and deviant sexual misconduct , and served three years in jail .
It should have destroyed him , and he might well argue that it did , but , amazingly , within a year of his release he regained his world title .
Then , once again , he chucked it all away .
Since retiring four years ago , Tyson has done little with his life .
He has boxed in a few exhibitions , put on more weight , got in trouble with the law again : in 2007 , he was convicted of drink - driving after almost crashing into a police car .
Three bags of cocaine were found on him , and he was given a day in jail , three years ' probation and ordered into rehab .
That is when Toback , an old friend , asked Tyson , now 42 , if he could make a film about his life .
The result is extraordinary - pretty much a 90 - minute monologue , some of it stream of consciousness .
What emerges is a man who finds it impossible to censor himself .
He talks vividly about growing up with a promiscuous mother who might have been a prostitute and about a father he never knew , stealing drugs from dealers as a 12 - year - old , detention centre and being taken under the wing of the boxing coach Cus D'Amato , all while he was barely into his teens .
Tyson is not a man who went off the rails .
He was born on the skids .
Somehow , and all too briefly , he managed to transcend his traumatic destiny .
We arrange to meet in the Hollywood Hills at the opulent house of another film - maker friend , Brett Ratner .
There are Warhols in the loo , Bacons in the kitchen , Giacomettis on the sideboard , Toback at the centre of the conversation , but as yet no Tyson .
" We could be here a while - Mike 's been held up . "
Toback and his entourage grin at each other .
It 's not the first time the boxer has delayed them .
Toback is disarmingly honest about why Tyson makes such a great subject .
" The movie is like the aftermath of an earthquake .
It 's Mike standing there amid the rubble and wondering why he has survived .
Ultimately , what I feel comes through is a struggle to justify his continuing existence because the highlights of his life are gone .
Usually tragedy ends in death , but here 's a tragic figure who has survived .
And now that I 'm here , what do I do ? "
Their friendship goes back 23 years .
Toback , an experimental film - maker obsessed with all things sexual , had just finished making The Pick - Up Artist with Robert Downey Jr when Tyson popped into the wrap party .
" He was 18 , had n't become world champion yet .
He 'd heard about the orgies in [ American footballer ]
Jim Brown 's house and he was like , ' Tell me about those orgies . ' "
Then there were the acid trips .
Toback felt that young Tyson was almost too curious .
Tyson arrives a couple of hours late .
Years ago , there would have been dozens in his entourage , now there are only three .
One stands over me , legs splayed , eyeballing me as I talk to Tyson .
It 's intimidating , but also quite funny - rather than protecting Tyson , he seems to be making sure I do n't escape .
It 's a hot winter 's day in LA .
We are in the garden , the sun is beating and a rivulet of sweat is running down Tyson 's nose .
I ask what he has learned about himself from the film .
" When I watched it alone , I realised why people had certain opinions about me .
When I was upset , I got upset like everybody else , but I 'm an extremist , so when I got upset , I took it to the next level .
I took it to the level of being almost violently upset .
And I realise , if I was sitting next to that guy , he 'd make me nervous .
That guy was impulsive .
Unpredictable . "
He wants to believe - he has to believe - that is the old Tyson .
What shocked him most ?
" I thought I was a dick when I was crying . "
This is Tyson the macho man speaking , wary of losing face in front of his buddies .
But that 's one of the most moving moments in the film , I say - he 's talking about how he was bullied as a boy .
" Well , that 's your opinion , of course .
Only . "
He talks quietly , with that familiar lisp , but the answer carries a hint of menace .
As a boy , Tyson was small , fat and bespectacled , weak with asthma and alone but for the pigeons he bought with stolen money .
When kids picked on him , he just ran away .
One day an older bully took one of his pigeons and popped its neck in front of him .
That was the first time Tyson hit out .
He surprised himself because he was good at fighting , enjoyed it , found it empowering .
After that , he says , people wanted to be his friend .
" I'm a good guy , I 'm a good brother .
There 's nothing wrong with me .
Just do n't push me too far , you know .
I 'm sure everyone has a breaking point in their lives . "
It 's hard to know whether he 's addressing the old bullies or me .
Tyson 's speech has a hypnotic , incantatory rhythm to it .
It was D'Amato who transformed his life .
After being picked up by police at 12 with $ 1,500 in his pockets , Tyson was sent to a detention centre , where he learned to box .
On his release he was put in touch with D'Amato , a Bronx - born coach in his 70s who had discovered Rocky Marciano and Floyd Patterson .
D'Amato welcomed him into his home , fed him , educated him , trained him , disciplined him , loved him .
Tyson had never known anybody like this .
The two became inseparable .
" Me and Cus were two megalomaniacs sitting there talking about our future , what we could do .
You understand ?
Two guys - we did n't have anything - talking about what we could do .
I imagine myself being 13 , 14 , watching a great fighter fight , talking about why he is a great fighter , and asking Cus , ' Cus , how could I beat that guy if I was to fight him ?
What would you tell me to do to beat that guy ? ' " D'Amato told him that becoming a champion was more a mental and spiritual discipline than a physical one .
In 1982 , aged 14 , Tyson went to the junior Olympics and broke any number of records , including the fastest knockout ( eight seconds ) .
D'Amato told him he need n't worry about being bullied again , and Tyson knew he was right .
He chokes on his tears .
" Coz I knew I would fuckin ' kill them if they fucked with me . "
The most important thing he learned , he says , is that he was n't dependent on others for his survival .
" I did n't need to take the handouts .
It was just psychological motivation , refusing to accept what you had always accepted , refusing to accept welfare , refusing to accept being bullied any more , refusing to live your life unlawfully . "
As he talks , the who man minutes ago was paralysed by uncertainty radiates a frightening conviction .
" I took it to extreme levels .
Success is something you work hard at , you put your nose to the grindstone and you do everything you can .
You 're hungry , you 're grinding , and you 're still not guaranteed success .
So I took it to another level .
I said , I 'm going to die to get this .
I 'm going to dedicate my whole life to it .
Second place is not going to do it , I 'm going to be champion .
And being champion is not going to do it , I have to be the champion that nobody will ever forget to the end of this planet . "
Millions dream of being champion .
Did it feel good being one of the few who succeeded ?
The diffidence returns : " That 's where it gets complex .
It gets tricky .
I think anybody can do it because I do n't think much of myself .
I think if I can do it , anybody can do it . "
The trouble is , he says , he hears so many voices in his head , and they are so often at war with each other .
I ask if he feels more pride for the great things he achieved or shame for the bad things .
" I do n't know .
Both become irrelevant .
By thinking about the bad things , I start to feel really low and depressed .
When I start to think about the good things , I just get pride and egotistical .
So I try to leave them both alone . "
Maybe the great tragedy in Tyson 's life is that by the time he became world champion , D'Amato had died .
He lost his moral compass and found himself surrounded by acolytes who encouraged his excess .
He bought houses by the dozen , he had more than 130 cars , he bought lavish gifts ( usually cars and jewellery ) for women who had sweet - talked him for a couple of minutes .
At his peak , he could command $ 30 m for a night 's work , and he earned more than $ 300 m in his career .
By 2003 , he was bankrupt .
Now , he worries the film might be too successful and he will end up with " too much money and pussy " again .
" It 's pretty dangerous .
I become accustomed to it . "
He has either had no money or a ridiculous amount in his life , and he feels safer with none .
Does he miss the drama of his old life ?
" No , I was addicted to drama . "
In the film he calls Desiree Washington , the woman he was convicted of raping , " that wretched swine of a woman " and insists he was not guilty .
Yet he talks explicitly , often alarmingly , about his sexual preferences and how he has treated women .
" I like strong women , not necessarily masculine women , say a woman who runs an organisation , I like a woman with massive confidence and then I want to dominate her sexually .
I like to watch her like a tiger watches their prey after they wound them .
I want her to keep her distance for at least 20 - 30 minutes before I devour them and take them to the point of ecstasy .
I love saying no when making love .
What I want is extreme .
Normally what they want is not as extreme as what I want .
I want to ravish them .
Completely ...
I may have taken advantage of women before , but I never took advantage of her [ Washington ] . "
At times Tyson paints himself as a victim - of circumstance , of liggers , of women on the make - but in the end he says he has nobody to blame but himself .
I say that the strength of the film is he does n't absolve himself : " You say you did n't do the rape , but you did some bad things to women . "
" I know .
The fact is , I 'm not trying to win no friends .
I do n't want you to think I 'm doing this to try to get a clean - up job , or I want people to like me .
I do n't care . "
It 's true , you do n't feel he 's trying to pull the wool over your eyes .
Tyson shakes his troubled head .
" No ... sometimes my mind tells me , you think you 've got these white people fooled , that they like you - you 're a fucking fraud . "
Now he 's talking with visceral intensity .
" My mind is not my friend : ' You 're a fraud , you 're trying to fool these white people . '
And I have to contain that .
That 's the addict talking .
That 's the guy who wants to get high .
The guy who wants to drink the Hennessy , the guy who wants to gallivant in the street with a bunch of crude women , that 's that guy talking right now .
That 's not you talking , Mike . "
He pauses , the sweat dripping from his head .
" When you go to a doctor or a psychiatrist , and they say , ' Do you hear voices ? ' of course we say no , because if you say , I hear voices , they go , ' Have that guy straitjacketed ' and you go to hospital .
But we do hear voices .
Our mind does tell us things .
So your mind is not your friend if you do n't discipline it and control it . "
He tries hard now to filter his thoughts , but he worries that it 's a form of lying .
Thankfully , he says , he does n't have the same intensity of feeling any more .
Maybe the antidepressants have made things easier .
In 2001 , he told reporters , " I 'm on the Zoloft to keep me from killing y'all . "
When Tyson went into rehab in 2007 , he admitted being addicted to cocaine and alcohol .
" I 'll never beat that .
That 's going to be a till - the - day - I - die job .
That 's an inside job .
Nothing to do with anything else .
That 's just a disease I have received hereditarily . "
" Simon , keep the questions to the movie , " says a minder .
" We do n't want to talk about stuff . "
" OK , I 'm sorry , " Tyson replies meekly , but then goes on to ignore him .
" Listen , I 'll talk about anything .
I 'm not ashamed of who I am .
I understand I 've got to be sold in a certain way , but I 'm not ashamed of anything I 've done in my life .
After all , my journey , I know who I am .
And I 'm cool with who I am . "
For a second , he believes it .
But there are so many incidents in his life that he knows he can't begin to justify .
On his release from prison in 1995 , by now a Muslim with the name Malik Abdul Aziz and his body tattooed with images of Mao and Che Guevara , he launched the following tirade on a reporter who suggested he should be in a straitjacket .
" I 'll put your mother in a straitjacket , you punk - ass white boy .
Come here and tell me that , and I 'll fuck you in your ass , you punk white boy , you faggot ...
I 'll eat your asshole alive , you bitch ...
You scared , coward , you 're not man enough to fuck with me , you can't last two minutes in my world , bitch .
Look at you , scared now , you ho .
Scared like a little white pussy , scared of the real man .
I 'll fuck you till you love me , faggot . "
It did n't help his protestations of innocence .
After being headbutted by Evander Holyfield in 1997 , he bit off part of the boxer 's ear in the rematch seven months later and spat it out into the ring .
Tyson was fined a maximum $ 3 m and had his licence revoked .
But boxing needed Tyson as much as he needed boxing , and a year later he was given a final opportunity .
By now , though , he had lost the pace , accuracy and hunger .
His sense of fair play had also gone for a burton .
In 1999 , he was accused of trying to break Frans Botha 's arms in the ring .
That same year he was sentenced to a year 's imprisonment after assaulting two motorists following a traffic accident .
On his release , he fought Orlin Norris and knocked him down after the bell rang .
A win in 2000 over Andrzej Golota was overturned when Tyson tested positive for marijuana .
His second wife , Monica Turner , the mother of two of his six children , divorced him in 2003 .
In his final fight , against the journeyman boxer Kevin McBride , he was a pitiful figure - slumped in a corner , legs splayed , unable or unwilling to stand himself up .
Straight afterwards , Tyson announced his retirement .
" I do n't have the stomach for this kind of thing any more .
I do n't have that ferocity .
I 'm not an animal any more .
I 'm not going to disrespect the sport by losing to this calibre of fighter . "
When he talks about biting Holyfield 's ear or beating up boxing promoter Don King in public , for example , he simply says he was insane .
Does he think the boxing led to that type of instability ?
" Boxing is nothing to do with madness , it 's all about control and discipline .
Madness has nothing to do with it .
It 's what you do with the discipline , it can drive you mad , but it depends on the individual , whether they allow it to drive them mad . "
Today , Tyson lives by himself in a modest house in Las Vegas .
A friend , Darryl , spends a lot of time with him and manages his affairs .
His great hope for the future is that he catches up with his children , and becomes the kind of father he should have been years ago .
" They never had a chance to hang out with me , like all these freeloaders did .
' Dad 's an awesome guy , he 's a fun guy , he 's a goofy guy , he likes to make people laugh , he likes to buy gifts for people and stuff ' - I never experienced that with them .
I 've worked hard all my life to give them a great life , and I never enjoy it with them .
They get to go on all these great trips to Europe , and I should be with them . "
Are they seeing a different you , the goofy guy ?
" I do n't know - they tell me that I 'm funny .
Ha !
I do n't know .
I 'm just glad my 11 - year - old kid does n't have to live the life I did when I was 11 . "
Does he box ?
" Oh man , no , this guy 's an erudite , he 's not a boxer . "
And if he got into boxing ?
" Let him go .
There 's nothing more humbling .
Trust me , he 'd become humble . "
Why ?
" Because it 's for uniquely special individuals to do that stuff .
You know , you got to strike a guy , you 've got to attack the guy , but you 're not mad at them , they did n't say nothing bad about your mother , then you 're going and your objective is to dismantle him . "
Looking back , he says , perhaps the biggest problem was achieving so much so young .
" If you want to see a tragedy , just take a kid who 's 19 , 20 years old - some kid from the hood who 's got some talent - and give them $ 50 m .
I did n't know what to do .
By society 's standards , you reach that level and people bow down to you .
I never understood that . "
Is there a danger in people treating you as a god ?
" No , there 's a danger in that I might believe it .
It 's not dangerous that they say it .
It depends what side of the bed I wake up on , I might believe it , then it 's all downhill again , and I 'm in for a big crash . "
Moments later he 's über - man , telling me just what made him a winner : he turned apparent disadvantages ( such as his height : 5ft 11in , short for a heavyweight ) into pluses ( surprising challengers with his upward punching ) ; he won fights before they started by staring out the opposition .
" When you look at me , you think I 'm a tough guy .
I 'm not a tough guy .
I 'm a smart guy .
This is not a tough guy 's sport .
A tough guy gets hurt in this sport .
This is a thinking man 's sport .
You see what happens to the tough guys ; you see how they start talking , you see how they start looking .
Later , they become more decrepit .
This is serious stuff at the highest level .
This is a brutal game . "
What does he think D'Amato would say to him if he saw the film and knew how his life had panned out ?
" ' You swear too much ! ' " He grins .
" I never swore in front of him . "
A while later , Toback calls me over , and asks me to look at the film 's trailer .
It 's early evening , the sun is setting and the sky is a salmon pink .
The trailer is book - ended by Tyson quoting Oscar Wilde 's The Ballad Of Reading Gaol :
Yet each man kills the thing he loves
By each let this be heard ,
Some do it with a bitter look ,
Some with a flattering word ,
The coward does it with a kiss ,
The brave man with a sword !
Tyson says it was Toback 's idea to read the poem , but he is a fan of Wilde's .
" Do you know who his lover was ? " he asks .
" The Marquess of Queensberry 's son , and you know it was the Marquess of Queensberry who invented the rules of boxing .
How strange is that ? "
He seems exhausted .
By the afternoon , by his life , by his mind , by everything .
He says he thinks it is unlikely he will ever have anything to do with boxing again .
I ask why he has n't considered television commentary .
He thinks some time before answering .
" I am ashamed of so many of the things I have done . "
In boxing or in his private life ?
" In the ring , too . "
It 's not so long ago that he told me there was nothing he was ashamed of .
He smiles , and points to his head , suggesting that the last thing you should ever expect from Mike Tyson is consistency .
" There 's a committee going on up there . "
And he laughs , a little desperately .
" A committee !
A committee going on up there !
Oh God help me ! "
• The film Tyson is released on Friday 27 March 2009
April 29 , 2009  -- Students and parents at two Wisconsin public high schools are suing the school district to prevent this June 's graduation ceremonies from being held inside a local mega church .
A lawsuit filed last week by Americans United for Separation of Church and State on behalf of nine students and parents in the Elmbrook , Wisc. , school district , claims that conducting graduation ceremonies in a place of worship violates the Constitution and makes some attendees feel uncomfortable .
" Students literally have to walk up under a giant cross to get their diplomas , " said Americans United 's Executive Director Barry Lynn .
The graduation ceremonies for Brookfield Central High School and Brookfield East High School , the two schools named in the suit , are set to take place at the 3,200 - seat Elmbook Church on June 6 and 7 .
" It 's not an appropriate venue for a multi-cultural and multi-religious community , " said Lynn .
None of the nine plaintiffs have been identified publically to prevent " social ostracism , " according to the suit .
A lawyer for Americans United declined to make them available to ABCNews.com for an interview .
The suit , filed in federal court in Milwaukee , is seeking a court order that would force the two schools to find an alternative venue for the graduation ceremonies .
One plaintiff , identified in the complaint as a senior set to graduate in Elmbrook Church this spring , said in court papers that seeing his older sibling graduate in the church made him feel " uncomfortable and upset . "
" Photographs from that graduation include the cross , and serve as a permanent reminder of the discomfort that the ceremony 's location caused , " the students claim in the complaint .
Another plaintiff in the suit reported feeling " unwelcome " and " like an outsider " during a past graduation ceremony at the church because of the presence of Bibles and hymnals in the pews .
The complaint also notes the " immense " size of the cross that hangs in the church and the fact that it " appears directly in attendees ' line of sight . "
Heather Weaver , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union 's religion program , which is not involved in this case , told ABCNews.com that graduations should not be held in churches when there are other workable options .
" When there are suitable alternative venues as appears to be the case here , public school students should not have to go to church to take part in the final event of their high school careers , " said Weaver .
" The school district has the responsibility that all students of all faiths or no faith can attend without feeling religiously pressured , " said Weaver .
Matt Gibson , the Elmbrook School District superintendent , told ABCNews.com that Elmbrook Church was originally chosen by students themselves after they requested the ceremonies be moved out of the schools – which had a limited amount of space for guests – and into an alternative venue with air - conditioning and handicapped accessibility .
" The students asked their principals if they could check out some other locations for their graduations and the principal said yes , " said Gibson .
" They looked at a variety of locations , and the one they settled on was the church 's auditorium . "
This scouting process has occurred every year since 2000 at Central High School and since 2002 at East High School .
The church has been chosen each year as the venue for the graduation .
The first year the graduation was held at the non-denominational Christian church , Gibson said that the 15 - to 20 - foot tall cross that is noted in several of the plaintiff 's complaints was obscured .
" The first year we held graduation at Elmbrook they veiled the cross , " said Gibson .
" Then the church decided that they would n't do that anymore and they would only remove temporary things – such as banners that are religious in nature but that can be put back up after graduation . "
Mel Lawrenz , the senior pastor at Elmbrook Church , argues that the cross was never purposely veiled but was rather hidden by graduation decorations that were relocated in the following years so that the cross would be in full view .
Asked whether the church would be willing to veil the cross during this year 's graduation ceremony , Lawrenz said that covering the cross would be " an insult to the identity of the church . "
" Elmbrook Church has always tried to be a good neighbor and a resource to the community , " said Lawrenz .
" A wide variety of schools and other organizations have asked to use the Elmbrook facility for graduations , music events , and other community functions , and over the years we have heard widespread gratitude by these many groups for what they were able to accomplish in the facility . "
" To cover the cross becomes more of a negative statement than accomplishing anything really practical , " said Lawrenz .
" Everybody knows a church building is being used . "
Sarah Mucek , a 2001 graduate of Brookfield Central , said that she remembers the cross being " pretty visible " during her graduation .
" From my perspective , the facility was a church but the ceremony was completely secular and focused on the high school , " said Mucek .
" It did not mention any denomination or the church itself , so for me there was no problem . "
Mucek said that while she does see where some people could take issue with the ceremony occurring in a church , she said that the way the facilities were used by the school were " nothing but welcoming and inclusive . "
The church is also the nicest place in the area to host the event , according to Mucek .
" The church is absolutely the biggest venue in the area , " she said .
" If we did it at the school it would have had to be in the cafeteria and the facilities at Elmbrook are so much nicer . "
Gibson said that there have always been a " handful " of complaints regarding the religious setting for public schools ' graduation , but said that the Elmbrook Church remains the most sensible choice .
" I view this as a practical matter , " said Gibson .
" Questions have been raised periodically through the years by a handful of people and I do n't discount them , I take them seriously .
But the majority of students are OK with the church and as long as it's constitutional . "
Gibson said the cost of holding the ceremonies at the church , which about $ 2,000 per school according to court documents , is on par with what it would cost to pay janitors overtime and crews for setting up and breaking down seating if the schools were to host the graduations at their respective campuses .
Students have consistently chosen the church for their graduations because it has more space and amenities than any of the other local options , including an exhibition center with half the number of seats as Elmbrook .
The church 's 3,200 - person capacity lets each student invite an unlimited number of guests .
Graduating classes at the schools range from 350 to 400 students .
Gibson says that both schools are constructing improved gymnasiums that will have similar amenities as the church and are to be completed well before the next year 's graduations .
" We 've stated to people that we 'll be moving the graduations back on campus in 2010 , " said Gibson .
Jay Sekulow , the chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice , a conservative civil liberties law firm that is dedicated to protecting religious freedoms , said that this is the first lawsuit of this kind that he 's seen , despite the fact that many public high schools nationwide have traditionally used church property for graduation ceremonies .
Sekulow said that he believes American United 's lawsuit is " ridiculous " and that constitutionally , there is no problem holding the graduation in a church .
" If this was a worship service for a public school then clearly there would be a problem , " said Sekulow .
" But it 's not , a school is just using it for convenience . "
" To those who say they 're uncomfortable they 're in a free country , " said Sekulow .
" They 're going to see and hear things that they do n't like , that 's the price of freedom . "
Although I ’ve never come up short in the crazy category , there are some gastronomical indulgences that even I refuse to make at home .
You see , a lot of what drags me into the kitchen is a complaint : I find something dissatisfying in its availability , quality or it brings me ennui .
But items on my list of cooking refusals fall into none of these categories , and that ’s why I ’ll gladly leave the sausage , sushi and bagel making to others in this great city .
Oh , except that last one .
Because you see , there is one thing that bothers me about bagels is that they ’re too big .
There ’s just no reason to eat 7 ounces of bread for breakfast .
I end up glutted and then hungry three hours later .
Yes , yes , yes , I know , just eat half of one , and while that ’s a bright - minded suggestion , there is also the fact that Peter Reinhart ’s bagel recipe has been calling my name since I bought the book last winter , which just about brings us to last Friday .
I followed the recipe to the letter , beginning the process on Friday night and finishing it on Saturday , yet although the bagels were gorgeous and smelled wonderful , I was a bit disappointed .
They were so chewy , crispy and tough on the outside and soft on the inside and a bit unlike the bagels I was used to .
And this is where SantaDad steps in , who sent me this email on Sunday , after trying one of my bagels the night before .
The memories are fuzzy , but it was back in the mid ’ 40 ’s and early 50’s .
We ( my Dad and I ) used to go to the local bakery on Sunday mornings for bagels and Jewish rye / corn bread .
It was right around the corner … the first of what would ultimately be a chain : Zaro’s .
In fact , Phil Zaro , one of the two brothers that owned the bakery was our upstairs neighbor in our apartment building .
I always wondered why we could n’t get bagels during the week .
My father explained that there was only one bagel bakery in NY ( probably the nation ) .
It was located on an island in the East River .
I imagine it was the island where the Queensborough Bridge crosses .
Anyway , the bakery only made bagels on Saturday nights after Shabbat .
The local retail bakeries would go to the bagel “ factory ” early on Sunday mornings and pick up their weekly orders .
There was real consistency in bagels then … no surprise since they all came from the same place .
There were only two kinds of bagels , plain and egg .
None of this cranberry , raisin , chocolate chip stuff .
The bagels were more chewy than bagels today ( which are very bready . )
They were sort of crisp on the outside , and soft but chewy on the inside .
More like an intermediate between today ’s bagels and bialys .
Bialys then were like rubber .
The bialys sold today are more like what we then called “ onion rolls . ”
Then , sometime in the 50’s people started opening bagel shops and bagels became available 365 days a year .
…. and the decline started .
I imagine it was like the proliferation of pizza joints .
Everyone thought they knew how to make bagels ( pizza ) and no one had the memory of what they really were like originally .
One who was old enough , would probably say that bagels from THE East River bagel bakery had no resemblance to the bagels in eastern Europe where they probably originated .
( An aside : I think “ bialys ” are named after the town Bialistok ( sp ? ) in Poland . )
Since Phil Zaro was about 25 years older than I am , it is likely that his stores are now run by his children or grandchildren .
He did n’t have children back then as well as I can remember , so his children would also be about 10 years younger than I am .
If this is true , it ’s possible that the memory of what bagels were was lost in that generation … a reason why Zaro ’s bagels today are nothing like the East River bagels of yesterday .
I do remember having bagels in Israel on one of my trips , but they were nothing like the bagels in 1940 ’s NYC .
The Israeli bagels were large and bready … good , but just not bagels .
Having said all this , I just want you to know that your bagels last night were the closest thing I have ever had to the original bagels of my childhood .
It ’s a good thing that they are so much work to make , since otherwise they could easily be the undoing of my Atkins program .
GOOD BAGELS !!!!
And that , my friends , is the final word .
Peter Reinhart ’s Bagels
Adpated from The Bread Baker ’s Apprentice
Hoo boy , there are a lot of notes for this one , so you might want to skim ahead to the end first .
Otherwise , these are utterly glorious as - is , chewy with a crispy and tough exterior and a soft , flavorful interior .
I have it on good authority that these are as good as , if not better , than the Old School variety .

2 teaspoons malt powder or 1 tablespoon dark or light malt syrup , honey , or brown sugar ( see note below )
To Finish
1 tablespoon baking soda
Cornmeal or semolina flour for dusting
Sesame seeds , poppy seeds , kosher salt , rehydrated dried minced garlic or onions ( Deb note : this was what I chose , and found the taste very authentic ) , or chopped onions that have been tossed in oil ( optional )
1 . Day one :
To make the sponge , stir the yeast into the flour in a 4 - quart mixing bowl .
Add the water , whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth , sticky batter ( like pancake batter ) .
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours , or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly .
It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop .
2 . To make the dough , in the same mixing bowl ( or in the bowl of an electric mixer ) , add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir .
Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt .
Stir ( or mix on low speed with the dough hook ) until the ingredients for a ball , slowly working in the remaining 3/ 4 cup flour to stiffen the dough .
3 . Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes ( or for 6 minutes by machine ) .
The dough should be firm , stiffer than French bread dough , but still pliable and smooth .
There should be no raw flour – all ingredients should be hydrated .
The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77 to 71 degrees F .
If the dough seems to dry and rips , add a few drops of water and continue kneading .
If the dough seems tacky or sticky , add more flour to achieve the stiffness required .
The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky .
4 . Immediately divide the dough into 4 1 / 2 ounce pieces for standard bagels , or smaller if desired ( Deb note : I used 2.25 ounce pieces , and yes , I weighed them because I wanted them to bake evenly ) .
Form the pieces into rolls .
5 . Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes .
6. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil .
Proceed with one of the following shaping methods :
Method 1 : Poke a hole in a ball of bagel dough and gently rotate your thumb around the inside of the hole to widen it to approximately 2 1/2 inches in diameter ( half of this for a mini- bagel ) .
The dough should be as evenly stretched as possible ( try to avoid thick and thin spots . )
Method 2 : Roll out the dough into an 8 - inch long rope .
( This may require rolling part of the way and resting if the pieces are too elastic and snap back , in which case , allow them to rest for 3 minutes and then extend them again to bring to full length .
Wrap the dough around the palm and back of your hand , between the thumb and forefinger , overlapping the ends by several inches .
Press the overlapping ends on the counter with the palm of your hand , rocking back and forth to seal .
7 . Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pans ( Deb note : I got away with 1 - inch space for the minis ) .
Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and slip each pan into a food - grade plastic bag , or cover loosely with plastic wrap .
Let the pans sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes .
8 . Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the “ float test ” .
Fill a small bowl with cool or room - temperature water .
The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water .
Take one bagel and test it .
If it floats , immediately return the tester bagel to the pan , pat it dry , cover the pan , and place it in the refrigerator overnight ( it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days ) .
If the bagel does not float .
Return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature , checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats .
The time needed to accomplish the float will vary , depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough .
9 . The following day ( or when you are ready to bake the bagels ) , preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven .
Bring a large pot of water to a boil ( the wider the pot the better ) , and add the baking soda ( and optionally , a few tablespoons of barley syrup , see Note at the end ) .
Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby .
10 .
Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water , boiling only as many as comfortably fit ( they should float within 10 seconds ) .
After 1 minutes flip them over rand boil for another minute .
If you like very chewy bagels , you can extend the boiling to 2 minutes per side ( Deb note : I used the 2 minute option ) .
While the bagels are boiling , sprinkle the same parchment - lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour .
( If you decide to replace the paper , be sure to spray the new paper lightly with spray oil to prevent the bagels from sticking to the surface . )
If you want to top ( see note below ) the bagels , do so as soon as they come out of the water .
You can use any of the suggestions in the ingredients list or a combination .
11 . When all the bagels have been boiled , place the pans on the 2 middle shelves in the oven .
Bake for approximately 5 minutes , then rotate the pans , switching shelves and giving the pans a 180 - degree rotation .
( If you are baking only 1 pan , keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees . )
After the rotation , lower the oven setting to 450 degrees F and continue baking for about 5 minutes , or until the bagels turn light golden brown .
You may bake them darker if you prefer .
( Deb note : I actually baked them quite a bit longer , often almost five extra minutes .
I judge by color , not internal temperature , in this case .
I did not lower the oven temperature because I had multiple batches to bake . )
12 . Remove the pans from the oven and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving .
Cinnamon Raisin Bagels :
For cinnamon raisin bagels , increase the yeast in the final dough to 1 teaspoon , and add 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon and 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar to the final dough .
Rinse 2 cups of loosely packed raisins with warm water to wash off surface sugar , acid , and natural wild yeast .
Add the raisins during the final 2 minutes of mixing .
Proceed as directed , but do not top the bagels with any garnishes .
When they come out of the oven and are still hot , you can brush the tops with melted butter and dip them in cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon - sugar crust , if desired .
Notes :
In his introduction to bagels , Reinhart mentions two ingredients that are not exactly ordinary , but completely essential to the bagel texture and flavor .
The first is barley malt powder or syrup , more for that typical bagel shop flavor than anything else , and something that was readily available at Whole Foods and a bunch of other stores .
Sadly , I cannot tell you if this ingredient is as essential as he said because I woke up with a startle at 7 a.m. the next morning , “ Oh my god I forgot to add the barley syrup ! ”
Do n’t you hate it when that happens ?
Later , I read a recipe that suggested you add the barley syrup to the boiling water bath , and I did so in my later batches , figuring it would n’t hurt to get the flavor in somewhere .
I ended up feeling that these bagels had a slightly darker , and more stereotypically - bagel color than the earlier batches , so I am adding this as an optional step .
The second is high gluten flour , a step above the extra gluten in bread flour .
( Though he says regular bread flour will work in a jam , I ’m used to getting top - notch bagels , and was convinced I ’d be able to tell the difference . )
This can be ordered online or available in a specialty store ( though I could n’t come up with one in NYC that had it ) .
Or , you can beg your local bagel shop for some of theirs , and given that the other two options would take time and energy , I turned to our beloved Murray ’s on 8th Avenue .
They came through , and then some , and I am now the proud own of some ten pounds of super - high gluten flour , and a sinking feeling that I ’ll be making bagels again or some very tough cookies ( bah ! ) this winter .
The crazy , it keeps coming .
I had difficulties getting my seeds and onion bits to stick to the top of the bagels .
Though the recipe does not call for an egg wash , I would definitely use one next time to get them to stick , after the boiling and before the baking .
These pictures were taken with a film camera !
Our camera had a mishap ( we ’ll call it ) last Friday and was out for repair when I made these bagels .
Instead , I used Alex ’s old manual Canon Rebel , replete with my macro lens and our Speedlite flash .
How cool is it that everything works together ?
On Saturday , my dad was kind enough to lend us his Rebel XTi until ours came out of the shop , which is supposed to be today .
( Pictures taken with his camera can be seen in the previous post . )
Hooray for SantaDad , and camera repair shops that work quickly !
Although Alex may have been the cause of the camera ’s injury , he deserves a hearty round of applause for typing this entire recipe for us .

The Australian Bankers Association ( ABA ) says the bank fees Australian customers are charged compare favourably with other countries .
A survey by Fujitsu Consulting shows Australians pay an average of 22 per cent more in bank fees than British customers and 11 per cent more than Americans .
But ABA chief executive David Bell says domestic bank fees are fairly reasonable and the banks should be recognised for offering low - cost or fee - free accounts .
" In our own report last year - which we published - it shows that Australia is about middling in terms of account - keeping fees and we 're grouped in the same bracket as say , Canada and The Netherlands , " Mr Bell said .
" We do know in Australia that the banks have a number of free accounts for people .
We also have a lot of low - cost bank accounts in the market which have received terrific uptake . "
Research by Fujitsu Consulting says Australian banks will collect about $ 5 billion in fees this year .
The survey says $ 2 billion of that relates to transaction accounts and $ 1.5 billion is tied to credit card fees .
Martin North from Fujitsu told ABC Radio's AM program that Australian banks are less efficient than their overseas counterparts and use fees to make up the cost gap .
" They have to try and recover those costs somehow , but my own view is that there is less competitor tension in Australia than overseas , and as a result , the banks have been able to lift their fees , " Mr North said .
" My view is that banks have plenty of opportunity to get more efficient , and if they reduce the number of fees that they have to put into their systems , they would actually be much better off because there would be less costs involved . "

The blood of those boys still cries to me from their graves .
An international consortium of industry , academic and government scientists has rejected as incomplete and unreliable the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's case that a chemical found in food containers and other household products is safe .
The group , which met last month in Germany , is working to release a consensus statement in the next few weeks .
The meeting was closed to the public , but the Journal Sentinel has interviewed many scientists who attended the meeting and has seen several working versions of their agreement .
The group raises questions about the two studies that the FDA has used as its foundation to declare that bisphenol A is safe in food and beverage containers .
It calls for a much broader look at the chemical than the FDA has given .
Speakers at the conference included Rochelle Tyl , the author of the two studies that are being used as the FDA 's benchmarks .
Both of Tyl 's studies were paid for by the American Chemistry Council , a trade association for BPA makers .
According to scientists at the meeting , Tyl conceded that there were errors and inconsistencies in the 2008 report that the FDA used as the foundation for its findings .
" It is becoming undeniable that BPA is dangerous , " said Laura Vandenberg , a developmental biologist at Tufts University , one of 58 scientists from around the world invited to the conference in Germany .
" The FDA 's standard for safety is reasonable certainty .
It is no longer reasonable to say that BPA is safe . "
The group 's conclusions also call into question the European Food Safety Authority 's assessment of BPA .
The authority , which also relies on Tyl 's studies , sets policy for all countries in the European Union .
The scientists ' consensus statement will contradict claims by industry spokesmen who have been citing the FDA and European assessments as proof that BPA is safe .
Tyl told the Journal Sentinel in an e-mail that her studies do not claim that BPA is safe .
Her studies were not designed to cover all aspects of the chemical 's effects .
They simply show no effects to the reproductive system of rats and mice that were exposed to the chemical at low doses , she said .
She has previously acknowledged inconsistencies in her data , particularly the age of some animals that were examined in the 2008 study for effects on the prostate .
While Tyl answered several questions by e-mail , she declined to be interviewed .
John Vandenbergh , a biologist at North Carolina State University who attended the conference in Germany , said the FDA risks losing credibility by relying on such flimsy evidence .
" We desperately need good judgment at the FDA , " Vandenbergh said .
" For years , they did a superb job looking out for food safety .
I hate to see something like this jeopardize all that . "
The conference , held in late March , was called to reassess the safety of BPA for German regulators .
But the agreements that were forged there are being closely watched by those worldwide with a stake in the future of the chemical , including BPA - makers , regulators and advocates who consider the chemical to be dangerous .
The group agreed that Tyl 's studies were too limited in their scope to be considered benchmarks .
The group found that Tyl 's studies failed to consider serious dangers posed by BPA .
They include effects on behavior and the development of the brain and prostate .
Those problems were identified in a National Toxicology Program report published last year .
FDA administrators promise to address those issues more thoroughly now .
Ruling protested
Despite concerns raised by other regulatory agencies , the FDA declared BPA to be safe last August .
It cited Tyl 's two studies , which were released in 2001 and 2008 .
Several BPA experts and health advocates protested the ruling , saying that the agency was too quick to ignore hundreds of other studies that found the chemical caused harm .
The agency 's Science Board agreed and recommended that the FDA reopen its assessment of the chemical .
Laura Tarantino , director of the FDA 's Office of Food Additive Safety , said Tyl 's studies followed proper protocol .
But she acknowledged some uncertainties about whether Tyl 's studies addressed all concerns about the chemical .
Neither Tarantino nor any FDA scientists were invited to the meeting .
Tarantino said her agency would now look at other studies that raise concerns about BPA .
BPA , developed more than 100 years ago as a synthetic estrogen , is used in thousands of household products to make hard , clear plastic for things such as baby bottles and food containers .
It also is used in many dental sealants and to line most food and beverage cans .
The chemical has been found in the urine of 93 % of Americans tested .
Tests conducted last year for the Journal Sentinel found that toxic levels of the chemical leached from 10 different product containers when heated , including those marked " microwave safe . "
Although the levels that leached from the containers were low , the Journal Sentinel identified several peer - reviewed studies that found health risks in laboratory animals at similar levels .
Scientists began studying the chemical more than 10 years ago after laboratory animals were found to be developing health problems suspected of being caused by their polycarbonate cages .
These problems included heart disease , obesity , diabetes , some forms of cancers and reproductive failures .
Recent studies have linked the chemical to heart disease and diabetes .
It has been found to interfere with chemotherapy for breast cancer patients .
Concern is especially keen for its effects on fetuses and newborns , whose development are most affected by exposure to the chemical .
Canada declared BPA to be a toxin and has banned its use in baby bottles .
Earlier this year , the six major baby bottle makers promised to stop using BPA .
Sunoco , one of five BPA makers , now requires companies buying its BPA to sign a promise that they will not use it to make products for children younger than 3 .
The government is expanding its look at the chemical , and last month the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences announced it was investing $ 5 million in BPA research .
Last month , bills were introduced in both houses of Congress to ban BPA from all food and beverage containers .
Different accounts
The German conference did not reject Tyl 's studies but had questions regarding her methodology and accuracy .
In the past seven months , Tyl has given three different accounts of the ages of the animals that she used to study BPA 's effects on prostate size .
Scientists who attended the conference in Germany say that the discrepancies are significant because prostate size varies greatly depending on age .
A larger - than - normal prostate could indicate cell change caused by BPA .
Tyl said in her 2008 paper that the animals were younger than 14 weeks , or around 3 months old .
Critics questioned this at an FDA hearing in September .
They noted that Tyl 's data showed the mice to have abnormally large prostates for animals that were 3 months old .
They said that could indicate that either the animals were diseased or that a lab technician had bungled the data .
Tyl said then that the paper erred .
The animals were 6 months old , she said .
FDA administrators were at the hearing , but there is no record of the discrepancy on the FDA 's Web site , which lists the studies for the public to review .
Last month in Germany , when questioned again , Tyl said the paper was wrong .
The animals actually were 5 months old .
" How could this mistake be made and not caught , " said Laura Vandenberg , the Tufts scientist .
" Now that this issue has been brought to light , have the other data been verified and validated , and by whom ? "
FDA spokesman Michael Herndon said Friday that he was not certain if the agency had made note of the discrepancy .
" She is in big trouble over the age issue , " said Fred vom Saal , biologist at the University of Missouri and one of the most vocal critics of the FDA 's assessment .
Vom Saal was also at the meeting in Germany .
Vandenbergh , the BPA expert from North Carolina State , said the discrepancies " significantly weaken " Tyl 's 2008 study .
" I would n't use it as a benchmark study , " Vandenbergh said .
Lab fire
Scientists who attended the conference said they also were concerned about a fire that broke out in Tyl 's North Carolina laboratory that was never reported to the FDA .
The fire occurred on Aug. 25 , 2001 , about a year after her first paper had been written and some three years before work began on the second study .
Eighteen polycarbonate cages , made with BPA , burned in the fire .
Scientists at the conference say the lingering effects of the fire may have compromised future experiments .
The chemical could have gotten into the heating ducts or the feed , exposing the animals to much higher doses than reported in the study .
Tyl 's company , RTI International , investigated the fire - which appeared to be arson .
An independent firm analyzed the lab and reported that it had been sufficiently cleaned .
The group declared that the animals were not compromised and that Tyl 's lab " was , and continues to be , an excellent facility . "
But scientists at the conference , when told of the fire by the Journal Sentinel , said they would not trust that assessment .
BPA is a sensitive chemical that acts at extremely low levels , and the group that analyzed the lab did not test for the chemical at those levels , they said .
Vandenbergh , of North Carolina State , who examined the reports on the fire and the laboratory 's investigation for the Journal Sentinel , said he would have conducted the experiments at a different lab .
" In hindsight , this is too important of an issue to leave open these questions , " Vandenbergh said .
Herndon , the FDA spokesman , said the agency was unaware of the fire and has no plans to discount the studies .
" It appears that sufficient corrective action was taken at the laboratory regarding the fire , the incident and its impact on the animals is not relevant to the studies reviewed regarding BPA , " Herndon said .
Scores of studies
The scientists at the German conference also agreed that government regulators need to greatly expand the universe of studies that they consider .
Scores of studies have linked BPA to behavioral problems in animals , such as aggression , anxiety and hyperactivity .
Other studies have found changes to the prostate gland that have been shown to lead to cancer .
But the FDA discounted them because they did not adhere to the Good Laboratory Practices designation .
The internationally recognized designation is considered by some to be biased toward industry because it requires more animals to be tested than many academic institutions can afford or are willing to test .
The March conference was the first time that scientists from all perspectives reached a consensus on several key aspects of human exposure to the chemical .
Though representatives of European industries attended the conference , scientists from the American Chemistry Council , which represents American BPA - makers , were not invited .
Steven Hentges , the industry spokesman on BPA , deflected worries that this new position would threaten previous safety assessments of BPA .
" Within the last year , the European Union , European Food Safety Authority , German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment , Danish Environmental Protection Agency , French Food Safety Authority and the Swiss health authorities have all evaluated BPA and concluded that BPA in food contact applications is not a human health risk , " Hentges said .
These agencies also relied largely on Tyl 's work and several premises that are about to be discounted , a review of those assessments show .
For years , scientists from industry and many regulatory agencies have said that BPA is not a health risk because people - including infants and children - are exposed to such low levels of the chemical .
But the group in Germany acknowledged that children and infants have levels of BPA in their urine that are three to 11 times higher than adults .
The FDA also discounted studies that used rodents to gauge human exposure to BPA .
But the German group found that humans and animals treated with comparable doses end up with similar levels even though they metabolize it differently .
The group also urged regulators to look at studies that examined how BPA acts at low doses , an area of research that many regulating bodies were reluctant to consider .
A growing number of scientists say that because BPA acts like a hormone , its effects are seen at extremely low levels , even if no damage is found at higher doses .
Tarantino of the FDA says the agency will expand its look to include low - dose effects .
There have been widespread calls for reform of the system Docking the wages of MPs who break the rules on expenses is a " good suggestion " , David Cameron has said .
The Conservative leader agreed with a caller to BBC Radio 5 Live who argued wages could be docked by 10 to 20 % .
Mr Cameron also suggested MPs could be banned from the Commons for a period if they abused the system .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has ordered a review of expenses to be speeded - up amid growing public anger but Mr Cameron has called for action now .
Mr Cameron said he was ready to meet the other party leaders to make progress on scrapping the controversial second homes allowance .
One option , he said , was to " have a proper declaration by MPs about why they need this allowance and where they live and all the rest of it , so that there is n't any of this monkey business about pretending a second home is n't a second home " .
' Children 's charity '
The other option was to replace the allowance with a " sum of money " that costs less than under the current system .
He added : " I just want us to sort this out .
I think our politics is being dragged through the mud .
It 's not just bad for the House of Commons , but I think it 's bad for the country and we just need to sort this out . "
MPs can already be made to pay back any expenses they wrongly claim .
But asked by a listener if he thought they should also be docked " say 10 , 20 % on top of that " with the money " given to help the country get out of recession or to a children 's charity " Mr Cameron said : " I think that 's a very good suggestion . "
He added : " Where MPs have been found to misuse their expenses they have been made to pay back the money , I think that 's right .
The idea of getting them to pay back some more is a very good suggestion . "
Expenses review On Wednesday , Gordon Brown agreed to meet Mr Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg to discuss MPs expenses .
The prime minister told MPs : " This whole system has to be reformed and improved .
" I think there is common ground in this House that it brings no repute to MPs if we are continually having to deal with these issues . "
But he said any reforms would still have to wait for the outcome of a review by the Committee on Standards in Public Life .
The review has been speeded up amid public anger about the scale of expenses being claimed by MPs and ministers .

Yesterday was Rod Blagojevich ’s big day of spin and obfuscation on TV .
Today that honor goes to Bernard Goldberg , a FOX news contributor , who will spend part of his day on FOX News hawking a book about Obama and the media .
So , a book being hawked on FOX — by Bernard Goldberg — about Obama and the media — you know that ’s got to be a real winner .
Our friends at Media Matters for America actually read the book and fact - checked its content .
Guess what they found ?
Goldberg ’s book has “ falsehoods and red herrings ” :
In Chapter One , Goldberg cites as evidence of the media ’s “ pro-Obama tilt ” the fact that CBS ’
The Early Show ran a segment called “ Five Things You Should Know About Barack Obama ” that featured trivia about Obama .
Of course , five days later , the show ran a segment called “ Five Things You Should Know ” about Sen.
John McCain — a fact Goldberg conveniently neglects to mention .
In another example of purported media infatuation with President Obama , Goldberg echoes Rush Limbaugh by printing badly doctored “ snippets ” of an interview between Charlie Rose and Tom Brokaw .
Like his Early Show example , Goldberg ’s doctored transcript of the interview falsely suggests that comments Brokaw and Rose made about their lack of familiarity with the candidates applied only to Obama when , in fact , they were referring to McCain as well .
It also falsely suggests that Brokaw expressed the view that “ there ’s a lot about [ Obama ] we do n’t know , ” when , in fact , Brokaw attributed that assertion to “ conservative commentators . ”
And , in a particularly striking example of mangling the facts , Goldberg writes , “ Finally , in the last month of the campaign , the [ New York ]
Times returned to the Obama - [ William ]
Ayers story , but only after McCain and ( mostly ) [ Gov. Sarah ] Palin began making it an issue on the campaign trail . ”
In fact , in what was reported as the “ first time ” Palin raised Obama ’s connection to Ayers , Palin actually cited the October 4 , 2008 , New York Times story to which Goldberg refers .
I will take that one ... no wait ... THAT ONE !

The Democratic Party of Japan is moving to support freedom of expression , proposing an amendment to the anti-loli law of last year which would overlook “ simple possession ” of pornography featuring underage participants , but attach harsh punishment to the commercial sale of such material .
Lolicon have naturally switched their voting preferences accordingly .
The Democrats propose amendments which would prohibit the commercial production , sale and distribution of pornography featuring minors , attaching a maximum 3 year sentence to the offence .
Other changes sought include altering “ child porn ” to read “ items depicting juvenile sexual acts and similar ” , and the inclusion of hidden camera material in the law .
However , citing the potential for abuse of search powers by the state , they propose simply possessing the material be overlooked ; previously it carried a slightly reduced sentence if the materials were for satisfying “ sexual curiosity ” .
No mention of 2D materials is being made , which observers unanimously interpret as an unwillingness to legislate on the issue .
The ruling LDP already put off deciding whether to extend its ban to 2D images , but it seems the Democratic proposal will not target 2D , although this is not beyond doubt .
Via Jiji and 2ch .
The Democrats themselves harbour many moralists and extreme feminists , and as we have seen before are quite capable of proposing highly objectionable legislation .
However , they also harbour many civil libertarians ; recently some have even made vociferous rebuttals to the calumnies heaped upon Japan by the likes of UNICEF , where they claim Japan to be a “ major producer ” of underage porn .
As a result , the actions of the Democrats are at times rather inconsistent , but they do have generally strong credentials where civil liberties are concerned .
Of course , whether the amendment passes is another matter …

Magnetic bubble to protect Mars explorers
Scientists believe they have found a way of protecting astronauts from a dangerous source of space radiation , clearing one of the hurdles towards sending humans to Mars .
The device has been developed by British and Portuguese scientists and appears in the journal Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion .
Radiation is one of the greatest challenges facing a mission to the red planet , planned by the United States and Europe in the first half of this century .
The shortest round trip would take at least 18 months , and during this time , the crew would be exposed to sub-atomic particles that whizz through space .
These particles are capable of slicing through DNA and boosting the risk of cancer and other disorders .
The peril has been known for nearly half a century , but has seemed difficult to solve because costs and technological difficulty .
Some experts have toyed with the idea of shielding the crew with lead or massive tanks of water , but the price of lifting this load into orbit from earth is high .
Another idea would be to swathe the spaceship with a replica of earth 's own magnetic field , deflecting incoming cosmic rays .
According to previous calculations , the spacecraft would have to generate a magnetic field hundreds of kilometres across .
But such equipment would be huge and drain the ship 's energy supply and its powerful field could well harm the crew .
Bubble protection
British and Portuguese scientists have taken a fresh look at this old concept and say the magnetic field does not , in fact , have to be huge - just a ' bubble ' a few hundred metres across would suffice .
" The idea is really like in Star Trek , when Scottie turns on a shield to protect the starship Enterprise from proton beams - it 's almost identical really , " says Bob Bingham of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK .
Their research uses numerical simulations also used by experts in nuclear fusion , in which hot plasma is kept in place by a powerful magnetic field .
This technology provides an accurate picture of how individual particles behave when they collide with a two - pole magnetic field .
As a result , the researchers have been able to devise a smarter , miniaturised model of magnetic protection .
Scaled test
Using a plasma lab at the Superior Technical Institute in Lisbon , the team tested a scaled down version of the device in a simulation of a solar storm of atomic particles .
Scaled up for a trip to Mars , the device would weigh around " several hundred kilos " and use only about a kilowatt of energy , or around one half to one third of the typical power consumption of today 's communications satellites , says Bingham .
The force of the magnetic field would replicate the earth's , but to minimise any risk to crew close to its source , could be carried in spacecraft flying either side of the crewed ship .
Bingham says the " mini magnetosphere " is being pitched both to the European Space Agency and NASA .
It would scatter almost all particles dispatched in " solar storms " - protons belched out by the sun , he says .
It would not work against a somewhat less dangerous problem , of high - energy cosmic rays that fly across interstellar distances , but the ship could be swathed with material , like a Kevlar bulletproof waistcoat , to protect against that threat .
" It certainly will be the answer if we go to Mars , because going to Mars will take about 18 months and we need to protect the astronauts against these storms , " says Bingham .
In 2001 , a NASA study found that at least 39 former astronauts suffered cataracts after flying in space , 36 of whom had taken part in missions beyond earth 's orbit .
The agency has tentatively estimated that a trip to Mars and back would give a 40 - year - old non-smoking person a 40 % chance of developing fatal cancer after they returned to earth , or twice the terrestrial risk .

Automobile remote keyless entry systems ( RKE ) were introduced in the 1980s .
They ’ve proved to be a big hit , making it easier for the grocery - laden to unlock their cars and sparing many of the terminally forgetful from finding they ’ve left their keys in the ignitions of their now - locked vehicles or their purses on the seats of same .
The earliest RKE systems were quite vulnerable to the sort of attack that was described in warning e-mails widely spread via the Internet .
Their RF transmitters ( usually built into key fobs ) sent unique identifying codes that could be picked off by ‘ code grabbers , ’ devices that recorded the codes sent out when drivers pushed buttons on their remote key fobs to lock or unlock their cars :
[ Collected via e-mail , August 2013 ] I locked my car .
As I walked away I heard my car door unlock .
I went back and locked my car again three times .
Each time , as soon as I started to walk away , I would hear it unlock again !!
Naturally alarmed , I looked around and there were two guys sitting in a car in the fire lane next to the store .
They were obviously watching me intently , and there was no doubt they were somehow involved in this very weird situation .
I quickly chucked the errand I was on , jumped in my car and sped away .
I went straight to the police station , told them what had happened , and found out I was part of a new , and very successful , scheme being used to gain entry into cars .
Two weeks later , my friend ’s son had a similar happening ….
[ Collected via e-mail , June 2008 ]
My oldest son Mike came over yesterday – He had to go to Canada for work last week .
One of the other engineers traveling to Canada with him , but in his own car , had something happen that I need to share .
While traveling he stopped at the roadside park , similar to what we have here with bathrooms , vending machines etc .
He came out to his car less than 4 - 5 minutes later and found someone had gotten into his car , and stolen his cell phone , laptop computer , GPS navigator briefcase … you name it .
They called the police and since there were no signs of his car being broken into — the police told him that there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your key - chain locking device .
They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim .
Since they know you are going inside the store , restaurant , or bathroom , they have a few minutes to steal and run .
The police officer said to be sure to manually lock your car door by hitting the lock button inside the car .
That way if there is someone sitting in a parking lot watching for their next victim it will not be you .
When you hit the lock button on your car upon exiting it does not send the security code , but if you walk away and use the door lock on your key chain , it sends the code thru the airwaves where it can be intercepted .
I just wanted to let you know about this … it is something totally new to us … and this is real … it just happened this past Thursday June 19th to his coworker …
So be aware of this and please pass this note on .
Look how many times we all lock our doors with our remotes .
Just to be sure we remembered to lock them , and bingo the guys have our code , and whatever was in the car can be gone .
I just wanted everyone I know to hear this from me .
I never knew about anything like this and do not want this to happen to anyone I know ,
If we can educate each other on bad things happening .
Keep safe everyone !
[ Collected via e-mail , August 2006 ]
Tonight , John and I went to Church , out to dinner , and then to the movies at Loews , on Spring Valley and Central .
Apparently , while we were in the movie theatre , someone broke into our car .
John ’s sun glasses were taken ( they are going to be really surprised when they find out they were prescription ! ) .
Aside from the glasses taken and the two glove boxes open , nothing else was taken , including the home clicker .
Now , here is the really odd part : there was NO forced entry into the car , nothing was broken , scratched , or removed from the outside of the car .
We were really baffled as to how anyone could have gotten into the car that we had locked .
The answer came from the security guard at Micro Center , who was in the parking lot talking to another man whose car had also been rifled .
( In that instance , the man ’s wallet , keys , checkbook , and credit cards were stolen . )
But there was no forced entry there either .
We soon learned that thieves now have some type of high tech gadget that can monitor and replicate the key pad locking device .
In other words , when we got out of the car and started to walk away , John hit his key pad to make sure the doors were locked .
When it beeped , apparently there was someone in the vicinity who had one of those devices / gadgets and replicated the key lock tone and then used it to get into the auto .
If you know of other instances where this has happened , please let the NA ’s / HOA ’s know , so they can spread the word to our neighbors to be cautious in locking their car doors .
If this is indeed how someone could get into our car , then you can bet that from now on I will definitely manually lock all the doors .
We will never again get out , walk off , and then use that key pad to lock the car .
Great invention , but obviously you have to be discreet in where you use it .
Have a great day but keep a ‘ heads up ’!
[ Collected via e-mail , November 2008 ]
Once again , we are approaching the holiday season and that often means a greater risk of becoming a victim of crime .
We suspect that , with the current economic conditions , this year the risk could be even greater than normal .
In addition , there is evidence that a new form of automobile burglary has begun to occur around the country .
Thieves may be using a device that allows them to copy the signal sent out when automobile owners use their remote key button to lock their vehicles .
The thief records the signal and then watches as the intended victim walks away .
Then , they simply unlock the vehicle .
These are n’t typical car break - ins .
There is no broken window , the car lock is intact .
It appears thieves may be scanning crowded parking lots with some sort of device , and when they see your lights flash , meaning they ’ve made a hit , they help themselves .
The only way to avoid this type of crime is to use the car door lock button located inside your vehicle , rather than using your remote locking device .
While the Tallahassee Police Department reports they are not aware of this occurring in Tallahassee , they do say that it could be occurring in those instances where victims are unclear as to whether or not they had locked their vehicles .
However , times change and technology advances .
In response to the fixed code security weakness , automakers shifted from RKEs with fixed codes to systems employing rolling random codes .
These codes change every time a given RKE system is used to lock or unlock car doors and thus rendered the earlier ‘ code grabbers ’ ineffective .
That form of more robust code system became the industry standard for remote keyless entry systems in the mid-1990s , so automobiles newer than that are not vulnerable to being quickly and easily opened by criminals armed with the first generation of code grabbers .
It is theoretically possible for a thief armed with the right technology and the ability to manipulate it correctly to snatch a modern keycode from the air and use it to enter a vehicle .
However , it ’s unclear how many ( if any ) crooks have managed to overcome the issues of complexity and time involved in the process to use it as a practical means of stealing from cars .
If the scheme requires would - be thieves to have specialized knowledge and equipment and spend hours ( or more ) crunching data and replicating a device to produce a correct entry code , its application to boosting valuables from cars in parking lots would be rather limited .
As Microchip Technology , the manufacturer of KEELOQ brand RKE systems , noted of this possibility :
The theoretical attack requires detailed knowledge of the system implementation and a combination of data , specialized skills , equipment and access to various components of a system which is seldom feasible .
These theoretical attacks are not unique to the Keeloq system and could be applied to virtually any security system .
So far we have n’t encountered any documented cases of items being stolen from locked cars via entry gained through the use of code grabbers , much less evidence that it ’s a widespread form of theft .
There have been a few reported incidents of thieves ’ managing to gain entry to locked vehicles through the apparent use of some form of electronic device , but the specific nature of those devices has yet to be determined .
In some similar cases it has been speculated that thieves who have been stealing purses and other valuables from parked vehicles have been using a device that blocks remote keyless signals and thus prevents car doors from locking ( rather than using a device that emulates remote keyless signals to open locked doors ) .
In 2016 , researchers theorized some makes and models were potentially vulnerable to such an attack , but again there was little to indicate that cars are routinely ( or even rarely ) stolen in such a fashion :
It is conceivable that all VW Group ( except for some Audi ) cars manufactured in the past and partially today rely on a ‘ constant - key ’ scheme and are thus vulnerable to the attacks , ” the paper argues .
The only exception the researchers found were cars built on VW ’s latest MQB production platform , which is used in its top selling model , the Golf VII , which they found does not have the keyless flaw .
A VW spokesman said that the current Golf , Tiguan , Touran and Passat models are not vulnerable to the attack .
“ This current vehicle generation is not afflicted by the problems described , ” VW spokesman Peter Weisheit said in a statement [ . ]
For the most part , any efforts by car thieves to steal vehicles by exploiting RKE systems have likely been supplanted by a much easier method , that of using boosting devices to relay the RKE signals from far enough away that the car ’s owner is unaware of it :
A group of researchers at the Beijing - based security firm Qihoo 360 recently pulled off the so - called relay hack with a pair of gadgets they built for just $ 22 .
That ’s far cheaper than previous versions of the key - spoofing hardware .
The Qihoo researchers , who recently showed their results at Amsterdam ’s Hack in the Box conference , say their upgrade also significantly multiplies the radio attack ’s range , allowing them to steal cars parked more than a thousand feet away from the owner ’s key fob .
The attack essentially tricks both the car and real key into thinking they ’re in close proximity .
One hacker holds a device a few feet from the victim ’s key , while a thief holds the other near the target car .
The device near the car spoofs a signal from the key .
That elicits a radio signal from the car ’s keyless entry system , which seeks a certain signal back from the key before it will open .
Rather than try to crack that radio code , the hacker ’s devices instead copy it , then transmit it via radio from one of the hackers ’ devices to the other , and then to the key .
Then they immediately transmit the key ’s response back along the chain , effectively telling the car that the key is in the driver ’s hand .
“ The attack uses the two devices to extend the effective range of the key fob , ” says Jun Li , one of the researchers in the Qihoo group , who call themselves Team Unicorn .
“ You ’re working in your office or shopping in the supermarket , and your car is parked outside .
Someone slips near you and then someone else can open up and drive your car .
It ’s simple . ”
The following demonstration video demonstrates this technique in action :
One of the versions of this warning circulated in 2008 contained the contact information for Const .
Wally Henry , an RCMP officer from Sherwood Park , Alberta .
Henry disclaimed the story being spread in his name , saying in his voice mail message to those who telephoned , “ If your call is concerning an e-mail with my name attached to it , please be advised that the information in that e-mail is false , and please do not disseminate it any further . ”
Now for something completely different .
Pub is closed by Monty Python hand grenade
The film prop of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch , a replica of which forced the temporary closure of a pub and several office buildings
Bomb disposal experts failed to see the funny side when when they rushed to disarm a suspicious object only for it to be the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch made famous by Monty Python .
Police evacuated several buildings , cordoned off a street and called in explosives specialists after water company workers stumbled on the film prop under a fire hydrant cover in Shoreditch , east London .
But the dangerous - looking weapon turned out to be the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch that featured in the 1975 film Monty Python And The Holy Grail .
Officers had evacuated a pub and another building , while office staff in another building were stopped from leaving .
But when the bomb squad arrived , they quickly established there was no danger and the street was declared safe .
In the film , the grenade was used to slaughter a killer rabbit .
Python actor Eric
Idle had filmgoers in stitches as he said : ' Oh Lord .
Bless this hand grenade , that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits , in thy mercy . '
Alberto Romanelli , who owns the Windmill pub nearby , said the police action in ordering his pub to be evacuated had been as ridiculous as the film scene .
' They evacuated the pub while they were doing X - rays and stuff , ' he said .
The prop forced the Windmill pub to close for 45 minutes while police cordoned off the street
' It all lasted about 45 minutes before they decided it was nothing - which I thought was pretty obvious from the start .
I lost a good hour 's worth of business . '
Emma
Eve , a training centre receptionist , said : ' It was scary .
They would n't let us out of the building . '
Office worker Graham
White said : ' The situation was nearly as crazy as the film . '
Former Python Michael Palin , who appeared in the film , said : ' Our Holy Hand Grenade was fictional and there were no plans for creating one .
We do n't want to add to the armaments of the world . '
An police spokeswoman said : ' There was no danger to the public .
The device is believed to be an object known as a Holy Hand Grenade . '

Copies of the prop can be bought on the internet for £ 14 or you can make your own by following the instructions in a five - minute video on YouTube .
In the film , before the grenade is used , Idle says : ' And the Lord spake , saying , " First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin , then shalt thou count to three , no more , no less .
'" Three shall be the number thou shalt count , and the number of the counting shall be three .
Four shalt thou not count , neither count thou two , excepting that thou then proceed to three .
Five is right out .
'" Once the number three , being the third number , be reached , then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe , who being naughty in my sight , shall snuff it .
Amen . " '
ISTANBUL --
As scientists around the world celebrate the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's seminal work on evolution , Adnan Oktar , a college dropout turned theorist of Islamic creationism , is working on the fifth volume of a 14 - part masterwork that he says will bury Darwinism once and for all .
" Darwin and his theory are dead , " says Mr. Oktar , founder and honorary president of the Science Research Foundation , an Istanbul outfit dedicated to debunking the Victorian - era English naturalist .
Darwin , says his 52 - year - old Turkish scourge , is " Satan 's biggest trick on humanity . "
Mr. Oktar , who briefly studied interior design , has n't had much success swaying scientists with the weight of his research .
" He is a complete and utter ignoramus , " says Richard Dawkins , an evolutionary biologist and Oxford University professor .
The physical weight of Mr. Oktar 's work , however , is considerable .
Each volume of his anti-Darwin magnum opus , " Atlas of Creation , " weighs more than 13 pounds .
Also weighing in on his side are very aggressive lawyers .
They 've repeatedly gone to court in Turkey to silence critics whom Mr. Oktar accuses of spreading " lies and insults . "
Scores of Web sites have been banned at his behest .
These include the site of Oxford 's Prof .
Dawkins , which Mr. Oktar -- who writes under the pen name Harun Yahya -- got blocked last fall after it posted an article entitled " Venomous Snakes , Slippery Eels and Harun Yahya . "
Prof .
Dawkins responded to the ban by posting a Turkish translation of the article .
Mr. Oktar derides Prof .
Dawkins , an outspoken atheist , as " a pagan monk . "
Apple ’s AppStore for iPhone and iPod touch is about to sell its billionth application .
You can watch Apple ’s pretty counter webpage , or you can see the downloads piling up and the rate of downloads visualized below .
Unlike the billionth song download a few years ago , this is in ( almost ) real - time .
The collected data and the Python script that generates the images using Google Charts is included .
The images below show the number of downloads ( the scale goes from 900 million to 1 billion ) as the dark gray background “ mountain , ” and the rate of downloads ( 0 to 500,000 per hour ) as the green line .
Light gray stripes in the background indicate six hour intervals ( the time zone is PDT ) .
The images change once per hour , when new data becomes available .
The best time to check is shortly after the full hour .
The bottom chart currently does not fill the image , but it will in a few days .
This was done on purpose to keep the aspect ratio from changing dramatically over time , and to keep the images comparable .
As of writing this , I only have about 24 hours of data , and it ’s from the beginning of the promotion and from a Friday ; so it ’s hard to make predictions based on this .
I do expect the billionth application to be sold before the end of the coming week ( April 17 ) , however , and we might see the rate of downloads go over 500,000 per hour ( update April 15 : looks like a downward trend so far , actually ) .
For the billionth song countdown , Apple gave away prizes for every 100,000th download .
You could see quite well how people were hunting for those , from the spikes in download rate close to those points .
This time around , things are a lot less exciting , and this is also reflected in the data : instead of a new data point every five minutes , there ’s only one per hour , and it is delayed by almost an hour .
It is still interesting to see the more and less active times during the day , and also the sheer number of downloads ( 300,000 downloads per hour is 5,000 per minute and over 83 per second ! ) .
The data for this is scraped from the same source Apple ’s webpage uses .
I ’m making the collected data available here : countdownlog.txt .
It ’s a simple text file that should be self - explanatory .
It ’s updated every five minutes , in case Apple changes its update frequency as downloads pick up during the week .
Instead of working this into the billion downloads applet , I decided to try out Google Charts .
While the API is pretty good for basic charts , it does have its limitations .
Perhaps the most annoying is that images are limited to 300,000 pixels : I would have liked to make the large version of this quite a bit larger .
Getting a combined line and bar chart also involves some trickery ( which is documented , though ) .
This could be a bit easier .
Transparency would be another useful feature , to make the stripes visible through the bars .
Another problem is that Google Charts does not degrade gracefully .
When there is too much data , it simply gives you an error message or produces a completely useless image .
I had to split the chart up at four full days , because it croaked at 117 data points .
This does not seem to be a limitation of the URL length ( it uses GET requests , not POST ) , but of the renderer .
Other writers have produced fantastically detailed annotated editions of Stoker ’s “ Dracula . ”
The first of these , “ The Annotated Dracula ” ( 1975 ) , by Leonard Wolf , a Transylvanian - born horror scholar , dealt , for example , with the scene of Dracula ’s assault on Mina by giving us the Biblical sources of “ unclean , unclean ” and “ flesh of my flesh ” ; by cross - referencing “ my bountiful wine - press ” to an earlier passage , about Transylvanian viniculture ; by noting , apropos of Dracula ’s opening a vein in his chest , that this recalls an old myth about the pelican feeding its young with blood from its bosom ; by telling us that the vein Dracula slashed must have been the superficial intercostal ; by exclaiming over the sexual ambiguity of the scene ( “ Just what is going on here ?
A vengeful cuckoldry ?
A ménage à trois ?
Mutual oral sexuality ? ” ) , and so on .
None of this information is needed by the first - or second - time reader of “ Dracula . ”
Indeed , it would be a positive hindrance , draining away the suspense that Stoker worked so hard to build .
“ The suspect was described as wearing totally pedestrian bluejeans , an indifferent gray sweatshirt , and a trucker ’s cap , without the slightest sense of irony . ”

The fullness of Wolf ’s commentary did not discourage others .
In 1979 , a second annotated edition came out , and in 1998 a third .
Last October , a fourth —
“ The New Annotated Dracula , ” by Leslie Klinger , a Los Angeles tax and estate lawyer who has a sideline editing Victorian literature — was published by Norton ( $ 39.95 ) .
What could Klinger have found to elucidate that his predecessors did n’t ?
Plenty .
In the scene of Mina ’s encounter with Dracula , for example , he honorably cites the earlier editions , and then he goes on to alert us to a punctuation error ; to conjecture , revoltingly , about the source of the mist in which Dracula enters Mina ’s bedroom ( “ Perhaps this was not a vapor but rather a milky substance expressed from Dracula ’s body ” ) ; to speculate that Jonathan Harker ’s excitement , upon awakening from his swoon , may be a form of sexual arousal ; and to question the medical accuracy of Stoker ’s claim that Harker ’s hair turns white as he listens to Mina ’s story : “ In fact , whitening is caused by a progressive decline in the absolute number of melanocytes ( pigment - producing cells in the skin , hair , and eye ) , which normally decrease over time . ”
Even that old sentimental convention does not get past him .
What is all this about ?
Why do publishers think that readers will care ?
One could say that “ Dracula , ” like certain other works —
“ Alice in Wonderland , ” the Sherlock Holmes stories ( both , like Klinger ’s “ Dracula , ” published in Norton ’s Annotated Editions series ; Klinger was the editor of the Holmes ) — is a cult favorite .
But why does the book have a cult ?
Well , cults often gather around powerful works of the second rank .
Fans feel that they have to root for them .
What , then , is the source of “ Dracula ” ’s power ?
A simple device , used in many notable works of art : the deployment of great and volatile forces within a very tight structure .
The narrative method of “ Dracula ” is to assemble a collage of purportedly authentic documents , most of them in the first person .
Many of the materials are identified as excerpts from the diaries of the main characters .
In addition , there are letters to and from these people — but also from lawyers , carting companies , and Hungarian nuns — plus telegrams , “ newspaper ” clippings , and a ship ’s log .
This multiplicity of voices gives the book a wonderful liveliness .
A long horror story could easily become suffocating .
( That is one of the reasons that Poe ’s tales are tales , not novels . )
“ Dracula , ” in a regular , unannotated edition , runs about four hundred pages , but it is seldom tedious .
It opens with four chapters from the diary of Jonathan Harker describing his visit , on legal business — he is a solicitor — to the castle of a certain Count Dracula , in Transylvania , and ending with Harker howling in horror over what he found there .
Then we turn the page , and suddenly we are in England , reading a letter from Mina — at that point , Harker ’s fiancée — bubbling to her friend Lucy Westenra about how she ’s learning shorthand so that she can be useful to Jonathan in his work .
This is a salutary jolt , and also witty .
( Little does Mina know how Jonathan ’s work is going at that juncture . )
The alternation of voices also lends texture .
It ’s as if we were turning an interesting object around in our hands , looking at it from this angle , then that .
And since the story is reported by so many different witnesses , we are more likely to believe it .
In addition , we are given the pleasure of assembling the pieces of a puzzle .
No one narrator knows all that the others have told us , and this allows us to read between the lines .
One evening , as Mina is returning to a house she is sharing with Lucy in Whitby , a seaside resort in Yorkshire , she sees her friend at the window , and by her side , on the sill , “ something that looked like a good - sized bird . ”
How strange !
Mina thinks .
It ’s not strange to us .
By then we know that the “ bird ” is a bat — one of the Count ’s preferred incarnations .
( Dracula will destroy Lucy before turning to Mina . )
Such counterpoint , of course , increases the suspense .
When are these people going to figure out what is going on ?
Finally , most of the narration is not just first person but on - the - moment , and therefore unglazed by memory .
“ We are to be married in an hour , ” Mina writes to Lucy as she sits by Jonathan ’s bed in a Budapest hospital .
( That ’s where he landed , with a brain fever , after escaping from Castle Dracula . )
He ’s sleeping now , Mina says .
She ’ll write while she can .
Oops !
“ Jonathan is waking ! ”
She must break off .
This minute - by - minute recording , as Samuel Richardson , its pioneer ( in “ Pamela ” ) , discovered a century and a half earlier , lends urgency — you are there !— and , again , it seems a warrant of truth .
But the narrative method is not the only thing that provides a tight receptacle for the story .
Most of this tale of the irrational is filtered through minds wedded to rationalism .
“ Dracula ” has what Noël Carroll , in “ The Philosophy of Horror ” ( 1990 ) , called a “ complex discovery plot ” — that is , a plot that involves not just the discovery of an evil force let loose in the world but the job of convincing skeptics ( which takes a lot of time , allowing the monster to compound his crimes ) that such a thing is happening .
No people , we are told , were more confident than the citizens of Victorian England .
The sun never set on their empire .
They were also masters of science and technology .
“ Dracula ” is full of exciting modern machinery — the telegraph , the typewriter , the “ Kodak ” — and the novel has an obsession with railway trains , probably the nineteenth century ’s most crucial invention .
The new world held no terrors for these people .
Nevertheless , they were bewildered by it , because of its challenge to religious faith , and to the emotions religion had taught : sweetness , comfort , reverence , resignation .
That crisis is recorded in work after work of late - nineteenth - century fiction , but never more forcibly than in “ Dracula . ”
In the opening pages of the novel , Harker , on his way to Castle Dracula , has arrived in Romania .
He complains of the lateness of the trains .
He describes a strange dish , paprika hendl , that he was given for dinner in a restaurant .
But he is English ; he can handle these things .
He does not yet know that the man he is going to visit has little concern for timetables — the Count has lived for hundreds of years — and dines on something more peculiar than paprika hendl .
Even when the evidence is in front of Harker ’s face , he can not credit it .
The coachman driving him to Castle Dracula ( it is the Count , in disguise ) is of a curious appearance .
He has pointed teeth and flaming red eyes .
This makes Harker , in his words , feel “ a little strangely . ”
Days pass , however , before he forms a stronger opinion .
The other characters are equally slow to get the point .
When Professor Abraham Van Helsing , the venerable Dutch physician who becomes the head of the vampire - hunting posse , suggests to his colleague John Seward that there may be a vampire operating in their midst , Seward thinks Van Helsing must be going mad .
“ Surely , ” he protests , “ there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things . ”
Van Helsing counters that not every phenomenon has a rational explanation : “ Do you not think that there are things in the world which you cannot understand , and yet which are ? ”
Throughout the novel , these self - assured people have to be convinced , with enormous difficulty , that there is something beyond their ken .
According to Nina Auerbach , in “ Our Vampires , Ourselves ” ( 1995 ) , Dracula ’s crimes are merely symbols of the real - life sociopolitical horrors facing the late Victorians .
One was immigration .
At the end of the century , Eastern European Jews , in flight from the pogroms , were pouring into Western Europe , thereby threatening to dilute the pure blood of the English , among others .
Dracula , too , is an émigré from the East .
Stoker spends a lot of words on the subject of blood , and not just when Dracula extracts it .
Fully four of the book ’s five vampire - hunters have their blood transfused into Lucy ’s veins , and this process is recorded with grisly exactitude .
( We see the incisions , the hypodermics . )
So Stoker may in fact have been thinking of the racial threat .
Like other novels of the period , “ Dracula ” contains invidious remarks about Jews .
They have big noses , they like money — the usual .
At that time , furthermore , people in England were forced , by the scandal of the Oscar Wilde trials ( 1895 ) , to think about something they had n’t worried about before : homosexuality .
Many scholars have found suggestions of homoeroticism in “ Dracula . ”
Auerbach , by contrast , finds the book annoyingly heterosexual .
Earlier vampire tales , such as Polidori ’s story and “ Carmilla , ” made room for the mutability of erotic experience .
In those works , sex did n’t have to be man to woman .
And it did n’t have to be outright sex — it might just be fervent friendship .
As Auerbach sees it , Stoker , spooked by the Wilde case , backed off from this rich ambiguity , thereby impoverishing vampire literature .
After him , she says , vampire art became reactionary .
This echoes Stephen King ’s statement that all horror fiction , by pitting an absolute good against an absolute evil , is “ as Republican as a banker in a three - piece suit . ”
According to some critics , another thing troubling Stoker was the New Woman , that turn - of - the - century avatar of the feminist .
Again , there is support for this .
The New Woman is referred to dismissively in the book , and the God - ordained difference between the sexes — basically , that women are weak but good , and men are strong but less good — is reiterated with maddening persistence .
On the other hand , Mina , the novel ’s heroine , and a woman of unquestioned virtue , looks , at times , like a feminist .
She works for a living , as a schoolmistress , before her marriage , and the new technology , which should have been daunting to a female , holds no mysteries for her .
She ’s a whiz as a typist — a standard New Woman profession .
Also , she is wise and reasonable — male virtues .
Nevertheless , her primary characteristic is a female trait : compassion .
( At one point , she even pities Dracula . )
Stoker , it seems , had mixed feelings about the New Woman .
Whether or not politics was operating in Stoker ’s novel , it is certainly at work in our contemporary vampire literature .
Charlaine Harris ’s Sookie Stackhouse series openly treats vampires as a persecuted minority .
Sometimes they are like black people ( lynch mobs pursue them ) , sometimes like homosexuals ( rednecks beat them up ) .
Meanwhile , they are trying to go mainstream .
Sookie ’s Bill has sworn off human blood , or he ’s trying ; he subsists on a Japanese synthetic .
He registers to vote ( absentee , because he cannot get around in daylight ) .
He wears pressed chinos .
This is funny but also touching .
In “ The Vampire Chronicles , ” Anne Rice also seems to regard her undead as an oppressed group .
Their suffering is probably , at some level , a story about AIDS .
All this is a little confusing morally .
How can we have sympathy for the Devil and still regard him as the Devil ?
That question seems to have occurred to Stephenie Meyer , who is a Mormon .
Edward , the featured vampire of Meyer ’s “ Twilight , ” is a dashing fellow , and Bella , the heroine , becomes his girlfriend , but they do not go to bed together ( because of the conversion risk ) .
Neither should you , Meyer seems to be saying to her teen - age readers .
They are compensated by the romantic fever that the sexual postponement generates .
The book fairly heaves with desire .
About Private Server
A Private server is a virtual machine which is privately administrated .
Servers need adequate power , internet connection and can be noisy .
They are mostly located in a collocation center .
Private Servers are available in the market in the same way as desktops or laptops are available and can be purchased individually .
Managed Dedicated Server Insight
Managed dedicated server includes the service of hardware , software , and ongoing upkeep of a dedicated server .
The dedicated server industry mostly provides bundles of additional services and products with the servers .
It offers a deeper level of management .
Managed dedicated server has full - time system administrators .
It offers the facility of not only more productivity , but also provides ease of mind for multitude of other issues .
It provides great security .
Moreover , security is a major factor in choosing not only a managed dedicated server but also in choosing a managed dedicated hosting company .
Get to know Managed Hosting
Managed hosting is an IT provisioning model in which a service provider leases the dedicated servers and associates the hardware to a single client .
Managed hosting is different from other dedicated hosting because in that the service provider administers the operating systems , hardware and system software .
The client has administrative access but as a rule , they rarely use it , instead of interacting with the leased system via Web - based interface .
The hosting provider is responsible for configuring and setting up the hardware .
It installs and configures software , patch management , system maintenance , monitoring , and updates .
It offers great technical support .
There are many other services available which may be either as a part of the hosting package or as an add - on .
It includes load balancing , backups disaster recovery and security processes .
It also includes intrusion detection ( ID ) , vulnerability scans and DDoS ( distributed denial of service ) prevention and mitigation .
Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) Technology
A virtual private server ( VPS ) is a system which implements multiple virtual machines on a physical server .
Virtual machines have long been used by computer manufacturers such as – HP , IBM , and many others on mainframes and servers .
In 2010 VPS use was increased by the Internet hosting providers ( ISP ) .
Virtualization makes it possible to use a large number of virtual servers on a single physical server .
It causes the physical server use in a much larger proportion of the time .
The use of virtual servers provides inherent security in addition .
Compromised VPS has no effect on other VPS on the same physical machine , like – shared web hosting usually is the case .
Virtualization is also be used to rotate different and non-interchangeable operating on the same computer .
Each VPS has their own RAM , their own processes , their own space , their own OS with their own server load and even their own file system .
Each VPS is completely independent .
VPS technology is about dividing a physical server into multiple smaller virtual servers .
Each VPS has its own share resources .
Managed Virtual Private Server
A Managed Virtual Private Server offers the peace of mind .
A fully managed server offers 99.9 % uptime guarantee .
There are various companies which offer 30 days money back guarantee with no hidden charges and 24/7 technical support .
They offer excellent technical support , which makes it simpler to use .
These companies offer various plans from which you can choose any of the plan as per your need & budget .
Until recently , the recording industry were committing publicity suicide by routinely issuing legal threats to file sharers .
Now , they seem to have changed the routine , going for fewer , but bigger targets .
The goal is clear : if you own the Internet , you do n't have to worry about pirates -- or anyone else .
Earlier this month , four Pirate Bay visionaries were given harsh fines and jail sentences .
Their only crime : creating the largest , free , uncensored , versatile file sharing platform on the Internet .
Soon after , Taiwan passed 3 - strikes legislation for copyright violations .
The recording industry is no longer targeting pirates – they are actually trying to hijack the very fabric of the Internet .
The apparent strategy :
1. Outlaw file sharing
2. Outlaw personal encryption and anonymization services
3 . Set up a global , privately - run Internet surveillance program to spy on everybody all the time without a warrant — run by ISPs and paid for by the taxpayers
4 . And finally , get the authority to block anyone from the Internet entirely , without the involvement of police , courts or any verifiable trail of evidence
We can not let this happen .
“ It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state . ” – Bruce Schneier
One of the main reasons why the recording industry are currently succeeding in this hostile takeover of the Internet , is that most people simply do n’t understand what file sharing is , or why it matters to them in the first place .
Whenever civil liberties are sacrificed , it is always on the bonfire of ignorance .
We need to educate the world – neighbors , parents , judges and lawmakers – as to why the Internet must remain free , neutral , and uncensored .
It sometimes helps to explain that a file sharing technology like Bittorrent is the digital society ’s equivalent of the wheel .
It allows fast and easy transportation of data between users and businesses alike .
But like the wheel , file sharing needs a stable , flat surface to perform at its best .
In this analogy , The Pirate Bay is nothing short of the largest , best maintained , and most stable network of such ‘ digital roads ’ in the world .
And it ’s free to use for anyone , at any time , for any purpose .
Naturally , as is always the case where people congregate in a free society , some of the people who drive their wheeled carts on this network of roads will be carrying things in their carts of questionable quality , purpose or origin .
In any system or society that is based on freedom rather than censorship or distrust , there is no question that individual transgressions can take place .
This is the most basic cost of liberty .
As a digital society in its teens , we have yet to realize the enormous potential of file sharing in culture , education , knowledge sharing , and business .
But already , we are seeing massive opposition against it from the likes of IFPI , the RIAA and the MPAA .
This opposition , of course , stems from some of the aforementioned wheeled carts transporting ‘ questionable goods ’ , in the form of copyrighted material .
The ensuing battle has been disguised as a legal matter concerning rights holders and ‘ pirates ’ , but that is only the tip of the iceberg .
It is true that the recording industry wants to stop criminals , but they are attempting to prohibit the wheel and all building of roads to pull it off .
These lawyers are prepared to sacrifice our liberties , our privacy and our digital freedom in order to reach their goal .
It is a grossly disproportionate and misdirected attack , and it has already begun :
Once the verdict of the Spectrial was in , the Swedish anti-piracy office immediately began issuing legal threats against other file sharing networks .
They are bulldozing every street and burning every car to prevent any possible ( mis ) use of the wheel .
And worse yet – we are letting it happen .
The case of The Pirate Bay was not a case of artists vs. freeloaders , or even the recording industry vs. pirates .
There were no artists on the accusing side , nor were there any pirates on the defending side .
It was , and is , a case of misguided frustration by industry executives and lawyers , directed not against the actual violators of copyright law , but against the most outspoken proponents and enablers of a fundmental digital technology .
A technology that allows fast and easy transportation af data – all data – between users and businesses alike .
We must never blame the network for the actions of individuals .
Both rights holders and lawmakers must respect the fundamental principle of personal , individual responsibility .
Let each peer be responsible for his own actions , just as every driver is liable for his own car .
The Pirate Bay is not illegal .
File sharing is not illegal .
Using file sharing for illegal purposes is illegal .
The difference may be subtle to a layman , but in legal terms , the distinction is clear as day .
The fact that the judges in the Pirate Bay case failed to recognize this , is a judicial travesty bordering on flat out corruption .
It can not be stressed enough : this is not a question of copyright , of music , or of piracy .
This is a question of a private organization now aiming to subvert several of the most important digital inventions since the World Wide Web , and our judges and politicians turning a blind eye in a staggering display of ignorance and corruption .
This fight is about much more than The Pirate Bay .
When our liberties are taken from us , we must rise , united in one voice , and fight for them .
It is a fight for basic digital liberties .
It is a fight for our right to privacy .
It is a fight for net neutrality .
There is no getting around it .
This is the fight of our generation , and it is too important to lose .

Bird flu is coming .
We 're all going to die .
Except me .
I 'm not going to die .
But you sure as hell are .
Genevieve Simms
The only thing that was missing was whiskey .
Six weeks ' worth .
Everything else was taken care of : food , water , medical supplies , and enough toilet paper to last a month or more .
We had piled the stuff — $ 360 worth of dry goods , nonperishables , canned foods , and paper supplies — onto a flatbed cart with a broken wheel and wheeled it around the South Seattle Cash and Carry , debating endlessly :
Do we really need four giant cans of Chef Boyardee ?
How much water should we really have on hand ?
Does it make sense to buy a bag of rice if the power 's going to be off anyway ?
Our shopping spree was inspired by avian influenza , a disease that had a brief moment in the media spotlight back in 2005 .
Since then , flu has largely disappeared from the stage in favor of climate change , hurricanes , and Paris Hilton .
But it has n't gone away .
It 's still mutating , jumping from species to species , and killing more people every year — four in 2003 , 32 in 2004 , 43 in 2005 , 79 in 2006 , and 33 so far in 2007 , according to the latest information from the World Health Organization .
Most of the dying is going on in places most of us do n't think about very often : Indonesia , Cambodia , Laos , Vietnam .
But when this flu mutates , as flus routinely do , into a kind of flu that 's easily caught by humans , it will be too late to confine it to poor nations in Southeast Asia .
Indeed , by the time you hear the first news report , it will be too late to do anything to stop it .
Every single person I spoke to for this article — epidemiologists , emergency health - care specialists , pandemic preparedness experts , and politicians — said the same thing :
The question is n't whether pandemic flu is coming , but when .
" Pandemics have happened throughout history , " says Meredith Li-Vollmer , a risk communications specialist for King County .
" There 's no question that it 's going to happen .
What we can't tell is when and how bad it 's going to be . "
Back at the Cash and Carry , we finished loading up our cart , our debates settled , and headed for the checkout lanes .
Then we loaded all the stuff into the Flexcar , drove it home , and lugged it down the stairs into the basement .
We 're ready for the pandemic — how about you ?
All flus begin as bird viruses .
Birds , particularly waterfowl , are the natural reservoir for every strain of influenza .
The virus that currently has public - health officials worried , known as H5N1 , is a particularly nasty , virulent flu strain that has been circulating in poultry in Asia since 2003 .
So far , the virus has mostly limited itself to people who come in frequent , direct contact with infected birds — poultry workers and people in isolated rural areas .
Right now , it 's bad , but it wo n't be really bad until the flu starts to move from person to person .
The current bird - to - human form of the virus kills an astonishing number of those it infects ; according to the World Health Organization , more than half of those who have contracted the virus from birds have died .
Its impact is greatest among the young ; in a study of more than 200 confirmed human avian flu cases conducted in early 2006 , WHO found that just over half of all cases were in people under 20 , and that the median age of those who caught the flu was 18 .
Of the youngest victims , the majority died ; the majority of those older than 50 survived .
" People my age just get sick and get better , " says King County Executive Ron Sims , 58 , the local public official most responsible for making bird flu a top health priority .
" This is a disease that attacks the young . "
Right now , people can only catch bird flu from infected birds ; however , the virus mutates constantly , making it highly likely that it will eventually learn to transmit itself easily from person to person .
Once that happens , a pandemic will occur .
The likelihood of pandemic is currently high , which is why WHO took the unusual step of increasing the world pandemic alert level from a 2 to a 3 ( pandemic is declared at the highest level , a 6 ) in 2005 .
The organization predicts that the world is now closer to a flu pandemic than at any time since 1968 , when the last of the 20th century 's three pandemics began .
The others were in 1957 and 1918 .
The 1918 pandemic killed between 40 million and 50 million people around the world .
The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were milder , in part because they were hybrid human - flu viruses , to which people have some immunity ; they killed one million and two million , respectively .
The current bird - flu virus worries scientists because it 's similar to the one that led to the 1918 pandemic .
In one of WHO 's " more conservative scenarios , " according to its strategic action plan for pandemic flu , there will be as many as 233 million outpatient visits , 5.2 million hospital admissions , and 7.4 million deaths worldwide .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that as much as 30 percent of the population of the U.S. could be infected ; in King County , officials predict that as many as 540,000 people could be infected , with as many as 18,000 deaths , according to Sims .
" This is something that will kill millions , " says Barb Graff , head of emergency preparedness for the Seattle Police Department .
" There will be no natural immunity .
There will be no vaccine . "
And because the disease can take weeks to kill its victims , it will spread very easily from person to person .
King County , thanks in large part to the vigilant efforts of County Executive Sims , is perhaps the best - prepared county in the nation .
Unfortunately , that does n't mean we 're actually prepared .
If a severe pandemic hit tomorrow , King County would be in serious trouble .
Hospitals , which have almost no excess capacity , would overflow immediately ; the movement of goods through the port and freight rail systems would slow to a crawl ; medicine supplies would run out ; the mortuaries would fill up ; and many basic functions of government would cease .
" Ebola , " which struck in Africa in the mid-1990s , " kills people by the hundreds and ends because it kills them quickly , " says Sims , who 's so obsessed with bird flu that he puts Purell alcohol gel on his phone , keyboard , and doorknobs every morning .
" This virus is n't like that .
It 's a mean virus , " and death comes slowly .
" You die with your lungs full of water . "
Think about all the people you come into contact with in a day .
Simple acts like using an ATM , riding the bus , boarding a plane — all put us in contact with the fingerprints , bodily fluids , and germs of hundreds , sometimes thousands , of people .
Flu can survive on nonporous surfaces , like steel and plastic , for up to 48 hours , and on paper and cloth for up to 12 hours .
That means that when you touch the plastic bin at the airport , the germs of everyone who 's touched it before you for the last two days are now yours .
Touch your eyes , rub your nose , eat a sandwich without washing your hands , and you 're infected .
The last time I flew , from Sea - Tac to Austin , I used an American Airlines e- ticket machine that had been touched by hundreds of people over the last 48 hours .
Then I lugged my suitcase into a long line behind a family of six , a couple of whom were sniffling .
I gave my luggage to the airline representative , touching the steel counter and setting my plastic ID on top of it .
I waited through the security line — handing my ID and ticket to yet another airport worker — and put my carry - on , laptop , and shoes in a plastic bin where someone else 's luggage and shoes had been before .
I walked through the line , put my shoes back on , and made my way to the crowded gate .
There I sat in close proximity to other passengers , many of them making connections from other places , before boarding .
On the plane , I was squeezed in between a man and a woman ; a crying child squirmed and coughed behind me .
Several hundred of us shared the same tiny space , the same recirculated air , for nearly five hours .
I probably came into contact with a thousand people on my trip , all without talking to anyone or shaking a single hand .
Our lives are a microbiological disaster waiting to happen .
Previous pandemics took six to nine months to travel around the world ; today , thanks to globalization and air travel , a flu pandemic is expected to reach all parts of the world within just three months .
" Once a pandemic begins , it 's not feasible to think that it can be stopped , " says Michael Loehr , head of the preparedness program at King County .
" We 're acting under the assumption that once things start spreading from human to human , it 's going to happen here . "
Flu spreads the same way as all viral infections — through respiratory secretions , droplets released into the air when people cough or sneeze .
The closer people are to one another , the more likely they are to catch the flu .
The most effective tool for slowing flu transmission — far more effective than quarantine and isolation of infected patients , which only work during the first days of a pandemic — is to keep people from getting together .
Officially , this strategy is called " social distancing " — using police power to prevent people from gathering in large groups .
If a pandemic hits , and if the flu is virulent and severe , Sims says the county will impose social distancing as soon as it confirms five cases .
That means no school , no church , no concerts , no professional sports .
Children , notes Jeff Duchin , head of King County 's communicable disease program , are " very effective carriers " of viruses , so closing down all the schools will be an important step in limiting the flu's spread .
Closing down the schools , in turn , will mean a big hit to the local economy , as businesses lose workers who have to stay home to take care of their kids ( to say nothing of the quarter to one - third of all workers who are expected to fall ill ) .
Although Duchin says social distancing " does n't mean we 're going to encourage people to close down restaurants " and other small businesses , he adds , " we would n't encourage " keeping them open , either .
Sims goes further , suggesting that he might invoke police power to shut businesses down .
If the worst happens — if people stop going to work , if businesses are shut down , if the power and water get disrupted — the city of Seattle will look much different .
The normal bustle of small - business operations — people walking in and out of restaurants , cars driving into gas stations for beer and cigarettes , workers lining up at Starbucks — will cease .
If there 's no power , Seattle will be a dark spot on the map .
If there 's no water , there will be raids on grocery stores — by people wearing masks because they fear being infected by the other looters , not because they fear being identified by the police .
As unlikely as that scenario seems , that 's exactly what happened after Hurricane Katrina , as the realization dawned on people that no one — not the federal government , not the state — was going to help them .
They had to help themselves .
That can happen just as easily here in 2007 as in New Orleans in 2005 .
County health officials seem convinced that voluntary compliance with social distancing measures will be high — that is , people will stay home willingly to avoid getting sick .
Li-Vollmer , the King County risk communications specialist , says that at a flu preparedness forum the county put on with the CDC earlier this year , " the vast majority of people said they would be willing to support " measures to keep people from congregating .
However , she acknowledges that those were " people who were willing to come to a forum on pan flu , a self - selecting group of people who are already interested in the subject . "
Among the general population , officials ' optimism seems excessive : People are creatures of habit , and if you tell them not to go to church , or to cancel travel plans , or that they can't have a funeral for a loved one , they 're likely to rebel .
When that happens , people will get sick .
When they do , even the most optimistic officials predict that the existing health - care system will be overwhelmed almost immediately .
" If we were to have a severe pandemic tomorrow , our [ health - care ] planning would not be complete , " says Dorothy Teeter , the chief of health operations for King County .
King County has between 3,500 and 4,000 hospital beds ; on any given day , 90 percent of them are full .
If more than a few of the 540,000 sick people in King County need to go to the hospital ( and they will ) , they 'll quickly find they do n't have anywhere to go .
" There 's going to be a run on every hospital around here , " Sims says .
" We can discharge people to free up capacity , but we 'll never have enough . "
Ventilators , drugs , even things as simple as hospital bedsheets , will be in short supply .
" If we have anything more than a moderate pan flu , we wo n't have enough hospital beds , " Teeter says .
" In any health - care emergency , we 're outstripped . "
Hospitals , overwhelmed by the influx of patients , will have to discharge patients who are n't critically ill , cancel all elective surgeries , and send many sick people to so - called " alternate care facilities , " large public places like gyms and community centers that have been recommissioned to serve as makeshift hospitals .
Teeter expects that there will be three such alternate care facilities in the region ; however , none have yet been identified .
There 's also the question of inequality of care :
What happens to people who have the misfortune to get sick in a poor part of town , or while homeless ?
" You can't have one hospital having a surplus and everyone else having nothing , " Loehr says .
To that end , the county has put together a health - care coalition — an organization that will coordinate flu response efforts between all the health - care entities and hospitals in the region .
" The health - care system is very fractured , competitive , and independent .
It 's important that the system work as a system , " Loehr says .
Aspects of the health - care coalition were put into effect during last December 's windstorm , enabling health - care workers , for example , to get people in nursing homes without power to places that still had electricity .
Mortuaries will also be overrun with bodies ; estimates range between 12,000 and 18,000 deaths in a six - week period for a county that usually sees 13,000 deaths in a year .
The state and federal governments will be unable to provide disaster relief , because people will be sick everywhere at once .
Many health - care workers will be sick , putting more strain on a system that 's stretched thin already .
Nationwide , there 's already a shortage of 100,000 nurses ; the system can't afford to lose a third of its already meager work force .
Medications , likewise , are in short supply ; most hospitals have only enough inventory for a few days , and the sudden spike in demand during a pandemic would correspond exactly with a period of limited supply .
" Everyone thinks hospitals have drugs on site .
Well , they do for that day , but they do n't have any backlog , " Sims says .
" The more you think about how daunting it is , the more it starts to overwhelm you . "
Seattle City Council member and health board member Tom Rasmussen , who has been an advocate for the elderly and disabled on the council , says that when people with mental - health problems and other disabilities can't get their medication , " that is a huge problem .
I met a woman recently who has bipolar depression .
Without her meds , she would be on the street screaming at people . "
King County and other health agencies recommend that people keep a few weeks ' supply of extra medication on hand ; however , most insurance companies will only dole out a month 's worth at a time , making that option unrealistic for those who can't buy extra medication at full price .
The county is also stockpiling enough of the antiviral drug Tamiflu to treat 25 percent of the population , the goal of local governments nationwide ; however , those doses will be targeted at health - care workers and others on the front lines of the pandemic , not the general population .
And there 's no guarantee Tamiflu will work against pandemic flu anyway .
In a best - case scenario , Tamiflu might lessen the severity of illness in the very sick , but only if they manage to take it on time — within 24 hours of infection .
( Meanwhile , there 's no vaccine , because the flu has to break out before a vaccine can be developed , a process that takes between four and six months . )
While all that is going on , businesses and government agencies will be hard hit , losing as many as 30 percent of their work force on any given day .
Health officials suggest that businesses cross -train workers to do other people 's jobs , a strategy that may work in government and at places like Boeing but that 's likely to be tough for small businesses to swallow .
" The larger businesses take it very seriously , but smaller businesses do n't have a lot of extra resources lying around , " Loehr says .
The Stranger , which has about 70 employees , does not have a specific plan for pandemic flu .
If — when — the pandemic hits , Li-Vollmer says staying home is the best protection .
" If you 're at home , " she says , " you 're not circulating among people who have the virus . "
Health officials all agree that you should have a stockpile of food , water , and medication .
What they do n't agree on is how big that stockpile should be .
King County 's current preparedness campaign recommends that people prepare for " three days , three ways " — make a plan , build a three - day emergency kit , and get involved in your community .
However , although virtually every official I talked to for this story had their own stockpile ( see sidebar , " What 's in Their Stockpiles , " page 23 ) , they all agreed that three days wo n't cover it when the flu hits Seattle .
Here 's what 's in my personal stockpile :
One 20 - pound bag of rice ; one gallon jar of pickles ; four 40 - ounce cans of Chef Boyardee ravioli ( a childhood indulgence I would never allow myself to have in " real " life ) ; two weeks ' worth of bottled water , allocating one gallon per person per day ; several assorted cans of beans ; several large cans of soup ; a large box of crackers ; a half - gallon jar of peanut butter ; canned vegetables , including corn and green beans ; several pounds of pasta and jars of pasta sauce ; a half - dozen aseptically packaged boxes of broth and soup ; cereal ; vitamins ; toilet paper ; tea ; and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember .
Most of my coworkers think I 'm an overprepared nut .
According to the state department of health 's checklist , though , I 'm actually underprepared .
I still need medication , a digital thermometer , cold packs , extra toothpaste and soap , games , cash , and large trash bags .
Assuming I do n't get sick , I could " survive in place " for two weeks or longer — staying at home while the flu rages outside — assuming the boredom would n't kill me first .
" Seventy - two hours works in an earthquake or a tsunami , " says Sims , referring to " Three Days , Three Ways . " " [ But a ] pandemic is a rule changer .
You can not prepare for it .
You buy two weeks of supplies , and in two weeks you 're going to have to go out and buy more . "
Some advocate solving that problem by simply building a bigger stockpile .
" I recommend highly that you take all the information you 've ever been given about earthquake preparedness and multiply it by six , " SPD emergency preparedness director Graff says .
" The way I put it is , get ready to go urban camping .
Three days of supplies is n't nearly adequate . "
For those who do n't have the resources or the storage space to do that ( aka apartment dwellers ) , the health department recommends relying on family , friends , and neighbors — a hard sell in a city where most of us do n't know the people in the apartment next door .
Think city living is impersonal and isolating now ?
When the flu hits , you 're really going to be on your own .
Let 's say — it 's possible — that none of this comes true .
No flu , no panicked raids on grocery stores by the less prepared , no corpses stacking up in temporary morgues while I hole up in my house and wait it out .
My stockpile , now augmented by whiskey , wo n't go to waste .
If a year goes by without a disaster , I 'm having a disaster party and using up everything that wo n't keep .
But then I 'm going out and buying more .

Given the inevitability that these countries will have a growing influence , the London summit meeting , which begins Thursday , is likely to be remembered “ as the last hurrah for the U.S. and Europe rescuing the world economy , ” said Simon Johnson , a professor at M.I.T. and a former chief economist of the fund .
One reason the I.M.F. has emerged as such a popular cause is that the United States has been unable to rally countries behind its other major priority : economic stimulus .
The European Union opposes further stimulus packages in 2010 , arguing that its social safety net makes an increase in government spending unnecessary .
European and American officials are also still divided , to a lesser degree , on how to rewrite international financial regulations .
France and Germany are more receptive than the United States to giving regulators supranational authority to scrutinize global banks and other financial companies .
“ The United States is desperately trying to assert leadership , as if it were 10 years ago , when the U.S. set the agenda , ” said Kenneth S. Rogoff , an economist at Harvard and another former chief economist of the fund .
With more countries slipping into crisis by the week , there is general agreement that the fund needs additional resources .
Since last year , the I.M.F. has made nearly $ 50 billion in loans to 13 countries .
It is streamlining the process for making loans and loosening its strings , hoping to counter the resentment that built up against it during past crises because of its stringent demands .
At a preparatory meeting two weeks ago , finance ministers of the Group of 20 agreed to “ very substantially ” increase financing , though the Europeans favored an extra $ 250 billion , not $ 500 billion .
Whatever their reservations about financing , the Chinese have seized on the fund for another purpose : to tweak the United States .
The governor of China ’s central bank , Zhou Xiaochuan , recently proposed that the American dollar be phased out as the world ’s default reserve currency .
As a replacement , he suggested using special drawing rights , or S.D.R. ’s , the synthetic currency created by the fund that is used for transactions between it and its 185 member countries .
Ameneh Bahrami poses on March 5 , 2009 in Barcelona .
Bahrami , of Iran , was blinded by a man who threw acid in her face .
In 2008 an Iranian court ruled that the man -- identified only as Majid -- a spurned suitor who poured a bucket of sulfuric acid over her head , leaving her blind and disfigured , should also be blinded with acid , based on the Islamic law system of ' qisas ' , or eye for an eye retribution .
Ms Bahrami has said that she is now waiting for a letter from the court to go back to Iran for the punishment to be carried out .

Authors ' Quotes on Antidepressants and School Shootings
( NaturalNews ) A 17 - year - old former student opened fire near Stuttgart , Germany , killing at least 16 people .
The teenager was a former student at a Winnenden school , where he initiated the shooting spree .
Three teachers and at least 10 students were killed by his actions .
The media is reporting that Tim Kretschmer , " walked calmly into three classrooms and opened fire , without saying a word . "
Following the shooting at his school , Tim ran to a psychiatric clinic school and killed an employee there .
( Did he have a link to the psychiatric staff members there ? ) A day earlier , a man in his mid-30 's opened fire in Alabama , killing ten people before he was shot and killed by law enforcement .
In seeing the news reports on these events , the ignorant masses quite predictably leaped to the conclusion that " guns are the problem . "
Apparently in their minds , these shootings were carried out solely by guns and have nothing whatsoever to do with the people pulling the triggers .
But the truth is far more insidious :
It is thein America , Germany and elsewhere .
These dangerous psychiatric medications drastically imbalance brain chemistry , causing teens ( and adults ) to feel distanced from reality , as if they are walking through a video game .
In fact , this was exactly how the Columbine school shooters described their experience of carrying out the infamous shootings in Colorado .
The report that Germany 's shooter , Tim Kretschmer , " walked calmly into three classrooms and opened fire , without saying a word " is a strong indication that he was almost certainly suffering the brain - altering side effects of psychiatric medication .
The pharmaceutical companies , of course , incessantly attempt to deny the reality that their drugsschool shootings .
In fact , their psychiatric drugs actually cause the very same things they often claim to treat !
Antidepressants , for example , can cause depression , suicidal thoughts and violent behavior .
They also directly promote weight gain , obesity and diabetes , and those health conditions can then lead to more depression , requiring more " treatment " with medication .
It 's all a gigantic scam .
These drug companies are just selling patented chemicals for profit while destroying the lives of human beings in the process .
In my view , .
Read the jaw - dropping collection of quotes ( below ) from authors on this issue to learn even more .
Not surprisingly , the mainstream media remains virtually silent on this issue , not even mentioning any link between psychiatric drugs and school shootings .
The media , you see , is largely funded by drug company advertisements .
A truly remarkable documentary film on the history of psychiatric medication is now available through CCHR ( the Citizens ' Commission on Human Rights ) .

Reports in the media began suggesting thatmight be behind the horrific murders that shook the nation .
These stories typically noted that Andrea Yates ( Houston bathtub drownings ) , Kip Kinkel ( Jonesboro , Arkansas , shootings ) , Eric Harris ( Columbineshootings ) and Christopher Pittman ( South Carolina grandparents murdered ) were on or had been on .
The relationship betweenagainst others andagainst self is apparent .

The SSRIare especially liable to produce extremely irrational and sometimes horrendously violent acts .
Despite mountains of evidence , they were avidly denying thatcan cause mayhem , murder , and .
From the moment Prozac burst on the scene in 1989 , to the start of the FDA hearings onin 2004 , many stories of antidepressant - inducedandhad been reported in the press .
Hundreds more had been sent to the FDA and had even been published in the scientific literature concerning antidepressant - induced " harm to self and others .
However , mania is by no means the only waycan induce .
The SSRI , as well as some othersuch as Wellbutrin and Desyrel ( trazodone ) cause akathisia .
In earlier chapters , I described this drug - induced neurological condition that can become a virtual inner torture of irritation and anguish .
Akathisia can drive a person toward bizarre and even violent actions .
SSRIs can also cause a loosening of inhibition or self - control , leading to unanticipated acts of Many doctors seem to believe thatwill reduce the likelihood of a patient attempting or committing .
The labels forwarn about being careful aboutbut they emphasize that this care is required until the antidepressant can take effect .
This falsely implies thatcan reduce the danger of .
After reviewing the vast literature and after examining the internal records of several antidepressant makers , it is absolutely clear thatdo not reduce therate .
Andrew Mosholder , the task of investigating the emerging ( though it had been around for years ) evidence of a link betweenandattempts in children .
As he was told to , he did his job and filed his report , but the FDA refused to release it .
They also refused to allow him to participate in public hearings onthat were conducted in February 2004 .
Why ?
Our belief is that it is because of his finding that children who takeare two times more likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors than depressed children who are not givenClassic papers dating as far back as the 1930s describe the risk with amphetamine .
For decades pharmaceutical companies and drug proponents adamantly denied the phenomenon , but by the 1970s , when strict limitations were imposed on prescribing amphetamines , their ability to triggerandhad been firmly established .
In the 1980s , a similar phenomenon was recognized with tricyclic , the class of drugs used between the fall of amphetaminein the 1970s and the rise of serotonin boosters in the 1990s .
On July 16 , 2005 , BMJ ( formerly known as the British Medical Journal ) , in a major review article ( " Efficacy ofin Adults " ) , summarized the research on the long - term outcome ofthis way : " Antidepressants have not been convincingly shown to affect the long - term outcome of depression orrates . "
Todayare increasingly used by Americans who are not severely depressed , and they are being prescribed on a long - term basis .
The previously mentioned 2000 ABC News poll reported that 46 percent of antidepressant users had taken them for a year or more .
The cases and scientific evidence presented in this book should convincingly demonstrate thatcause .
Given that psychiatric drugs can cause , is there evidence that any of them actually reduce suicide ?
The answer is no .
Particularly in the case of the , drug companies and their paid researchers have tried for years to show that these drugs reduce therate , but no compelling evidence has been forthcoming .
Given that this conservative diagnostic manual makes clear thatcause mania and that mania can produce goal - directed criminal acts , anger , , depression , and , no physician should doubt thatcause acts ofor .
Unfortunately , despite clinical experience , scientific data , and a consensus of opinion among experts , many doctors refuse to believe that their medications are sometimes driving patients to crime , , and Adults whose symptoms worsen while being treated with , including an increase in suicidal thinking or behavior , should be evaluated by their health - care professional .
The data convinced even the FDA hardliners .
Belatedly , the agency issued warnings about suicidal thinking and .
These cautions came far too late to prevent many terrible tragedies over nearly 2 decades .
As difficult as it has been for psychiatrists and FDA officials to contemplate , people taking SSRI - typeare sometimes preoccupied with thoughts ofor homicide .
Adults in Taiwan and Korea , whereare rarely used , have very low rates of major depression .
Adults in America , Canada and France , whereare commonly prescribed , have much higher rates .
Are western people born inherently inferior to Asian people mentally ; that is , more prone to develop a mental disease ?
In 1950 , when noexisted , therates for children and young people were less than half the rates for those same age groups in 2000 despite dramatic growth in antidepressant use among America 's youth .
Perhaps the most dangerous misconception is that the seriously depressed can better be prevented frombythan any other therapeutic technique .
Not only is there no such proof , but SSRIactually increase suicidal thoughts and behavior for some patients .
In 2004 , the FDA ordered thatcarry a " black box " warning , the government 's strongest warning , alerting consumers to the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behavior among children and teens taking them .
The availability of graduated doses , 5 - and 10 - milligram pills , would have undermined this advantage over all otheravailable at the time .
Likewise , had the FDA decided to add a warning onandto the label of , this would have necessitated closer monitoring of patients , markedly reducing Prozac 's unique appeal for primary - care clinicians .
Another memo makes clear that dosing problems were brought to Lilly 's attention again not long after the drug went on the market .
As this book goes to press , a research team led by Kirsch ( 2008 ) has once again produced a meta- analysis of the scientific literature demonstrating the ineffectiveness of .
It is a sad , ironic , and tragic tale :
It 's impossible to prove thatactually relieve depression but it 's relatively easy to demonstrate that they can worsen depression and cause mania , murder , and .
If my colleagues wanted to be scientific about it , they would call them " depressants " rather than , and take them off the market .
Paxil is not substantially different from Prozac , Zoloft , Luvox , Celexa , Effexor , Wellbutrin , or any other of the newerin its capacity to cause overstimulation and a variety of other dangerous adverse mental reactions .
If Paxil causesin adults , so do the other .
As already described , the FDA has mandated clear warnings that are identical for the drugs .
But because it is so short - acting and potent , Paxil probably poses a more frequent and more severe risk than some of the other Madhukar Trivedi , a clinical psychiatrist who is the director of the Mood Disorders Research Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical , has been researching the effectiveness of using exercise to augment .
In 2006 he published a pilot study showing that patients who were n't responding tolowered their scores on a common depression test by 10.4 points on a 17 - point scale -- a huge drop -- after twelve weeks of exercise .
All seventeen patients were deeply depressed and had been takingfor at least four months .
Children using venlafaxine ( Effexor ) -- a serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) -- had a 2.3 times greater risk ofattempts compared with no drug treatment at all .
Tricyclicwere also significantly linked withattempts .
They divided the people into two groups -- those who had receivedand those who had not .
They found that children between the ages of six and 18 who were takingwere 1.5 times more likely to attemptand 15 times more likely to die in that attempt than individuals not treated with an antidepressant .
Express Scripts reported in 2003 that in a five - year period ( 1998 - 2002 ) the use ofin children increased from 1.6 per 100 to 2.4 per 100 -- an adjusted annual increase of 9.2 percent , with the fastest - growing segment of users being preschoolers ( newborns to 5 years old ) .
As a follow up to the FDA 's revelations about the adverse effects associated with , Express Scripts updated its study , reporting " the prevalence of antidepressant use in children continued to rise through the first half of 2004 .
Still , though , there is the matter of the 2004 public hearings , where once again , due to the public outcry , the FDA was forced to revisit the issue of suicidality and SSRIs due to an ever - increasing number of claims that the mind - altering ( including Prozac ) were causing suicidal thoughts and other harmful behaviors .
What does Breggin conclude ?
" Lilly continued to hide the documents and the data at the 2004 FDA hearings on pediatric suicidality caused by .
At the hearings Tom Laughren of the FDA said that he knew of no data linking SSRIs toor hostility .
An estimated 500,000 grade - school children are now taking .
In the teen years , this high rate of depression translates into a tragically high number of suicides and attempted suicides .
The teenrate has increased threefold since 1960 , making it the third leading cause of death among adolescents .
But a very well - kept secret , revealed by considering all the research , is that the actual rate of death fromis higher in patients who take the newthan in those who take the older tricyclics .
Even more important , twice as many people taking the newsuccessfully committedthan did the people who took placebos .
And it is here that even those who continue to believe in the usefulness ofoverwhelmingly fault the industry .
The most charitable read it as a case of fragmented decision making and regulatory numbness .
Others assert that it was all about maintaining sales .
Whatever you believe about motivation , you can be certain that every major SSRI maker fudged when it came to reporting publicly the rate of , suicidal ideation , andassociated with use of their drug .
What 's more , for almost all the drugs , except Prozac , there was no evidence from the clinical trials in children that theworked any better at relieving depression than a placebo or dummy pill .
British authorities moved in late 2003 to try to stop the drugs being prescribed to children .
A year later authorities in the U.S. demanded that companies add a " black box " warning to antidepressant labels -- more than a decade after the drugs had first appeared on the market .
According to independent analysis of the clinical trials -- almost all of which have been funded by their manufacturers -- on average the advantages of theseover placebo or dummy pills are modest at best , yet their side effects can include sexual problems , severe withdrawal , reactions , and an apparent increase in the risk of suicidal behavior among the young .
Somewhat ironically , part of the marketing of these newhas played directly on fears thatcould result if a young person 's depression was left untreated .
The world - record Donkey Kong score hardly seems like fuel for controversy , and in the larger world , it has n't inspired any .
But a microscopic look at the competitive arcade - gaming scene reveals high levels of anxiety , rivalry , and bad blood .
The King Of Kong , a terrific documentary produced by Ed Cunningham and directed by Seth Gordon , details the rivalry between Billy Mitchell , an arcade - game legend since the early ' 80s , and Steve Wiebe , a nice guy who came out of nowhere to challenge the champ .
That may sound like niche entertainment for nerds , but the story that develops — spurred partly by Mitchell 's outsized personality and partly by the filmmakers ' framing — becomes a hilariously universal story of good vs. evil , with [ necessary spoiler ahead ] the challenger coming out victorious .
The King Of Kong trailer
The story did n't end with the movie , though : Billy Mitchell , a successful restaurant owner and hot - sauce mogul in Florida , unsurprisingly took umbrage at the way he was portrayed .
Though the beginning of the film paints him as a hard - working businessman who bettered himself via the same principles that made him good at gaming , it quickly casts him as a man who a ) may have sent minions to examine his rival 's game console , b ) wo n't face a worthy opponent in a live match , c ) may have cheated to keep his title , and d ) is generally self - absorbed and awful .
To what degree those things are true is a matter of debate .
While Mitchell claims to this day that he has n't seen the movie , he insists ( in the few interviews he 's given ) that he was portrayed unfairly , and that the film is inaccurate .
That 's where The A.V. Club was willing to leave things — with an excellent documentary that , like all documentaries , can't possibly paint a completely accurate picture .
Until about a week before the DVD release of The King Of Kong , when Billy Mitchell called our office .
Advertisement
He was ostensibly just thanking us for ordering some of his hot sauce — and looking for our suite number for the shipment — but after I 'd chatted with him for about 10 minutes , I asked if he'd like to continue our conversation , and make it an official interview .
He agreed , and an hour of sometimes - pointed , sometimes - rambling conversation followed .
To his credit , Mitchell is well aware that a Donkey Kong score is n't the most important thing on earth , or even in his life .
But he 's at least slightly bitter — and heartily determined to get his side of the story across .
He comes across as friendly but almost amazingly self - centered , and a good deal more charming than Kong lets on .
( Some of the DVD 's bonus footage offers a better glimpse into what may be the " real " Billy . )
He had plenty to say about specific points the movie raises — for instance , he says that in one key scene , the filmmakers edited out several seconds to make it look like he snubbed his nice - guy rival .
In the interest of fairness , The A.V. Club tracked down Ed Cunningham and Seth Gordon to respond to some of the allegations .
And the saga continues .
What follows is two separate conversations that took place about a week apart , the first with Mitchell , and the second with Cunningham and Gordon .
They 're edited together for the purposes of clarity and flow .
On Billy Mitchell 's patriotic neckwear :
Billy Mitchell :
You see me in the movie , and I 'm wearing different types of patriotic ties .
You saw the movie .
What impression did the movie give you ?
And then I 'll tell you the real truth .

The A.V. Club :
Well , the movie clearly makes you out to be the bad guy .
Or do you mean specifically about the ties ?
BM : Did I come across like a staunch Republican , or like a NRA guy or a 9/11 guy , or something like that ?
The truth is , I started wearing those ties to competitions in 1999 , because in the race for a perfect game of Pac - Man , there was another guy , a counterpart from Canada who 's really good , and we were in our race , in our quest for a perfect game .
He called himself Captain Canada , and he actually wore a Canadian cape , a flag .
I just was n't gonna be that goofy .
The American flag tie 's about as goofy as I would go .
Sometimes interviews take a funny angle like that .
Sometimes they want real serious questions about truth and lies and deception .
And sometimes they just want the humor , the funny stories , and that 's fine , too .
And whatever you wanna do is fine .

The filmmakers , on Billy 's personality :
AVC : What 's your honest assessment of Billy as a person ?
Is he a bad guy ?
My feeling after speaking with him is that he 's kind of an egomaniac , but not a terrible person .

Ed Cunningham :
My on - the - record comment is " No comment . "
It 's not our job to stamp someone and say that they 're this or they 're that .
All of us live in gray areas , so , depending on your point of view of the film …
Everyone 's had different reactions to Billy in different ways .
It 's not up to us to judge what 's on the screen , that 's for the audience to judge .
AVC : Did the film do a good job humanizing him ?
The extra footage on the DVD makes him out to be a nicer guy than the actual film .
Advertisement
EC : Here 's what I 'd ask you to do , and it 's kind of a ridiculous ask :
Go back and watch the film again , because for whatever reason , because of what happens at [ arcade ]
Funspot and then what transpires at Guinness , people kind of forget everything that was said at the beginning of the film about Billy .
We spend the first 20 minutes of the film talking about how great Billy is , that he 's got a great business , that he 's used gaming to influence the rest of his life , to seek perfection with his family , with his business .
That he bought and delivered a Q - Bert machine to [ an elderly gamer ] and sent her to Funspot .
All of that stuff is covered in the film .
It 's almost like those things are forgotten as the story unfolds .
AVC : Did you make conscious editing choices to set up a clearer good - guy / bad - guy dynamic , though ?
Advertisement
EC : Our goal was to represent them as truthfully as we witnessed them .
Seth Gordon : I would say to represent it as it unfolded for us , in the sense that when we first met Billy , he was amazing , and everyone talked about him like he was amazing and perfect , and this sort of gamer of the century — there was a whole sort of rehearsed legend of Billy that we were very persuaded by , and very excited by .
And when we were putting the piece together , we arced out our own experience of him , including , as time went on , the sort of hypocrisy of his actions .
Not because we were interested in painting him in one way or another , just showing what we witnessed .
Also , we were part of an elaborate chess game that he 's been playing for 20 years with this group of guys , and we were uncovering stuff that I do n't think he wanted uncovered .
That 's a really interesting puzzle to pick apart as a documentarian .

On Mitchell 's refusal to see the movie :
AVC : What if I sent you a copy of the movie , and you watched it and then we could chat after that ?
And you could directly address some things …
Advertisement
BM : You can't send me a copy of the movie .
Number one , it 's not out on DVD [ Editor 's note :
This interview was conducted before the film 's recent DVD release . ] , so what you got , you can't send to me .
I could have gotten it a long time ago illegally .
And I 'm not gonna do that .
But I think you 're gonna have a hard time believing the fact that I kinda know everything about the movie , since every day I open my computer and reviews are forwarded to me , including video clips and all that .
Plus , I got a good memory .
On the controversial scene in Florida , in which Billy and his wife enter Funspot and appear to snub Steve Wiebe : ( In the film , Wiebe says , " Hi Billy , " and Mitchell ignores him , walks away , and tells his wife , " There 's certain people I do n't wanna spend too much time with . " )

AVC : Let me ask you about a specific scene in the movie …
BM : Okay , I 'm ready .
You 're gonna ask me about the scene where I walk behind Steve .
Advertisement
AVC : Yeah .
BM : Do you believe that I actually told you the question you were gonna ask me ?
So find humor in that , and go ahead and put it in your review .
Advertisement
AVC : I 'd guess this is a question you 're getting a lot .
BM : Either that , or I can read your mind , and you should hang up the phone quickly .
Recall the scene in your mind .
I 'm walking with my wife — my trophy wife , which we 'll talk about later .
Um , what part of the country are you in ?
Chicago ?
Is that where you were born ?
Or where you grew up ?
Advertisement
AVC : I grew up in Milwaukee .
BM : Very good .
That plays a point later …
We 're on the record here so , I 'm gonna watch what I wanna tell you .
Are we on the record ?
Advertisement
AVC : Yes .
BM : After spending a night out with my family , and dropping off one of the people who was participating in the contest there , I went to drive away , and my wife said , " You do n't wanna go inside ? "
And so we walked in , and Ed Cunningham put the microphone on me .
I did n't have any objection to that .
I would n't — I mean , I do n't have anything negative , period .
Walking into the arcade , I went game to game , and at each game , I reminded my wife who the person was that was playing .
One of the very first games — I do n't know that it was the first , but it was one of the first — was Steve playin ' Donkey Kong .
And as I walked past him …
Now you 've got the movie in your mind , the camera is looking at me from behind or from the front ?
As I 'm walking toward him .
Advertisement
AVC : I do n't recall .
BM : You 've gotta watch this movie , man !
I 'm givin ' you these test questions !
Okay , so the camera 's watchin ' us , and as we walk past him , this guy in the movie [ Sarcastically . ] who I 've never met and I 've never even said hello to , because I 'm so nasty and arrogant …
As I was just about behind him , he turned and he said , " Hi , Billy . "
Okay .
You do n't really — somebody you 've never met — would you just say " Hi , Billy , " that casually ?
Then it cuts from a perfectly good camera angle that 's following us to the opposite side , where me and my wife continue walking , and I say something to the effect of , " Some people , I do n't wanna spend too much time talking to . "
Is that what you 're talking about ?
Advertisement
AVC : Yes .
BM : Okay .
Now this is what you do for a living ?
I 'm only being funny here to drive a point home .
I do n't want you to put across that I was mean to you , because I 'm not , I 'm happy here .
But let 's think of this :
This is what you do for a living ?
Now I 'm gonna say it again , and you tell me what this means : " Some people , I do n't wanna spend too much time talking to . "
You do n't hear somethin ' in that ?
Advertisement
AVC : I 'm not getting it .
You 'll have to let me know what I 'm missing .
BM : I obviously stood there and talked to him .
" Some people , I do n't wanna spend too much time talking to . "
That 's why they cut one camera angle to the other , ' cause when I stood behind him , and I waited for the precise moment , knowing Donkey Kong …
You know where the monkey falls down on its head ?
You 've got like , maybe 10 seconds of little rhetoric that you can , whatever , without disturbing somebody ?
And I reminded my wife , " This is Steve , remember we met him ?
He 's the guy from Seattle .
He 's the other Donkey Kong guy . "
She goes , " Oh , yeah . "
I go , " How they treatin ' ya ? "
That — my line to him is , " How they treatin ' you , " or " How is it treatin ' you ? "
And he said , " Not good . "
And I go , " No ? " He goes , " No , I just ca n't get it together , " and he did n't get a good score that weekend .
And I said , " All right , well , hang in there . "
And I walked away .
Advertisement
AVC : And you 're saying they cut that out , right ?
None of that 's actually in the movie .
BM : Right .
So what they did was , he says , " Hi , Billy , " cut !
And then it's : " Some people , I do n't wanna spend too much time talking to . "
If I stood there and talked to him and his guy died , [ people would say ] " Look at this :
He can't even let the guy play in peace . "
You can see that angle , right ?
I did n't wanna stand there , I did n't want him to feel intimidated , I did n't want anyone to think that I was stealin ' his secrets .
Advertisement
AVC : So you did n't spend much time talking because you did n't want to disturb him ?
BM : Right .
But why do n't you ask the filmmakers if you can see the raw footage ?
They wo n't show it to you .
But I think it makes a great movie , and really , if somebody loses sleep over it , give me a break , it 's a video game .
Advertisement
Ed Cunningham : Yeah , no , that did n't happen there .
It did n't .
At that moment , what we show is exactly what happened .
AVC : With no time break ?
EC : No .
There are all these conspiracy theories …
Obviously , it was a small venue , and we had three or four cameras .
And of course , if Billy 's walking in , we 're gonna cover it from three or four different angles , because that was the story .
So that scene when he walks by is just a multi- camera shot , where we cut between angles .
I 've read claims that we had an actor dub in Bill saying , " I do n't wanna spend too much time with certain people here . "
Really ?
That 's what you 're claiming ?
But no .
He did n't stop .
They did a whole lap , they were in there for like 20 or 30 minutes , he and his wife , and then on their way by , his wife actually stopped , and she engaged Steve in a conversation .
She saw Billy 's name up on the placard , and said , " Hey , why are n't you playing ? "
And he made a quick comment to the effect of , " Oh , that 's a misprint . "
A friendly back - and - forth is not what happened .
Advertisement
AVC : He says that he was trying to not disturb Steve , and that 's what he meant by not spending " too much time , " not wanting to psych him out .
SG : That 's very generous of him .
[ Laughs . ]
Not to derail the game with his magnetic force .
He absolutely did not talk to Steve in any way .
Advertisement
EC : Our goal was just to represent the tension that we felt in that room .
I mean , the temperature in that room changed drastically , and we just hoped that we could present it as such .
What he said is what he said .
Does he want us to subtitle it and say , " This is what he meant " ?
I just know that that 's what he said .
We tried to represent that moment , as we tried to represent the whole thing , as truthfully as we witnessed it .

On the real - world consequences of being a movie villain , and the relationship between rivals :
BM : Yesterday , I get a phone call .
I 'll give you the phone number if you want ; you can call the person .
" Hi , is Billy there ? "
I 'm on the other line , but I go , " Sure , who 's calling ? " " Steve Wiebe . "
Well , first of all , they said " WEE - be , " which leads me to believe it 's somebody who knows something .
[ Laughs . ]
And I says , " Yeah , hi , Steve , how ya doin ' ? "
He goes , " Good . " Click .
He hung up on me .
It was n't him .
This call was from Indiana .
I 'll give you the phone number if you want .
You can put it through the 411 reverse and see what you learn or whatever , I do n't know .

AVC : But have you actually had conversations with the real Steve ?
BM : So if Seth Gordon once again in an interview says , " Billy Mitchell and his minions have started a smear campaign against the film … "
I mean , where have I said anything negative about the film ?
I do n't !
I 'm sure it 's entertaining .
I guess that 's the best thing that can be said .
[ Steve ] and I had three very friendly phone calls , um , each lasting more than an hour , on three different occasions .
Not recently .
Not at all recently .
This was before he went to San Jose .
I invited him to the Classic Gaming Expo , 2004 .
I invited him there , and I went up to speak onstage , as I do at each expo there .
When I went up and spoke onstage , I called him to the stage , in order to honor him .
I unveiled the poster in his honor , honoring his accomplishments .
I did that in 2004 .
He was onstage with me .
And I 'm sorry to tell you that you can't see that , ' cause they forgot to put that in the movie .
The pictures of me onstage with him , the posters , I think even film , are available , you 're welcome to look at 'em .
Do you really wanna go this deep ?
I mean , I can really shovel it at ya .
But the thing is , like , what 'd make me unhappy is , I give you all this , and all you do is state it in the paper .
I mean , if you wanna know about it , then you look at the pictures .
Then it 's not he - said - she - said .
Then you could ask Steve about it if you want .
It 's not " Billy Mitchell claims . "
It 's " My research shows me . "
You know what I mean ?
I do n't wanna be foolish , and , ya know , entertain you with this and then be made to look silly , you know ?
I read your reviews , " These two guys who obviously hate each other . "
That 's absurd !
I do n't know him well enough to hate him .
It 's a video game .
I would n't hate him over a video game .
The ins and outs of Donkey Kong
On Billy 's reclamation of the throne , post - release :
BM : I last played Donkey Kong in July of last year , when I got the world record .
I did it as a favor to a friend who was participating in the convention in Orlando .
They asked me to go , and I said no .
That was in August .
I said no in September , no in October , no in November .
In December , they said that if I go there and I play , that they 'll send my family , too , and we can have a vacation out of it .
I said yes , but they had to donate $ 1,000 to a charity of my choice , which they agreed to .
Sometime in January or February , I actually bought a Donkey Kong off eBay because I do n't own one .
I do n't own any video games in my house .
None .
So in preparation for the convention , I practiced , played a little bit just to be able to show off and be entertaining .
And things kinda came together really good , and about a week before I went there , I thought , " Wow , man , this fell back together good . "
So I went to the convention , and three weeks before the movie came out , I beat Steve 's score , which sort of debunked what they did .
I think I aggravated 'em .
Not Steve , I think I aggravated the movie people .
I guess they 'd rather I did n't do that , but I did it , and I have n't played since .
Prior to playing that July , I had n't played since 2004 , when I got to the kill screen and set what was thought to be a new world record in Milwaukee .
So the idea that I had played it intensely since 1982 …
Gimme a break .
I went 13 years without playing a video game at all , from around ' 87 to '99 .

AVC : How much of your day - to - day is taken up , since the movie came out , with talking to people about it ?
BM : Before the movie came out , there was n't a day would go by that I did n't have somebody say hi or recognize me from video games as a whole .
Matter of fact , if a day did go by , I 'd say , " Phew , nobody said anything to me . "
Now that the movie 's out , it 's the same thing .
Before , it was mostly , " That 's the video - game guy , " or " That 's the Pac - Man guy , " and it 's still dominantly , " That 's the Pac - Man guy . "
But some of it is , " That 's the Donkey Kong guy . "
As far as sayin ' hi to people and things like that , it does happen on a daily basis , sayin ' hi to kids who come in the restaurant or play with my children .
Everything that 's face - to - face is always very , very friendly .
I get e-mails and such that would turn your stomach .
People , they surprise ya ! [ Laughs . ]
With how strong their emotions are .
I guess that 's because it's an entertaining movie .
And some people , like yourself , find it entertaining , great to watch and be humored , and some people take it as a whole lot more , I guess .

AVC : And you 're interested in setting the record straight wherever you can ?
BM : No .
AVC : You 're not interested ?
BM : For every hundred interviews that I have the opportunity to do , I just once in a while do it , ' cause somebody 's polite on the phone .
Like you .
The interviews I 've done in a year , I can count on both hands .
It 's just a video game , and it 's brought me a lot of fun , the experience as a whole from 1982 to now .
I 've been to 48 out of 50 states .
I did n't get to Hawaii yet , and for whatever reason , I have n't been to North Dakota .
I 've been in Canada , I 've been in Europe , I 've been in Asia .
How can it not be a great experience ?
But every year that ticks on the calendar seems to deal me more and more responsibility in the real world , and less and less available for recreation .

AVC : So if somebody beat your new record , would that inspire you to go do it again ?
BM : August 17 , 2000 , Tim Sczerby beat my score .
I do n't know if you know that .
I was n't the world - record holder [ as the movie implies ] .
That 's just a big sham .
He beat my world record , and I called him , I congratulated him .
I guess you could say we talked Donkey Kong on a higher level .
And he went back to his life , and I went back to mine .
That was in the year 2000 .
Steve Wiebe came along in 2004 or 2003 , and he submitted a score of 947,000 .
And when he submitted that , he had the record .
During this time period , I had never played or attempted to beat anybody 's record .
In the movie , when you show [ Steve ] getting a million six , and the score is pulled down , and it goes back down to 874,000 — what happened to the 937,000 that Tim Sczerby had ?
And what happened to the 947,000 that Steve Wiebe had ?
They just crossed that over , but it made a better movie .
If you really want the facts , I 'll give 'em , but to answer your question , no , it 's not that important to me .
I mean , it was n't important then .
I did it for the charity , and I have done many scores at many times that , had I chosen to videotape them or submit them , they would have been a big deal .
But as the years go on , the big deal is the wife and kids .
Steve Wiebe reaches the legendary " kill screen " at FunSpot , and Bill Mitchell 's " spy . "

On Billy Mitchell 's heavily documented current score :
AVC : You have the record now , correct ?
And you achieved it live ?
BM : You ask good questions , man .
You been doing your research ?
Considering all the controversy surrounding Steve 's score and all the fuss that was made about the score , I did n't wanna be a part of that .
That 's why in the movie — search your memory banks or watch the movie again — never , ever do I say a bad or negative word about Steve or anyone .
It 's just not part of my nature .
So I did n't wanna be a part of the controversy , and I thought , " Well , how do I drive this point home ? "
And so I bought a game , I sent the board to Nintendo — this is all documented — they verified its authenticity , that it was a real board and had not been tampered with .
It was sent to the manager from GameWorks and a notary public , who were there and plugged it in at the event in Orlando .
So the notaries were there .
The game was locked up and the manager of GameWorks kept the key with him , and the Twin Galaxies senior referee Todd Rogers was there .
If you follow the rules , you have a senior referee there , a senior referee witnesses it , period .
End of paragraph .
Score verified .

AVC : But you did more than that .
BM : The game was videotaped , and then the overall area of me playing was taped .
Once the score was done , the GameWorks guy came back with the key , opened the cabinet , then put it in a box and they sent it back to Nintendo , who re-verified it as the same board , still authentic , untampered with .
Lastly , I took the videotape of the game and sent it to two referees , the same referees that had viewed previous tapes , and they verified the authenticity of the tapes .
I can't really do a whole lot more than that .
Advertisement
AVC : You say it 's just a video game , but you took it pretty seriously .
BM : I did n't want to cause any rhetoric or any heartache , and without kidding you , and this part is the touching part for me …
People in the movie , like Walter [ Day , video - game scorekeeper ] , who are very giving of their time , for a labor of love , people in the movie who are made to look corrupt , incompetent , or manipulated , they take a lot of flack that they do n't deserve .
They can't take any flack on this .

On the " break - in " at Steve Wiebe 's house , in which two gamers — friends of Mitchell 's — examined Steve Wiebe 's machine :
BM : The two guys who went to Steve 's house , they called ahead of time , they were told when to be there .
He was late getting home .
The grandmother opened the garage , they let 'em play .
Nobody broke into his house .
And now Steve Wiebe says that .
He says , " No , they were pleasant , " and now when they do interviews , they do n't say " the goons who broke in , " like the movie would have you believe .
They just say " the two guys who visited Steve . "
And I appreciate that , because I have it on my conscience that otherwise good people are criminalized , and they should n't be .
It was a fun thing , and if you sensationalize something for the sake of Hollywood , I think that 's fine .
I do n't think it 's a big deal .
I think the interviews , afterwards , they talked to Cunningham , and they talked to Seth Gordon , and they openly say that these goons came in and broke into his garage , these two spies came in and tore his machine apart .
They did n't tear his machine apart .
Steve opened it .
Now Steve says that , and I appreciate his character on that , and the fact of the matter is , it 's not necessary to say those things in an interview to sensationalize the movie .
The movie sensationalizes itself .
They do n't have to do that .
And it 's better that they do n't .

AVC : Have you spoken with Seth Gordon after reading these sorts of interviews ?
BM : Seth was behind the camera , and I obviously did interact with him , but without kidding you , if Ed Cunningham came in and sat in a restaurant and started eating and I walked past him , I 'd know who he was .
If Seth Gordon did , I would not , and it's not a slight to Seth Gordon .
He was not the one that was steering the cart .
It was Ed Cunningham , and Ed Cunningham was the one who organized things , and all that kind of stuff .
Seth Gordon does these interviews and comes up with these things he says out of thin air , these quotes he says I 'm saying — they 're beyond me .
I have no idea .
I have n't had a conversation with him .
You know , the idea that Billy Mitchell is bitter about the movie …
Says who ?
I think it 's funny .
I think it 's humorous .
The closest thing to bitterness that I have is , I think it 's lousy that they criminalize people .
You know , they 're the ones who have to live with that .
But the fact that myself and others were duped , that 's no fun .
We were led to believe something else about the movie , and , oh well .
Advertisement
Ed Cunningham :
We could have spent 25 minutes dissecting how they got in [ to Wiebe 's garage ] , and how they were asked not to come in .
But the point is , two guys showed up at this guy 's garage , unannounced .
They did n't call , and I do n't care what anybody says , they went at the behest of Bill Mitchell .
Three people say that .
The whole thing started , honestly , when we just kind of , in editing , referred to it as " the break - in . "
They did n't break into the garage , nor does the film say that they broke into the garage .
And everyone was upset , and I understand that it had come out that we had said in a Q&A ; or something online that it was a break - in .
I get that , and we 've pulled back from that .
We do n't refer to it as the break - in any more .
But the overall fact is , two guys showed up at Steve Wiebe 's garage unannounced to look at his machine .

On the documentary itself , and controversial video - gamer Roy " Mr. Awesome " Shildt :
AVC : You thought it was going to be a more direct documentary about video gaming ?
Advertisement
BM : The truth is , I never knew it was even going to be about Donkey Kong , I thought it was competitive video gaming as a whole .
But the truth is , none of us are ever mean .
None of us are ever vindictive , and we 've never had a mean - spirited movie or story or film done about us , so this was a first .
All of us , a couple of us in particular , for 22 years now , have avoided interaction with Mr. Awesome , and it was clearly stated , " I 'll do what you need me to do , or we can talk about whatever you want me to talk about , I 'm not going to talk about him .
And if you 're going to include him , I 'd just rather not participate . "
And it was openly said , " No , we are n't going to , " and " Not a chance , " and they did anyway .
Oh , well .
That 's really the main crux as to why I decided to distance myself from participating in any promotions or anything like that .
As far as the movie , it 's a lot more fun to play the bad guy , believe me .
Are you married , or do you have a girlfriend ?
AVC : Girlfriend , yeah .
BM : Well , let 's pretend like she watches soap operas .
She 'll tell you her favorite person is the really bad girl or bad boy .
So , it 's kinda fun .
The incredible , unbelievable story of Mr. Awesome .
Ed Cunningham : I met Steve four days after the guys showed up at his house to check out his machine .
So it was a really opportune moment , but you know , Steve 's just kind of a regular guy , and we did n't know if we could hang a whole movie on him .
And then we went down and met Billy and I was like , " Oh my God , this guy 's awesome . "
He 's just an amazing , amazing guy .
We were chasing about four or five different stories , there was a great story going on with Ms. Pac - Man , with this Jamaican immigrant who worked for his dad 's construction company in Queens .
But every time we showed up , something strange and fascinating was happening with Donkey Kong .

AVC : Billy says his greatest concern was the inclusion of Mr. Awesome in the film .
Presumably there 's more to their history than the movie goes into .
EC :
The movie pretty clearly states that Roy is jealous of Billy , has been since the mid-'80s , and will go to the ends of the earth to try to hurt him .
In a 35,000 - foot statement , that 's the story .

SG : Although not physically harm him .
Conspiracy theories and Mr. Awesome .
On the planned feature film :
AVC : Apparently , Seth Gordon and Ed Cunningham are working on a feature - film version of the story .
Did you know anything about that ?
Advertisement
BM : The contract that I have with them says clearly : No Mr. Awesome .
After the movie released at Sundance , maybe like in February , I began to know things about it .
That 's when I said , " Well , wait a minute .
You said he was n't going to be in it . "
And , the theory is , " Oh , no .
That contract 's not for the documentary .
It 's for the remake . "
So , yeah , I know there 's a remake , and supposedly the agreement I have with them says that I do n't want to be a part of anything that has to do with , um , different things …
AVC : So if they came to you and said , " We 're doing a remake .
And we want to have a character named Billy Mitchell , and it's about — "
Advertisement
BM : They already have the paperwork to do that .
I signed the paperwork to do that before the documentary came out , and I was duped .
I suppose they 'll get away with it .
AVC : That 's not something you 'd have enough interest to go to court about ?
BM : Actually , I 've had some very strong legal opinions on directions that they feel will be very effective .
And I suppose eventually I 'll sit down and give it serious thought .
But for the moment , to be honest , I do n't really put my thoughts or time to it .
Again , it 's a fun part of history .
And unfortunately , there 's about a half a percent of a tenth of the population that somehow gets worked up over the movie .
[ Laughs . ]

Ed Cunningham : Our goal would be to keep [ a feature - film version ] in the same tone as the doc .
That 's one of the reasons we were so excited to end up at New Line , because they have that same vision for it , that it wo n't become this broad , kick - in - the - groin comedy .
So that 's our goal .
The ending in the doc is fairly complicated , and you have to consider when you go to a scripted version , you have to be open to the idea that it may change some .
As far as Billy reclaiming the record , I do n't know how that 's going to be dealt with .
AVC : And you already have permission to portray Billy in a feature film , right ?
EC : Yeah , we have his life rights .
[ Laughs . ]
Complicates things , does n't it ?
AVC : Billy 's understanding of this is that the exclusion of Mr. Awesome applies to a feature film .
Is that true ?
Advertisement
EC : It 's not our position to talk about the legal side of things .
That would be completely beyond our scope to comment on .
SG : But I think we can generally say , the degree to which Billy wants to remove Mr. Awesome from the historical record , in every form , is definitely true .
[ Laughs . ]
Is that fair , Ed ?

EC : Totally fair .
On what the filmmakers learned :
Ed Cunningham :
It 's been an incredible lesson on how , when people have a vested interest , the truth is always going to be slanted toward their opinion .
We 've tried a couple of times to sit down and hash out everything we learned through this process factually , and it 's nearly impossible .
If you want to have some very intense reading , go on some of the blogs and read any entry from [ video - game referee and King Of Kong participant ]
Robert Mruczek and his claims on what happened and how .
It 's so mind - boggling , the level of detail that people have gone to , to try to say what the truth is or is n't .
It 's really a fascinating study .
There 's truth everywhere .
Advertisement
Seth Gordon : Yeah , the Rashomon of it .
What 's fascinating is how high the stakes are for such a thing .
They put so much effort into something that to most of us seems relatively inconsequential .
What 's worth getting upset about , really ?
Amazing 2003 MTV interview with Billy Mitchell .
A little more Billy being Billy :
BM : Hey , you did n't ask any real tough questions .
AVC : I did n't know we were doing an interview today !
BM : Well , you 're not intimidated by the movie , are you ?
You do n't look over your shoulder and think that I 'm there ?
Advertisement
AVC : [ Laughs . ]
Are you right behind me ?
BM : No , but I will be .
Again , I see the value of Hollywood , I really do .
I do n't think it 's necessary for — you can read the interviews , you can be at the Q&As ; — I do n't see the necessity , when the game is over , to do things they 've done that are mean - spirited .
Advertisement
AVC : Are you selling more sauce since the movie came out ?
BM : Well , let 's just say I have n't hit $ 50 a week yet .
I do talk to a lot of people , and when I have a review or something sent to me , like when somebody sends me yours , sometimes you can just click on it and send an e-mail .
Sometimes there 's a phone number .
I never ever , not once , miss contacting , saying thanks , saying " That was funny , " or whatever the case is .
Sometimes the reviews are funny .
Sometimes they 're insightful , and I learn things that I otherwise did n't know .
Very often , I get responses back , and they 're usually : " Well , I did n't mean to offend you . "
You 're not offending me , you 're reporting what 's just on the screen .
That 's the way it is .
More often than not , it leads to a conversation without an interview .
But I 'm very cautious , as you can hear in my voice , I do not speak ill of people .
It would come back to bite me , and in 25 years , I 've never done a negative interview , and I 'm not going to do one .
Advertisement
AVC : Well , thanks for all the insight , I appreciate it .
And we 're looking forward to the sauce as well .
BM : Well , ask some tough questions the next time !
AVC : If I 'd known we were going to speak today , I would have thought of some .
BM : Hang in there .
If you 're ever down here , you can stop and say hi .
Phil Marino for The New York Times
Disguised or not , cellphone towers often carry a patchwork of network upgrades .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith today apologised and promised to pay back money which she wrongly claimed for a television package which was reported to include adult movies .
Ms Smith said she " mistakenly " claimed for the television package while submitting a bill for an internet connection .
The £ 67 bill was submitted last June as part of Ms Smith 's expenses , the Sunday Express reported .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The newspaper said the Virgin Media bill included two 18 - rated features which each cost £ 5 which were viewed on April 1 and April 6 last year .
The bill was also said to include two viewings of the film Ocean 's 13 - at £ 3.75 each - and an additional £ 3.50 to watch the film Surf 's Up .
In a statement to the newspaper , Ms Smith said : " I am sorry that in claiming for my internet connection , I mistakenly claimed for a television package alongside it .
" As soon as the matter was brought to my attention , I took immediate steps to contact the relevant parliamentary authorities and rectify the situation .
" All money claimed for the television package will be paid back in full . "
News of the claim is an embarrassment to Ms Smith who last month faced criticism for claiming taxpayer - funded allowances for a second home while living with her sister .
Ms Smith said she had " fully abided " by the rules by designating her sister 's house as her " main " residence , allowing her to claim payments on the Redditch constituency home she shares with her husband and children .
The television bill is reported to be for her family home .
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards , John Lyon , accepted a complaint about Ms Smith 's claims and has called on her to explain the £ 116,000 which she has claimed since becoming an MP .
Ms Smith 's apology came as Labour left - winger Harry Cohen , who was said to have claimed more than £ 300,000 in second home allowances on his house in the capital , insisted that he had done nothing wrong as it was " part of my salary " .

Mr Cohen said that MPs had been told " Go out boys and spend it " when the present system was introduced under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s .
The Mail on Sunday reported that the MP listed a single - bedroom schoolhouse in Colchester , Essex , and a caravan on nearby Mersea Island as his main home .
The paper said that it meant that over the past five years he was able to claim the maximum allowance of £ 104,701 on his constituency home 70 miles away in Leyton and Wanstead , east London .
It calculated that since 1990 , he had received a total of £ 310,714 in allowances .
Mr Cohen told the Press Association that the arrangement had been cleared with the House of Commons authorities .
He said that the former Conservative minister John Moore had told MPs " Go out boys and spend it " when he introduced a big uprating of the allowance in the 1980s to head off a pay revolt by backbench Tories .
Mr Cohen said that he had taken full advantage of the arrangement ever since .
" That is exactly what John Moore said on behalf of Mrs Thatcher to her Tory MPs .
That makes it part of my salary , " he said .
" It really is part of my salary in all but name .
That is what it exists for . "
Mr Cohen said the Colchester property was his " family home " .
He said that there was no reason under the Commons rules why London MPs should not live outside the capital and have a second home in their constituency .
" It is the legitimate costs of having a constituency home to do my job .
We do n't have a system where people are required to live in their constituency , " he said .
" I am doing nothing wrong whatsoever .
I am using it for parliamentary purposes .
It is a legitimate and proper use of it . "
Nevertheless the latest disclosure is likely to fuel demands for a complete overhaul of the system of MPs ' expenses and allowances .
Gordon Brown last week tried to head off the growing public anger by asking the Committee on Standards in Public Life to carry out a review of the whole system .
It followed the disclosure that another Greater London MP , Immigration Minister Tony McNulty , was claiming the allowance on the home where his parents live in his Harrow constituency , even though he lived only a few miles away in Hammersmith .
However with the committee not planning to report until after the next general election , the latest may lead to fresh demands for an immediate crackdown .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said that Ms Smith was an " outstanding " Home Secretary , but refused to be drawn on the disclosures about her expenses .
Asked on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show if it was " final straw time " for Ms Smith , he said : " I am never going to get into individual cases .
" What I am absolutely confident of is that Jacqui Smith is doing an outstanding job as the Home Secretary with some of the toughest responsibilities in government . "
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Yvette Cooper said she did not know the particular circumstances surrounding Ms Smith , but said there had to be " greater transparency " regarding the expense claims of MPs .
" I do n't know any more than you have just had on your bulletins , " she told the Sky News Sunday Live programme .
" It is difficult for me to comment on any individual case .
All I heard ... was that Jacqui Smith has apologised so I know no more than that , so it is difficult to comment on individual cases .
" I think there is a wider issue , that there has got to be greater transparency , greater independent checks in terms of MPs ' expenses across the board , that is why I think this new review that is taking place ... is exactly the right way forward .
" You have got to have a system that people can feel confident in . "
She added : " My view is that actually those checks and that scrutiny and those independent checks need to be increased as a minimum in terms of reforms that need to take place . "

Limbaugh lashes back at Steele for ' entertainer ' diss David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 2 , 2009
Print This Email This UPDATE ( at bottom ) : Steele apologizes to Limbaugh
Responding to criticism by recently - elected RNC chairman Michael Steele , talk show host Rush Limbaugh tore into the party 's leader , contending that Steele is actually " not the head of the Republican Party , " cautioning that the chairman is off to a " shaky start . "
ABC News said that Limbaugh had " practically declared war " on the Republican leadership .
" Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer , " Steele told D.L. Hughley during a Saturday broadcast of CNN's D.L. Hughley Breaks the News .
" Rush Limbaugh 's whole thing is entertainment .
Yes , it is incendiary .
Yes , it is ugly . "
Moments before , Steele had asserted himself over Limbaugh as the " de facto leader of the Republican Party . "
On the same show , Hughley remarked that the 2009 CPAC convention -- at which Rush Limbaugh was the final keynote speaker -- " looked like Nazi Germany . "
" Michael Steele , you are head of the RNC , " said Limbaugh .
" You are not head of the Republican Party . "
" I hope ... he realizes he's not a talking head pundit , " said Limbaugh on Monday .
After telling him to go behind the scenes and do the work he 's been hired to do , the radio host added , " He 's off to a shaky start . "
The first suggestion that the host would lampoon the GOP leader came in an e-mail from Rush to Politico .
" Ill handle it on the radio , " he wrote .
During his Monday show , he Limbaugh quoted the Politico story , but referenced them on as " the drive - by media . "
" Mr. Steele , if you want to lead the Republican party -- as you say you do -- you need to run for and win the presidency , " said Limbaugh , adding that Steele is n't going to lead the party by being " cute " on cable news .
" Do n't underestimate the intelligence of this audience , " he continued .
" Republicans and conservatives are sick and tired of being talked down to .
Until you should them the respect they deserve , you are going to have a hard time rebuilding your party . "
" I 'm not in charge of the Republican Party , and I do n't want to be , " said Limbaugh .
" I would be embarrassed to say that I 'm in charge of the Republican Party in a sad - sack state that it 's in .
If I were chairman of the Republican Party , given the state that it's in , I would quit . "
" Rush knows what he is doing , " wrote David Frum on the conservative Web portal newmajority.com .
" The worse conservatives do , the more important Rush becomes as leader of the ardent remnant .
The better conservatives succeed , the more we become a broad national governing coalition , the more Rush will be sidelined .
" Rush is to the Republicanism of the 2000s what Jesse Jackson was to the Democratic party in the 1980s .
He plays an important role in our coalition , and of course he and his supporters have to be treated with respect .
But he can not be allowed to be the public face of the enterprise  and we have to find ways of assuring the public that he is just one Republican voice among many , and very far from the most important . "
" Doubtless this will lead to the usual complaints that Frum 's a fraud , a sell - out and an intellectual snob , " noted Spectator 's Alex Massie .
" All this could be true and none of it would prohibit Frum being right . "
The following audio is The Rush Limbaugh Show , broadcast on Feb. 2 , 2009 .
Update : Steele apologizes to Limbaugh
In an exclusive interview with Politico , RNC Chairman Michael Steele said he 's sorry for his remarks about Republican talk show host Rush Limbaugh .
" My intent was not to go after Rush  I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh , " Steele said .
" I was maybe a little bit inarticulate .
...
There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership . "
" I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said werent what I was thinking , " he said .
" It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing , and it came out differently .
What I was trying to say was a lot of people ... want to make Rush the scapegoat , the bogeyman , and hes not . "

Your Cellphone is a Homing Device
Do n't want the government to know where you are ?
Throw away your cell , stop taking the subway , and pay the toll in cash .
By Brendan I. Koerner
IF YOU PURCHASED A NEW CELLPHONE over the past 18 months or so , odds are that one of the features listed in small print on the side of the box was " E911 capable . "
Or , as in the case of my latest Motorola , " Location technology for piece [ sic ] of mind . "
Perhaps you asked the salesman to explain the feature , and he replied that it means that cops can home in on your phone in case of an emergency , a potentially important perk should you ever find your hand pinned beneath an immovable boulder in rural Utah , as Aron Ralston did recently .
Assuming he could have gotten a signal , an E911 - capable phone might have saved the young backpacker the pain of having to amputate his own arm .
What your salesman probably failed to tell you and may not even realize is that an E911 - capable phone can give your wireless carrier continual updates on your location .
The phone is embedded with a Global Positioning System chip , which can calculate your coordinates to within a few yards by receiving signals from satellites .
GPS technology gave U.S. military commanders a vital edge during Gulf War II , and sailors and pilots depend on it as well .
In the E911 - capable phone , the GPS chip does not wait until it senses danger , springing to life when catastrophe strikes ; it 's switched on whenever your handset is powered up and is always ready to transmit your location data back to a wireless carrier 's computers .
Verizon or T - Mobile can figure out which manicurist you visit just as easily as they can pinpoint a stranded motorist on Highway 59 .
So what 's preventing them from doing so , at the behest of either direct marketers or , perhaps more chillingly , the police ?
Not the law , which is essentially mum on the subject of location - data privacy .
As often happens with emergent technology , the law has struggled to keep pace with the gizmo .
No federal statute is keeping your wireless provider from informing Dunkin ' Donuts that your visits to Starbucks have been dropping off and you may be ripe for a special coupon offer .
Nor are cops explicitly required to obtain a judicial warrant before compiling a record of where you sneaked off to last Thursday night .
Despite such obvious potential for abuse , the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission , the American consumer 's ostensible protectors , show little enthusiasm for stepping into the breach .
As things stand now , the only real barrier to the dissemination of your daily movements is the benevolence of the telecommunications industry .
A show of hands from those who find this a comforting thought ?
Anyone ?
GPS tracking is already a staple of workplace surveillance , especially for those not bound to desks .
Trucking companies have long outfitted their fleets ' semis with devices that monitor how long and how frequently a driver stops to rest .
Now the vogue is for smarter GPS versions , which can pinpoint exactly where each truck stops en route .
A New York Times article reported on a Texas company that busted an employee whose vehicles had been spending on - the - job time in the parking lot of a strip club .
The difference between that and E911 tracking is the nature of the relationship between the tracker and the trackee .
Private - sector employees are essentially at the mercy of their bosses , a power dynamic that the courts have affirmed again and again .
When using company - issued equipment , there is no " expectation of privacy , " perhaps the most important legal test in deciding whether incriminating data was obtained lawfully .
That 's why The Times was able to check the cellphone records of the disgraced reporter Jayson Blair , who was fired for fabricating interviews and facts .
The records revealed that on days that Blair professed to be reporting from West Virginia or Maryland , his calls were routed through cellphone towers in New Yorkironclad evidence that he'd never actually left home .
Obviously , Verizon and I have a vendor - customer relationship , not a boss - underling one .
But the matter is complicated by the public nature of E911 information :
It is designed to be shared with emergency services .
So a police - friendly judge could easily decide that with this third , governmental player involved , no cellphone user should count on privacy , at least as far as location data goes .
Which way the courts will lean , though , is anybody 's guess ; as of this writing , no criminal case involving E911 has yet materialized .
Handwringing over prickly privacy issues has , of course , inspired many books in recent years .
The most popular viewpoint is that espoused in Jeffrey Rosen 's The Unwanted Gaze : that electronic records are too accessible and that laws are needed to guarantee that certain data will rarely see the light of day .
A smaller and , frankly , geekier crowd advances the thesis of David Brin's The Transparent Society , which amounts to the following : " Privacy is vanishing .
Get over it . "
Brin , a sci - fi author , contends that the end of privacy as we know it need n't necessarily mean an Orwellian future , because technology will allow citizens to monitor the authorities , too .
Much of the academic discourse has focused on what can be termed " fixed surveillance " : websites that track user preferences , bosses who covertly scrutinize employee performance , companies that leak employee medical records to insurers .
Tracking a person 's physical movement throughout the day is a new type of violation , one that naturally conjures up rather nasty comparisons to the East German Stasi and similarly thuggish outfits .
It 's one thing for Amazon.com to suggest that , judging by my past CD purchases , I may enjoy the new Mobb Deep album , and quite another for Amazon to spam my phone with a message beginning , " We notice you are standing in a Tower Records store .
Did you know that Amazon is selling the new Mobb Deep album for $ 2 less than Tower ? "
THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY HAS A NAME FOR SUCH CUSTOM - TAILORED HAWKING : " location - based services , " or LBS .
The idea is that GPS chips can be used to locate friends , find the nearest pizzeria , or ensure that Junior is really at the library rather than a keg party .
One estimate expects LBS to be a $ 15 billion market by 2007 , a much - needed boost for the flagging telecom sector .
That may be fine for some consumers , but what about those who'd rather opt out of the tracking ?
The industry 's promise is that LBS customers will have to give explicit permission for their data to be shared with third parties .
This is certainly in the spirit of the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 , which anticipated that all cellphone carriers will feature E911 technology by 2006 .
The law stipulated that E911 data that is , an individual 's second - by - second GPS coordinates could only be used for nonemergency purposes if " express prior authorization " was provided by the consumer .
" But no one clearly understands what that means , " explains David Sobel , general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center , which has repeatedly petitioned the FCC for a clarification of the law 's language to no avail .
" ' Express prior authorization ' has never been fleshed out . "
Think about the consent process in the realm of software law , where a user must click " I agree " to a licensing agreement in order to install the program .
A user irked by some aspect of the agreement can select " I do not agree , " but that prevents the software from being installed , which makes the product essentially worthless .
There 's nothing stopping a cellphone carrier from instituting a telecom equivalent of the shrinkwrap license when you break the seal on the box and activate the phone , you agree to abide by the company 's conditions .
One of those could easily be , " I authorize for my location data to be shared with third parties . "
This could very well be the case with my Motorola , one of those spiffy picture phones advertised on TV every 60 seconds .
The thick user 's guide makes no mention of the GPS chip 's privacy implications ; Verizon Wireless 's website is devoid of any specific language relating to location privacy .
The technology industry 's attitude toward end - user licenses seems to be " Do n't worry , it 's too complicated for you to understand . "
When I asked to be pointed in the direction of Verizon 's E911 privacy policy , a company spokesman named Jeffrey Nelson told me , " We do n't have a policy , because we 're not offering any location - based services at this time . "
I pushed a little , pointing out that the phones are still GPS - enabled and thus remain able to collect data .
" What I can say , " Nelson responded , " is that in all of our internal discussions , we do acknowledge the importance of very healthy opt - in promises . "
The libertarian counterargument would be that the market will ultimately favor privacy , since most consumers would balk at onerous privacy terms .
Smart companies will eventually differentiate themselves from the pack by getting serious about privacy , and the advantage will go to the carrier that can honestly claim , " We 're the ones who protect your data , unlike the folks at XYZ Communications , who sell your restaurant habits to the highest bidder . "
Governmental privacy laws , this line of logic goes , are an unnecessary burden on the private sector .
But laissez faire has n't really worked as a way of protecting consumers online .
Partly it 's their own fault .
Consumers do a poor job of reading and understanding the privacy statements of the websites they visit .
Given the complexity of these sites , though , can you blame them ?
No one would shop online , or even surf , if it meant reading a long slab of legalese for each site .
Cookies ?
Registration forms that ask for a home address , age , and income ?
Anything to get that cool Shockwave game a little faster .
John Soma , a University of Denver law professor and the author of Computer Technology and the Law , explains that consumers are easily seduced into giving up their privacy : " If you were at a McDonald 's in downtown Denver , and you agreed to give everyone three free Big Macs , fries , and a shake if they 'd sign away their DNA , you 'd have 200 people lined up . "
Since medical information is considered more sensitive than , say , mere web browsing habits think of how your insurance company would love to factor your genetic predispositions into their actuarial tables the inducements to obtain other types of data need n't be that lavish .
And once signed away , privacy is hard to recoup .
Consumers may also be quite willing to accept an erosion in privacy in exchange for a sweet enough reward .
Take the growth of wireless " communities , " groups of cellphone users who swap text messages about The Lord of the Rings , pro basketball , or whatever interests they share .
As a recent Marketplace report noted , these groups need corporate sponsorship to survive and grow , since most draw no revenue .
If the choice eventually comes down to catching the latest Frodo Baggins gossip or staving off Kmart spam , many aficionados will accept the spam .
Finnish hunters are already signing up in droves for " dog radar , " which allows them to use their cellphones to pinpoint their wandering hounds , who bear GPS locators in their collars .
It would take a cold heart to give up on protecting Fido merely because he gives away your location when you take him for a walk .
Then there are LBS companies like Calgary 's Cell - Loc , which plans to pitch its location service to worried parents .
" I have a daughter turning 16 , and I know I 'm getting her a cellphone for her birthday , " one Cell - Loc employee told The Toronto Star .
" She 'll be like , ' Great , Mom , thanks for the phone . '
I 'll be like , ' No problem , I 'm going to be tracking your every step . ' "
Corporate data collectors do their best to present a trustworthy image , but they have n't always been entirely forthcoming about the details of their practices .
Early adopters of the TiVo digital video recorder knew that the box somehow uses the Internet , since it needs to be plugged into a telephone jack .
But it was n't until the Privacy Foundation attached a " sniffer " to a test unit that TiVo 's true nature was revealed .
Every night , the recorder transmits the day 's viewing records back to the company 's servers which channels were viewed when , when the volume was turned up and down , even the device 's internal temperature .
( That 's not to mention TiVo 's habit of recommending shows to viewers based on their past viewing habits , a feature that has famously vexed homophobes , who worry that a peek at a Miss America pageant will convince their box to recommend " gay " fare . )
None of this was revealed in TiVo 's brochure , which contained only a vague privacy pledge that records are stripped of identification markers and a statement that the company 's privacy policy was subject to change .
Despite Congressional testimony by Privacy Foundation founder Richard M. Smith , the TiVo revelation stirred only the barest of public outcries and did nothing to push forward privacy legislation .
That 's not a surprise , as Congress has always been slow to recognize the privacy implications of new technologies .
Unauthorized wiretapping was n't outlawed until 1967 , 91 years after " Mr. Watson , come here , I want to see you , " and 77 years after Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren 's famous Harvard Law Review article on the importance of privacy as a legal concept .
As Rosen writes in The Unwanted Gaze , " The politics of privacy tends to be largely reactive , fired by heartstring - tugging anecdotes that capture the public imagination . "
Not until after The Washington City Paper published Judge Robert Bork 's video - rental records in 1987 , for example , did Congress pass the Video Privacy Protection Act , which outlawed that kind of disclosure .
At the intersection of privacy and technology , the legislative wheels require considerable grease to start turning .
There 's also a substantial anti-privacy lobby , composed of industry front groups that view tough privacy laws as potential revenue killers .
The Online Privacy Alliance and the Privacy Council may sound like muckraking Naderite organizations , but they 're pure " Astroturf , " fake grass - roots lobbies that hammer home the message that privacy restrictions hurt American business .
Law enforcement likewise views privacy laws as an impediment , especially now that it has grown accustomed to accessing location data virtually at will .
Take the MetroCard , the only way for New York City commuters to pay their transit fares since the elimination of tokens .
Unbeknownst to the vast majority of straphangers , the humble MetroCard is essentially a floppy disk , uniquely identified by a serial number on the flip side .
Each time a subway rider swipes the card , the turnstile reads the bevy of information stored on the card 's magnetic stripe , such as serial number , value , and expiration date .
That data is then relayed back to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 's central computers , which also record the passenger 's station and entry time ; the stated reason is that this allows for free transfers between buses and subways .
( Bus fare machines communicate with MTA computers wirelessly . )
Police have been taking full advantage of this location info to confirm or destroy alibis ; in 2000 , The Daily News estimated that detectives were requesting that roughly 1,000 MetroCard records be checked each year .
A mere request seems sufficient for the MTA to fork over the data .
The authority learned its lesson back in 1997 , when it initially balked at a New York Police Department request to view the E - ZPass toll records of a murder suspect ; the cops wanted to see whether or not he'd crossed the Verrazano Narrows Bridge around the time of the crime .
The MTA demanded that the NYPD obtain a subpoena , but then - Justice Colleen McMahon of the State Supreme Court disagreed .
She ruled that " a reasonable person holds no expectation of confidentiality " when using E - ZPass on a public highway , and an administrative subpoenaa simple OK from a police higher - up was enough to compel the MTA to hand over the goods .
What McMahon was advancing , in effect , was an extension of the rationale behind the rules governing " pen register " and " trap and trace " surveillance of phone lines .
While police need a warrant to listen in on the content of calls , they do not need judicial warrants to monitor the phone numbers a person calls or is called from .
The phone company already knows what numbers you are dialing , and their existence as a knowing third party means that you should not expect this data to be kept privateor so the logic goes .
On the Verrazano Narrows Bridge , how could a toll transaction between a driver and the MTA be private , since the bridge is a public space with a zillion other drivers ( third parties all ) around to witness it ?
It does n't take a genius to see how this argument could be extended to location data obtained through E911 ; if the emergency operator can get access to your GPS coordinates , how can you expect privacy ?
It 's not like the cops are asking to know what you talked about , only where you were .
The 2002 Washington State case State v. Jackson is perhaps the only other instance of the use of location data being contested on appeal , and the conclusion was similar .
In the absence of laws specifically addressing GPS , the court ruled that the police did n't need a warrant to attach a tracking device to a suspect 's vehicles .
The vehicle was in plain view , and the cops were n't intercepting any " communication " ; in other words , the tracking conformed to the " trap and trace " standards .
Never mind the obvious stretch of applying wiretap laws from the 1960s to such a novel technology .
Any time the police are allowed to act without obtaining a judicial warrant , it is natural to be concerned about whom they 're accountable to .
How much evidence must a detective present before he or she is given access to someone 's subway habits ?
How easy would it be for the men and women of the 10th Precinct , right behind my apartment in New York City , to find out that I 'm fond of taking the F train to East Broadway on Sunday mornings ?
How about the GPS data from my Motorola ?
The NYPD 's lips are apparently sealed about this matter ; despite repeated phone calls and a formal written request , spokesman Detective Walter Burnes did not respond to questions .
The Department of Justice is equally silent on the topic .
I submitted a request to the organization 's press office for information about the FBI 's methods of obtaining location data from a target 's GPS - enabled phone , but received no response .
David Sobel was not surprised by my defeat , as his organization , EPIC , has been asking for the exact same clarification for well over a year now .
Without a potentially precedent - setting case moving through the federal justice system , however , the Justice Department 's silence is at least understandable .
You get away with what you can .
If new laws are n't forthcoming , perhaps our location - data guardians will be those twin pillars of federal bureaucracy , the FCC and the FTC .
Wireless communications are the former 's responsibility , and the FCC 's official mission , as set out in the 1934 act that created it , is to protect the " public interest . "
Yet under Bush - appointed chairman Michael Powell , an avowed fan of laissez faire , the FCC has shown little interest in employing its rule - making powers to take responsibility for protecting the privacy of cellphone users .
Last August , the FCC turned down a request from the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association to draw up location - data privacy rules .
( Though it is an industry group , the CTIA believes that federal rules lenient ones , if it has its way would convince consumers that LBS is n't as menacing as it sounds . )
The commission explained that it did " not wish to artificially constrain the still - developing market for location - based services . "
So all hopes rest with the FTC , charged with holding companies to their contractual word .
This is exactly the sort of oversight that 's required for the libertarian fantasy to come true .
If a cellphone carrier is going to one - up its competitors by positioning itself as a stickler for privacy , there need to be consequences if it breaks its pledge .
In Connecticut , the Department of Consumer Protection took a step in the direction of punishing privacy violations in February 2002 when it backed a suit against Acme Rent - a - Car for using GPS monitors installed in its autos to fine renters for exceeding the speed limit .
The department successfully argued that Acme 's contracts were not upfront about this monitoring , and the company discontinued its policy .
Optimistic that the FTC would confirm that , in lieu of federal statutes on the matter , it would take the lead in making sure no one finds out that I enjoy the occasional Taco Bell feast , I called the agency .
Staff members seemed mystified at the prospect of scrutinizing a company 's location - privacy policy .
I started with a gruff Consumer Protection staffer , high in the hierarchy .
He was obviously less than pleased to hear from me .
" Never dealt with an issue like that . . .
I do n't have anyone that 's readily available to talk to you , " he said , before kicking me down to the Office of Public Affairs .
Despite my appeals to speak with an actual lawyer , an FTC spokeswoman rebuffed my every requestand , in true government style , passed the buck .
" Talk to the F - C - C , " she added , enunciating each letter to emphasize her irritation .
Clearly , E911 is not an issue to which the FTC has given much thought .
Back to square one , then : no clear laws , no bureaucratic oversight , a permissive judiciary .
Aside from saying " Trust us , " industry 's response is to push technological safeguards , like GPS phones equipped with " I AM HERE " buttons .
If you do n't want to be bothered , do n't press that button when the handset starts flashing .
Trouble is , this does n't really shut off the GPS chip the satellites still know where you are .
They just wo n't remind you of that fact .
When it comes to consumer protections , technology simply does n't have the teeth necessary for the jobespecially when the safeguards in question are manufactured by the same folks who'd love to peddle your location data .
But until some privacy Waterloo embarrasses the law into catching up , technology is what we 're stuck with .
The legendary hacker zine Phrack recently published a how - to guide on building a GPS - jamming device .
Maybe I 'll head to RadioShack this weekend and pick up the parts .
And I 'll leave the cellphone at home when I go the only surefire way to opt out .
Brendan I. Koerner , a fellow at the New America Foundation , last wrote for Legal Affairs about dying declarations .

Every night , the recorder transmits the day 's viewing records back to the company 's servers which channels were viewed when , when the volume was turned up and down , even the device 's internal temperature .
( That 's not to mention TiVo 's habit of recommending shows to viewers based on their past viewing habits , a feature that has famously vexed homophobes , who worry that a peek at apageant will convince their box to recommend " gay " fare . )
None of this was revealed in TiVo 's brochure , which contained only a vague privacy pledge that records are stripped of identification markers and a statement that the company 's privacy policy was subject to change .
Despite Congressional testimony by Privacy Foundation founder Richard M. Smith , the TiVo revelation stirred only the barest of public outcries and did nothing to push forward privacy legislation .
That 's not a surprise , as Congress has always been slow to recognize the privacy implications of new technologies .
Unauthorized wiretapping was n't outlawed until 1967 , 91 years after " Mr. Watson , come here , I want to see you , " and 77 years after Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren 's famousarticle on the importance of privacy as a legal concept .
As Rosen writes in , " The politics of privacy tends to be largely reactive , fired by heartstring - tugging anecdotes that capture the public imagination . "
Not until afterpublished Judge Robert Bork 's video - rental records in 1987 , for example , did Congress pass the Video Privacy Protection Act , which outlawed that kind of disclosure .
At the intersection of privacy and technology , the legislative wheels require considerable grease to start turning .
There 's also a substantial anti-privacy lobby , composed of industry front groups that view tough privacy laws as potential revenue killers .
The Online Privacy Alliance and the Privacy Council may sound like muckraking Naderite organizations , but they 're pure " Astroturf , " fake grass - roots lobbies that hammer home the message that privacy restrictions hurt American business .
Law enforcement likewise views privacy laws as an impediment , especially now that it has grown accustomed to accessing location data virtually at will .
Take the MetroCard , the only way for New York City commuters to pay their transit fares since the elimination of tokens .
Unbeknownst to the vast majority of straphangers , the humble MetroCard is essentially a floppy disk , uniquely identified by a serial number on the flip side .
Each time a subway rider swipes the card , the turnstile reads the bevy of information stored on the card 's magnetic stripe , such as serial number , value , and expiration date .
That data is then relayed back to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 's central computers , which also record the passenger 's station and entry time ; the stated reason is that this allows for free transfers between buses and subways .
( Bus fare machines communicate with MTA computers wirelessly . )
Police have been taking full advantage of this location info to confirm or destroy alibis ; in 2000 , estimated that detectives were requesting that roughly 1,000 MetroCard records be checked each year .
A mere request seems sufficient for the MTA to fork over the data .
The authority learned its lesson back in 1997 , when it initially balked at a New York Police Department request to view the E - ZPass toll records of a murder suspect ; the cops wanted to see whether or not he'd crossed the Verrazano Narrows Bridge around the time of the crime .
The MTA demanded that the NYPD obtain a subpoena , but then - Justice Colleen McMahon of the State Supreme Court disagreed .
She ruled that " a reasonable person holds no expectation of confidentiality " when using E - ZPass on a public highway , and an administrative subpoenaa simple OK from a police higher - up was enough to compel the MTA to hand over the goods .
What McMahon was advancing , in effect , was an extension of the rationale behind the rules governing " pen register " and " trap and trace " surveillance of phone lines .
While police need a warrant to listen in on the content of calls , they do not need judicial warrants to monitor the phone numbers a person calls or is called from .
The phone company already knows what numbers you are dialing , and their existence as a knowing third party means that you should not expect this data to be kept privateor so the logic goes .
On the Verrazano Narrows Bridge , how could a toll transaction between a driver and the MTA be private , since the bridge is a public space with a zillion other drivers ( third parties all ) around to witness it ?
It does n't take a genius to see how this argument could be extended to location data obtained through E911 ; if the emergency operator can get access to your GPS coordinates , how can you expect privacy ?
It 's not like the cops are asking to know what you talked about , only where you were .
The 2002 Washington State caseis perhaps the only other instance of the use of location data being contested on appeal , and the conclusion was similar .
In the absence of laws specifically addressing GPS , the court ruled that the police did n't need a warrant to attach a tracking device to a suspect 's vehicles .
The vehicle was in plain view , and the cops were n't intercepting any " communication " ; in other words , the tracking conformed to the " trap and trace " standards .
Never mind the obvious stretch of applying wiretap laws from the 1960s to such a novel technology .
Any time the police are allowed to act without obtaining a judicial warrant , it is natural to be concerned about whom they 're accountable to .
How much evidence must a detective present before he or she is given access to someone 's subway habits ?
How easy would it be for the men and women of the 10th Precinct , right behind my apartment in New York City , to find out that I 'm fond of taking the F train to East Broadway on Sunday mornings ?
How about the GPS data from my Motorola ?
The NYPD 's lips are apparently sealed about this matter ; despite repeated phone calls and a formal written request , spokesman Detective Walter Burnes did not respond to questions .
The Department of Justice is equally silent on the topic .
I submitted a request to the organization 's press office for information about the FBI 's methods of obtaining location data from a target 's GPS - enabled phone , but received no response .
David Sobel was not surprised by my defeat , as his organization , EPIC , has been asking for the exact same clarification for well over a year now .
Without a potentially precedent - setting case moving through the federal justice system , however , the Justice Department 's silence is at least understandable .
You get away with what you can .
If new laws are n't forthcoming , perhaps our location - data guardians will be those twin pillars of federal bureaucracy , the FCC and the FTC .
Wireless communications are the former 's responsibility , and the FCC 's official mission , as set out in the 1934 act that created it , is to protect the " public interest . "
Yet under Bush - appointed chairman Michael Powell , an avowed fan of laissez faire , the FCC has shown little interest in employing its rule - making powers to take responsibility for protecting the privacy of cellphone users .
Last August , the FCC turned down a request from the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association to draw up location - data privacy rules .
( Though it is an industry group , the CTIA believes that federal rules lenient ones , if it has its way would convince consumers that LBS is n't as menacing as it sounds . )
The commission explained that it did " not wish to artificially constrain the still - developing market for location - based services .
" So all hopes rest with the FTC , charged with holding companies to their contractual word .
This is exactly the sort of oversight that 's required for the libertarian fantasy to come true .
If a cellphone carrier is going to one - up its competitors by positioning itself as a stickler for privacy , there need to be consequences if it breaks its pledge .
In Connecticut , the Department of Consumer Protection took a step in the direction of punishing privacy violations in February 2002 when it backed a suit against Acme Rent - a - Car for using GPS monitors installed in its autos to fine renters for exceeding the speed limit .
The department successfully argued that Acme 's contracts were not upfront about this monitoring , and the company discontinued its policy .
Optimistic that the FTC would confirm that , in lieu of federal statutes on the matter , it would take the lead in making sure no one finds out that I enjoy the occasional Taco Bell feast , I called the agency .
Staff members seemed mystified at the prospect of scrutinizing a company 's location - privacy policy .
I started with a gruff Consumer Protection staffer , high in the hierarchy .
He was obviously less than pleased to hear from me .
" Never dealt with an issue like that . . .
I do n't have anyone that 's readily available to talk to you , " he said , before kicking me down to the Office of Public Affairs .
Despite my appeals to speak with an actual lawyer , an FTC spokeswoman rebuffed my every requestand , in true government style , passed the buck .
" Talk to the F - C - C , " she added , enunciating each letter to emphasize her irritation .
Clearly , E911 is not an issue to which the FTC has given much thought .
Back to square one , then : no clear laws , no bureaucratic oversight , a permissive judiciary .
Aside from saying " Trust us , " industry 's response is to push technological safeguards , like GPS phones equipped with " I AM HERE " buttons .
If you do n't want to be bothered , do n't press that button when the handset starts flashing .
Trouble is , this does n't really shut off the GPS chip the satellites still know where you are .
They just wo n't remind you of that fact .
When it comes to consumer protections , technology simply does n't have the teeth necessary for the jobespecially when the safeguards in question are manufactured by the same folks who'd love to peddle your location data .
But until some privacy Waterloo embarrasses the law into catching up , technology is what we 're stuck with .
The legendary hacker zinerecently published a how - to guide on building a GPS - jamming device .
Maybe I 'll head to RadioShack this weekend and pick up the parts .
And I 'll leave the cellphone at home when I go the only surefire way to opt out .
