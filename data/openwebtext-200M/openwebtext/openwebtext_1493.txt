Why do you think it makes sense to do GSEA with correlation values ?
If you ca n’t pitch the press , pay them .
That ’s the proposition some review sites have for publicity - starved iPhone developers .
Several websites dedicated to iPhone app reviews are requesting payments from developers in exchange for writeups of their apps , Wired.com has learned .
Those payments are not always clearly disclosed to readers , and the practice has n’t received much discussion outside of gaming blogs .
Soliciting money in exchange for a product review is not illegal , but the practice should raise questions about the credibility and independence of the review sites , critics say .
“ They prey on people who need exposure , ” said Oliver Cameron , developer of the popular iPhone app Postman , who has avoided pitching his apps to sites that request payment for reviews .
“ It strikes me as a paid ad , really .
They never seem to actually ‘ review ’ it . ”
The two sites that were most frequently mentioned by programmers who contacted Wired.com were TheiPhoneAppReview.com and AppCraver.com .
Both sites appear in the top four Google search results for the search term “ iPhone app review . ”
With more than 150,000 apps in the iPhone App Store , rising above the crowd is a major challenge for developers .
Getting a good review on the web can help drive sales and that , in turn , can raise an app ’s profile within the App Store .
While apps that earn their creators hundreds of thousands of dollars are rare , they do exist , and many developers seek publicity in hopes of achieving this dream .
Driven by that demand , app review websites are offering to “ expedite ” reviews — that is , bring apps to the front of the review queue — in exchange for a fee .
But at least one site , The PhoneAppReview.com , has gone even further , and threatened to shun products whose developers have n’t paid for reviews .
The iPhone App Review told independent developer Michael D’Ulisse it would not review his app Pocket Labeler at all unless he paid a fee of $ 25 .
The demand is at odds with the website ’s About section , which implies that fees only apply to reviews that are expedited .
D’Ulisse provided a copy of an e-mail from a site editor :
I would be interested in writing a review and having it on our website ( www.theiphoneappreview.com).
We do charge a $ 25 fee for reviews ( this is used to compensate our authors ) , so the decision is yours .
If you want a review written , but have no promo codes left , I can purchase the app and add the price of the app into your invoice .
Let me know either way .
Thanks !

The iPhone App Review
D’Ulisse noted that on a separate occasion in November 2009 , he received the same e-mail response from The iPhone App Review when he distributed press releases for his app 2,001 Easy Gifts .
“ So you ’ve got a reviewer , and she ’s an editor at the site who wants to use my app personally but will not post a review on her site unless I give her $ 25 , ” D’Ulisse wrote .
“ What happened to journalistic integrity ? ”
The iPhone App Review ’s editor - in - chief Shaun Campbell said he was unaware that his site ’s writers were requesting payment in exchange for reviews .
He explained that the reviewers work autonomously , so he is unsure of how they ’re paid by app creators .
As of this writing , The iPhone App Review ’s About section remains unchanged , stating that fees only apply to expedited app reviews .
“ I have never once sent a request for a fee to a developer to review their app , ” Campbell told Wired.com .
“ That is not our policy , which is why that is not stated in the About . ”
Campbell said that his site ’s policy is to offer expedited service in exchange for a fee because with the gigantic number of apps in the App Store , it would be an “ impossible task to review all the apps we receive , paid or unpaid . ”
He added that very few talented writers would be willing to review iPhone apps for free and that providing payment ensures quality work .
“ The iPhone App Review is not a PR charity , ” Campbell said .
“ We ’re a business , and like in any business , there are costs that need to be recovered . ”
Requiring payment for product reviews is not illegal , but the Federal Trade Commission has frowned on the practice .
The commission believes a paid review can easily be the same as a paid advertisement , and consumers as a result may be misled into purchasing a product based on a falsely positive evaluation that was bought .
To address the issue , the FTC in October 2009 published revised guidelines governing endorsements for bloggers , requiring bloggers to provide disclosure whenever a review is written in exchange for money or gifts .
Rich Cleland of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection said he could not comment on specific websites , because they must be evaluated on a case - by - case basis .
He said that in general , so long as payments are disclosed clearly and accurately , it is not considered misleading to the public .
“ If a consumer knows that a producer pays for the review to appear , the consumer can make up their own mind to what extent that affects the credibility of the review , ” Cleland told Wired.com in a phone interview .
“ From our perspective , the primary issue is not the payment but the disclosure of the payment . ”
Still , paid reviews should raise questions about a publication ’s credibility , he added .
“ It ’s reasonable to assume that a significant number of consumers would n’t give the same level of credibility to something they thought was a paid review versus something they thought was an independent review , ” Cleland said .
Every time a review is written in exchange for pay , it should be explicitly disclosed on that review , Cleland said .
Paid reviews on The iPhone App Review do not include such a disclosure in the text of the review .
AppCraver.com also seeks payment for expedited reviews .
Lore Sjöberg , Wired.com ’s
Alt Text columnist , said he submitted his iPhone app The Cyborg Name Decoder to AppCraver.com for review , and in response the site offered to expedite a review of his app for $ 150 .
The letter included a promise to contact Sjöberg “ prior to publishing a review that scores lower than 5/10 . ”
The e-mail also offered Sjöberg the opportunity to buy an advertisement on the site , along with the promise that every advertised app would also receive an editorial review .
AppCraver did not respond to Wired.com ’s request for comment .
However , it ’s worth noting that AppCraver has , in some reviews , disclosed when reviews are “ expedited , ” providing a link to the site ’s policy about paid expedited reviews , which states , “ Simply put , an Expedited Review is one where the developer paid to move to the front of the line .
Developers can NOT buy a good score . ”
Not all iPhone app review sites require money or gifts in exchange for write - ups .
The creators of app review sites 148 Apps and Slide to Play authored a set of ethical standards called Organization for App Testing Standards , or OATS , that they hope other sites will commit and adhere to .
“ Steve and I created OATS out of our concern for the lack of ethics when we started seeing more and more of these sites , ” said Jeff Scott of 148 Apps .
“ While we strive to stick to standard practices of editorial integrity , there are others that seem to operate under a very different set of morals , ” said Scott .
Slide to Play ’s Steve Palley said paid reviews are detrimental to the community of iPhone developers and customers .
“ Paid reviews damage our entire ecosystem because they harm consumers , period , full stop , ” Palley told Wired.com in an e-mail .
“ People who think they are reading objective reviews are going to be disappointed after taking paid ‘ advice . ' ”
Added Palley , “ We decided that we needed to do something to put a stop to it . ”
The FTC ’s Cleland said that if blogs are not clearly or honestly disclosing payments for reviews , consumers can file complaints to the FTC ’s online Complaint Assistant or by calling 1-877- FTC -HELP ( 1-877-382-4357 ) .
Update : 2:30 p.m. PDT — Matt Marquez , a Mac Directory editor , has published a post about his experience applying for a job at The iPhone App Review , in which Campbell said all writers were required to charge a fee to developers for reviews .
Update : March 19 , 10 p.m. PDT : — The Today in iPhone podcast has posted another e-mail showing a The iPhone App Review author requesting payment in exchange for a review last month — with no mention of expedited service .
The PayPal ID listed for sending payments is Shaun Campbell .

Car Accident Attorneys – Personal Injury Law
Many people want to know the value of their auto accident case and , somewhat shockingly , will even choose their attorney based on the estimated value that the attorney gives their case .
This is faulty reasoning .
It is 100 % impossible for any auto accident attorney to predict the value of what either an insurance company ( during settlement ) or a jury ( after a trial ) will place on their auto accident case .
Jurors and insurance companies can pretty much decide what they want and there are no guidelines for them , other than courts sometimes overturn judgments that are too high ( this is relatively rare but can happen ) .
Five Factors Considered By Insurance Companies During Settlement Negotiations
That being said , during the settlement process , which means before any trial , the insurance company will assess a variety of factors to determine how much to offer you .
Among other things , they may consider the following five factors .
more info on this website
1. Who Caused The Auto Accident ?
First , they consider whether the other driver was clearly at fault .
One example might be that the other driver ran a red light and smashed into your car .
Lawyers would generally consider that a “ clear liability ” auto accident case .
2. How Bad Are Your Injuries From The Auto Accident ?
Second , the insurance company will consider the extent and permanency of your injuries .
If your injuries were minor or did not last for a long time , the value of your case may be lower .
We rely on medical records to prove this second issue .
So you need medical proof if you have serious injuries , which means you need treatment and cannot rely solely on your own testimony to establish the extent of your ongoing pain or disability .
3. Can You Prove The Above Two Factors During Any Trial ?
Third , the insurance company will consider whether you are likely to be able to prove the first two factors during any trial .
This involves the consideration of potentially hundreds of minor sub-issues , such as whether any critical evidence might be admissible at trial , or whether a key witness is available , just as a few of many examples .
4. How Do Your Witnesses Measure Up ?
Fourth , the insurance company will consider the reliability and demeanor of all witnesses , including you .
This means they will consider whether the jury is likely to believe any witness and / or like you .
5. Can They Beat Your Lawyer , Either During Pre-Trial or Trial ?
Fifth , the insurance company will consider whether your lawyer has seriously prepared your case and done a good job ( or not ) .
They are less likely to give away money if they believe that they can beat your lawyer , either during any motions or appeals that they plan to file , or during the actual trial .
Along the same lines , if they refuse to settle before any lawsuit is filed , they may further wait until any “ dispositive ” motions are filed .
Dispositive motions are basically motions that the defendant can file to try to get the judge to throw your case out of court , such as motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment .
If the defendant is successful in these types of motions , then you cannot get to a jury ( unless you win on a subsequent appeal , which may or may not make sense to file depending on the legal issue involved ) .
So very often the settlement value will increase if you survive a motion for summary judgment in particular .
But your lawyer ’s success with other motions may also sway the defense counsel , such as motions allowing you to present very persuasive evidence .
( In other news , the evidence laws alone fill books and present the basis for many potential arguments that can help or harm you , before and during the trial . )
What Do Jurors Consider During Trial ?
If your case survives the pre-trial process and you get to a jury , which only happens in a small percentage of cases because most cases either settle or get dismissed before trial , then the answer depends on the opinions and attitudes of your particular jury .
This actually can involve strategic questions about which county or state in which to file your lawsuit , if you have choices under the rules of procedure ( which , like evidence rules , are also exceedingly complex and fill volumes of books ) , because different geographic areas are notoriously more or less favorable to plaintiffs .
This again can involve many potentially critical motions filed and argued by your auto accident lawyer in court .
Once you know your case will be heard by any particular jury , the value of your case depends on what they think of any evidence presented .
Typically they consider the defendant ’s level of fault , your level of contributing fault , and , again the extent and permanency of any injuries .
They usually hear from you , the defendant driver , any witnesses to the accident , and any relevant experts .
Your auto accident lawyer strategically may choose from a wide array of potentially admissible evidence to decide what might best sway the jury .
And the auto accident lawyers often fight ( on paper and during subsequent oral hearings ) about whether the evidence code will allow various types of evidence .
So , as you hopefully see , your attorney cannot predict the value of your auto accident case .
That being said , auto accident cases can range in value from nothing to hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in damages , in cases involving severe injuries with clear liability and ( important ) defendants with large insurance policies .
One Sad Thing
If you were injured by an uninsured driver with no personal assets or cash , and you did not have uninsured or under - insured motorist coverage yourself , then the value of your case is zilch , regardless of any other factors .
You can not recover what does not exist .
For this reason , it is a very wise idea for all residents to add uninsured or under - insured motorist coverage to their automobile insurance policies .
This coverage often proves crucial when people are seriously injured and need money to survive without the ability to work .
Final Piece of Good News
You can recover a lot of money for serious injuries if you hire a highly skilled auto accident attorney .

Pas encore appliquée , déjà invalidée : c'est – en résumé – le message des opposants à la loi Hadopi , l'autorité qui sera chargée d'envoyer des messages et , après deux avertissements , de couper l'accès des internautes qui téléchargent illégalement .
Les anti-Hadopi s'appuient sur une étude récente du laboratoire de recherches M@rsouin , basée sur les résultats d'une enquête par téléphone auprès de 2 000 personnes , réalisée en Bretagne par téléphone fin 2009 .
Les chercheurs ont constaté que le vote de la loi , qui ne devrait entrer en application que mi-2010 , a d'ores et déjà eu un impact sur le comportement des téléchargeurs , mais qu'il n'est pas tout à fait celui qu'espérait le gouvernement .
Le sondage montre qu'une partie des téléchargeurs a anticipé la mise en application du texte , et se tourne de plus en plus vers des systèmes d'échange de fichiers plus difficilement contrôlables que les réseaux peer - to - peer .
Ce sont ces derniers qui sont visés en priorité par l'Hadopi .
Parmi les personnes interrogées , 15 % affirment avoir cessé de télécharger sur ces réseaux , mais dans le même temps , les utilisateurs d'autres méthodes de téléchargement illégal ( téléchargement direct , newsgroups ... ) augmentent dans des proportions similaires .
DISSUASION ET ÉVOLUTION DES TECHNIQUES
Peut - on pour autant en déduire que l'effet dissuasif de la loi est nul ?
Pas exactement .
Si les anti-Hadopi estiment , en se basant sur un chiffre de l'étude , qu' " Hadopi a fait augmenter le piratage " , une partie des données analysées ne sont pas statistiquement significatives .
En additionnant les chiffres , les chercheurs du M@rsouin aboutissent bien à une augmentation de 3 % du nombre de personnes déclarant télécharger illégalement , mais ce pourcentage est calculé à partir d'une sous - partie de l'échantillon et ne représente que six personnes .
" Ce chiffre de 3 % est peu significatif statistiquement , reconnaît Sylvain Dejean , l'un des auteurs de l'étude .
D'ailleurs il ne figure pas dans les principales conclusions de l'étude .
En revanche , nous avons constaté une hausse de 27 % de l'utilisation des modes de téléchargement autres que le peer - to - peer : c'est une tendance nette et statistiquement significative . "
Une conclusion corroborée par d'autres indices indirects , comme l'augmentation des recherches sur Google pour des services de téléchargement direct .
La " peur du gendarme " aurait - elle facilité le développement de nouveaux moyens de téléchargement , au lieu d'inciter les internautes à cesser de télécharger ?
Le M@rsouin note que pour l'instant , seuls 15 % des utilisateurs de réseaux peer - to - peer ont cessé de le faire , sachant qu'une partie d'entre eux s'est tournée vers d'autres moyens de téléchargement ( les deux tiers d'après l'enquête , mais là encore l'échantillon est peu significatif statistiquement ) .
Les défenseurs de la loi notent de leur côté que l'Hadopi n'étant pas encore en place , il est beaucoup trop tôt pour tenter de tirer des conclusions sur l'efficacité de la loi .
Une objection soulevée notamment par David El Sayeg , le secrétaire général du SNEP , qui regroupe les principales maisons de disques , dans une interview au site Electron Libre .
"
Il est avéré que le marché du numérique se développe de manière significative dans les pays qui ont mis en place une législation destinée à lutter contre le piratage sur Internet " , martèle M. El Sayegh , qui note qu'en Suède , où un équivalent de l'Hadopi a été mis en place en avril 2009 , le marché de la musique numérique a augmenté de 98 % l'année dernière .
LES AMBIGUÏTÉS DE L'EXEMPLE SUÉDOIS
En réalité , la situation suédoise est plus complexe .
Certes , les ventes de musique numérique y ont presque doublé en 2009 et les ventes de musique y ont progressé pour la première fois depuis dix ans .
Mais la corrélation avec la mise en place de la riposte graduée n'est pas évidente .
Le téléchargement payant a progressé , mais ce sont les services de streaming légal ( Spotify , Deezer ... ) qui ont le plus contribué à la hausse : leur part dans les revenus de la musique numérique est passée de 17 % à 46,1 % des revenus .
Dans le cas suédois , une partie de la hausse des revenus de l'industrie musicale est donc liée au développement d'une offre payante attractive , et ne peut s'expliquer seulement par une baisse du téléchargement illégal .
De même , l'impact de la riposte graduée suédoise sur le téléchargement illégal est moins clair que ne l'affirment les éditeurs .
En avril 2009 , lors de la mise en place de la loi , le trafic Internet du pays a connu une brusque chute de volume , vraisemblablement liée à une réduction du trafic peer - to - peer , gros consommateur de bande passante .
Mais sept mois plus tard , le trafic avait atteint à nouveau son niveau d'avant avril , et poursuit depuis sa croissance .
Lors des débats sur la loi Hadopi en France , la majorité avait mis en avant le caractère " didactique " de la riposte graduée , estimant que la peur de la sanction aurait un impact important sur les comportements à moyen terme .
S'il faudra effectivement attendre la mise en place de la Haute Autorité pour avoir des éléments de bilan , l'exemple suédois et l'étude du M@rsouin tendent à montrer que l'impact pourrait être plus faible que ce qu'espèrent les partisans de l'Hadopi .

AFTER a couple of months of talks with the Chinese authorities , Google announced on Monday March 22nd that it had stopped censoring search results on its China portal , Google.cn , and was automatically redirecting its users to Google.com.hk , an uncensored portal in Hong Kong .
The company said it would try to maintain an advertising - sales operation in China , and would continue research and development work there .
However , it acknowledged that the Chinese authorities might block access to its site , in effect putting it out of business .
Google 's decision follows several attempts to hack its e-mail system , ever stronger censorship of its searches , legal complaints tied to its digitisation of books , and — always a worrying sign in China — growing vitriol in the state - controlled press .
If Google , which first raised the prospect of withdrawal in January , seems to have hesitated on the way towards the exit , there are 400 m reasons why .
That is the number of people in China , the government reckons , who use the internet .
Increasingly , they are choosing it over other media , notably television , as a source of entertainment , information and opinion , say Max Magni and Yuval Atsmon of McKinsey , a consultancy .
Over the past decade revenues from digital advertising have grown exponentially , admittedly from a tiny base , and the trend , predicts Mr Atsmon , will continue for some time .
Foreign internet firms operating in China have been quick to see its potential but largely unable to grasp it
Foreign companies operating in China have been quick to see this potential but largely unable to grasp it .
Facebook , Twitter and YouTube are all explicitly blocked .
EBay faltered because of its own managerial errors , but also because of delayed approval for PayPal , its online payment system , which this week announced a partnership with a Chinese rival .
Yahoo !
caused a stir by allowing the Chinese authorities to probe its users ' e-mails in a hunt for political dissidents — something it has since pledged not to do .
There are now domestic Chinese equivalents of all these sites — Baidu for Google , Taobao for eBay , Renren for Facebook , QQ for instant messaging , games and social networking — and they are doing well ( see chart ) .
The vast traffic they attract brings huge potential revenues and lots of useful data that could help them shape the internet in future , rather than merely following Western models , says Duncan Clark , chairman of BDA China , a consultancy .
To the extent that Western firms have seized on the growth of the internet in China , it has often been as a marketing tool .
McKinsey cites two examples : Nestlé has promoted coffee in a tea - drinking country with clever online ads about the joy of a coffee break , and Nokia has run music promotions and competitions , accessed via its handsets , in conjunction with video sites .
Outright revenues from the internet may become even harder to capture in years to come as China takes further steps to control access .
Content providers like Google have always needed to obtain local licences , and have thus been required to have a Chinese subsidiary or partner .
As awkward as this has been , new rules expand these impediments , requiring the licensing of domain names and , potentially , foreign sites as well .
Google 's possible departure from the Chinese market sends a chilling message to companies that remain .
Advertisers and workers can both see that they will be better off with entities the Chinese government favours , which means domestic firms .
A withdrawal would also cast a new light on Google itself .
It is often perceived to be successful because of advanced technology , but , as China shows , it thrives only to the extent that local laws permit it to link to content and distribute it without interference .
Alter the legal environment and the commercial results are quite different .

James Illingworth explains how the budget crisis got so bad in California -- and describes the development of a movement that is challenging the cuts .
ON MARCH 4 , thousands of students , workers , and teachers will take action across California to resist the ongoing attack on public education .
The scale of the fightback in education has inevitably focused attention on the cuts in that sector , but the crisis extends into every area of the state government .
How did things get so bad in California ?
Budget crises are hitting states across the U.S. According to the Economic Policy Institute , state governments entered the 2010 fiscal year with a collective budget shortfall of $ 156 billion .
This was partially overcome with $ 68 billion in federal stimulus spending and about $ 1 billion in rainy day funds .
That left $ 87 billion to be accounted for through spending cuts and tax increases .
The crisis is sharpest in California for several reasons .
First , its economy was the most reliant on construction and financial services , two of the sectors hardest hit in this recession .
California lost half a million jobs in 2009 alone .
Over 2 million Californians are out of work today , and the unemployment rate stands at more than 12 percent .
Statewide , construction , manufacturing and business services have each lost well over 150,000 jobs during the last 18 months .
And , of course , tax revenues have slumped as a result of the downturn .
Some 4,000 students , faculty and staff demonstrated on Sproul Plaza at UC Berkeley last September
Second , California 's peculiar political character exacerbated the crisis .
One key factor is the 1978 Proposition 13 ballot measure , which put a strict limit on property taxes and mandated a two - thirds majority vote of the legislature to raise any state taxes .
For a decade , Republicans in Sacramento refused to raise taxes , forcing the majority Democrats to fund the state government through massive borrowing .
This strategy worked fine while the economy kept growing , and cheap credit stayed available .
But the financial meltdown of late 2008 caused both a huge drop in state tax revenues and also the drying up of credit .
Now , almost 5 percent of the state budget is dedicated to servicing California 's massive debts .
That 's $ 4.5 billion this year , and it 's projected to rise to more than $ 9 billion , or 6 percent of the budget , before the end of the 2010s .
From the beginning of the crisis , therefore , the state government consistently sought to make poor and working - class Californians pay the price .
Rather than introduce publicly funded jobs programs to replace employment lost in the private sector , the state used the crisis to attack social welfare programs , privatize whole parts of the public sector and attempt to break the back of the teachers ' union .
THE SCALE of the attack to come became clear in November 2008 , when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger responded to the Wall Street meltdown by proposing a furlough program for state workers , elimination of some paid holidays and restrictions on overtime .
By early 2009 , Schwarzenegger and California Democrats were proposing to fix the $ 42 billion budget deficit with ballot measures that would have raised indirect taxation on working people and capped spending on education .
Voters went to the polls in May 2009 and overwhelmingly rejected these measures -- so Schwarzenegger and the Democrats were forced to take a different tack .
After many delays and much political wrangling , the legislature managed to pass a budget in July 2009 that included $ 15 billion in cuts -- including more than $ 6.5 billion slashed from K - 12 education and community colleges , and $ 2 billion taken from the California State University ( CSU ) and University of California ( UC ) systems .
Democrats in the legislature voted unanimously for the cuts .
They were able to secure passage of the budget when state Sen .
Abel Maldonado -- who has since gotten Schwarzenegger 's endorsement to serve as lieutenant governor -- defected from the closed ranks on the Republican side , and voted in favor .
At $ 20 billion , the projected budget deficit for 2010 - 11 is smaller than last year's .
But Schwarzenegger clearly intends to continue his strategy of cuts , privatization and war on the unions .
In January of this year , he announced plans for state workers to take a further 5 percent cut in wages , and to pay 5 percent more into their pensions out of their paychecks .
The proposed budget also calls for privatization of those pensions , which would strip many workers of any protection for their retirement benefits .
For good measure , the governor wants to curtail seniority protection for teachers .
And he wants to do all of this without sitting at the negotiating table with public sector unions .
If education took the biggest hit last time around , it 's now the turn of Health and Human Services , which the governor is targeting for 8 percent cuts , totaling almost $ 3 billion .
Included in this is an attack on In - Home Supportive Services ( IHSS ) , which cares for more than 430,000 of the poorest elderly and disabled Californians .
Despite the fact that a federal judge issued an injunction to stop the state government from implementing similar cuts during the 2009 - 10 budget year , Schwarzenegger now proposes to eliminate this service entirely for 87 percent of recipients , which could destroy more than 300,000 union jobs .
The governor 's latest budget also proposes to end public assistance for legal immigrants , which would save a paltry $ 300 million , but leave thousands of elderly and disabled people at the mercy of the recession .
If his plan is approved , the CalWORKS welfare program , which provided $ 723 for a two - parent family of three in January 2009 , will now pay out only $ 585 to the same family .
The budget also proposes a $ 750 million cut to Medi - Cal -- California 's version of Medicaid -- as well as cuts in day care services .
ALTHOUGH EDUCATION will take a smaller hit in the new budget , this sector has become the main symbol of the California budget crisis .
It 's also the area that most clearly demonstrates the " shock doctrine " approach of the California ruling class in the current crisis -- it 's become a testing ground for a policy of austerity and privatization .
Schwarzenegger has had a grudge against public education ever since he took office .
In 2004 , he agreed to a " Higher Education Compact " with the heads of the CSU and UC systems , under which student fees would rise at an average of 10 percent a year .
With so much cheap credit available during the debt bubble of those years , Schwarzenegger and university administrators figured that students and their families could fund the increase in fees through ever - more student loans , based on the equity from rising house prices .
The idea that higher education should be a luxury for the wealthiest Californians reached its logical conclusion when the UC Regents raised tuition by 32 percent in November 2009 .
At the same time , state authorities have gone on the offensive against public schools in the K - 12 system .
Schwarzenegger stacked the State Board of Education with advocates of privatization .
The result has been a steady push towards charter schools , which often employ non-union teachers and are run by private business interests .
At first , public - sector unions were slow to react to the attack .
In early 2009 , the California Teachers Association even made the extraordinary decision to back Schwarzenegger 's ballot measures , though they were hugely unpopular with California workers and would have led to an increase in regressive taxation .
Soon after , however , the first sparks of a fightback appeared on university campuses .
On September 24 , the first day of classes in much of the University of California system , two campus unions -- the Union of Professional and Technical Employees ( UPTE ) and the Coalition of University Employees ( CUE ) -- organized a one - day strike , and found a deep well of support from students and faculty .
Professors and lecturers throughout the UC system signed on to an open letter calling for walkouts against the cuts .
At UC Berkeley , as many as 5,000 students and workers rallied against the cuts on September 24 , and thousands took action elsewhere .
September 24 also saw the beginning of the student occupation movement .
At UC Santa Cruz , some two dozen protestors took over the graduate student commons and remained barricaded inside for almost a week .
The tactic spread -- occupations took place on UC campuses at Davis , Berkeley and Los Angeles , plus San Francisco State and Fresno State , among others .
On October 24 , some 800 students , workers and teachers gathered in Berkeley for a conference to coordinate the fight against the cuts , and voted for March 4 to be a day of strikes and actions to defend public education at all levels .
The movement took another big step forward when the UC Regents met in November for their vote to raise tuition by 32 percent .
When they were meeting , students and their allies occupied buildings at half a dozen schools across California .
Some of the occupations involved hundreds and even thousands of people , and led to confrontations with riot police at UC Berkeley , UCLA and UC Santa Cruz .
Authorities only regained control on these campuses after several days of protests .
THE SCALE of the November protests and the inspiration they gave to many rank - and - file workers in the public sector finally forced union leaderships to take the movement seriously .
One by one , during December and January , the teachers ' unions endorsed the March 4 actions .
Even if their organizing efforts were often top - down or half - hearted , this development demonstrated the depth of anger among union members and showed how a radicalized and mobilized membership could shift the direction of labor officials .
So far , the movement against cuts in education has won mostly symbolic victories .
In early January , Schwarzenegger proposed a constitutional amendment to guarantee funding for education and stated that California " can no longer afford to cut higher education . "
Hours later , the governor 's chief of staff called campus protests " the tipping point " in producing this partial reprieve for schools .
In mid-February , a California state legislature committee responded to student and worker anger about UC spending priorities by announcing an audit of the entire system .
But simply demanding more money from Sacramento is n't enough .
The movement is also calling for the democratization of education -- an end to the system where political appointees and bureaucrats , many with an ideological predisposition to privatization , make decisions that affect millions of students , workers and teachers .
We need to stand up against charter schools and all other attempts to introduce market relations into our basic social services .
Meanwhile , activists ' demands have gone on to focus on a radical change in the distribution of wealth in California .
Today , working - class Californians pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some of the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the state .
Many profitable companies actually pay no state taxes at all - - overall , the share of state taxes paid by corporations in California has shrunk to about 7 percent .
Many activists are also demanding an end to regressive taxation and the repeal of Proposition 13 .
The crisis in California should serve as a warning to workers and students in other states .
Because of its unique tax structure and political make - up , California is feeling the effects of the credit crunch first .
But almost every state in the country -- particularly those where the boom and bust of the housing market hit hardest , like Nevada , Arizona and Florida - - face a similar crisis .
The Obama administration 's decision to call a three - year freeze on non-military spending is a signal of the austerity measures that lie in wait for students and workers everywhere .
No matter how inspiring they are , the March 4 Day of Action wo n't be enough to stop the cuts by itself .
This is a long - term struggle , and the movement needs to prepare for that .
Where the fightback has already begun , activists must strengthen and broaden existing organizations -- the networks of rank - and - file teachers , campus unions and student assemblies .
These forces should attempt to bring into action still greater numbers of workers and students , while remaining independent of the educational bureaucracy and the Democrats in Sacramento , who have tried to corral the protest at every turn .
At the local and statewide level , we need to strengthen the cooperation and coordination among different sectors of education .
But we also need to broaden the struggle .
We need a movement that unites students and teachers with other public sector workers and the poor people who are losing vital services .
The activism and protests we 've seen so far show the potential to move forward .
A woman was reported to the police after going to the aid of a child left in a tree because it was the school 's policy not to help youngsters in that situation .
Kim Barrett was passing Manor primary school , in Melksham , Wiltshire , when she saw a five - year - old boy apparently stuck in a tree .
She went to help him but next day received a visit from a police community support officer , who told her she had been trespassing , she said .
Manor primary school today admitted that its policy was to observe children who climb into trees from a distance rather than go to them , for fear the pupil might be distracted and fall , or feel rewarded for bad behaviour .
It claimed the incident was shortlived and urged adults not to enter school grounds without permission .
Barrett , who has a six - year - old daughter at a different school , today said she was shocked by the policy .
She had simply wanted to help the boy and was upset at how the school had responded .
She added that the incident had happened this month as she walked home .
She went to the front of the school and on to the playing field to help the child .
Barrett , who works as a part - time cleaner , claimed the boy was in the tree for 45 minutes .
The school insisted it was less than 10 .
Later that evening a letter from the headteacher , Beverley Martin , was posted through Barrett 's door , saying that the school had contacted the police about the incident .
The next morning Barrett was visited by a police community support officer , who told her she had committed a trespassing offence .
Barrett said : " I felt really angry because I felt I had saved the school and this boy from something that could have been far worse , and that instead of thanking me I was under investigation .
It was ridiculous .
He was all on his own . "
The school disputes Barrett 's observation of the incident .
It concedes that the child had been in the tree but says he got down before she reached him .
It also claims Barrett climbed over a padlocked gate to get into the school .
The child had been viewed from three vantage points , the school added .
In a statement it said : " The safety of our pupils is our priority and we would like to make it clear that this child was being observed at all times during this very short incident .
Like other schools whose premises include wooded areas , our policy when a child climbs a tree is for staff to observe the situation from a distance so the child does not get distracted and fall .
This also ensures children are not ' rewarded ' with attention for inappropriate behaviour .
" Ofsted are aware of our policies and procedures and graded us as outstanding for our care , guidance and support of our children .
With regard to this incident , the child 's mother is in agreement with , and fully supportive of , our actions both prior to the incident and since . "
Police battle to control EDL and UAF protest in Bolton
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Police have battled with thousands of demonstrators during clashes between the English Defence League ( EDL ) and Unite Against Fascism ( UAF ) in Bolton .
Police said about 1,500 UAF and 2,000 EDL supporters were in Victoria Square and several people were injured .
Sixty - seven people were arrested , including the UAF protest organiser on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder , police said .
The EDL says it opposes " militant Islam " and Sharia law .
UAF accuses the EDL of being a far right party but it describes itself as a peaceful , non-political group .
Dog bite A 16 - year - old girl , who the police said had nothing to do with the protests , was treated after she suffered a panic attack .
Two members of UAF were also taken to hospital with a minor head and a minor ear injury and smoke bombs were set off , the police said .
Sixty - seven people were arrested during the demonstrations Greater Manchester Police said a 19 - year - old officer had suffered a fractured finger and another officer was treated for a dog bite .
Many shops and pubs closed in the area and most taxi firms pulled their drivers off the roads for fear of violence .
The protest , which started at about 1000 GMT , has now calmed down .
Protesters for the EDL were escorted away from Victoria Square by police .
UAF supporters were then told to disperse by about 1630 GMT .
A police spokeswoman said there were now only a few people left in the square .
Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said earlier : " The number of arrests already made is a clear indication that this is not a peaceful protest and some demonstrators are determined to cause trouble .
" We are facing a lot of hostility and will take swift action when confronted with disorder .
" The actions of some demonstrators is resulting in injuries to others .
This is not acceptable . "
The force warned offenders would be identified from CCTV footage and " brought to justice " .
Hindu festival
The EDL published a notice on its website with information about the demonstration .
It said that supporters would only protest peacefully and they were aiming to have " zero arrests " .
It stated : " We will not ever submit to the radicals .
We will not tolerate their intolerance .
We will stand firm and further the cause of the EDL . "
EDL supporters were warned not to react to any goading from other parties , but to smile and give the V for victory sign .
The two factions were separated by barriers on the steps of the town hall , which was boarded up .
We and the faith community leaders have done everything within our power to prevent this demonstration due to the risk of violence
Bolton Council leader , Cliff Morris
The leader of Bolton Council , the Bishop of Bolton and representatives from the Council of Mosques and the Hindu Forum wrote to Alan Johnson earlier this week asking for him to ban the demonstration .
But he told them it was not in his power to stop a protest .
Before the protest , council leader Cliff Morris said he was " disappointed " by the home secretary 's decision .
" We and the faith community leaders have done everything within our power to prevent this demonstration due to the risk of violence .
" However we understand under current law his powers are extremely limited . "
The EDL had postponed its protest , which was due to take place on 6 March , because they did not want it to clash with the timing of Hindu festival , Holi .

The Streets of San Francisco ... But Flat ?
What would San Francisco be without its steep hills ?
Well for one , if would be much easier to walk around and without much effort .
It would be easier to park a car and not have to curb the wheels .
We would not have runaway vehicles and tennis balls .
On the other hand , we would not have cable cars , beautiful views and quaint neighborhoods .
We would not have the many movies and postcard images to view .
In fact , San Francisco would not be San Francisco .
By tilting the camera , I attempted to " level " the hills .
These images whimsically portray the streets of San Francisco ... flat .
But thank goodness it is n't !
Since my neighborhood is surrounded by hills , steep hills and more steep hills , I will continue to add new images .

In 1992 I was chairman of the History Department at New York University — where I was also the only unmarried straight male under sixty .
A combustible blend : prominently displayed on the board outside my office was the location and phone number of the university ’s Sexual Harassment Center .
History was a fast - feminizing profession , with a graduate community primed for signs of discrimination — or worse .
Physical contact constituted a presumption of malevolent intention ; a closed door was proof positive .
Shortly after I took office , a second - year graduate student came by .
A former professional ballerina interested in Eastern Europe , she had been encouraged to work with me .
I was not teaching that semester , so could have advised her to return another time .
Instead , I invited her in .
After a closed - door discussion of Hungarian economic reforms , I suggested a course of independent study — beginning the following evening at a local restaurant .
A few sessions later , in a fit of bravado , I invited her to the premiere of Oleanna — David Mamet ’s lame dramatization of sexual harassment on a college campus .
How to explain such self - destructive behavior ?
What delusional universe was mine , to suppose that I alone could pass untouched by the punitive prudery of the hour — that the bell of sexual correctness would not toll for me ?
I knew my Foucault as well as anyone and was familiar with Firestone , Millett , Brownmiller , Faludi , e tutte quante .
To say that the girl had irresistible eyes and that my intentions were … unclear would avail me nothing .
My excuse ?
Please Sir , I ’m from the ’60s .
The life of an early - ’60s adolescent male was curiously confined .
We still inhabited our parents ’ moral universe .
Dating was difficult — no one had cars ; our homes were too small for privacy ; contraception was available but only if you were willing to confront a disapproving pharmacist .
There was a well - founded presumption of innocence and ignorance , for boys and girls alike .
Most boys I knew attended single - sex schools and we rarely encountered women .
A friend and I paid hard - earned money for Saturday morning dance classes at the Locarno Ballroom in Streatham ; but when it came time for the annual social , the girls from Godolphin & Latymer School laughed at us all the same .
We cut the experiment short .
Even if you got a date , it was like courting your grandmother .
Girls in those days came buttressed in an impenetrable Maginot Line of hooks , belts , girdles , nylons , roll - ons , suspenders , slips , and petticoats .
Older boys assured me that these were mere erotic impedimenta , easily circumnavigated .
I found them terrifying .
And I was not alone , as any number of films and novels from that era can illustrate .
Back then we all lived on Chesil Beach .
And then , to our surprise , we learned that we were part of the “ sexual revolution . ”
Within a matter of months , a generation of young women abandoned a century of lingerie and adopted the miniskirt with ( or without ) tights .
Few men of my acquaintance born later than 1952 have even heard of — much less encountered — most of the undergarments listed above .
The French pop star Antoine sang optimistically of buying contraceptive pills in the Monoprix ( approximately France ’s K - Mart ) .
At Cambridge , cool and worldly , I helped a friend arrange an abortion for his girl .
Everyone was “ playing with fire . ”
Or claiming to .
My generation was obsessed with the distinction between theory and practice — I knew a man in California whose doctoral dissertation was devoted to “ Theory and Practice in theory and in practice . ”
Sexually , we lived the contrast .
In theory we prided ourselves on being the cutting edge .
But in practice we were a conformist cohort : shaped more by our ’50s youth than our ’60s adolescence .
A surprising number of us married young — often to our first serious girlfriend .
And of that number , many have stayed married .
Championing the inalienable right of everyone to do anything , we had scant occasion to do much ourselves .
Our predecessors had grown up in the claustrophobic world of Lucky Jim and Look Back in Anger .
Constrained by the limits they were taught to respect , they might try to seduce an office junior or a female student but were instinctively rule - bound : they did not expect to live out their fantasies .
We , by contrast , had trouble distinguishing our fantasies from everyday life .
The solipsism of the ’ 60s — “ make love , not war , ” “ do your own thing , ” “ let it all hang out ” — certainly destroyed taboos .
But it also muffled the conscience : nothing was off - limits .
In 1981 , shortly after arriving at Oxford , I invited a student and her boyfriend to dinner .
My wife and I lived in a country village and by the time the young couple arrived it was snowing hard .
They would have to stay overnight .
I casually pointed out the tiny guestroom with its double bed and wished them good night .
Only much later did it occur to me to wonder whether the pair were sleeping together .
When I delicately alluded to the matter a few days later , the young woman patted me on the shoulder : “ Do n’t worry Tony , we understood .
You ’60s types ! ”
Our successors — liberated from old - style constraints — have imposed new restrictions upon themselves .
Since the 1970s , Americans assiduously avoid anything that might smack of harassment , even at the risk of forgoing promising friendships and the joys of flirtation .
Like men of an earlier decade — though for very different reasons — they are preternaturally wary of missteps .
I find this depressing .
The Puritans had a sound theological basis for restricting their desires and those of others .
But today ’s conformists have no such story to tell .
Nevertheless , the anxieties of contemporary sexual relations offer occasional comic relief .
When I was Humanities dean at NYU , a promising young professor was accused of improper advances by a graduate student in his department .
He had apparently followed her into a supply closet and declared his feelings .
Confronted , the professor confessed all , begging me not to tell his wife .
My sympathies were divided : the young man had behaved foolishly , but there was no question of intimidation nor had he offered to trade grades for favors .
All the same , he was censured .
Indeed , his career was ruined — the department later denied him tenure because no women would take his courses .
Meanwhile , his “ victim ” was offered the usual counseling .
Some years later , I was called to the Office of the University Lawyer .
Would I serve as a witness for the defense in a case against NYU being brought by that same young woman ?
Note , the lawyer warned me : “ she ” is really a “ he ” and is suing the university for failing to take seriously “ her ” needs as a transvestite .
We shall fight the case but must not be thought insensitive .
So I appeared in Manhattan Supreme Court to explain the complexities of academic harassment to a bemused jury of plumbers and housewives .
The student ’s lawyer pressed hard : “ Were you not prejudiced against my client because of her transgendered identity preference ? ”
“ I do n’t see how I could have been , ” I replied .
“ I thought she was a woman — is n’t that what she wanted me to think ? ”
The university won the case .
On another occasion , a student complained that I “ discriminated ” against her because she did not offer sexual favors .
When the department ombudswoman — a sensible lady of impeccable radical credentials — investigated , it emerged that the complainant resented not being invited to join my seminar : she assumed that women who took part must be getting ( and offering ) favorable treatment .
I explained that it was because they were smarter .
The young woman was flabbergasted : the only form of discrimination she could imagine was sexual .
It had never occurred to her that I might just be an elitist .
This story is revealing .
When discussing sexually explicit literature — Milan Kundera , to take an obvious case — with European students , I have always found them comfortable debating the topic .
Conversely , young Americans of both sexes — usually so forthcoming — fall nervously silent : reluctant to engage the subject lest they transgress boundaries .
Yet sex — or , to adopt the term of art , “ gender ” — is the first thing that comes to mind when they try to explain the behavior of adults in the real world .
Here as in so many other arenas , we have taken the ’60s altogether too seriously .
Sexuality ( or gender ) is just as distorting when we fixate upon it as when we deny it .
Substituting gender ( or “ race ” or “ ethnicity ” or “ me ” ) for social class or income category could only have occurred to people for whom politics was a recreational avocation , a projection of self onto the world at large .
Why should everything be about “ me ” ?
Are my fixations of significance to the Republic ?
Do my particular needs by definition speak to broader concerns ?
What on earth does it mean to say that “ the personal is political ” ?
If everything is “ political , ” then nothing is .
I am reminded of Gertrude Stein ’s Oxford lecture on contemporary literature .
“ What about the woman question ? ” someone asked .
Stein ’s reply should be emblazoned on every college notice board from Boston to Berkeley : “ Not everything can be about everything . ”
The playful mantras of our adolescence have become a way of life for later generations .
At least in the ’60s we knew , whatever we said , that sex was about …sex .
All the same , what followed is our fault .
We — the left , academics , teachers — have abandoned politics to those for whom actual power is far more interesting than its metaphorical implications .
Political correctness , gender politics , and above all hypersensitivity to wounded sentiments ( as though there were a right not to be offended ) : this will be our legacy .
Why should I not close my office door or take a student to a play ?
If I hesitate , have I not internalized the worst sort of communitarian self - censorship — anticipating my own guilt long before I am accused and setting a pusillanimous example for others ?
Yes : and if only for these reasons I see nothing wrong in my behavior .
But were it not for the mandarin self - assurance of my Oxbridge years , I too might lack the courage of my convictions — though I readily concede that the volatile mix of intellectual arrogance and generational exceptionalism can ignite delusions of invulnerability .
Indeed , it is just such a sense of boundless entitlement — taken to extremes — that helps explain Bill Clinton ’s self - destructive transgressions or Tony Blair ’s insistence that he was right to lie his way into a war whose necessity he alone could assess .
But note that for all their brazen philandering and posturing , Clinton and Blair — no less than Bush , Gore , Brown , and so many others of my generation — are still married to their first serious date .
I cannot claim as much — I was divorced in 1977 and again in 1986 — but in other respects the curious ’60s blend of radical attitudes and domestic convention ensnared me too .
So how did I elude the harassment police , who surely were on my tail as I surreptitiously dated my bright - eyed ballerina ?
Reader : I married her .

Women in Critical Condition After Hundreds of Bee Stings
Three people hospitalized after swarm of bees attacked .
March 19 , 2010  --
Two Phoenix women are in critical condition today after a swarm of bees attacked them Thursday night , authorities said .
Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Jacobs declined to disclose their names , but said the two women , who were about 55 years old and 75 years old , were out for an evening stroll when the bee swarm descended , stinging them hundreds of times .
By the time authorities arrived and used foam to stop the bee attack the women were rolling on the ground , covered in bees , he said .
" These women had the fight taken out of them , " Jacobs said .
" They were done trying to knock the bees off of them and that 's a really big deal .
It shows the severity of how many times they 'd been stung . "
He said that a good Samaritan , a Phoenix man in his 20s who tried to help the women , was also stung dozens of times and taken to an area hospital .
According to ABC affiliate KNXV , the man got out of a pickup truck and used a fire extinguisher on the bees .
" It looked like an Alfred Hitchcock movie .
They were covered , I mean covered in bees , you could n't see their face or their skin , " Tony Garcia , another onlooker who tried to help the women , told KNXV .
" The other guy was getting stung so he handed me the fire extinguisher and I was trying to get the bees to stop .
It was something else , they [ the women ] had bees in their hair , ears , just all over . "
Bees Particulary Active in Arizona This Time of Year
Authorities said the attack , which happened near an apartment complex in north Phoenix , appeared to be an isolated incident .
Sometimes bees attack when provoked , other times an article of clothing in a particular color can set them off .
It 's difficult to know the precise trigger , Jacobs said .
Residents in the area told KNXV that children had been throwing rocks at a hive in the eave of a nearby apartment building .
" [ The women ] were minding their own business , " Jacobs said .
" It sounds like this was bad timing . "
He emphasized that bees are particularly active this time of year .
" Everything is starting to blossom right now , " Jacobs said , adding that recent heavy rainfall has only added to the vegetation .
" This time is extremely busy for us .
… This is the bee season . "
Fire Dept. Spokesman : Bee Calls Expected to Surge
While the Phoenix area 's call center typically receives about 20 bee - related calls a day , Jacobs said that number could surge to 300 to 600 per day , given the recent publicity .
However , he said , most calls are nonthreatening .
The Fire Department only dispatches officers to respond when the bees are in a schoolyard or somewhere dangerous .
Jerry Keele , owner of The Bee Keeper in Phoenix , said bees in the area thrive all year round , but when spring comes " these hives explode . "
Keele said his business receives about 25 to 30 bee - related calls a day , but he predicts that within a couple of days he 'll start receiving 150 to 200 calls each day .
" We deal with this every single year , " he said .
Keele did n't witness the bees attacking the two women , but said that based on reports , he thinks the bees were not honey bees , but Africanized bees .
They look just like honey bees and produce the same amount of honey , but Keele said they 're more aggressive .
" You get anywhere near their hives and they come after you , " he said .
" They do n't need to be provoked .
Africanized bees , they see movement , they 'll come after you . "
He said that when people are in the immediate vicinity of an active swarm of bees , their best bet is to get out of the way .
" If you have a chance to run , you need to get inside of a home , inside of a car , " he said .
" Your only shot is to get somewhere that they 're not . "

It is a situation being repeated across the country as the aspirations of many workers have been recalibrated amid the recession , enabling some companies to reap unexpected rewards .
A result is a new cadre of underemployed workers dotting American companies , occupying slots several rungs below where they are accustomed to working .
These are not the more drastic examples of former professionals toiling away at “ survival jobs ” at Home Depot or Starbucks .
They are the former chief financial officer working as comptroller , the onetime marketing director who is back to being an analyst , the former manager who is once again an “ individual contributor . ”
The phenomenon was probably inevitable in a labor market in which job seekers outnumber openings five to one .
Employers are seizing the opportunity to stock up on discounted talent , despite the obvious risks that the new hires will become dissatisfied and leave .
“ They ’re trying to really professionalize this company , ” said Mr. Carroll , who is the sole breadwinner for his family of four and had lost his home to foreclosure .
“ I ’ve been able to play a big role in that . ”
In some cases , of course , the new employees fail to work out , forcing the company through the process of hiring and training someone else .
But Mr. Carroll is just one of several recent hires at Cartwright who would be considered overqualified , including a billing clerk who is a certified public accountant and a human resources director who once oversaw that domain for 5,000 employees but is now dealing with just 65 .
They represent marked upgrades for Cartwright , a modest - size business with expanding ambitions .
The company is benefiting from an influx of talent it probably never would have been able to attract in a better economic climate .
I can still recall the excitement of the first time I tried to access and administer a remote system using SSH .
Accessing my shell at a remote machine securely , being able to do local and remote port forwarding in order to access remote services through encrypted tunnels , X forwarding , secure file transfers using scp or sftp , authentication using public key infrastructure are just a few of the features that justify the excitement of the first time .
The only Secure Shell server implementation I had used all that time was the OpenSSH server .
Although this is an open - source project , the fact that it is written in C makes it extremely difficult for me to have fun with it by making any modifications in order to implement even simple things like command filtering .
This is because I have never programmed in C and do not intend to learn how to do it in the foreseeable future .
So what I ’ve been looking for today was a server implementation of the SSH2 protocol written in Python .
Unfortunately , there is no such project ready for immediate use .
I had to hack my own !
After several hours of trial and error , having written dozens of sample scripts for testing , I finally created a minimal project , called RapidSSH , in order to demonstrate how to create a fully functional SSH server with just a few lines of Python code by using Twisted .
conch , part of the Twisted Framework .
Read on …
At first , I tried to experiment with the sshsimpleserver .py example script that exists on the Twisted homepage .
But , soon I realized that this script is there just to give an idea about how to use Twisted .
conch and also provide a sensible starting point for your own implementations .
That script was not even close in having the functionality I had in mind .
After spending some time examining the Twisted source code , I found a fantastic , but completely undocumented , module : twisted.conch.unix .
Having gained some experience by my experimentation with sshsimpleserver .
py
I managed to easily put the pieces together and come up with the SSH server implementation as shown below .
But first , let ’s install some dependencies .
I assume that you will try the code on a machine aimed for testing , so I wo n’t be using the system ’s package manager but instead use easy_install to install the needed Python modules .
Other commands like pip could be used as well .
If you do not want to mess with your system - wide python installation , just use virtualenv and pip , but I wo n’t go into the details about how to use these tools in the current document .
Install the needed dependencies :
easy_install pycrypto easy_install pyasn1 easy_install pam easy_install twisted
Make sure you have gcc installed , because it will be needed to complete the installation of Twisted and PyCrypto .
Below is a small script I wrote in order to test the basic functionality .

Twisted included a module for PAM authentication , twisted .cred .
pamauth , but unfortunately I could not locate one of its dependencies to make it work .
So , I used the excellent python - pam to create a custom PAM authenticator class .

I can guess what you might thought when you read about this code :
Python is a cross- platform programming language .
Twisted runs on Windows .
So , is this a solution for running a SSH server on Win32 ?
Well , at the moment it wo n’t run because internally it uses some Python modules that are available on UNIX platforms only .
But , I intend to investigate the possibility of running this on Windows since I already need something like that .
We can now enjoy our Python SSH server .
Run as root :
python scripts/rapidsshd_unix.py
From another machine , connect to the server using an ssh client :
ssh -p 5022 rocky@arena
If you have deployed your public key in the ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file on the remote machine ( arena ) , you should be able to authenticate using the public key :
ssh -p 5022 - i / path/to/private.key rocky@arena
You should get output like the following on the server :

This first release of the script for demonstration purposes .
Do n’t get fooled by the small amount of code .
Information about how to put the pieces together is scarce and it required a lot trial&error and source code reading .
The above implementation contains none of the customizations I had in mind .
These will be done as soon as I find some time to do so .
Until then it will be nice to hear about your experiences or implementations you have worked on .

The Times and the Sunday Times are set to charge for access to their websites from June .
Rupert Murdoch said in August last year he wanted to charge for all his sites , though in November he suggested the firm could miss the June deadline .
Rebekah Brooks , chief executive at News International , said : “ These new sites , and the apps that will enhance the experience , reflect the identity of our titles and deliver a terrific experience for readers ... this is a crucial step towards making the business of news an economically exciting proposition . "
Other Murdoch titles , like The Sun and The News of the World , will follow The Times behind a paywall sometime after June .
The Times will charge £ 1 a day for access to the site - or £ 2 a week .
Subscribers to seven days of the print edition will get free access to the websites - the Sunday Times gets its own site for the first time .
The sites will launch in May for a free trial period - you can register here .
The move will be closely watched by the struggling UK newspaper business .
Although The Telegraph saw profits for the year jump a third to £ 41 m the Guardian Media Group was more typical - its losses grew by a third to £ 37 m for the year ended 29 March 2009 . ®
Please stay tuned for audio from the second half of the event , which consisted of a Q&A with O’Keefe and Walia , followed by audience discussion .
On Saturday , Feb. 20 , at the W2 Community Media Arts Centre in Vancouver ’s Downtown Eastside , rabble.ca and Working TV co-hosted a public discussion on the topic .
StopWar.ca activist and writer , Derrick O’Keefe questioned a diversity of tactics .
No One is Illegal activist and writer Harsha Walia expressed its benefits .
Methods of protest vary , and there has been much discussion between Canadians lately about certain methods employed by demonstrators at the Vancouver Winter Olympics .
After media denounced the destruction of property , including the smashing of a Hudson Bay Company window , some activists have suggested that such strategies could harm the greater cause .
Others believe that by criticizing diversity of tactics , the movement ’s solidarity is undermined .
Thank you for reading this story …
More people are reading rabble .ca than ever and unlike many news organizations , we have never put up a paywall – at rabble we ’ve always believed in making our reporting and analysis free to all , while striving to make it sustainable as well .

Apparently Sidney Crosby still lives with Mario Lemieux .
Anyone else find that weird ?
Dude , youâ€ ™re almost 23 .
Youâ€™ve got a Stanley cup ring , an Olympic gold medal , an 8.7 million dollar per year salary ( to say nothing of the endorsements ) .
Damn man , move out already .
But I digress …
I get the sense that Brian Burke likes to gamble .
And heâ€™s got a little over $ 12 Million in cap space at the table .
Itâ€™s safe to assume that high on his list will be re-signing Gustavsson , Kulemin and others , which could bring that total closer to 6 or 7 Million .
The Leafs need at least one or two more offensively gifted wingers .
If Burke wants to sincerely sell Torontonians a playoff contending team , he needs to bring someone in who will produce .
And on the cheap .
The current desire of Leafs fans is for this to be facilitated by trading Kaberle .
The hype and speculation around that is well above my pay grade though .
So who in the seething masses of UFAdom , hypothetically of course , could Burke look to ?
Alex Tanguay .
Hear me out .
Alex Tanguay , 30 , is having a decidedly modest year in Tampa this season .
He has 9 goals and 25 assists in 70 games for 34 points this season ( after racking up 41 points in 20 fewer games last season in Montreal ) .
Tampa signed him in September of 2009 as some French Connection 2.0 experiment with St Louis and Lecavalier .
Since Tanguay is on pace for his lowest single season goal and point total , itâ€™s safe to say that expectations have not been met .
So why am I testifying on this bumâ€™s behalf ?
History and experience .
This is a man who won a Stanley cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001 at just 21 years of age ( putting up 21 points in 23 playoff games no less ) .
Who better to talk to Luke Schenn or Tyler Bozak about being a key contributor in the playoffs so young ?
Heâ€™s had the experience of lifting the cup , something no Leaf other than Beauchemin can speak to .
Heâ€™s played in 98 playoff games and has scored 59 points , higher totals than any current Leaf .
Alex Tanguay has 614 points in 729 career games over the course of ten seasons ( the total number of games also speaks to relative durability ) .
Add onto that a career +/- of +155 .
Heâ€™s only had one season where he wasnâ€™t a plus player ( this current one , - 2 , on a Tampa team that has - 37 Goals For / Against differential ) .
And heâ€™s still only 30 years old .
But history is a fickle thing .
At age 29 , after an injury shortened season , he signed a one year 2.5 million dollar contract with Tampa Bay .
The hope being that he would put up 15 â€ “ 20 goals and 50 â€ “ 60 points , and then find himself a Darcy Tucker â€˜last great contractâ€™ of about 3 â€ “ 4 million per season for 4 or 5 years .
A lovely retirement package isnâ€™t in the cards due to this seasonâ€™s production .
He still needs to prove himself worthy of such a deal .
My modest proposal is this :
Why not throw the dice on a one year deal , for 2 â€ “ 3 million dollars ?
This is precisely the sort of gamble that could turn the Leafs into winners .
While I feel that Tanguayâ€™s years of putting up a point per game are behind him , he could be just the tonic for the Leafs second line .
The Leafs are weak on the left wing , so Tanguay could step in there and find himself with more opportunities to return to his previous 50 â€ “ 70 points per season range .
Worst case scenario ?
He has one bad season in Toronto , and heâ€™s gone ( maybe even as early as the trade deadline ) .
Heck , Burke was willing to ante up 3 years and 8.7 million on Mikhail Grabovski putting up similar numbers , without a similar pedigree .
There are always worse hands one could play .
Average earnings before interest and tax of the companies replying to the American Chamber of Commerce survey fell to 8.3 per cent in 2009 from 15 per cent the year before .
Some are shifting production to lower - cost regions of China and elsewhere in Asia , especially India .
Willie O'Dea is no longer a member of the Cabinet .
His resignation as Defence Minister has been announced in the past few minutes .
It comes after days of pressure over his false statement in a court case and false allegations against Sinn Féin Councillor , Maurice Quinlivan .
John Gormley , leader of the Green Party , said the controversy would be a distraction if Mr O’Dea stayed in the Cabinet .
Mr Gormley claimed he had been led to believe that full details of the interview Mr O’Dea gave would vindicate him .
He added : “ In fact it does the opposite . ”
In a hard - hitting statement , the Environment Minister also criticised Mr O’Dea ’s attempt to defend the comments both in the Dáil ( Irish Parliament ) and in the media .
“ At the very conclusion of yesterday ’s Dáil debate , Mr O’Dea said his original actions in the matter were based on information given to him by An Garda Siochana , ” Mr Gormley said .
“ We were very concerned by this behaviour by a member of Government .
“ We have also taken the view that Willie O’Dea ’s comments and conduct during yesterday ’s debate and in subsequent media appearances were inappropriate .
“ All these factors have led us to conclude that Willie O’Dea could not continue as a member of this Government .
“ The issue has already taken up too much energy and attention at a time when crucial economic challenges face the Irish people .
“ We are committed to continuing to work with our partners in Government to face those challenges . ”

Facebook traffic tops Google for the week
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Facebook topped Google to become the most visited U.S. Web site last week , indicating a shift in how Americans are searching for content .
Web analysis firm Experian Hitwise said Monday that the social networking site surpassed Google to take the No. 1 spot for the week ended March 13 .
" It shows content sharing has become a huge driving force online , " said Matt Tatham , director of media relations at Hitwise .
" People want information from friends they trust , versus the the anonymity of a search engine . "
Facebook accounted for 7.07 % of U.S. Web traffic that week , while Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) received 7.03 % .
The study compared only the domains Facebook.com and Google.com -- not , for example , Google - owned sites like Gmail.com .
Though the traffic levels were close , Facebook 's year - over - year growth far outpaced Google 's that week .
The number of visitors to Facebook spiked 185 % compared with the same period last year , while Google 's traffic climbed just 9 % .
" It 's definitely a big moment for Facebook , even though they beat by a small margin , " Tatham said .
" We 've seen it coming for quite a long time . "
Facebook had never before beaten Google over a full weeklong period , though it has been the most visited site on recent holidays : Christmas Eve , Christmas Day and New Year 's Day .
Facebook was also the top site on the weekend of March 6 - 7 .
But Tatham noted that when he added up traffic on all Google properties like Google Maps and YouTube , the company 's sites comprised 11.03 % of visits .
Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) was second with 10.98 % .
Google.com had been the No. 1 site each week since Sept. 15 , 2007 , when ironically it passed another social networking site , MySpace.com , in order to take the crown .
Of course , the MySpace connection could be a bad omen for Facebook .
MySpace enjoyed dominance on the social networking scene for years until it saw traffic plummet following Facebook 's rise .
" By nature , the Web is ever - changing , " Tatham said .
" The Internet can be a fickle crowd . "
Causality !
Can you figure out how to kill all of the stickmen ?
There are several levels to this complex game ; use your intelligence and mouse !

Hubble confirms cosmic acceleration with weak lensing
A new study led by European scientists presents the most comprehensive analysis of data from the most ambitious survey ever undertaken by the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
These researchers have , for the first time ever , used Hubble data to probe the effects of the natural gravitational " weak lenses " in space and characterise the expansion of the Universe .
A group of astronomers [ 1 ] , led by Tim Schrabback of the Leiden Observatory , conducted an intensive study of over 446 000 galaxies within the COSMOS field , the result of the largest survey ever conducted with Hubble .
In making the COSMOS survey , Hubble photographed 575 slightly overlapping views of the same part of the Universe using the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) onboard Hubble .
It took nearly 1000 hours of observations .
In addition to the Hubble data , researchers used redshift [ 2 ] data from ground - based telescopes to assign distances to 194 000 of the galaxies surveyed ( out to a redshift of 5 ) .
" The sheer number of galaxies included in this type of analysis is unprecedented , but more important is the wealth of information we could obtain about the invisible structures in the Universe from this exceptional dataset , " says co-author Patrick Simon from Edinburgh University .
In particular , the astronomers could " weigh " the large - scale matter distribution in space over large distances .
To do this , they made use of the fact that this information is encoded in the distorted shapes of distant galaxies , a phenomenon referred to as weak gravitational lensing [ 3 ] .
Using complex algorithms , the team led by Schrabback has improved the standard method and obtained galaxy shape measurements to an unprecedented precision .
The results of the study will be published in an upcoming issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics .
The meticulousness and scale of this study enables an independent confirmation that the expansion of the Universe is accelerated by an additional , mysterious component named dark energy .
A handful of other such independent confirmations exist .
Scientists need to know how the formation of clumps of matter evolved in the history of the Universe to determine how the gravitational force , which holds matter together , and dark energy , which pulls it apart by accelerating the expansion of the Universe , have affected them .
" Dark energy affects our measurements for two reasons .
First , when it is present , galaxy clusters grow more slowly , and secondly , it changes the way the Universe expands , leading to more distant — and more efficiently lensed — galaxies .
Our analysis is sensitive to both effects , " says co-author Benjamin Joachimi from the University of Bonn .
" Our study also provides an additional confirmation for Einstein 's theory of general relativity , which predicts how the lensing signal depends on redshift , " adds co-investigator Martin Kilbinger from the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris and the Excellence Cluster Universe .
The large number of galaxies included in this study , along with information on their redshifts is leading to a clearer map of how , exactly , part of the Universe is laid out ; it helps us see its galactic inhabitants and how they are distributed .
" With more accurate information about the distances to the galaxies , we can measure the distribution of the matter between them and us more accurately , " notes co-investigator Jan Hartlap from the University of Bonn .
" Before , most of the studies were done in 2D , like taking a chest X -ray .
Our study is more like a 3D reconstruction of the skeleton from a CT scan .
On top of that , we are able to watch the skeleton of dark matter mature from the Universe 's youth to the present , " comments William High from Harvard University , another co-author .
The astronomers specifically chose the COSMOS survey because it is thought to be a representative sample of the Universe .
With thorough studies such as the one led by Schrabback , astronomers will one day be able to apply their technique to wider areas of the sky , forming a clearer picture of what is truly out there .

In astronomy , the redshift denotes the fraction by which the lines in the spectrum of an object are shifted towards longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the Universe .
The observed redshift of a remote galaxy provides an estimate of its distance .
In this study the researchers used redshift information computed by the COSMOS team , who also obtained the HST data ( PI : N. Scoville , http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2007ApJS..172...38S), based on observations from the SUBARU , CFHT , UKIRT , Spitzer , GALEX , NOAO , VLT , and Keck telescopes ( http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2009ApJ...690.1236I).
[ 3] Weak gravitational lensing :
The phenomenon of gravitational lensing is the warping of spacetime by the gravitational field of a concentration of matter , such as a galaxy cluster .
When light rays from distant background galaxies pass this matter concentration , their path is bent and the galaxy images are distorted .
In the case of weak lensing , these distortions are small , and must be measured statistically .
This analysis provides a direct estimate for the strength of the gravitational field , and therefore the mass of the matter concentration .
When determining precise shapes of galaxies , astronomers have to deal with three main factors : the intrinsic shape of the galaxy ( which is unknown ) , the gravitational lensing effect they want to measure , and systematic effects caused by the telescope and camera , as well as the atmosphere , in case of ground - based observations .

" Ahhhhhhhh , weedhopper ! "
" When you can snatch the pebble .... "
Uh , sorry -- had a relapse -- he just died this year , yah know ...
Anyhow ....
Cabbages .
This is only my second season growing cabbages .
There 's a whole saga associated with the one I 'm holding , that outlines how much I did NOT know when I grew them the 1st time .
The cabbage I 'm holding grew for 9 months .
Talk about labor and delivery !
I 've come a looooooooooooong way .
Cabbages LOVE , LOVE , LOVE the cold weather .
They host beach volleyball games when it 's between 45 - 35 degrees out .
This upcoming season I will be starting all my cabbage seedlings from seeds for the 1st time .
Should n't be a problem there , and if I 'm successful , I 'll be shooting for a plantout date of September 1st .
Problem is catching that cold window of opportunity !
If it 's too hot , they 'll just stall out and sulk until the temps get cool enuf .
Then , they 'll charge outta the shoot like Kentucky Derby thoroughbreds !
I 'm trying to time it so they 'll spend MORE time in the cool / cold months to come to full maturity .
As it stands now , I 'm the only one in Houston praying for more cold weather to mature the 7 remaining cabbages , but I do n't hold out much hope .
So , I 'll have the 4 mature cabbages you see , and let the others keep going til I think they 're about to bolt on me .
Make lots of homemade compost .
Cabbages LOVE , LOVE , LOVE organic potting medium !
Get lots of fertilizer .
Cabbages are HUNGRY , HUNGRY , HUNGRY !
They eat a lotta fertilizer !
I used a ring of 13 - 13 - 13 at plantout .
About 2 months in when they started getting bigger , I upped the ante with liquid MG and Epsom salts every 7 days or so .
2 Tbsp MG , 2 Tbsp Epsom Salts per gallon of water , poured through the top .
Can you find a worm hole ?
You do , and I 'll personnally send you $ 1 million -- ' cause there 's not one worm hole in the batch -- well , only a couple on one cabbage .
But that ONE worm has been pushing up daisies for quite awhile now .
However , any day I 'm expecting an explosion outta nowhere , due to the warming temps .
For now , I 'm ahead of that explosion and getting ready to harvest my beauties !
LMK if you need more time in the Cabbage Shaolin Temple , Weedhopper !
Your Neighborhood Cabbage - sahn ,

Fannie
Mae reported its January total serious delinquency rate for single - family houses : the rate hit a new record of 5.54 % , a jump from the December 's 5.38 % , and double the 2.77 % in January 2009 .
All in all a perfect time for the Fed to be moving away from the mortgage market , pardon , to no longer being the mortgage market .
The one saving grace for the Fed , was that new issuance keeps declining : $ 43.9 billion in MBS was issued in February , 7 % less than the $ 47.6 billion in January .
Yet $ 44 billion is not zero , and we anticipate ongoing new issuance which will need to find private buyers now that taxpayers are out of the picture .
And even as Fannie 's total book of business grew at a 1 % annualized pace to $ 3,229,645 MM , the actual guaranteed MBS and mortgage loans declined at 0.9 % to $ 2,882,552 .
Incidentally , it 's worth nothing here that the Chief Fixed Income Strategist of MS Smith Barney Kevin Flanagan told Market News earlier that investors should reduce exposure to MBS , which he said are expensive even without considering that the Fed is no longer buying MBS .
Flanagan said that " for those investors looking to buy agency MBS anyway , they are
better off avoiding the political uncertainty surrounding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by sticking to the front end of the curve -- under the two - year area . "
Well , judging by the weak 4 week and 56 Day CMB auctions , this is certainly not happening at the ultra - short end of the curve .
While Flanagan recommends staying within the 2 - to 5 - year sector for Treasuries and even high yield , not only would he overweight investment grade corporates but he'd also go out the curve .
Not too much , however , as Flanagan says he would not go beyond the 8 - year sector .
Overall , he said , the biggest risk in fixed income markets right now is interest rate risk , closely followed by sovereign risk .
Flanagan noted that " U.S. fundamentals are not too supportive , given the unsustainable fiscal deficits , higher debt burdens , record coupon supply this year and the economic recovery . "
Going back to MBS :
" By any metric that you use when looking at MBS valuation they 're expensive , " Flanagan said .
And that 's also without considering the Federal Reserve no longer buying agency MBS or questions about asset sales down the road .
" When you throw that into the mix , " he said , " you could see how it could be a challenging environment for mortgage - backed over the next couple of quarters . "
Flanagan does not expect the so - called " cliff effect " when the Fed stops buying agency MBS , as some " natural buyers " such as banks might re-emerge .
That said , not only is he concerned about their valuation , but also about the impact of the rising Treasury yields on the MBS market , as he expects the 10 - year Treasury yield to rise to at least 4.50 % this year .
Fannie February Report
It seems like they 're practically every other ad on TV : pharmaceutical advertisements .
Go ask your doctor about Trotasia so you can treat your bad case of immediate postprandial , upper - abdominal distention .
The problem I have with this is this : the only person who can accurate decide what medicine you should take is your doctor .
However , medical advertisements has the effect of , not only spending money that goes straight towards the cost of the drugs your buying , to to encourage people to go to their doctor to demand drugs that they might not even need .
" Wait ! " drug makers will say , " we 're providing an important service by informing people about important medical conditions ! "
That may or may not be true .
But then , if your " goal " is to inform people about medical conditions , why do n't you do just that - inform them about a condition without advertising your product ?
That 's what I propose a new regulation should be :
No company shall be allowed to advertise any pharmaceutical product in any media .
Advertisements that I think should be allowed include :
Advertisements that inform about a specific medical condition , but which both identify whether a pharmaceutical company is funding the ad , but which does n't advertise , recommend , or otherwise identify a specific pharmaceutical treatment .
A person who practices medicine , in an advertisement for their specific service , may advertise the type of treatment they provide , including pharmaceutical products they use .
This way , a doctor can say " I use xxxx ! " but a pharmaceutical company can't just throw a doctor on TV and be like " hey ! we have a doctor saying it ! "
Not only would this shift the decision of what medicine to use back to doctors , but it could potentially cut down on most , if not all , of the billions of dollars spent on advertisements .
Indeed , pharmaceutical companies reportedly spend more on advertising than actual R&D , and then go out and claim that they have to charge so much so they can create new drugs .
I do n't think so .
It was particularly alarming , the district attorney said , that some teachers , administrators and other staff members at the school were aware of the harassment but did not stop it .
“ The actions or inactions of some adults at the school were troublesome , ” Ms. Scheibel said , but did not violate any laws .
Christine Swelko , assistant superintendent for South Hadley Public Schools , said school officials planned to meet with the district attorney this week or next .
“ We will then review this evidence and particularly the new information which the district attorney ’s office has but did not come to light within the investigation conducted by the school , ” Ms. Swelko said in a statement .
Ms. Prince ’s family had recently moved to the United States from a small town in Ireland , and she entered South Hadley last fall .
The taunting started when she had a brief relationship with a popular senior boy ; some students reportedly called her an “ Irish slut , ” knocked books out of her hands and sent her threatening text messages , day after day .
At South Hadley High School , which has about 700 students , most students and teachers refused on Monday to talk about the case .
Students waited for parents in the pouring rain and a sports team ran by , with one student telling reporters , “ Go away . ”
Ashlee Dunn , a 16 - year - old sophomore , said she had not known Ms. Prince personally but had heard stories spread about her in the hallways .
“ She was new and she was from a different country , and she did n’t really know the school very well , ” Ms. Dunn said .
“ I think that ’s probably one reason why they chose Phoebe . ”

On Jan. 14 , the investigation found , students abused her in the school library , the lunchroom and the hallways and threw a canned drink at her as she walked home .
Her sister found her hanging from a stairwell at home , still in her school clothes , at 4:30 p.m .

Well , the tone of some the comments on my last post -- dealing with nuclear development of oil shale , both recently and when I initially posted it on The Oil Drum helps illustrate one of the points that I want to make in this , a continuation in the posts on oil shale .
The tone was quite negative , in general , with a number of folk being disturbed at my even bringing it up .
It points to the fact that , as a political reality ( bearing in mind that I try to stick to technical matters in this series ) the use of nuclear adjustment to the local geology is not likely going to be popular .
As tstreet noted after the original post , there is an article in the Colorado Constitution ( article XXVI ) that he helped put in there .
Section 1 . Nuclear detonations prohibited exceptions .
No nuclear explosive device may be detonated or placed in the ground for the purpose of detonation in this state except in accordance with this article .
( Adopted by the People , November 5 , 1974 .
Effective upon proclamation of the Governor , December 20 , 1974 . )
Section 2 . Election required .
Before the emplacement of any nuclear explosive device in the ground in this state , the detonation of that device shall first have been approved by the voters through enactment of an initiated or referred measure authorizing that detonation , such measure having been ordered , proposed , submitted to the voters , and approved as provided in section 1 of article V of this constitution .
( Adopted by the People , November 5 , 1974 Effective upon proclamation of the Governor , December 20 , 1974 . )
While I did not know about that as I initially planned this series , I had intended just to point out that the unhappiness of just one Senator with a nuclear program ( and I was thinking of Senator Reid and Yucca Mountain ) can delay and ultimately kill its implementation .
In this case it is likely that there would be at least eight senators opposing , and I think the point is made .
However , since I do think it is useful for folk to know these things , I thought I would continue with the rest of the story from a technical point of view .
Particularly since the use of nuclear energy for excavation has recently been revisited by WIRED magazine .
Following the debates about the potential benefits that might occur from the use of nuclear explosives , it was decided to see if it would work in three test detonations , that were given the names Gasbuggy , Rulison and Rio Blanco .
The Gasbuggy shot , in 1967 , used a 29 KT device at a depth of a 4,240 ft deep shaft , and created a cavity that was 80 ft wide and 335 ft tall , when one included the chimney .
It also fractured the light shale around the opening .
Anticipated dimensions were 165 ft with a 350 ft chimney .
The Rulison shot , in 1969 , used a 43 KT device at a depth of 8,426 ft .
It produced a cavity that was 152 ft wide , with a fracture zone that extends some 200 ft into the surrounding sandstone .
( Predicted size was 160 ft with a 300 ft chimney ) .
It is interesting to note that contractors have sought to drill near that shot , in order to extract gas from the shale .
They were initially restricted to drilling no closer than half a mile .
That was back in 2004 , but interest in drilling at the site has continued .
In the latest development , Noble Energy Production is planning on drilling some 78 wells near the site , with DOE apparently having plans to drill closer than the half - mile imposition , though the wells planned in this case are all more than 1.5 miles from the site .
The County Commissioners are not amused .
And , lest there be some concern for gas released at the time , let me quote from the article .
All the gas freed by the nuclear blast was produced and burned off at the surface , Bennetts said .
The radioactivity at the site was n't high to begin with , and since has decreased to below background levels , he said .
The blast formed a sealed cavity underground , according to state and federal authorities .
" Even if you drilled a well into that cavity again , there 's very little radioactivity remaining to be produced , " Bennetts said .
There was some measure of the gas produced
Following the blast , in 1970 and 1971 , the companies burned off , or " flared , " 430 million cubic feet of gas into the open sky .
The commission said that the level of radioactivity in the air surrounding the site did not exceed normal background levels .
Rio Blanco , shot in 1973 , was made up of a series of 3 30 - KT devices stacked up the shaft , at a depth of 7,000 ft , with the devices actually at 5,840 ; 6,230 and 6,670 ft .
Each device created a cavity that was some 120 ft in diameter , and about 250 ft high .
( Against predictions of a 140 ft diameter with a 300 ft chimney . )
Fractures from the explosions extended about 200 ft into the rock around the shaft .
The production of gas from the shots was reported to be less than had been anticipated and the levels of radiation higher , so that while the volume of gas that could have been collected " would have been commercially viable , " that only held true had the gas been uncontaminated .
It was not .
Interestingly there have also been tests of this technology in the Former Soviet Union and when I wrote about gas fires in Turkmenistan there was a comment by Syndroma who posted pictures of devices , which I am reposting here .
Also noting
As to extinguishing of gas fountains : 1 in Turkmenistan , 2 in Uzbekistan , 1 in Ukraine ( objective not achieved ) .
Also in Ukraine , there was 0.3 kt explosion to alter the geology of coal mine , to make it safer for the miners .
Objective achieved .
Later , coal was extracted up to 70 meters from the chamber .
No excess radioactivity detected .
Of ~150 peaceful explosion only 4 turned out " nasty " ( contamination of the surface ) .
Soviet weapons that could be used in gas and oil well stimulation ( from Wonderful Russia via Syndroma )
Syndroma also posted pictures of the result of three shots to generate a trench which I am also moving here .
This was the model of the crater :
And this was the resulting crater that was achieved .
Results of the excavation when 3 nuclear devices were used to excavate a trench in the Soviet Union ( Syndroma ) ( You can see the site on Google Earth at 61 18 16.93 , 56 35 55.77 )
There is more information on the Soviet Program here .
However our purpose is to look at the development of reserves and their contribution to the marketplace within the foreseeable future -- particularly within the next fifteen years , when we can assume that the shortages of supply will become evident , it can , I think , be realistically assumed that there can be no use of nuclear devices to enhance oil shale recovery out West .
At the same time , the toughness of the rock and its strength and behavior under mechanical attack make machine mining of the shale a likely impracticality on a sufficient scale to produce perhaps much more than 100,000 barrels a day within that time frame .
That judgment on my part is based also on the need to regenerate the capital for the program , reconstruct the facilities and get through all the necessary paperwork .
There are alternate methods for mining the material , including those that are used in conventional metal mining of large - scale surface and underground deposits .
However , the mining of something that can generate high levels of potentially explosive gases , if very large scale fracturing and blasting is undertaken , creates levels of risk that will make development of such plans a lengthy process if carried out underground .
The mining of Gilsonite for example , was only realistically achieved when the hydrocarbon was mined using high pressure waterjets .
But the strength of the oil shale makes the conventional use of that technique impractical - even if it were allowable , which is conjectural .
With these prospects being diminished , the only likely potential for oil shale to have a significant impact in the next fifteen years is likely to be either through some smaller scale in - situ retorting or possibly through a surface mining approach .
I will discuss these in the next two posts on the subject .
" The results are actually quite impressive .
Having a higher proportion of protected areas is good for marine life , it 's good for fish and it's good for people who rely on the reef for a living , " said Laurence McCook , the lead author of the report by the Australian Research Centre 's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority .
Healthcare reform has passed .
It 's not perfect , but it 's better than nothing and almost universally a good thing .
Unless you 're Fox News or Sarah Palin , in which case it 's the end of the world .
We watched today 's apocalyptic coverage , mystified .
Fox Newshas been peddling false information and bad journalism throughout the debate .
They 've been deliberately misinforming their viewers by featuring , and skewing towards , poorly - researched and ideologically motivated Republican talking points .
Today 's coverage hit all the buttons — the emphasizing of protests , sad , resigned GOP - ers talking about rationed healthcare , the use of quotation marks in captions ( it 's a healthcare " fix " according to Fox News ) , and the posing of ridiculously provocative questions " what is the TRUE cost of this bill — we report , you decide . "
Even the New York Post — owned , like Fox , by Rupert Murdoch — is condemning them .
Which is maybe the lowest moral high ground to be looked down at from .
Here 's the crazy through the day , until the bill passed .
Here 's a lady comparing the Congressional Budget Office report on how much the bill will cost to ... Enron and Madoff .

And here 's a typical airing of some unquestioned scaremongering from a Republican on abortion — the talking point being that Obama 's executive order to prevent federal money being spent on abortions is flimsy and will mean that there will be Federal abortion parties in every town across the nation .

LONDON ( AFP ) – Scouting founder Lord Robert Baden - Powell was invited to meet Adolf Hitler after friendly talks with the Hitler Youth about forming closer ties , secret British files released Monday showed .
Britain ’s Baden - Powell , who started the Scouts in 1907 , held talks with German ambassador Joachim von Ribbentrop and Hitler Youth chief of staff Hartmann Lauterbacher on November 19 , 1937 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lauterbacher , then 28 , was in Britain to foster closer relations with the Boy Scout movement and Ribbentrop invited Baden - Powell to tea with the Hitler Youth leader , newly declassified MI5 Security Service files revealed .
A letter from Baden - Powell to Ribbentrop the day after the meeting showed how he felt about the talks .
“ I am grateful for the kind conversation you accorded me which opened my eyes to the feeling of your country towards Britain , which I may say reciprocates exactly the feeling which I have for Germany , ” Baden - Powell wrote .
“ I sincerely hope that we shall be able , in the near future , to give expression to it through the youth on both sides , and I will at once consult my headquarters officers and see what suggestions they can put forward . ”
In a report on the meeting , Baden - Powell described Ribbentrop as “ earnest ” and “ charming ” .
ADVERTISEMENT
He wrote : “ I had a long talk with the ambassador , who was very insistent that the true peace between the two nations will depend on the youth being brought up on friendly terms together in forgetfulness of past differences .
“ He sees in the Scout movement a very powerful agency for helping to bring this about if we can get into closer touch with the Jugend ( Youth ) movement in Germany .
“ To help this he suggested that if possible we should send one or two men to meet their leaders in Germany and talk matters over and , especially , he would like me to go and see Hitler after I am back from Africa . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
He went on : “ I told him that I was fully in favour of anything that would bring about a better understanding between our nations , and hoped to have further talks with him when I return from Africa . ”
There is no evidence that Baden - Powell ever met Hitler .

Once the war had been under way for several years , the security services had no doubt about the nature of the Nazi youth wing .
An October 1944 intelligence assessment warned that the organisation should not be taken lightly and could not be compared to the Scouts .
It said : “ It is a compulsory Nazi formation , which has consciously sought to breed hate , treachery and cruelty into the mind and soul of every German child .

“ It is , in the true sense of the word , ‘ education for death ’ . ”
Your book was about abandoned substations in New York City .
What attracts you to crumbling buildings ?
At first , there 's a certain Indiana Jones aspect to the discovery .
But after that initial awe wears off , what fascinates me most is that we as a society do not create buildings like this anymore , grand structures that are meant to last much longer than the architects .
The hospitals in this book were created at a time when it was thought that architecture would help in the treatment of the mentally ill .
The architects envisioned them as places of healing .
It 's kind of a romantic notion , but as an architect you want to think what you 're creating is going to last forever and have a profound impact not only on the occupants but society as a whole .
In Oliver Sacks 's introduction to your book , he points out that these facilities were called " asylums " because they were meant to be places of peace and refuge .
Can you say more about how these buildings helped achieve that goal ?
These places were created with noble intentions , and the architecture was certainly supposed to uplift people .
The buildings were also sited in rural areas , which were supposed to encourage a healthier living style .
But you can also look at the way the buildings were designed — they have these huge hallways where the patients were supposed to be social and hang out .
It 's also interesting to look at the arrangement of the buildings , the spaces in between them , because the idea was that the asylum was a whole community .
The occupants would be on the grounds or on the farms keeping active .
When you 're strolling around the grounds , you can imagine what life was really like with thousands of people living and working there .
In the 1970s , there was a series of court cases that outlawed patient labor .
How did those rulings affect the communal atmosphere you 're describing ?
The federal laws were passed for good reasons , but they also sucked a lot of the life out of these places .
Obviously , the idea of work therapy borders on forced labor .
But from what I learned , farming and building things did give the patients something to do in the absence of modern medical treatment .
It took their minds off their troubles , and many of these people did get better .
Part of it , too , was this notion of self - sufficiency .
Since the hospitals were located in remote areas , the people needed to have farms and dairies where they could produce their own food , workshops where they could make everything onsite .
There was a sort of utopian ideal behind these places , even if they later became something very different .
Some of your most striking photos show jumbled collections of toothbrushes and bowling shoes — everyday objects that were left behind .
How did you happen to stumble upon these things ?
I had to dig pretty deep to find some of those shots .
In some cases , one of the workers would be showing me around and get a sense of what I wanted and lead me to rooms that still had artifacts of everyday life in them .
By the time I got to most of the buildings , the rooms were empty or trashed or in such bad condition that they did n't yield a time - capsule - like photograph .
So when I did find something like that , it was a goldmine .
These things trigger emotions — they begin to describe not only a way of life in one of these institutions but the fact that there were thousands of people living there .
The Christian faith holds several acts of “ super - sizing ” to be miracles accomplished by Jesus Christ -- a handful of fish and loaves of bread expanded to feed thousands ; a wedding feast running low on wine suddenly awash in the stuff .
Now a new study of portion expansion puts Jesus once more at the center .
In a bid to uncover the roots of super - sized American fare , a pair of sibling scholars has turned to an unusual source : 52 artists ’ renderings of the New Testament ’s Last Supper .
Their findings , published online Tuesday in the International Journal of Obesity , indicate that serving sizes have been marching heavenward for 1,000 years .
“ I think people assume that increased serving sizes , or ‘ portion distortion , ’ is a recent phenomenon , ” said Brian Wansink , director of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab and author of “ Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think . ”
“ But this research indicates that it ’s a general trend for at least the last millennium . ”
To reach their conclusion , Wansink and his brother Craig , a biblical scholar at Virginia Wesleyan College , analyzed 52 depictions of the meal the Wansinks call “ history ’s most famous dinner party ” painted between the year 1000 and the year 2000 .
Using the size of the diners ’ heads as a basis for comparison , the Wansinks used computers to compare the sizes of the plates in front of the apostles , the food servings on those plates and the bread on the table .
Assuming that heads did not increase in size during the second millennium after the birth of Christ , the researchers used this method to gauge how much serving sizes increased .
And increase they did .
Over the course of the millennium , the Wansinks found that the entrees depicted on the plates laid before Jesus ’ followers grew by about 70 % , and the bread by 23 % .
As entree portions rose , so too did the size of the plates -- by 65.6 % .
The apostles depicted during the Middle Ages appear to be the ascetics they are said to have been .
But by 1498 , when Leonardo da Vinci completed his masterpiece , the party was more lavishly fed .
Almost a century later , the Mannerist painter Jacobo Tintoretto piled the food on the apostles ’ plates still higher .
New York University nutrition researcher Lisa R. Young called the Wansink study fun .
But as the author of “ The Portion Teller , ” a history of portion size through the 20th century , she also pointed to the three decades that ended the millennium as a “ tipping point ” for humankind .
There is scant evidence that the body mass index of people in developed societies soared into unhealthy ranges for most of the 1,000 years studied , Young said .
But there is little doubt , she added , that that changed in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s -- coincidentally , when portion sizes began a dramatic run-up .
The Wansinks , however , suggest that portion growth may have a provenance far older than industrial farming and the economics of takeout food .
Instead , they suggest , it ’s a natural consequence of “ dramatic socio- historic increases in the production , availability , safety , abundance and affordability of food ” over the millennium that started in the year 1000 A.D .
“ The contemporary discovery of increasing food portions and availability may be little more than 1,000 - year - old wine in a new bottle , ” the Wansinks wrote .

Rachel Maddow whacks the Republicans and the good folks over at ClusterFox who are aiding and abetting them for trying to conflate reconciliation with the nuclear option .
After playing a clip of Lamar Alexander saying that using reconciliation would be a “ political Kamikaze mission ” and “ the end of the United States Senate ” if the Democrats used it to pass the health care bill , Rachel notes Alexander ’s hypocrisy on the subject .
He was more than happy to use it for the Jobs & Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 , the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 , the Tax Increase Prevention & Reconciliation Act of 2005 and the College Cost Reduction & Access Act of 2007 .
Rachel then calls out all too often guest on the Sunday shows Grandpa McCain for his hypocrisy as well .
As Rachel notes , McCain wants to change the Senate rules so reconciliation ca n’t be used for anything involving entitlements and the John McCain of the past felt a bit differently .
McCain voted for the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 with Dick Cheney as the tie breaking vote which slashed Medicaid .
McCain voted for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1989 which overhauled the doctor payment system for Medicare .
She goes on to explain that the Republicans are now so desperate to win the debate on health care reform since they have already lost the votes in both houses of the Congress that their last resort is to try to conflate reconciling the two bills with the nuclear option , which would have eliminated the filibuster all together .
It ’s good to see Rachel calling these guys out for their lies , but sadly too much of the public does not watch her show and is being propagandized by the likes of ClusterFox .
A few weeks ago Todd Hoff over on the High Scalability blog penned a blog post titled MySQL and Memcached : End of an Era ?
where he wrote
If you look at the early days of this blog , when web scalability was still in its heady bloom of youth , many of the articles had to do with leveraging MySQL and memcached .
Exciting times .
Shard MySQL to handle high write loads , cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads , and then write a lot of glue code to make it all work together .
That was state of the art , that was how it was done .
The architecture of many major sites still follow this pattern today , largely because with enough elbow grease , it works .
…
With a little perspective , it 's clear the MySQL + memcached era is passing .
…
LinkedIn has moved on with their Project Voldemort .
Amazon went there a while ago .
Digg declared their entrance into a new era in a post on their blog titled Looking to the future with Cassandra ,
…
Twitter has also declared their move in the article Cassandra @ Twitter : An Interview with Ryan King .
Todd ’s blog has been a useful source of information on the topic of scaling large scale websites since he catalogues as many presentations as he can find from industry leaders on how they ’ve designed their systems to deal with millions to hundreds of millions of users pounding their services a day .
What he ’s written above is really an observation about industry trends and is n’t really meant to attack any technology .
I did find it interesting that many took it as an attack on memcached and / or relational databases and came out swinging .
One post which I thought tried to take a balanced approach to rebuttal was Dennis Forbes ’ Getting Real about NoSQL and the SQL - Isn't - Scalable Lie where he writes
I work in the financial industry .
RDBMS ’ and the Structured Query Language ( SQL ) can be found at the nucleus of most of our solutions .
The same was true when I worked in the insurance , telecommunication , and power generation industries .
So it piqued my interest when a peer recently forwarded an article titled “ The end of SQL and relational databases ” , adding the subject line “ We ’re living in the past ” .
[ Though as Michael Stonebraker points out , SQL the query language actually has remarkably little to actually to do with the debate .
It would be more clearly called NoACID ]
…
From a vertical scaling perspective — it ’s the easiest and often the most computationally effective way to scale ( albeit being very inefficient from a cost perspective ) — you have the capacity to deploy your solution on powerful systems with armies of powerful cores , hundreds of GBs of memory , operating against SAN arrays with ranks and ranks of SSDs .
The computational and I/O capacity possible on a single “ machine ” are positively enormous .
The storage system , which is the biggest limiting factor on most database platforms , is ridiculously scalable , especially in the bold new world of SSDs ( or flash cards like the FusionIO ) .
…
From a horizontal scaling perspective you can partition the data across many machines , ideally configuring each machine in a failover cluster so you have complete redundancy and availability .
With Oracle RAC and Sybase ASE you can even add the classic clustering approach .
Such a solution — even on a stodgy old RDBMS — is scalable far beyond any real world need because you ’ve built a system for a large corporation , deployed in your own datacenter , with few constraints beyond the limits of technology and the platform .
Your solution will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars ( if not millions ) to deploy , but that is n’t a critical blocking point for most enterprises .
This sort of scaling that is at the heart of virtually every bank , trading system , energy platform , retailing system , and so on .
To claim that SQL systems do n’t scale , in defiance of such obvious and overwhelming evidence , defies all reason .
There ’s lots of good for food for thought in both blog posts .
Todd is right that a few large scale websites are moving beyond the horizontal scaling approach that Dennis brought up in his rebuttal based on their experiences .
What tends to happen once you ’ve built a partitioned / sharded SQL database architecture is that you tend to notice that you ’ve given up most of the features of an ACID relational database .
You give up the advantages of the relationships by eschewing foreign keys , triggers and joins since these are prohibitively expensive to run across multiple databases .
Denormalizing the data means that you give up on Atomicity , Consistency and Isolation when updating or retrieving results .
And the end all you have left is that your data is Durable ( i.e. it is persistently stored ) which is n’t much better than you get from a dumb file system .
Well , actually you also get to use SQL as your programming model which is nicer than performing direct file I /O operations .
It is unsurprising that after being at this point for years , some people in our industry have wondered whether it does n’t make more sense to use data stores that are optimized for the usage patterns of large scale websites instead of gloriously misusing relational databases .
A good example of the tradeoffs is the blog post from the Digg team on why they switched to Cassandra .
The database was already sharded which made performing joins to calculate results of queries such as “ which of my friends Dugg this item ? ” to be infeasible .
So instead they had to perform two reads from SQL ( all Diggs on an item and all of the user ’s friends ) then perform the intersection operation on the PHP front end code .
If the item was not already cached , this leads to disk I/O which could take seconds .
To make the situation worse , you actually want to perform this operation multiple times on a single page view since it is reasonable to expect multiple Digg buttons on a page if it has multiple stories on it .
An alternate approach is to denormalize the data and for each user store a list of stories that have been Dugg by at least one of their friends .
So whenever I Digg an item , an entry is placed in each of my friends ’ lists to indicate that story is now one that has been Dugg by a friend .
That way when the a friend of mine shows up , it is a simple lookup to say “ is this story ID on the list of stories Dugg by one of their friends ? ”
The challenge here is that it means Digging an item can result in literally thousands of logical write operations .
It has been traditionally prohibitively expensive to incur such massive amounts of write I/O in relational databases with all of their transactionality and enforcing of ACID constraints .
NoSQL databases like Cassandra which assume your data is denormalized are actually optimized for write I/O heavy operations given the necessity of having to perform enormous amounts of writes to keep data consistent .
Digg ’s usage of Cassandra actually serves as a rebuttal to Dennis Forbes ’ article since they could n’t feasibly get what they want with either horizontal or vertical scaling of their relational database - based solution .
I would argue that introducing memcached into the mix would have addressed disk I/ O concerns because all records of who has Dugg an item could be stored in - memory so comparisons of which of my friends have Dugg an item never have to go to disk to answer any parts of the query .
The only caveat with that approach is that RAM is more expensive than disk so you ’ll need a lot more servers to store 3 terabytes of data in memory than you would on disk .
However , the programming model is not the only factor one most consider when deciding whether to stay with a sharded / partitioned relational database versus going with a NoSQL solution .
The other factor to consider is the actual management of the database servers .
The sorts of questions one has to ask when choosing a database solution are listed in the interview with Ryan King of Twitter where he lists the following checklist that they evaluated before deciding to go with Cassandra over MySQL
We first evaluated them on their architectures by asking many questions along the lines of :
How will we add new machines ?
Are their any single points of failure ?
Do the writes scale as well ?
How much administration will the system require ?
If its open source , is there a healthy community ?
How much time and effort would we have to expend to deploy and integrate it ?
Does it use technology which we know we can work with ?
The problem with database sharding is that it is n’t really a supported out of the box configuration for your traditional relational database product especially the open source ones .
How your system deals with new machines being added to the cluster or handles machine failure often requires special case code being written by application developers along with special hand holding by operations teams .
Dealing with issues related to database replication ( whether it is multi- master or single master ) also often takes up unexpected amounts of manpower once sharding is involved .
For these reasons I expect we ’ll see more large scale websites decide that instead of treating a SQL database as a denormalized key - value pair store that they would rather use a NoSQL database .
However I also suspect that a lot of services who already have a sharded relational database + in - memory cache solution can get a lot of mileage from more judicious usage of in - memory caches before switching .
This is especially true given that you still caches in front of your NoSQL databases anyway .
There ’s also the question of whether traditional relational database vendors will add features to address the shortcomings highlighted by the NoSQL movement ?
Given that the sort of companies adopting NoSQL are doing so because they want to save costs on software , hardware and operations I somehow doubt that there is a lucrative market here for database vendors versus adding more features that the banks , insurance companies and telcos of the world find interesting .

Toyota has an entire brand new range called Prius which offers amazing kinds of wheels and tyres .
This is absolutely brand new and has the seventeen inches wheel which gives it an extremely sporty look .
This car is being led by the amazing and brand new technology called Hybrid Synergy Drive which makes the machine amazingly fast .
Also if you are particularly concerned about fuel economy then the good news is that the car comes with resistance tyres which ensure that not too much money needs to be spent on the fuel .
The best part is that the Prius comes with brand new types of technology which also includes satellite navigation options .
Intelligent park assistant , IPA , is also available so that you find it extremely easy and convenient to park your car anytime and anywhere you want .
There is also another new version of the model called Prius i=Tech which is also extremely fuel efficient because of the seventeen inch will make .
This is quite an unique selling point of the vehicle that also makes it quite popular and much in demand .
There is also a spare attached to the car models that have the seventeen inch tyre .
Prius was launched last year in Australia and became quite popular .
It is definitely one of the cars of the hybrid vehicle variety that also sells really well .
In fact sales of the Prius have reached almost 1.6 millions .
The cars are priced accordingly :
Prius ( 15 - inch alloys with wheel cover ) : $ 39,900

Update : Merton is back — be sure to check out our exclusive interview with him .
Merton , a.k.a. the Chatroulette Improv Piano Player , has had his viral video yanked off of YouTube " due to terms of use violation . "
Merton became the big Internet sensation when he logged onto Chatroulette with his glasses , hooded sweater , and trusty keyboard and created songs for random strangers on - the - fly .
The result was millions of views , tons of Merton love , and even an " Ode to Merton " performed live by Ben Folds , which has also gone viral .
By their very nature , Merton 's songs were very unlikely to have violated copyrights from the big music agencies ; his songs were created as soon as the next Chatrouletter appeared .
Our understanding is that the video did n't violate any copyrights ; instead , there were likely privacy issued involved , as most of the people in the video did n't know that they were becoming part of a viral video .
I could n't get PulseAudio to work on one of my computers no matter what I do .
But removing PulseAudio can be tricky and besides , there is a very easy way to " fix " it ( if you 're using GStreamer as a backend for music and videos ) .
This is very useful for applications which use GStreamer but do not let you select the sound output module like : Rhythmbox , Totem and so on .
To use ALSA or OSS instead of PulseAudio for Gstreamer based apps , all you have to do is press ALT + F2 and enter :
gconf-editor
/system/gstreamer/0.10/default and change the " audiosink " and " musicaudiosink " to " alsasink " or " osssink " , depending on what you want to use .
I for one used OSS ( " osssink " - notice there are 3 s ) because it simply works , even though it 's deprecated .
If you want to do this via command line , all you have to do is paste this in a terminal :
gconftool - 2 -- type string -- set /system / gstreamer /0.10 / default /audiosink " osssink "
gconftool - 2 -- type string -- set /system/gstreamer/0.10 / default/musicaudiosink " osssink "
The above 2 commands set GStreamer to use OSS for audio and video players .
To use ALSA instead of OSS , simply replace " osssink " with " alsasink " in both commands above .
If you want to use ALSA or OSS for Audio / Video Conferencing too , also run the following command ( remember , the app must be using GStreamer ) :
gconftool - 2 -- type string -- set /system/gstreamer/0.10 /default/chataudiosink " osssink "
To use ALSA , simply replace " osssink " with " alsasink " in the command above .
Then restart your music player or video player ( Rhythmbox , Totem , etc. ) .
Then navigate toand change the " audiosink " and " musicaudiosink " to " alsasink " or " osssink " , depending on what you want to use .

Five years ago , we ran an editorial that said Pluto 's demotion was a good thing .
With Pluto back in the news , all the old arguments are new again , so we 're running the editorial again .
You can judge for yourself whether anything has changed .
I come to both bury Pluto , and to praise it — it being the decision to demote Pluto from the pantheon of planets .
In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union was faced with a growing collection of small , icy bodies similar in size to Pluto orbiting at the fringes of the Solar System .
It settled on a new way of defining what constitutes a planet , one that left Pluto and its peers demoted to dwarf status .
The decision triggered outrage that continues unabated , and some have argued that the demotion given science a black eye from the public 's perspective .
I 'm going to argue that Pluto 's demotion has actually created a fantastic opportunity to help the public understand the very nature of science itself , and connect it with a new era of discovery for the planetary sciences .
But it 's only an opportunity ; unless the scientific community takes advantage of the chance to communicate , then we risk letting the event be portrayed as the arbitrary killing of a childhood friend .
Discovery is a good thing
The astronomy community felt compelled to come to terms with Pluto 's status as a direct result of its own successes .
Driven by digital imaging , automated survey telescopes , and space - based observatories , we have become much more aware of the full diversity of objects orbiting the Sun .
Ceres , once dismissed as an asteroid , turns out to have been sufficiently massive for its own gravity to reshape it into a sphere .
Eris , the most distant dwarf planet yet found , appears to be both larger and heavier than Pluto .
Estimates are that there are dozens to hundreds of additional bodies of this class that we 've yet to discover .
And those are just the oddballs of our own Solar System .
Planet - hunting probes have spotted gas giants heated up to extremely low densities and rocky bodies that are pelted with vanadium oxide rains .
As instruments continue to improve and more results roll in , who knows what we might end up finding ?
We 've also gotten a better look at some of the Solar System 's large moons , many of which are significantly larger and more complex than any of the dwarf planets , with atmospheres , lakes , volcanism , and , quite possibly , liquid oceans hidden underneath their frozen crusts .
All of these discoveries have radically changed our perspective on the bodies that inhabit this Solar System and the apparent multitude of systems beyond it .
And that 's a great thing — it 's the sign of exciting times and a field that 's progressing rapidly , which means that definitions that date from 50 years ago have simply become obsolete .
But instead of focusing on the excitement , many who covered the decision and aftermath presented these discoveries as a problem for Pluto , rather than a benefit for the field .
Science is rarely a question of right or wrong
The fact that our understanding of what constitutes a planet needs revision is no surprise , really .
Science , by its very nature , is tentative , and our understanding gets updated as new information comes in .
That 's not to say our old definition was wrong , per se , simply that it did n't account for everything that we now know about the bodies in our Solar System .
This pattern , where a scientific understanding is n't wrong , but is found to be limited , is central to what we hope is the progress of science .
Scientific ideas rarely are completely wrong , but they are often more or less accurate .
This is a facet of science that the public does n't understand well .
A new finding that completely overturns our present understanding makes for a nice narrative in the popular press , but it's one that rarely reflects the evolutionary process of science .
Old ideas are rarely out - and - out wrong , just not as accurate as newer ones ; the newer ones are ( hopefully ) a bit more accurate , but they will eventually need revision as well .
But the public gets fed a steady diet of science stories that distill down to " everything we knew was wrong — meet the new right answer . "
It 's no surprise that many in the public now cynically expect every new right answer will be wrong five to ten years down the line .
That expectation creates problems .
Even if its conclusions are uncertain and tentative , science can produce reasonably accurate answers to important questions .
These answers may be limited at the time , and revised in the future , but that does n't make them " wrong , " nor does it mean that science is a poor basis for decision making .
Nature abhors a binary
If the public is confused about the fact that science does n't rely on binary , " right or wrong " distinctions , it 's equally confused by the fact that nature does n't rely on these either .
In the end , the Solar System is comprised of whatever bodies happened to form due to its starting conditions and physics .
We can try to define planets and dwarf planets as distinct categories within those bodies , but there 's no reason for physics to necessarily obey our definitions .
There 's still a chance that we 'll find something at the fringes or our Solar System that awkwardly straddles the divisions we 're trying to impose on the natural world , and an excellent chance we 'll find an exoplanet that makes a mockery of them .
And this is true in all areas of science .
Pick anything we'd like to place in a neat category — a gene , a species , a galaxy — and the Universe will almost always throw us a curve ball , something that 's neither here nor there , or a little bit of both .
It may be convenient to try to constrain the natural world with definitions , but the world has a nice way of blurring sharp boundaries and making a mockery of our attempts to pin it down .
In the end , another lesson from Pluto is that we can't get too hung up on definitions .
They 're convenient and useful , but they 're only a mental construct that we 're attempting to impose on a Universe that is n't necessarily interested in what we find useful and convenient .
Recognizing the difference between human terminology and the underlying reality can be essential .
The death of ideas we cherish
The debate about Pluto brought up all kinds of arguments in favor of retaining its planetary status .
It 's in the textbooks , in mnemonics , people had an emotional attachment to it , its demotion would ( and has ) unleash a popular outcry , we 've been talking about nine planets for years ...
In short , there 's an intuitive , emotional pull towards maintaining the status quo .
When it comes to science , none of that should matter .
Scientists get emotionally attached to their pet ideas all the time , and have trouble letting them go .
But , ultimately , the most beautiful theories can be slain by simple , ugly facts , and scientists have little choice but to let them die , or slide off the end of the crackpot scale — and a crackpot is , in effect , someone who has given up on science as a process in order to keep a cherished idea alive .
The fact that many scientists defended Pluto 's status was a great opportunity to show what a passionate , thoroughly human activity science is .
The fact that they lost shows us something even more important : no matter how much you care , you have to let the natural world have the final say .
Pluto is qualitatively different from the remaining eight planets , which left it on the wrong side of the planetary divide .
In the end , the story of Pluto 's demotion has everything : exciting discoveries , emotional appeal , and important lessons about the very nature of a process , science , that 's essential for understanding the modern world .
It may not have been an especially popular decision , but it can play an important role in helping the public understand the scientific process .
In that sense , it 's an incredibly valuable opportunity .
But it 's an opportunity that will be wasted if the scientific community and press simply present it as a controversial and arbitrary decision , instead of bringing the bigger picture into focus .
Guangzhou , China ( CNN ) --
Dogs bark and whine behind high chain - link fences , some of them gnawing the wire so hard they bleed at the mouths while cats packed into crowded cages cower in fear if anyone approaches .
This is n't a pet store -- it 's a meat market in Guangzhou , a city in southern China where eating cats and dogs is common practice .
At the Han River Dog Meat Restaurant in central Guangzhou , diners can choose from a long list of menu items , including dog soup , dog steak , dog with tofu and more .
In the kitchen , the chef chops up meat for dog hot pot , one of the more popular dishes .
Most customers like it spicy .
" Dog meat is good for your health and metabolism , " explains Li , the hostess who declined to give her first name .
" In the summer it helps you sweat . "
Should cat and dog meat be banned ?
But these local restaurants may have to find a new specialty .
The Chinese government is considering legislation that would make eating cats and dogs illegal .
Professor Chang Jiwen of the Chinese Academy of the Social Sciences is one of the law 's top campaigners .
" Cats and dogs are loyal friends to humans , " he said .
" A ban on eating them would show China has reached a new level of civilization . "
Eating dog meat is a long - standing culinary tradition not just in China , but also Korea .
Cat meat can be found on the menu in China , Vietnam and even parts of South America .
The Chinese government has signaled a willingness to take the meat off the market .
To avoid upsetting international visitors during the Beijing Olympics , officials ordered dog meat off the menus at local markets .
Officials in Guangzhou have warned vendors to stop selling it ahead of the Asian Games which will be held there later this year .
The ban on eating dog and cat meat is part of a larger proposal to toughen laws on animal welfare .
Individual violators could face up to 15 days in prison and a small fine .
Businesses found guilty of selling the meat risk fines up to 500,000 yuan ( $ 73,500 . )
The legislation is gaining support from China 's growing number of pet owners .
With living standards rising and disposable income growing , more Guangzhou residents are investing in house pets .
" I would never eat dog meat , " said Louisa Yong , as she clutches her pet cocker spaniel .
" It 's so cruel ! "
Meat vendors have a different view .
" The dogs you raise at home , you should n't eat , " said Pan , a butcher who also declined to give his first name .
" The kind raised for eating , we can eat those . "
Many of the dogs and cats sold for meat are specially raised on farms .
But Chang said there is always a chance they 're someone 's lost or stolen pet .
In anticipation of the new ban , dog and cat meat has become more difficult to find , though some vendors say they will keep selling it as long as they can .
" The legislation will definitely affect our restaurant , " said Li . " We 'll just wait to see the result . "
And it seems restaurants do n't necessarily need to change their menus anytime soon .
According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , the law prohibiting cat and dog meat could take as long as a decade to pass .
Until then it's a la carte , from the cage into the kitchen .
( Newser ) – From the fact - checking department :
When publishing an image of Olympic mascots , check to make sure there 's not a cartoon bear with ties to pedophilia mixed in .
A Polish paper made just such a mistake , accidentally lifting the meme known as " Pedobear " — widely used to mock pedophiles — from Google Images and popping him into a collage of the other mascots of the Vancouver Games .
The cartoon bear was originally devised by a Canadian graphic designer , apparently to protest the cost of the Games .
Members of an anarchic message board then adopted it .

Recently by Gary North : Ferris Geithner ’s Day Off
To understand what is going to happen to America ’s health care delivery system , we must first understand what has happened to Detroit .
Detroit is dying .
Yes , I know that there are lots of books on “ The Death of . . . . ”
That word sells books .
But Detroit really is dying .
It is the first metropolis in the United States to be facing extinction .
We have never seen anything like this in American history .
It is happening under our noses , but the media refuse to discuss it .
To do so would be politically incorrect .
Two factors tell us that Detroit is dying .
The first is the departure of 900,000 people — over half the city ’s population — since 1950 .
It peaked at 1.8 million in 1950 .
It is down to about 900,000 today .
In 1994 , the median sales price of a house in Detroit was about $ 41,000 .
The housing bubble pushed it up to about $ 98,000 in 2003 .
In March 2009 , the price was $ 13,600 .
Today , the price is $ 7,000 .
Check the price chart .
There has never been a collapse of residential real estate values of this magnitude in peacetime history , anywhere .
Detroit is dying .
We are unfamiliar with anything like this .
The media are silent .
The Powers That Be are not interested in reporting on this , because readers might ask the obvious question : “ How did this happen ? ” Obvious questions tend to lead to obvious answers .
Detroit has been killed by flight out of the city .
The 2008 Clint Eastwood movie , Gran Torino dealt with this problem .
Eastwood plays an 80 - something Korean War veteran who will not leave the neighborhood .
His children keep bugging him to sell and move into a retirement home .
He will not hear of it .
He is alienated from them and from his immigrant neighbors : Hmong refugees from South Vietnam .
The Hmong have trouble with the Blacks .
Every group is essentially trapped in a neighborhood , with the gangs running the show .
There is no surge of buyers to take advantage of fabulously low prices in Detroit .
Can you imagine buying a home for cash for $ 13,600 in 2009 — a house that had sold for $ 98,000 six years earlier — and losing half your money ?
It ’s incredible .
The Wall Street Journal recently ran one of the most creative stories I have seen in years .
The journalist told the story of the history of a 5 - bedroom home in Detroit , from the land purchase to its recent sale .
It was built by one of the most influential man you have never heard of , Clarence Avery .
Avery was on the Ford Motor Company team that conceived of implementing an assembly line for Ford ’s factory .
He copied the idea from a hog - slaughtering operation .
His home was a very nice home for the time .
The journalist located his daughter , now age 91 .
She said that she always thought the home was the best home she ever lived in .
As recently as 2005 , the home sold for $ 250,000 .
It was purchased by a woman who was lent $ 200,000 to buy it .
It was financed by a subprime loan .
The asking price was $ 189,000 .
Where the other $ 61,000 went , the woman has no idea .
She defaulted .
The deteriorating house was bought by a Christian organization that is renovating it .
The house sold for $ 10,000 .
This is simply inconceivable to anyone who is unfamiliar with Detroit since 2005 .
Nothing like this has ever happened .
How can we conceive of a lender lending $ 200,000 to a woman to buy a $ 250,000 home offered at $ 189,000 ?
How can we conceive of a fall in price from $ 250,000 to $ 10,000 ?
This is the sign of a dying city .
This does not happen in a normal environment .
Even with the mania created by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , in conjunction with Alan Greenspan ’s Federal Reserve , nothing like this has happened anywhere else .
If you had predicted anything like this in 2005 , you would have been dismissed as a crackpot on crack .
You would not have been taken seriously by anyone .
Yet it has happened .
The city planners , the Federal government ’s subsidy defenders , and the welfare state aficionados are all discreetly silent about Detroit .
The city funds its schools with property taxes .
Property taxes have collapsed as sources of revenue .
An honest property tax system will generate less than ten cents on the 2003 dollar .
Last week , the school board announced the closing of one - quarter of Detroit ’s schools .
The city is out of money .
The central agency of propaganda by the government is in the process of closing up shop .
This is not “ anti- business as usual . ”
This is collapse .
The American public does not perceive what is happening in Detroit .
When a city simply shuts down from the effects of government mismanagement , the media say nothing .
Detroit has become the poster child of government regulation , welfare systems , and a population that has given up hope .
The media say nothing because they are caught in a dilemma .
If they say that the local government ’s welfare programs are not really to blame , what does that leave ?
The unmentionable issue : 82 % of the city is Black .
So , that means blaming white employers , who discriminate , despite 40 years of Federal anti-discrimination laws .
But the main non-employers today are the region ’s auto companies , and two of the three are partially owned by the U.S. government .
One — GM — is mainly owned by the retirement fund of the United Auto Workers .
So , the media are not about to blame the auto companies — not now .
That leaves that other politically incorrect issue : the rate of illegitimacy , which is in the 80 % range .
That social phenomenon represents a moral collapse , but the participants were all educated by the tax - funded schools .
Who ya gonna blame ?
The media pundits cannot decide , so they simply ignore the collapse .
“ Detroit ?
Never heard of it . ”
The lesson of Detroit is this : the experts do not see a collapse coming .
They assume that next year will be like today , give or take 3 % .
They do not believe that anything as complex as a city can collapse .
So , they believe that things will continue , as they always have .
Taxes need not be cut .
Spending need not be cut .
Schools should be allowed to educate .
Tax - funded welfare programs should be increased .
When it comes to tax revenues , “ there ’s always more where that came from . ”
And then , overnight , the system collapses .
The assumptions were wrong .
Real estate prices collapse , indicating an irreversible flight of capital from the city .
The ability of the government to collect taxes collapses .
OBAMACARE
This brings me to the other subject : the health care law .
It is not law yet , but it soon will be .
I know what is going to happen .
1. Cost overruns2 . Fraud3 .
Additional coverage extended to groups4 .
Rising deficits in the program5 .
Lower payments to physicians 6 . Lower payments to hospitals7 .
Delays in payments8 .
Rising taxes on the rich9 .
Rationing by doctors , hospitals , government10 .
Delays in treatment11 .
More HMO care : assembly line medicine12 .
A search for scapegoats
In 1977 , I was involved in an early warning operation .
Three teams of physicians and economists toured the country .
We hit 30 cities in two weeks .
We warned physicians in poorly attended meetings that something like Obamacare was coming .
It has now arrived .
The physicians we spoke to are mostly retired .
They saw some of this happen on a minor scale , but they escaped .
I spoke about the percentage of the GDP ( then GNP ) devoted to heath care : about 7 % .
Today , it is 15 % .
Medicare and Medicaid have increased costs .
The care is no better .
Except for technology , it is arguably worse .
Obamacare will lead to an expansion of these forms of medicine :
1. Concierge2 . Wal - Mart3 . ER4 .
HMO5 .
Mexican
CONCIERGE .
The rich and very rich hire their own physicians .
They pay top dollar .
The physicians do not take third - party payments , either from the government or insurance companies .
They are independent practitioners .
They make house calls .
The houses they call on are very large .
For the upper middle class , there are fee - for - service physicians .
They take no third - party payments .
They do not make house calls .
WAL - MART .
These are the walk - in clinics .
They are price competitive .
They treat minor ailments .
They sell services on a one - time basis .
They take credit cards .
They may or may not cater to the Medicare crowd .
They are assembly - line clinics .
There are no major surgeries or other high - cost , high - risk services .
ER .
Large hospital emergency rooms are mandated by law .
The poor get treated there .
In a life - and - death emergency , they work .
People who would otherwise die in a couple of hours are saved .
For walk - in patients , the ERs ration by time .
Patients demonstrate their patience .
HMO .
This style of medicine is efficient .
It cuts costs by cutting services and cutting time .
You see the physician on duty .
You may not have seen him before .
His job is to get you in and out as fast as possible .
Time is monitored by the company .
Computers make this easy .
MEXICAN .
This is off - shore medicine .
In Canada , when you ca n’t get treated for months or years , you come to the United States and pay .
This will not be possible for Canadians much longer , except for rich ones .
Mexico will serve upper middle - class Americans as the USA has served Canadians .
It is possible to get very good surgical care in Asia and Latin America .
You have to know who the good practitioners are .
Asian hospitals sell for 25 % the same level of services .
There is less regulation there .
Plane fares are cheap .
A stay in a hotel is cheap .
There will be entrepreneurs who set up Websites off - shore that direct Americans to practitioners abroad .
The Web allows this sort of advertising .
Physicians who practice alone or in small limited liability corporations will find that they cannot compete under the new payment system .
Assembly - line medicine will replace the traditional doctor - patient relationship .
TRAPPED
Most physicians are trapped .
They can not sell their practices .
The price of practices has been dropping .
Foreign - trained physicians who can pass the U.S. tests are coming to America .
They are competitive .
Technical Services that can be digitized are being outsourced to India and other Asian nations .
Young American physicians begin with a lot of debt .
They need income fast .
They will be hired by the HMOs and clinics .
They will not reach the salary level of this generation of physicians .
They will be upper - middle - class income - earners .
There will be specialists , of course .
Plastic surgeons who specialize in making rich women better looking will not be part of the new system .
They will be able to do well .
But for the typical practitioner , his career options have been dramatically restricted by the new law .
I think most physicians will stick it out until they retire at age 67 .
They owe money .
They need the income .
The law ’s most restrictive provisions will not kick in until 2014 .
They will adjust .
Residents of Detroit also adjusted .
Then , without warning , the economy changed .
Those who were still living in the city saw their capital disappear .
People put up with the devils they know .
They do not look for a lifeboat when they hear the ship scrape the iceberg .
They assume that it will be business as usual .
Then , one fine day , it is n’t .
CONCLUSION
You had better decide which kind of medical care you can live with .
Then you had better locate a practitioner soon .
This is especially true if you want a fee - for - service physician .
People with money will go to them .
They are already hard to find .
They charge more .
It ’s not easy to become a patient .
They are booked up .
If you have an existing physician , do what you can to become an above - average patient .
You had better start getting into shape .
You can no longer afford to be vulnerable to the diseases and afflictions of a flabby lifestyle .
ObamaCare has changed the risk - reward ratio .
Risk has just gone up .
It will continue to go up .
There will be no roll - back of this law .
It is going to be enforced for as long as the U.S. government has money .
That may not be as long as Obama thinks .

Last week ,
Henry posted an article with 30 Fonts Perfect for Vintage and Retro Style Design and I simply loved the first font of the list , the matchbook typefaces .
By the time I saw it I could think of several good ways to use it in web design , print design on even other ways .
I was so inspired that I decided to do a selection of retro and vintage websites for our weekly web design inspirational post .
I really like retro and vintage stuff … websites , posters , print , adds , everything .
I think it ’s amazing how an ‘ old style ’ still get our attention and appreciation .
For this selection of retro and vintage web designs , you will see retro and vintage elements , fonts , images , colors , textures , etc .
I hope you enjoy the selection .
And of course , if you have a cool retro / vintage font site to share with us , the comments are open .
Have n't updated your laptop 's trackpad driver lately ?
Then you may well want to consider doing so , at least if your laptop is equipped with a Synaptics trackpad .
As a user on the Hardware Zone forums discovered , the latest Synaptics driver seems to enable multitouch gestures on older laptops that did n't previously support them , including two - finger scrolling , and three - finger click .
What 's more , while the drivers themselves come from HP , they should work just fine on other laptops with a Synaptics trackpad .

Gilligan 's Island Jan , 8 , 2001
The island is a direct representation of HELL .
Nobody on the island wants to be there , yet none are able to leave .
Each one of the characters represents one of the 7 deadly sins :
Ginger represents LUST - she wears skimpy outfits , is obsessed with her looks , and is a borderline nymphomaniac .
Mary
Ann represents ENVY - she is jealous of Ginger 's beauty .
The Professor represents PRIDE - he is an annoying know - it - all .
Mr. Howell represents GREED - no explanation needed .
Mrs. Howell represents SLOTH - she has never lifted a finger to help on any of their escape plans .
The Skipper represents two sins : GLUTTONY - no explanation needed ; and ANGER - he violently hits Gilligan on each show .
This leaves Gilligan .
Gilligan is the person who put them there .
He prevents them from leaving by foiling all of their escape plots .
Also , it is HIS Island .
Therefore , Gilligan is SATAN .
Crazy ?
He does wear red in every episode .
Les Rogers Response :
You are absolutely right that the castaways embody a version of the seven deadly sins .
Here is my list : Mr. Howell - greed and exploitation ; Mrs. Howell - frivolousness ; Gilligan - impetuousness ; Ginger - vanity ; the Skipper - gluttony ; and the Professor - eggheadism .
I do n't know what Mary Ann represents - the blandness of the girl next door ?
As the only normal one , maybe this is her nightmare .
Interesting that the island can be interpreted as Hell and paradise ( see the next letter ) .
July 20 , 2000
As much as I enjoyed your philosophical critique on the show , I will make this short and simple ...
I believe you missed the point on the meaning of the " exile " of the castaways on Gilligan 's Island .
You compare their story to Genesis , meaning that they have been barred by their own fault from paradise , when in fact this is not the case .
The only true fault of this crew is that they fail to appreciate the simple joy that they have found on the isle away from society 's worries and curses .
You see , they spend so much time obsessed with trying to get back , that they do n't realize that they have been surrounded by true paradise all along ...
- Eric Zaklukiewicz * * * * * * April 16 , 1999 I enjoyed the parable site .
I think , as with a lot of simply begun ideas , that Gilligan 's Island began as a foray into someone 's discombobulated mind .
In this case , Sherwood Schwarz .
For some reason , the simpler the idea , the more complex the reasoning behind it .
I 've heard that each Gilligan character is a representation of the 7 deadly sins , of course of the parable connection too , and apparently there have been some deep psychological studies done on it as well .
A television show .
A sitcom , at that .
Do you think for a moment that it was meant to go this far ?
Can you imagine something like this EVER happening to " Full House " ?
It 's amusing to watch just how many people get bent out of shape over the implications behind someone 's idea gone awry .
I guess some people just do n't have enough to do and need to dissect television shows .
Then , there are people like me , who sit in wait for these shows to get dissected so we can dissect the dissectors .
All in fun , no seriousness aside .
Greta Ballard * * * * * * August 19 , 1999
How perceptive of you to hone in on the semantic / psychological / spiritual
significance of GI .
There had to be some reason why all these years this stupid show has
been resonating in the psyche of mankind , and you have focused the
perception in such a manner that illuminates beyond the wisdom of TV
Guide .
Not a trivial feat as it seems ...
Sherwood Schwartz has always maintained he created a show to mirror the
archetypes of society .
But no one before you has been able to crack the
code of SS 's high - minded mythological basis and its blatant low - brow
appeal .
Exile from the Garden of Eden ?
The desire to be saved ?
You are so on - target , it 's almost frightening to think what a cultural
force GI truly is ...
James O'Grady * * * * * * September 16 , 1998
The simplicity and innocence of Gilligan 's Island , raped and dissected
by bored intellectuals with nothing better to do ... what a shame .
I
would loathe living in a world where every cultural artifact had to meet
the standards of profundity and significance set by pompous academics ...
what a sterile , joyless , and nightmarish vision of pretentiousness and
posturing !!!
The wonder of a child 's ' uncomplicated mind , the beauty of
a simple nonsensical joke , all this passes entirely over the cynical
gasping verbosity of those who seek to prove their superiority .
Not that
you have n't proved exactly that , that 's not my point .
I grant you
genius , if you wish .
Of COURSE Gilligan's ' Island was shallow and
inane ... intentionally so ... must everything be otherwise ?
I agree with
the Tao / Cheeseburger comment of the above writer , although I feel quite
differently about the show on a personal level , as it constitutes a
major part of my most treasured childhood memories , along with ,
( OH - MY - GOD ! ) , Star Trek .
When the carnage , chaos , and corruption of
Planet Earth 1998 gets to be tooooooo dreary and nihilistic , I pop in a
cassette of the castaways , and for a while , life is sweet .
Finally , to
quote from an interview of J.R.R
Tolkien : " I dislike allegory whenever
I smell it .
No metaphors were intended , nor should be construed , from
this tale .
I simply wanted to tell a ripping good yarn , and that I have
done . "
Kurt " koala " Gearheart * * * * * * Oct. 1 , 1997
Either this is some kind of highly elaborate joke , poking fun at academia , or else I 've found paradise .
At the risk of becoming the butt of the joke ( if that 's what it is ) , I must admit that this site contains exactly the type of writing and scholarship I 've been looking for .
Bravo !
I just received my MFA in stage directing , and I hesitated to enter a Ph.D. program because so many seem like embalming chambers .
I have a great desire to examine programs in popular studies .
Would you know of any ?
This is exactly the kind of scholarship I 'd like to look into doing , for better or worse .
can you offer me any assistance ?
I 'd be most grateful .
I enjoyed the Gilliganian essay , however , I 'll disagree with you on the lack of appeal the show holds for adults .
I feel that the show is pure commedia , and that the questionable depth of the characters actually makes them even more endearing and familiar .
The lack of specific , 3 - D personalities gives them a greater universality .
I am personally drawn to the comfortably iconic nature of the characters , and the cosmic inevitability of the plots hits home every time .
Just as prisoners can identify with Beckett 's protagonists ( enigmatic characters , certainly , but they hardly have a Horton Foote - level of dimension ) , so can many of my friends and I identify with the denizens of GI .
In fact , I 'll go out on a limb and say that Schwartz outdid Beckett .
What would you rather watch , every afternoon for three years ?
See what I mean ?
Anyway , if you know where this kind of scholarship is taking place , please drop me a line .
Great site !
Best ,
Patrick McCray * * * * * * Subject : your lame attempt at philosophy
July 11 , 1997
Trying to explain the philosophy of Gilligan 's Island is a waste of time .
it was a dumb , predictable comedy that made me sick .
Trying to describe Gilligan 's Island intelligently is like trying to describe the tao of a cheeseburger .
* * * * * * 1997/1998
Nietzsche warned us that as we stare into the abyss , so the abyss stares into us .
In the same way , as we watched the seemingly mindless syndicated show , we were being exposed to a brilliant rendering of existentialist doctrine .
Gilligan and his comrades were tantalized by the prospect of the paradise of mainland .
Mainland in this case , clearly stands for man 's search for eternal life in Heaven .
It is well understood by the audience that the island prisoners will never arrive at this mythical place .
Not by Science , as personified by the Professor , who with limited resources can accomplish anything except deliverance to the promised land .
Not by Wealth , as personified by the Howells , nor by beauty and art ( Ginger ) , nor by being a good person ( Mary Ann ) , nor pragmatism and industry ( the Skipper ) .
We identify with Gilligan , the everyman who finds no salvation in the attempts of these beneficent social forces .
Indeed , he is often a victim of their attempts to bridge the gaps between here and the hereafter .
When we find him attacked by sharks or falling from the sky in some ill - fated attempt to escape the island , we understand Heidegger 's claim that we are cursed with freedom .
It is no coincidence that the theme of an inability to reach God is prevalent in each episode .
For example , when an attempt is made to spell SOS with burning logs , in order to reach Astronauts in a capsule flying overhead ( representing the height of man 's science at the time ) , Gilligan accidentally reorders the sign to spell SOL , thus becoming a burnt offering to the Roman sun god " Sol " , principal deity in a religion that was once at the core of the mightiest empire the world has ever known , but also a religion that has long ago lost its last follower and any relevance .
It is a symbol of the vain and fleeting nature of man 's efforts to connect to something greater than himself .
The other overriding themes center around the loss of self and the inexorable proposition of non-existence .
The prospect of annihilation into the abyss of quicksand is ever present .
So complete is this form of destruction that nothing is left of the victim , not even clothing or bones , unless they have a hat which serves as an impromptu grave marker .
Sartre 's well known quote , " L'enfer est l'autre . " that can be translated as either " Hell is other people " or " Hell is the other . " is manifest as the " people " on the " other " side of the island .
These cannibals consume their victim's flesh , just as other people subsume their victim 's identity .
The ultimate absurdist humor is derived from the fact the show is still being broadcast to new generations , as it probably always will , as long as the medium of broadcast television is available .
In this way , the creators have devised the most accurate working model of Nietzsche 's theory of eternal recurrence .
Geoff July 30 , 1999
After too many years as Maynard Krebs in the Dobie Gillis show ( which lasted too long ) , Bob Denver 's portrayal of Gilligan and many strange , unrealistic scripts added to his bankroll but added nothing to sitcoms or comedy .
It was pithy when new .
The reruns were unwatchable .
* * * * * * * After reading your article on Gilligan 's Island I began to think to myself that there were some things that were pretty far fetched .
For instance , why did Ginger and the Howell 's have all of those fancy outfits for someone going on a 3 hour tour ?
Secondly , as many years spent on the island , how did Gilligan 's red shirt stay so new and so nicely pressed ?
Speaking of which , why did they even give Gilligan critical responsibilities as it related to rescue efforts .
I mean given all of his other daily blunders , would someone have thought far enough in advanced to put the professor or the skipper in charge ?
And why did n't the Skipper keep an emergency life raft or vests on his boat ?
Did it take more than 30 years to figure out why all the people died on the titanic ?
“ Hands off my health care , ” goes one strain of populist sentiment .
But what if ?
Suppose Congress and President Obama fail to overhaul the system now , or just tinker around the edges , or start over , as the Republicans propose — despite the Democrats ’ latest and possibly last big push that began last week at a marathon televised forum in Washington .
Then “ my health care ” stays the same , right ?
Far from it , health policy analysts and economists of nearly every ideological persuasion agree .
The unrelenting rise in medical costs is likely to wreak havoc within the system and beyond it , and pretty much everyone will be affected , directly or indirectly .
“ People think if we do nothing , we will have what we have now , ” said Karen Davis , the president of the Commonwealth Fund , a nonprofit health care research group in New York .
“ In fact , what we will have is a substantial deterioration in what we have . ”
Nearly every mainstream analysis calls for medical costs to continue to climb over the next decade , outpacing the growth in the overall economy and certainly increasing faster than the average paycheck .
Those higher costs will translate into higher premiums , which will mean fewer individuals and businesses will be able to afford insurance coverage .
More of everyone ’s dollar will go to health care , and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid will struggle to find the money to operate .
This was followed by a 5 hour hearing concerning protection .
But , I owe Dkos an answer , so tomorrow :
To verify hearing dates‎ , ‎times‎ , ‎locations and for more complete case information‎ , ‎please call ‎ Case Management Services at ‎( ‎520 ‎ ) ‎740‎-‎4240 ‎( ‎8‎:‎00 ‎am to ‎ 5‎:‎00 ‎pm‎ , ‎ Monday ‎ - ‎Friday‎ ) .

Judge rips Sheriff Joe Arpaio on lost profile case files
by Craig Harris , The Arizona Republic - Feb. 13 , 2010 12:00 AM
http://www.azcentral.com/...
A federal judge has imposed sanctions on the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office for destroying evidence in a racial - profiling case , and Sheriff Joe Arpaio must answer questions regarding an immigration file he kept .
U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray
Snow 's order , released Friday , also calls on the Sheriff 's Office to try to recover e-mails that were deleted and to swear under oath to steps it took to gather the records .
I can just see this sworn testimony :
Judge Murray : Sheriff Arpaio , what did you do in your attempts to save your emails ?
Lipstick Joe :
Well your honor , I just kept hitting that delete button like a man possessed .
I hit that delete button like it was a pancake and I was butter .
I hit it like I was Ali making friends with Foreman .
I hit it like it was candy and I was a kid at Halloween , hit delete over and over again , like a candy like button , shiny and red , deleting upon deleting until all evidence was gone .
I hit the delete key to cover my tracks so much it only say " le " when I was finished .
Yeah , something like that .
What this all about anyway ?
http://www.azcentral.com/...
Melendres is seeking to stop what he calls " illegal , discriminatory and unauthorized enforcement of federal immigration laws against Hispanics in Maricopa County . "
The case now includes five individuals who claim deputies have detained them because of the color of their skin , and their lawyers have sought records from the sheriff 's crime - suppression operations .
The Sheriff 's Office has denied it engages in racial profiling , but the office has acknowledged it destroyed records from those sweeps and deleted e-mails among employees regarding those operations .
Being browner than a grocery bag was a crime in Joe 's eyes .
See , he does n't like the immigrants , even though Joe was an anchor baby for his parents from Italy .
Funny how that works .
So everyone thought this evidence was gone and Sheriff Joe was pretty confident he was gonna beat the system again , just like Boss Hogg .
And there were no Duke boys to save the day , but there was an IT specialist .
See , Sheriff Joe 's fatal flaw in his scheme was his complete lack of understanding of how the internet actually works .
God bless him for it , because now he might actually have to answer for his actions .
Deleted e-mails by Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's office subpoenaed by grand jury
by Jacques Billeaud , Associated Press - Mar. 8 , 2010 05:50 PM
http://www.azcentral.com/...
Maricopa County officials said Monday that a federal grand jury investigating Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his office for alleged abuses of power has subpoenaed some e-mails that were thought to have been deleted by the sheriff 's office but turned out to have been saved by the county .
The e-mails had been requested earlier in an ongoing lawsuit that accused Arpaio 's office of racially profiling Hispanics in its immigration patrols .
The sheriff 's lawyers said last month that some e-mails were deleted as a result of an unintentional mistake by a manager and that they had been unable to recover messages written before October .
The discovery led a sheriff 's official to request the records back from the county on Friday on grounds that archiving the old e-mails could jeopardize public safety matters .
Haha , Sheriff
Joe thinks he 's a unitary executive .
This is same stunt BushII would pull when his administration got painted into an anti-Constitutional corner .
In unison they would scream , " National Security !
National Security !
National Security ! " , much like Sheriff Joe is claiming public safety .
Which is utter bullshit , and Lipstick Joe has no Yoo or Roberts to protect him .
Gets popcorn .
" I think they are terribly afraid about what 's in these e-mails , " said Cari Gerchick , a spokeswoman for the county .
You bet your bottom dollar they are afraid .
The wheels of justice turn ever so slowly , but they do turn and currently they are finally starting to grind down ol ' Joe .
He knows his goose is cooked .
Joe Arpaio 's office , county wrangle over control of e-mails
by Michael Kiefer , The Arizona Republic - Mar. 8 , 2010 08:26 PM
http://www.azcentral.com/...
The news caught the Sheriff 's Office by surprise .
On Friday afternoon , Sheriff 's Commander Bob Rampy confronted county technology managers and demanded the e-mails be turned over to him , first by e-mail and later in person .
County officials turned Rampy down .
A Pima County judge will try to sort out ownership in an emergency hearing Wednesday morning .
( Happening Right Now ! )
Eric Dowell , an attorney representing the Sheriff 's Office , said the Sheriff 's Office was not aware that its e-mails had been archived since August 2008 , following an order by another attorney for the county in an unrelated lawsuit involving county officials .
That 's rich !
So Lipstick Joe and the Boyz totally thought they had destroyed all the evidence against them only to find out a 3rd party vendor had been backing all their city correspondence due to corruption in another matter .
So much corruption , so little time , eh Joe ?
The judge should render these emails as evidence because :
They are county property , not the personal property of Sheriff Joe .
Saying they should have been deleted and were not is like saying : " Your honor , I meant to wipe my fingerprints off that gun before it became evidence . "
So I will update after the judge rules , because the proof of the criminal pudding of Boss Joe and his Hispanic - Hating Gang are in those emails .
Be nice to see Lipstick Joe in a neon pink prison outfit , busting rocks in 120 degree heat with no water .
Hell , he might even make a run for the border , which would be so sublime , even the changing winds would gale with laughter .
- no time to edit , watching for court action -
Update 1 : No news yet , but there was an NPR story about Sheriff Joe and the closing of a restaurant for having an undocumented worker washing dishes .
DMX also did cocaine on his probation on Phoenix so Sheriff Joe wants to send him to jail , so maybe they can bunk together .
Lastly Sheriff
Joe will be the celebrity host at The Humane Society of Wickenburg ’s fourth annual Pars For Paw golf tournament and fundraiser .
Something tells me this event is about to get awkward .
Just letting you know no news yet from the emergency hearing , I am sure Joe and his lawyers are howling against the rule of law as we speak .
Update 2 :
Well still no news , I 've placed calls .
But talk about a bad week for Sheriff Joe and his posse , as I alluded to in comments his chief attack dog Maricopa County attorney Andrew Thomas is under investigation by the FBI !
County Attorney Thomas snared by investigation
by David Keller
http://www.examiner.com/...
Maricopa County attorney Andrew Thomas long the hungry publicity hound and ever ready to stage a full court press conference to announce one of his double top secret investigations against political foes , finds himself the center of a special investigation .
The Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court has decided allegations of unethical conduct lodged against Mr. Thomas warrant the unprecedented appointment of a special investigator requested by the Arizona bar .
It ’s also been revealed that Thomas the chief political ally of embattled Maricopa county Sheriff Joe Arpaio , is a target of an ongoing FBI and justice department investigation into allegations of civil rights violations , corruption and widespread abuse of authority .
The Arpaio political machine which dominated local politics in Arizona for the better part of two decades is visibly disintegrating as lower level players attempt to make the best plea deals they can with federal authorities , before a federal grand jury begins handing down indictments .
Nothing says the end times of political machine than plea deals by the little fish .
Big fish are sweating so much you can see the perspiration under water .
Sources close to the federal investigation report several individuals have already flipped on the sheriff and County attorney in return for pleas .
The Government is said to be just a few months away from winding up the probe , which perhaps explains why Sheriff Arpaio has recently begun to claim he is the victim of a secret plot being directed against him by none other than President Barack Obama ’s white house and the Justice department .
The Arizona legislature which is home to several dozen lawmakers who owe their political careers to the Arpaio political machine is already consumed by bitter infighting over who will take over leadership of the Arizona GOP and State legislature when Sheriff Arpaio is gone .
Most local pundits speculate all the meetings and long lunches being taken by groups of moderate republicans and conservative democrats at the capitol indicate a bi partisan coalition of legislators will emerge to assume power when Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Andrew Thomas are taken into custody and find themselves being outfitted for the pink underwear they made so famous .
Looks like I will be moving from popcorn to champagne very shortly !
The New York Times has an excellent investigative piece on the small - town judges of New York State .
These judges are elected to office , need no legal training , have no oversight ( many do n't even keep court records ) , and have the power to imprison people for up to two years ( and some accused have been kept in jail for many more years , waiting for a judge to call their cases ) , and collect millions in ( unaudited ) fines and penalties .
The system is a shambles , and there have been calls for reform since the 1920s , with no movement to do anything about it , despite racist remarks , blatant violations of law , pursuit of personal vendettas from the bench and other grave misconduct .
Judges send abused women back to their spouses ( " Every woman needs a good pounding every now and then , " quipped Donald R. Roberts , a former state trooper , now a judge in Malone , NY ) , lock up children , deny accused counsel , find accused guilty without a trial or a plea .
Reading this piece , you get the sense that the reporters struggled to winnow down the list of horrific abuses to fit the space — the litany of absolutely nightmarish judicial behavior goes on and on and on and on .
And several people in the small town of Dannemora were intimidated by their longtime justice , Thomas R. Buckley , a phone - company repairman who cursed at defendants and jailed them without bail or a trial , state disciplinary officials found .
Feuding with a neighbor over her dog 's running loose , he threatened to jail her and ordered the dog killed …
In the Catskills , Stanley Yusko routinely jailed people awaiting trial for longer than the law allows — in one case for 64 days because he thought the defendant had information about vandalism at the justice 's own home , said state officials , who removed him as Coxsackie village justice in 1995 .
Mr. Yusko was not even supposed to be a justice ; he had actually failed the true - or - false test …
In Mount Kisco , people who asked for the court 's sympathy were treated to sarcasm : Justice Joseph J. Cerbone would pull out a nine - inch violin and threaten to play .

Shock waves could force amino - acid forming chemistry .
Hitting a planet at the right angle could trigger the formation of molecules necessary for life on Earth .
NASA
Striking a glancing blow to a planet could create the perfect conditions in a comet 's icy core to create amino acids — molecules that are vital to forming life on Earth .
This shock - compression theory for making amino acids has been developed by Nir Goldman and his colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , California .
Goldman presented their results on 24 March at the American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco , California .
The researchers wanted to find out what chemical events might occur in an ice grain trapped inside a comet glancing off a planet .
They used around one million computer hours on the powerful Atlas computer cluster at Lawrence Livermore to simulate the possible chemical processes occurring in a single ice grain during such an impact .
In particular , they were looking for amino acids — markers of potential life .
Previous theories for how amino acids on Earth might have come into being include lightning strikes on a primordial soup of simple molecules or the ultraviolet irradiation of interstellar dust grains , but none of the theories proposed so far is definitive .
Goldman 's simulations included 210 molecules : a mixture of water , methanol , ammonia , carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide .
This mix is commonly used by scientists to represent ice in comets .
First impact
When a comet strikes a planet , a shock wave travels through it as it comes to a sudden halt .
This , Goldman explains , compresses the comet , and the compression wave travels through the comet faster than the speed of sound .
As a result , the molecules inside deform and bonds break .
Goldman 's group based its models on the impact that a comet travelling at 29 kilometres per second would be likely to experience .
The impact had to be a side - on blow because a head - on impact would probably destroy everything inside .
To unpick the chemistry going on inside the ice , the researchers used density functional theory simulations , a quantum mechanical treatment of the electrons in a molecule .
In the model , if the electrons around the atoms come close enough to those around other atoms a bond will form .
The first and weakest shock compression that Goldman and his colleagues modelled had a pressure of 10 gigapascals and reached a temperature of 700 kelvin .
The grain was compressed by 40 % .
The team noticed that molecules with carbon–nitrogen bonds were forming , including an unstable molecule called carbamide .
This was a hint that amino - acid - forming processes were possible .
" Under these sorts of conditions everything 's very reactive , so if you have one sort of morsel that has an essential component like a C–N bond you can imagine more carbons adding to it and getting a complicated amino acid , " says Goldman .
In further simulations , in which the pressures and temperatures were higher , the scientists saw more chemistry .
They focused on a simulation at 47 gigapascals and a temperature of 3,141 kelvin for the first 20 picoseconds of the impact .
They saw many complex molecules forming , including large molecules with carbon–nitrogen bonds .
And relax
After the initial impact , the compressed comet relaxes , cools down and expands , events that Goldman and his co-workers recreated in the next stage of their simulation .
After 50 picoseconds of relaxation Goldman 's group saw just five types of molecule with carbon–nitrogen bonds including hydrogen cyanide and more carbamide .
There were also several hydronium ions — water plus a hydrogen ion .
More interestingly , the team also saw what looked like the amino acid glycine with carbon dioxide stuck to it .
Goldman is certain that glycine would ultimately be formed in such a collision , although the simulation was too complex to run for long enough to show this .
The glycine / carbon dioxide complex would react spontaneously with a hydronium ion to produce glycine , water and carbon dioxide , he says .
" We see things that are one step away from forming glycine .
What that really means is if it were easier to run our simulations for longer , let 's say up to a microsecond , the glycine would form readily . "

This is the first suggestion , says Goldman , that a shock impact could drive interesting chemistry within a comet .
The work is theoretically sound , says Murthy Gudipati , an expert in interstellar ice at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
However , he would like to see further calculations to work out the probability of these amino - acid - forming events actually happening .
Goldman 's simulations could also be tested experimentally , he says .
That the ingredients for making amino acids are held within comets has been known for some time , says Gudipati , and laboratory studies have demonstrated that radiation can trigger the formation of amino acids in comet - like ice .
The new study is " the icing on the cake " , Gudipati says , although is not the only process to consider .
" A comet heading towards early Earth may already have been loaded with prebiotic molecules . "
The best thing about reading a book on a tablet ( so far ) is how closely it approximates reading a " real " book – which is why the Kindle 's screen is matte like paper rather than luminescent like a laptop .
Some ( not all ) fear for the demise of real reading and writing , but it 's more likely we 're really at the leading edge of an innovation curve that could breathe new life into the written word .
For example :
What if those written words were watching you reading them and making adjustments accordingly ?
Eye - tracking technology and processor - packed tablets promise to react , based on how you 're looking at text – where you pause , how you stare , where you stop reading altogether – in a friction - reducing implementation of the Observer Effect .
The act of reading will change what you are reading .
We noticed something similar happening with televisions , which will soon be capable of adjusting playback based on how viewers are moving , and it looks like text is headed in the same direction .
In the above video a team of scientists at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ( DFKI in German ) leash eye - tracking technology from the Swedish firm Tobii Technology to HTML , CSS and JavaScript code , creating what they call " Text 2.0 . "
Their technology is capable of monitoring your eyes in order to define words if you stare at them puzzled , eliminating non-essential information when you 're skimming , helping you pick up exactly where you left off , swapping images based on what you 're reading , surfacing relevant reference materials and more , as reported by h+ magazine .
The above video was posted in October , more than three months before the iPad was announced , and since then more people began re-examining the tablet 's potential to enhance the reading experience beyond the Kindle 's implementation of the " book " experience .
The first iPad nearly had a camera , according to some reports , and later models almost certainly will , given the tablet 's potential as a videoconferencing device .
Reader - facing cameras , attached to large screens and coupled to processors capable of running eye - tracking software , now seem all but inevitable .
Apple reportedly purchased eye - tracking unit(s ) from Tobii Technology , which also makes them for paraplegics so that they can control things they otherwise can't .
As for the software part of the equation , Apple has already filed a patent for " gaze vectors , " which arrange and modify content on a screen based on where a user is looking :
Enter the iPad .
With eye - tracking technologies already in Apple 's possession , e-readers more popular than ever before , and Apple set to unleash an e-reader that 's more computer than it is book , the stage is set for eye - tracking technology to appear on next - generation tablets .
This could present incalculable opportunities to reinvigorate the written word , and become a key differentiator from print – a positive one .
Whether it catches on is another story .
Text 2.0 will no doubt draw its share of naysayers – some of the same people who decry electronic text as inferior even when it contains the same information as the dead - tree version .
Granted , it might be a bit over - the - top to add contextual information about whales ' feeding habits to Moby Dick when your eye lingers on a certain passage for too long , and Text 2.0 's potential for abuse could be greater than its potential utility .
But these are the same kind of best - practices challenges that taught us not to hyperlink every word on a web page , or send someone to a corporate site at the mention of any company name .

Produced in a tasteful , helpful way , Text 2.0 promises to resurrect book - reading in a new form .
Before you take these as the self - serving written words of an e-reader junkie addicted to whatever new way there is to read , I should admit that I have yet to make the leap to an e-reader .
Having grown up a bookworm in the ' 70s and ' 80s , I prefer the feel and even the smell of paper books – and the fact that I can just chuck one in my bag for whenever I have a spare moment , without worrying about batteries , theft or breakage .
If Text 2.0 becomes a reality , whether on the iPad or somewhere else , count me in .
I 'm not reading as many books as I used to , and publishing figures suggest I 'm not the only one .
To compete for our attention with other methods of storytelling , books need to evolve – especially for readers born more recently – and Text 2.0 is one way forward that appears to respect the written word , enhancing our ability to consume it rather than subjugating it to multimedia fireworks .
These are still early days for Text 2.0 .
The hardware is still bulky and expensive ( the Tobii x120 pictured here costs tens of thousands of dollars , with the price depending on volume ) , but hardware prices drop precipitously when technology migrates from specialized fields , like helping paraplegics control things , to general fields , like reading .
To encourage software development in this area , DFKI posted a plug - in that e-book developers can use to experiment with the new format 's possibilities using eye - tracking hardware or a mouse pointer simulating the reader 's gaze ( see video ) .
Traditionalists will surely wonder why words need to see us , and they have a point .
But if one believes in the magic of prose , one should n't have a problem with it becoming more magical , and that 's precisely what Text 2.0 promises to do .

That pairing was installed in a misguided bid to bring a new sensibility to the program following a bitter divorce from Ebert and , the Sun - Times colleague Ebert picked to succeed Siskel after Siskel 's 1999 death from a brain tumor at age 53 .
The plug nearly was pulled last year after one season with poorly received Ben Lyons of E! Entertainment Television and Ben Mankiewicz of Turner Classic Movies in the critics ' chairs .
Disney - ABC Domestic Television and ABC Media Productions finally yelled cut Wednesday , announcing the final show with current reviewers Michael Phillips of the Tribune and A.O. Scott of the New York Times will air the weekend of Aug. 14 .
It was anything but a surprise ending .
The cancellation will bring down the curtain on the Chicago - based nationally syndicated TV showcase for dueling film critics that traced its lineage to WTTW - Ch .
11's mid-1970s pairing of the Chicago Sun- Times ' Roger Ebert and Tribune 's Gene Siskel .
Instead , last August , just weeks before the new TV season , Disney - ABC announced it had hired Phillips and Scott .
Respected print reviewers , they were a throwback to the tradition and standards of Ebert , Siskel and Roeper .
But their earnest , sometimes bookish approach -- a sharp contrast to the slick , too often superficial approach of Lyons in particular -- failed to restore the viewership the two Bens squandered " To their credit , " Phillips said Wednesday night , Disney - ABC " never tried to make us anything we were n't . "
Scott and Phillips -- each of whom sat across from Roeper in the earlier incarnation of " Ebert & Roeper " after 2006 health issues that stole Ebert 's voice and kept him off the air -- at least allowed " At the Movies " to die with dignity .
" This was a very difficult decision , especially considering the program 's rich history and iconic status within the entertainment industry , " Disney - ABC Domestic Television and ABC Media Productions said in a statement .
" But from a business perspective it became clear this weekly , half - hour , broadcast syndication series was no longer sustainable . "
Chicago public broadcaster WTTW first paired Siskel , who was reviewing films for the Tribune and WBBM - Ch. 2 , and Pulitzer Prize - winner Ebert for " Opening Soon ... at a Theater Near You " in 1975 .
The show began airing monthly almost a year later .
WTTW eventually made it a weekly a program and took it national via public television in 1978 as " Sneak Previews . "
It was one of the most popular shows in PBS history .
A dispute with WTTW led Siskel and Ebert to commercial television through Chicago Tribune parent Tribune Co.'s TV syndication wing in 1982 , and the rival newspapermen got an even better syndication deal from Disney four years later .
On Twitter , Ebert said Phillips and Scott " can be very proud of their work on ' At the Movies . '
If it had to die , it 's going out with class . "
Ebert praised current producer David Plummer , a holdover from the " Siskel & Ebert " and " Ebert & Roeper " days .
Ebert wrote in an early Thursday blog post that Roeper " did n't fancy following the show in a ' new direction " and called Lyons " the victim of a mistaken hiring decision . "
Mankiewicz , Ebert Tweeted , was " a good guy who knew his stuff ... an innocent bystander in the ' At the Movies ' situation . "
The show 's demise , Ebert noted , was tied to the changes in the TV industry since the show 's heyday .
" Blame the fact that five - day - a - week syndicated shows like ' Wheel of Fortune ' went to six days , " Ebert wrote .
" Blame the fact that cable TV and the internet have fragmented the audience so much that stations are losing market share no matter what they do .
Blame the economy , because many stations would rather sell a crappy half - hour infomercial than program a show they respect . "
From the very start , even when they lacked performance skills and a comfort in front of the camera they would later acquire , Siskel and Ebert were such a natural point - counterpoint that they came to define in many ways the genre of sparring experts on TV .
Siskel , thin , tall with a receding hairline , and Ebert , shorter , full - bodied with a mop of hair , were more than mere physical study in contrasts .
Each could intelligently , passionately and persuasively argue their views with authority , a sense of perspective and history and the certainty the other guy was just plain wrong .
" On television , you get a whole lot of fake people ... fake friendliness , phony smiles ...
I think there is a reality level that makes our show interesting , " Siskel told the Associated Press in 1983 , with Ebert adding that " what appears to be a conversation between two people who have just seen ' Zelig ' " is actually that .
Their affection for the films was more obvious at the time than their affection for each other .
" Gene Siskel and I were like tuning forks , " Ebert wrote on the 10th anniversary of Siskel 's death , noting he thought daily of his old sparring partner .
" Strike one , and the other would pick up the same frequency . "
TV critic Tom Shales of the Washington Post , in 1983 , called the duo " the two best - known movie critics in the country , and , now that Archie and Edith ( Bunker of ' All in the Family ' ) have left us , probably the country 's most celebrated squabblers as well "
Despite his on - air absence , Ebert 's name and imprimatur remained with the program until the formal split with Disney in the summer of 2008 .
A hint of the trouble to come had surfaced a few months before , however , when the show dropped its use of " thumbs up " and " thumbs down " as shorthand for a recommendation or rejection of a film .
Ebert and Siskel 's estate own the trademark on the thumbs .
The parting with Disney was not pretty , and to some the program linked to Siskel and Ebert died then and there .
Ebert later wrote that the executive who brought in Lyons and Mankiewicz decided that the show 's balcony set from both the Siskel - Ebert era and Ebert - Roeper days was passe .
So " one of the most iconic set ideas in ... television history , which had survived for more than half of the life of the medium " and once seemingly destined for the Smithsonian Institution instead was leveled by workers with sledge - hammers and tossed " in a dumpster in the alley " outside ABC - owned WLS - Ch.
7 , where the show was produced .
" We gratefully acknowledge the outstanding work of the program 's current co-hosts , A.O. Scott and Michael Phillips , and top - notch production staff , " the syndicator and production company said in its statement .
" And it is with heartfelt appreciation that we extend very special thanks to the two brilliant , visionary and incomparable critics that started it all , Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel . "
It is not known if Disney or WLS have plans for a replacement show in the old " At the Movies " slots .
WLS has aired the program after the late local news on Saturday nights and on Sunday mornings .
A spokeswoman for Disney - ABC and ABC Media declined comment beyond the prepared statement .
One possibility would seem to be " On the Red Carpet , " a show and Web product launched in February by Disney - ABC Los Angeles flagship KABC - TV with hosts Chris Balish and Rachel Smith , a former Miss USA , focusing on celebrity glitz and glamor .
Ebert , who continues to review films for the Sun - Times , indicated on " The Oprah Winfrey Show " recently he his wife , Chaz , may help produce a new show of some sort and reiterated that plan in his Thursday blog post .
" We believe a market still exists for a weekly show where a couple of critics review new movie , " Ebert wrote .
Ebert declined to " reveal details about the talks we 're deeply involved in " but said they looked to wrest back control of the name , " At the Movies , " as in " Roger Ebert presents At the Movies , " noting he and Siskel first used that title in the 1980s when they left PBS for Tribune .
Tribune Entertainment held onto the title when the two went to Disney as " Siskel & Ebert , " replacing the original critics with Rex Reed and Bill Harris in 1986 .
WTTW similarly tried to sustain a post - Siskel and Ebert PBS version of " Sneak Previews " with what Shales called " two New York yokels ... Jeffrey Lyons ( father of Ben ) , to whom the notion of insight or analysis is more foreign than Jupiter , and Neal Gabler , who talks down to viewers as if they were all 3 years old and looks into the camera the way Dracula regards a vacant neck . "
Roeper , a general columnist at the Sun - Times newly signed to co-host a program on WLS - AM 890 , has been reviewing movies for his cable 's Starz channel , with the video segments also available on his richardroeper.com
Web site , as well as on You Tube and Hulu .

( SACRAMENTO , Calif . ) --
Young women and teenage girls often face efforts by male partners to sabotage birth control or coerce pregnancy -- including damaging condoms and destroying contraceptives -- and these efforts , defined as " reproductive coercion , " frequently are associated with physical or sexual violence , a study by a team of researchers led by UC Davis has found .
Published online today in the January issue of the journal Contraception , the study , " Pregnancy Coercion , Intimate Partner Violence and Unintended Pregnancy , " also found that among women who experienced both reproductive coercion and partner violence , the risk of unintended pregnancy doubled .
The study is the first quantitative examination of the relationship between intimate partner violence , reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy , the authors say .
" This study highlights an under - recognized phenomenon where male partners actively attempt to promote pregnancy against the will of their female partners , " said lead study author Elizabeth Miller , an assistant professor of pediatrics in the UC Davis School of Medicine and a practitioner at UC Davis Children 's Hospital .
" Not only is reproductive coercion associated with violence from male partners , but when women report experiencing both reproductive coercion and partner violence , the risk for unintended pregnancy increases significantly . "
Conducted between August 2008 and March 2009 at five reproductive health clinics in Northern California , the study involved approximately 1,300 English - and Spanish - speaking 16 - to 29 - year - old women who agreed to respond to a computerized survey about their experiences with relationships and pregnancy .
Study participants were asked questions about birth - control sabotage , pregnancy coercion and intimate partner violence to assess their experience of pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage .
Questions included :
" Has someone you were dating or going out with ever told you not to use any birth control " or " ... said he would leave you if you would not get pregnant ? "
" Has someone you were dating or going out with ever taken off the condom while you were having sex so that you would get pregnant ? "
Approximately one in five young women said they experienced pregnancy coercion and 15 percent said they experienced birth control sabotage .
Over half the respondents -- 53 percent -- said they had experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner .
More than a third of the women who reported partner violence -- 35 percent -- also reported either pregnancy coercion or birth control sabotage .
" We have known about the association between partner violence and unintended pregnancy for many years , " said Jay Silverman , the study 's senior author and an associate professor of society , human development and health in the Harvard School of Public Health .
" What this study shows is that reproductive coercion likely explains why unintended pregnancies are far more common among abused women and teens . "
The study authors said the research underscores the importance of educating women seeking care about reproductive coercion , and ensuring that women who are seeking reproductive health services are offered counseling on ways to prevent pregnancy that are less vulnerable to partner interference , as well as connected to domestic violence - related services .
The study also highlights the importance of working with young men to prevent both violence against female partners and coercion around pregnancy .
" This study confirms that women experiencing partner violence are more likely to have greater need for sexual and reproductive health services , " Miller said .
" Thus , clinical settings that offer reproductive health services likely offer the greatest opportunity to identify women experiencing partner violence and to ensure that women receive the counseling and support they may need . "
Comprehensive assessment in clinical settings for pregnancy coercion , birth control sabotage and intimate partner violence should be considered a priority in the context of family planning services .
Moreover , public health efforts to reduce unintended pregnancy should ensure that discussions of reproductive coercion are included in pregnancy prevention programs , she said .

Paul Rosolie leads volunteer expeditions into the Peruvian rainforest with an aim towards education and grassroots conservation .
Mongabay.com ’s eighth in its series of interviews with ‘ Young Scientists ’ .
At twenty - two Paul Rosolie has seen more adventure than many of us will in our lifetime .
First visiting the Amazon at eighteen , Rosolie has explored strange jungle ecosystems , caught anaconda and black caiman bare - handed , joined indigenous hunting expeditions , led volunteer expeditions , and hand - raised a baby giant anteater .
“ Rainforests were my childhood obsession , ” Rosolie told Mongabay.com .
“ For as long as I can remember , going to the Amazon had been my dream [ … ]
In those first ten minutes [ of visiting ] , cowering under the bellowing calls of howler monkeys , I saw trails of leaf cutter ants under impossibly large , vine - tangled trees ; a flock of scarlet macaws crossed the sky like a brilliant flying rainbow .
I saw a place where nature was in its full ; it is the most amazing place on earth . ”

Today Rosolie is a full - time environmental studies major at Ramapo College in New Jersey .
But during breaks he leads tourist and volunteer expeditions ( Tamandua Rainforest Expeditions ) deep into the Peruvian Amazon near the Tambopata River .
Rosolie has teamed up with Juan Julio Duran and the local indigenous tribe , called the Infierno ( named by missionaries ) , to run the tours , as well as explore , survey , and conserve the area .
Recently , the local tribe sent Rosolie and Duran to a place both legendary and ecologically marvelous : a massive lake with a “ raft of vegetation and grass which supports a smaller dwarf forest , ” Rosolie says .
The ecosystem is strong enough to walk on — at least in parts .
“ Walking on the floating forest at night is a surreal and very spooky experience .
The floating part is n’t very stable , one wrong step and you get plunged into the lake .
It was an intimidating place but with careful navigation we found a completely alien environment .
As we walked , we passed only the tops of the aguaje palms whose base lay rooted to the lake ’s floor forty or fifty feet below , ” he says .
While this unique ecosystem is home to a number of animals , including “ three species of caiman , two species of owl , numerous fish ( which we were unable to identify ) , and a tremendous tarantula population ” — all seen on the first night — the big ( literally ) inhabitants are the anacondas .
During their first expedition to the dwarf forest , Duran and Rosolie came upon the biggest anaconda they have ever encountered : “ We spotted two tremendous anacondas .
The largest was more than double the size of the largest anaconda [ Duran ] and I have ever measured ( 15 ft 4 inches ) .
She was so large it would have taken eight people to restrain her on land ; on the floating forest there was no chance .
When she saw us she started moving away .
We both wrapped our arms around her and did our best to restrain her for measurements and documentation , but it was like trying to stop a bus , she was way too strong .
She bolted for the water with us holding onto her .
Hanging on longer would have meant following her into the water below the floating forest .
We were left soaked and panting – in complete disbelief of what we had just seen . ”

Rosolie estimates that she was at least 25 feet long with a 70 inch girth — given the fact that his six foot arm - span could barely reach around her body .
“ Snakes measuring over twenty feet are extremely rare , ” Rosolie says , “ this one was a living legend .
In future explorations , once again spotting her will be one of my primary goals . ”
Rosolie believes that the dwarf forest on the lake may be an anaconda mating ground , given the number of snake tracks they have seen there and the lack of suitable prey .
“ To my knowledge , and the knowledge of the people of Infierno , there is nowhere like it the region , ” Rosolie says .
Rosolie ’s volunteer trips , named Tamandua Expeditions , helps raise eco-tourism funds for the Infierno people , whose area is threatened by development , road building , oil leases , hunting , bushmeat demand , and gold mining .
“ We have raised money that has contributed to permanently protecting a 7000 square hectare area of primary forest , ” explains Rosolie .
“ Recently we have begun a new project within the Infierno community itself .
By basing volunteer expeditions on Infierno territory we are supporting the community ’s ambitions to pursue revenue through ecotourism .
This , combined with the discovery of the floating forest ecosystem has helped convince community decision makers to abandon plans of creating several new roads into primary forest areas . ”

Having tourists come from around the world has also brought increasing conservation awareness to the Infierno community as well .
“ For my friends in Infierno , seeing the interest and appreciation which visitors have for their home ( the rainforest ) and way of life , is an eye opening experience .
They take great pride in showing volunteers the ways of the forest , skills such as how to observe animals , what fruits and nuts are edible , what vines are needed to make brooms and hats , and how to use a machete for just about everything , ” says Rosolie , who adds that education and the desire to draw eco-tourists has led to a decline in hunting by the Infierno .
“ I try to lead volunteers on an adventure that they will never forget – which is thankfully the one easy part , ” Rosolie says of his expeditions .
“ When people see fire - red macaws crossing the sky for the first time , or explore the giant buttress roots of a kapok tree , or find themselves holding a live spectacled caiman , I know that the jungle has done my work for me – they are hooked . ”
In a March interview with Mongabay.com , Paul Rosolie spoke about his expeditions into the Amazon , the local Infierno community , anacondas and black caiman , grassroots conservation work , and his recent discovery of a strange floating dwarf forest thriving on a carpet of vegetation .
AN INTERVIEW WITH PAUL ROSOLIE
Mongabay : How did you become interested in wildlife ?
What is your background ?

Paul Rosolie : I ’ve always been passionate about wildlife and the natural world .
Some of my earliest memories are of my parents taking me on hikes in the woods , or teaching me the difference between African and Asian elephants , or how to recognize the difference between tree species .
I grew up hiking , camping , catching snakes , and raising praying mantises each summer .
I could n’t have been more than eight years old when I remember hearing about a species of turtle of which there was only one left .
The species was about to go extinct .
As a child who loved wildlife above all else , it was the most terrible thing I had ever heard .
It was my first encounter with the concept of extinction .
To think that any species could be gone forever at the hands of humans was more than I could fathom .
That story made an impression on me which never left ; I have been passionate about conservation ever since .
And while I always found classrooms dull , my dissatisfaction with conventional education reached its peak during sophomore year of high school .
So , with my parents ’ encouragement ( can you believe that ! )
I left high school and started college .
Soon after turning eighteen I followed my dream of visiting the Peruvian Amazon .
There I fell in love with the pristine primary forests of the Madre de Dios lowlands .
But it was later that same year , while on a study abroad program through Columbia University in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest that I learned the true value of what I had experienced in Peru .
The near total destruction and complete fragmentation of the once great biome was a sobering contrast to what I had seen in the Amazon .
It instilled a fear in me which was reinforced by similarly grim images of rainforest decimation which I encountered during work in Indonesia and India .
It is because of these experiences that I have chosen to dedicate myself to defending the Amazon .
I will be finishing my undergraduate in environmental studies at Ramapo College of New Jersey this May .
Mongabay :
You first volunteered in the Amazon at the young age of eighteen — what drew you there ?

Paul Rosolie : Rainforests were my childhood obsession .
For as long as I can remember , going to the Amazon had been my dream .
I have always been aware of the destruction occurring in rainforests around the world and by age 17 the sense of urgency was unbearable ; I had to go .
I had to see for myself if it really was as incredible and vast as documentaries showed it to be .
At the time I had no way of knowing that it would far surpass even my wildest expectations .
It took about ten minutes in the jungle before I knew without a doubt that this was where I belonged .
In those first ten minutes , cowering under the bellowing calls of howler monkeys I saw trails of leaf cutter ants under impossibly large , vine - tangled trees ; a flock of scarlet macaws crossed the sky like a brilliant flying rainbow .
I saw a place where nature was in its full ; it is the most amazing place on earth .
Mongabay : How do you balance your conservation work in Peru with your studies back in the US ?
Paul Rosolie :
So far I have been restricted to running trips between semesters and during the summer .
I use my time at school in the states to recruit volunteers and plan expeditions .
Mongabay : How did you end up working with the Infierno people on Peru ’s Tambopata River ?
Paul Rosolie :
My good friend and partner in Tamandua expeditions is a man named Juan Julio Duran ( or JJ ) .
He was one of the expedition leaders of my first trip to the jungle .
I began learning from him and as our friendship grew , I became more and more familiar with his family and the other members of the community .
Over the past few years I have tagged along on numerous expeditions into indigenous hunting grounds with men from Infierno .
During these forays , mostly in the Tambopata Reserve and Bahuaja - Sonene Natinal Park , they would search for peccary , fish , and forest foul to hunt ; I would search for wildlife to study and photograph .
It was then that I honed my jungle skills , and became addicted to the indescribable feeling of being truly deep in the jungle , away from civilization for days on end .
THE DWARF FOREST AND ANACONDAS
Normally 50 + feet in the air , the top of this aguaje palm stands only several feet from the surface of the lake – and the floating vegetation that covers it .

Mongabay : Locals recently led you to a startling place .
Will you tell us about the dwarf forest on the lake ?
Paul Rosolie :
For years I had been hearing about a lake that was somehow special .
Everyone in the community had a profound respect for it because it was rumored to have tremendous anacondas and full grown giant black caiman .
I suspected all the hype to be mostly exaggeration .
But when we launched our first exploration of the place , we instead found the legends to be understated .
The lake is huge , and is surrounded by a palm forest swamp system that stretches for miles .
But the most incredible part is that floating on top of the water ’s surface is a raft of vegetation and grass which supports a smaller dwarf forest .
This “ raft ” is tremendous , we still do n’t know its exact size , but it is arranged in a patchwork that covers over 80 % of the lake ’s surface .
Acting as support pillars for the vegetation raft and dwarf forest , are the tops of aguaje palm trees which are rooted to the lake ’s bottom .
Walking on the floating forest at night is a surreal and very spooky experience .
The floating part is n’t very stable , one wrong step and you get plunged into the lake .
It was an intimidating place but with careful navigation we found a completely alien environment .
As we walked , we passed only the tops of the aguaje palms whose base lay rooted to the lake ’s floor forty or fifty feet below .
The value of this ecosystem as an isolated habitat was immediately evident to us , and during the night of our first exploration we recorded three species of caiman , two species of owl , numerous fish ( which we were unable to identify ) , and a tremendous tarantula population .
To my knowledge , and the knowledge of the people of infierno , there is nowhere like it the region .
Mongabay :
Will you also tell us about your first encounter with anacondas in the lake ?

Paul Rosolie :
On our very first night exploring the floating forest we immediately noticed drag marks of all sizes winding through the grass , areas where something had flattened the vegetation .
JJ suspected from the start that they were anaconda pathways , but I was skeptical because there were simply too many , and some were far too large .
Some measured over 20 inches wide .
But the answer to our questions came at 2 am – when we spotted two tremendous anacondas .
The largest was more than double the size of the largest anaconda JJ and I have ever measured ( 15 ft 4inches ) .
She was so large it would have taken eight people to restrain her on land ; on the floating forest there was no chance .
When she saw us she started moving away .
We both wrapped our arms around her and did our best to restrain her for measurements and documentation , but it was like trying to stop a bus , she was way too strong .
She bolted for the water with us holding onto her .
Hanging on longer would have meant following her into the water below the floating forest .
We were left soaked and panting – in complete disbelief of what we had just seen .
Mongabay : How many anacondas have you found in this strange ecosystem ?
What is the largest you have recorded ?
Paul Rosolie : From catching 15ft individuals on a fairly regular basis , we have a good frame of reference to verify that the female was saw that first night was significantly larger than double any we had previously encountered .
The only actual measurement we have is that my arms barely touched around her body and I have a 6 ’ arm span .
This means that the snake had a girth of something like 70 inches .
We estimate her length to be easily upwards of 25 ft .
Snakes measuring over twenty feet are extremely rare ; this one was a living legend .
In future explorations , once again spotting her will be one of my primary goals .
Although we have been seeing evidence ( tracks ) of 25 ft + range individuals in extremely remote areas forest for years , actually photographing and documenting an anaconda of that size would be huge !
Mongabay :
What ecological significance do you think this place has ?

Paul Rosolie :
Our research so far indicates that in the dry season , when water in the forest is low or absent , the anacondas travel to the protection and moisture provided by the floating forest .
The soft vegetation , isolation from predators , and copious water make it a perfect location for mating , which we suspect to be the main reason for migration to the lake .
It is a theory supported by the fact that while the floating forest offers a social sanctuary , the anacondas would have little or no access to large prey animals while living there .
As a result , during the rainy season as the forest floods , the anacondas migrate away from the lake into the forest .
Using forest streams as navigation highways , they diffuse into the primary forest floodplain and it is there that they do the majority of their hunting .
In January of this year while exploring the Infierno territory , JJ , his brother Federico , and I were following a herd of collared peccary when we came across a 14ft female in a stream constricting one of the pigs we had been following , it was an incredible image !
Because the floating forest hosts a large migration of an apex predator species , this location most likely impacts the surrounding ecosystem in a profound way .
Since anacondas are born very small and grow very large , their predation affects many levels of the food chain .
Their usual diet includes caiman , birds , agoutis , capybara , peccary , monkeys , and much more .
There was even a confirmed case of a dead anaconda found with a nine foot boa constrictor in its stomach .
Other species found around the floating forest habitat include peccary , tapir , ocelot , giant armadillo , giant anteater , puma , and tyra among others .

Mongabay :
What are some other notable species that you have recorded in the Tambopata region ?
Paul Rosolie :
The region is notoriously rich in biodiversity .
Some of my favorites to see are blue and yellow macaws , spider monkeys , howler monkeys , tapir , peccary , caiman , and an incredible diversity of frogs .
Other notable wildlife that we have recorded are giant anteaters , giant armadillos , king vulture , blue morpho butterfly , brocket deer , tamanduas , sloths , harpy eagle , toucans , and a tremendously healthy population of jaguar .
Some of our rarer finds include the black caiman , several unidentified species of snake , the Amazon leaf frog , ocelots , and the gallywasp lizard .
On two occasions we have even encountered the planet ’s largest lepidopteran , the ghost moth , with a wingspan of 12 inches .
Also worthy of note is the finding of a fossilized lower jaw bone from an extinct giant ground sloth .
Mongabay :
You ’ve discovered a healthy population of black caiman in the region .
Will you tell us about this species and why your discovery is important ?
Paul Rosolie : Today there are pockets of black caiman scattered throughout the region , but fully grown adults are rare .
In the past fifty years the skin trade has brought their numbers to dangerously low levels .
Although the skin trade has subsided they still face ‘ pest ’ status and are frequently killed by fearful humans .
Having been almost completely exterminated for years now , they are slowly coming back to the area .
However , they are being met with opposition similar to that of wolves in the U.S. – another re-emerging apex predator .
People are used to life without them .
I encountered one farmer who showed me the carcass of a 16 foot mother caiman .
Close by was her nest which had been ravaged by predators in the absence of her protection .
Although their population seems to be on the rise once again , it is a slow and hazardous recovery .
Being the largest predator in the Amazon , their full return could have a dramatic effect on riparian fauna and on the health of the entire ecosystem .
They are a stunning species to observe .
THE INFIERNOS
Mongabay : Will you tell us about the Infiernos ?

Paul Rosolie : The Infierno community is a mix of indigenous Ese ’eja and Andean colonists .
The community consists of about 90 families and covers approximately 25,000 acres of rainforest on both sides of the Tamboptata .
Like many native communities today , Infierno is made up of people who live varied lifestyles .
Some still live primarily out of the forest — hunting , fishing , farming , and gathering from the surrounding jungle .
Many are Brazil nut farmers , many harvest aguaje palm .
And others have pursued careers such as teachers , carpenters , and ecotourism guides .
Most however are still very familiar with the primary forests that surround the community .
Mongabay : How have the volunteers you bring to the Tambopata River aided the Infierno peoples and vice - versa ?
Paul Rosolie : Each expedition we have run has depended heavily on the help of Infierno men and women .
Employed as guides , teachers , cooks , consultants , trackers , and boat drivers , they play an essential role in making expeditions feasible .
But more important than their work is what they offer to the volunteers in terms of knowledge .
On both sides there is a learning experience .
For my friends in Infierno , seeing the interest and appreciation which visitors have for their home ( the rainforest ) and way of life , is an eye opening experience .
They take great pride in showing volunteers the ways of the forest , skills such as how to observe animals , what fruits and nuts are edible , what vines are needed to make brooms and hats , and how to use a machete for just about everything .
For the volunteers , it ’s a chance to see a very different way of life from their own .
They see people who depend solely on the natural environment for their livelihoods , and yet still live comfortably .
In my opinion this is a very important lesson today , when so many people live completely detached from nature .
Mongabay :
You have had a number of conservation successes through working directly with the community .
What are these ?
Do you think your work could be replicated elsewhere ?

Paul Rosolie : Through working with the community on volunteer projects we have raised money that has contributed to permanently protecting a 7000 square hectare area of primary forest .
Recently we have begun a new project within the Infierno community itself .
By basing volunteer expeditions on Infierno territory we are supporting the community ’s ambitions to pursue revenue through ecotourism .
This , combined with the discovery of the floating forest ecosystem has helped convince community decision makers to abandon plans of creating several new roads into primary forest areas .
These developments mean a tremendous sigh of relief for several dozen miles of forest .
Also , because having abundant wildlife is essential in appealing to tourists , I have been able to convince some farmers in the area to cease or reduce hunting of many species .
Turtle eggs are now left in peace on the river banks , tapir can walk freely , peccary numbers are rising , and the killing of ‘ pest ’ species such as anaconda , puma and jaguar have stopped completely .
The modest success I have had so far is reassuring , but it is a teardrop in the ocean .
Even in the community itself there are still many people to reach .
Just last June a puma was shot on Infierno boundaries because a farmer found it inspecting his chickens .
But seeing how quickly people change is very encouraging : people want to save their way of life .
This progress can very easily be replicated – but we need more passionate conservationists to spread the word on the ground .
I hope that our volunteer trips will help to create some of those .
Mongabay :
You have noted that the Infiernos know everything about the forest , but little about snakes , why do you think this is ?
Paul Rosolie demonstrating a venomous coral snake .
Photo by Gowri Varanashi .
Paul Rosolie : Good question !
I suspect the reason is twofold .
People living on the rivers do n’t eat snakes , nor do they benefit from them directly .
Compared with other forest species which they have grown up tracking , eating , studying , or owning as pets , contact with snakes is minimal .
Subsequently their snake identification skills have never been developed ( even with a field guide and years of experience , I sometimes find snake identification to be difficult ) .
This unfamiliarity combined with the stories passed around of snake bite deaths makes their phobia appear more logical .
For this reason I do my best to educate people about snakes .
I do this by handling the non-venomous ones freely , and exhibiting their harmlessness .
Sometimes for a larger crowd , getting voluntarily bitten is a great way to show off their benign nature .
Although it scares everyone half to death , it pretty much guarantees they will remember at least that one species is harmless forever .
Mongabay : How has the work you ’ve done changed the locals ’ opinions regarding anacondas ?
Paul Rosolie :
They used to shoot them .
Before I began working with anacondas all I heard were horror stories — tall tales of people who had been eaten .
Anacondas were greatly feared .
Today it is a constant contest to see who can find the biggest one .
Today everyone in the community that I know wants to see pictures of the latest sighting ; old women , children , everyone .
Now when JJ , his brothers , and I go out into the bush on what used to be hunting expeditions , we are mostly searching for anacondas to measure and document .
And yet , many people are still un-informed and some still kill anacondas .
This May / June while with the volunteer groups , JJ and I are planning to have an event for the community which should help us reach a lot more people .
We are planning to capture a large female from the wild for a day , and use her for education .
We will be giving a talk about the fact and fiction of anacondas , and inviting the people ( especially children ) to come and get up close to one .
From what we have seen so far , this could help a lot in improving people ’s image of them .
Because once they calm down , anacondas are actually sweethearts .
CONSERVATION IN THE TAMBOPATA
Mongabay : What are the threats to the Tambopata River region ?
What are some of its threatened species ?

Paul Rosolie : Habitat destruction from development , logging , oil leases , hunting , and mercury poisoning from gold prospectors all threaten the region .
Although it is one of the most intact forests on earth , the Tambopata area has been stripped almost completely of mahogany .
Giant otters , black caiman and macaws are among the most severely threatened fauna .
However in remote areas where humans are absent , pockets of stable populations exist .
Mongabay : How do your volunteer expeditions aid conservation efforts ?
Paul Rosolie : The Tambopata / Madre de Dios region of Peru has some spectacularly vast national parks that are set up to protect areas of old growth , biodiversity - rich forest .
But these parks are of little meaning if the people in the area do not respect them .
Today many indigenous people living in cities and towns , who are no longer dependant on the jungle for survival , still enjoy bush meat as a delicacy .
It is a problem with surprisingly vast implications ; in Infierno and other native communities , frequent hunting expeditions target species such as tapir , peccary , deer , monkey , and tortoises .
Through education and employment we try to encourage responsible and informed practices within the forest .
In the Infierno community we are directly aiding in small scale conservation by supporting Infierno ’s efforts to preserve a 600 hectare ( 1,482 acres ) of forest which was formerly used for hunting , wood cutting , and other exploitation .
If it were not for the efforts of the Infierno community and Tamandua , the forest might not be standing today .
Also , through our ongoing studies of the area we are contributing to knowledge that could one day help in upgrading the Tambopata Reserve Zone to national park status .
Mongabay :
If you could draw up a wish - list , what additional conservation initiatives would you like to see in the area ?

Paul Rosolie : I would like to see the Tambopata Reserve Zone upgraded to national park status .
It would supplement the already tremendous Madidi and Bahuaja Sonene National parks by adding over a million acres of protected forest and provide protection to the lower Tambopata from the growing city of Puerto Maldonado .
Also enforcement and education is needed to maintain the existing protected areas where logging , mercury poisoning , and hunting are rampant .
And it is not only the wildlife which is at stake , isolated and un-contacted tribes exist in this region .
Unfortunately for them , loggers who bring guns , chainsaws , and foreign pathogens , frequently invade their lands .
On both sides deaths have resulted from confrontations .
I personally feel that armed guard stations on the boarders of such tribal lands are necessary to prohibit entry by loggers .
For centuries these people have lived isolated , protected by the jungle .
Today their way of life is threatened by our world – it is our responsibility to stop this .
VOLUNTEERING IN THE TAMBOPATA
Mongabay : How did Tamandua expeditions come about ?
Paul Rosolie :
After my initial trip to the Amazon I knew what I wanted to do with my life , and dedicated myself to learning as much as I could .
I did this by spending time with JJ and other members of Infierno and learning about the forest .
Also , the pictures and stories I returned with after each trip helped to inspire my friends and family to want to visit as well , and suddenly I found myself leading expeditions .
From the beginning I knew that being in the jungle was where I belonged , but as time went on I learned that giving other people the chance to experience the place I loved most in the world was an incredibly rewarding process , and one that could help spread the conservation message .
Volunteers .

The name Tamandua is a result of the time I spent caring for an orphaned baby giant anteater ( which in Spanish is tamandua grande ) .
Her mother was killed by farmers when she was only a month or two old .
For five weeks I spent almost every minute with her mixing powdered milk with water and nursing her .
Taking her for walks in the jungle and playing with her I learned that giant anteaters are as affectionate and intelligent as my golden retriever .
Eventually she grew enough to return into the forest , and I lost a very good friend .
But to this day anteaters remain one of my very favorite species .
Mongabay :
What are the goals of your volunteer expeditions ?
Paul Rosolie : Simply , the goal is to make people care about preserving the planet ’s rainforests .
Both for the people who live within them and for the people who buy products like mahogany and palm oil that are taken from them .
In Peru we try to make locals see that preserving the forest can be more financially beneficial than degrading it , and maintaining village life more fruitful than destructive Western development .
And I try to lead volunteers on an adventure that they will never forget – which is thankfully the one easy part .
When people see fire - red macaws crossing the sky for the first time , or explore the giant buttress roots of a kapok tree , or find themselves holding a live spectacled caiman , I know that the jungle has done my work for me – they are hooked .
Mongabay :
What types of volunteers are you looking for ?
What advice would you give a potential volunteer before they show - up ?

Paul Rosolie :
We like to get all types of people : young , old , seasoned adventurers and the uninitiated .
While most who come are already nature lovers , even those who are n’t come away with a profound sense of awe for the jungle .
We get some volunteers who are looking for a hardcore adventure that will test them , and we get others who want a peaceful experience and a chance to meditate in natures climax .
As for advice for prospective volunteers , I would warn them that this is not for the faint hearted .
This is the real thing .
It is a rare privilege to live , even for a short time , in the most biologically rich place on earth , and take part in its preservation .
We live in the forest , drink the river ’s water , and get dirty , really dirty !
Many people are fearful of the Amazon before they come .
But that does n’t last long .
It ’s actually paradise , and on expeditions we have a ton of fun !
Mongabay :
Do you have work for a volunteer who has a deep fear of snakes ?
Paul Rosolie : Haha !
Absolutely , I usually have to reassure people of this .
In reality , the vast majority of the research and activities we do during expeditions does not involve snakes .
Much of our time is spent walking transects and documenting the mammal life we encounter in the early morning , as well as logging a few bird species which are indicators of primary forest .
Our mission is to study the ecosystem , so all things are taken into account .
We focus mainly on mammals , reptiles , birds , amphibians , and even butterflies and insects .
Also , on a number of occasions we have had injured or orphaned wildlife come our way , volunteers can help with this as well .
In the past , volunteers have helped rehabilitate and / or rescue species such as toucan , tapir , giant anteater , bats , snakes , and a number of giant yellow - footed tortoises .
Mongabay :
If someone is n’t able to volunteer are there other ways they can help your conservation efforts ?
Volunteers enjoying their first look at a wild caiman .

Paul Rosolie : Yes .
There are plenty of people who volunteer at home .
Our website , blog , posters and other advertising is all done by volunteers .
Volunteer recruiters can help us in a big way by helping us advertise , and recruit , and help to educate and inform prospective field volunteers .
Mongabay :
You ’ve already achieved a number of conservation successes : something most students your age only dream of .
What advice would you give a young person who is also interested in pursuing grassroots conservation and a truly adventurous life ?
Paul Rosolie :
It ’s easier than you might think .
Make some good contacts ; read .
Check out your local conservation issues , or buy some plane tickets to somewhere .
Ask to assist on a research project , volunteer with an organization , or just call me up !
The world is an exciting and beautiful place with a lot of issues , problems , people and wildlife that need your help .
JUST GET OUT THERE !
Mongabay :
What plans do you have for the future ?
Paul Rosolie : I really want to stay involved in education and continue to run volunteer expeditions , as well as continue to explore deeper and more remote areas of rainforest .
I will most likely continue on to pursue a masters as well as Ph.D.
Making a documentary about the region and the threats facing its wildlife and indigenous cultures is a major dream which I am currently trying to make a reality – there are a lot of issues in this region people simply do n’t know about .
And if this region is going to have a chance at surviving people need to see what the story on the ground is .
Also on my list is someday working on a giant anteater telemetry project .
There are many questions I have about their behavior inside the forest and working with them on a focused level would be incredible .

Under siege : oil and gas concessions cover 41 percent of the Peruvian Amazon
( 02/16/2010 )
A new study in the Environmental Research Letter finds that the Peruvian Amazon is being overrun by the oil and gas industries .
According to the study 41 percent of the Peruvian Amazon is currently covered by 52 separate oil and gas concessions , nearly six times as much land as was covered in 2003 .
“ We found that more of the Peruvian Amazon has recently been leased to oil and gas companies than at any other time on record , ” explained co-author Dr. Matt Finer of the Washington DC - based Save America ’s Forests in a press release .
The concessions even surpass the oil boom in the region during the 1970s and 80s , which resulted in extensive environmental damage .

The mining company has brought in ex-marines for ‘ security ’ and will stop at nothing , not even genocide , to secure profits for its shareholders .

Brazil allocates first funds under plan to save the Amazon
( 12/10/2009 ) Brazil ’s development bank BNDES has announced the first five recipients of grants under the South American country ’s ambitious Amazon Fund , which aims to reduce deforestation by 70 percent over the next decade .
Changing drivers of deforestation provide new opportunities for conservation
( 12/09/2009 ) Tropical deforestation claimed roughly 13 million hectares of forest per year during the first half of this decade , about the same rate of loss as the 1990s .
But while the overall numbers have remained relatively constant , they mask a transition of great significance : a shift from poverty - driven to industry - driven deforestation and geographic consolidation of where deforestation occurs .
These changes have important implications for efforts to protect the world ’s remaining tropical forests in that environmental lobby groups now have identifiable targets that may be more responsive to pressure on environmental concerns than tens of millions of impoverished rural farmers .
In other words , activists have more leverage than ever to impact corporate behavior as it relates to deforestation .

How rainforest shamans treat disease
( 11/10/2009 ) Ethnobotanists , people who study the relationship between plants and people , have long documented the extensive use of medicinal plants by indigenous shamans in places around the world , including the Amazon .
But few have reported on the actual process by which traditional healers diagnose and treat disease .
A new paper , published in the Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine , moves beyond the cataloging of plant use to examine the diseases and conditions treated in two indigenous villages deep in the rainforests of Suriname .
The research , which based on data on more than 20,000 patient visits to traditional clinics over a four - year period , finds that shamans in the Trio tribe have a complex understanding of disease concepts , one that is comparable to Western medical science .
Trio medicine men recognize at least 75 distinct disease conditions — ranging from common ailments like fever [ këike ] to specific and rare medical conditions like Bell ’s palsy [ ehpijanejan ] and distinguish between old ( endemic ) and new ( introduced since contact with the outside world ) illnesses .
In an interview with mongabay.com , Lead author Christopher Herndon , currently a reproductive medicine physician at the University of California , San Francisco , says the findings are a testament to the under - appreciated healing prowess of indigenous shaman .

WASHINGTON  The Human Rights Campaign , the nation 's largest lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender civil rights organization , applauded Senator Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) 's statement that he will introduce a bill in the Senate to repeal the discriminatory " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " law that bars openly gay and lesbian Americans from serving in the military .
Lieberman made his intentions public this morning in a statement and during an interview with the New York Daily News , where Lieberman stated , " What matters is not the gender of the other person in your unit or the color or the religion or in this case the sexual orientation .
It 's whether that person is a good soldier you can depend on .
And that 's why I think it 's going to work . "
" Senator Lieberman 's announcement of the introduction of a Senate repeal bill is a welcome development following what has already been a historic several weeks in the campaign to end " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , ' " said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese .
" As a member of the Armed Services Committee and a longtime leader on issues of national security and foreign policy , Senator Lieberman 's leadership on this bill is another positive sign that ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' can end this year . "
Senator Lieberman 's public stance calling for the end of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " is one that is shared by a growing consensus of military leaders , public officials and the American public .
Since President Obama delivered his State of the Union address last month , where he called for ending the ban on openly gay and lesbian Americans from serving in the military , there has been a nearly unanimous and diverse group who have spoke out in support of doing away with the law .
Some of those include :
· Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates during their congressional testimony before a Senate Armed Services Committee .
· General Colin Powell , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , states , " I fully support the new approach presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee this week by Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen . "
· A New York Times / CBS
News national poll conducted on February 5th  10th , 2010 , shows yet again that a majority of Americans support repeal .
· The largest organization of retired U.S. military reserve officers in the nation voted to end its decades - long position in support of excluding gays and lesbians from the U.S. military .
The association , founded in 1922 and chartered by Congress in 1950 , also rejected the " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " law .
· Former Vice President and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney threw his support behind the effort to repeal " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " by stating , " When the chiefs come forward and say , ' We think we can do it , ' then it strikes me as it's time to reconsider the policy , and I think Adm .
Mullen said that . "

OK , I know this FAQ is long .
Very long .
Well ... it 's ridiculously long .
If you are inconvenienced or strenuously object to the posting of this FAQ , please DON'T FLAME me or send me nasty mail .
Just think what I have to go through .
This FAQ takes a lot of my time , of which I have very little to spare .
I 'm open for suggestions .
I 've considered the following : - splitting it up into smaller parts - eliminating certain sections which may no longer be relevant - the web and search engines certainly seem to make a lot of this FAQ obsolete ( or am I mistaken on this ? ) - not posting it to the newsgroups and just turning this whole mess into a [ large ] web page ( the problem with this is that I do n't have a web site ) - forgetting about it all together and reminding my kids that I 'm their father ( if you all tell me to go packing , I 'll gladly fold up shop and devote more time to family , friends , and personal hygiene ) I would be happy to hear ideas on how this FAQ could be improved for the reader .
If it makes MY job easier , then that 's even better .
OK , with that out of the way , let 's get on with it ...
Well , it 's finally here .
A free C compiler for the 8051 .
Featured in Dr. Dobb's August 1997 issue , Andy Yuen 's Retargetable Concurrent Small C ( RCSC ) is based on James E. Hendrix ' lengendary Small C. A previous iteration of RCSC , Concurrent Small C was introduced in the August 1996 issue of Dr. Dobbs .
With the release of this compiler , Andy Yuen is very likely to become a folk hero .
So , why are you still reading this ?
The FAQ will wait !
First download a copy of RCSC .
You can get it from : http://www.ddj.com or ftp://ftp.mv.com/pub/.
Then go out and find a copy of Dr. Dobb 's August 1997 issue .
You 'll still need to purchase either James E. Hendrix 's " A Small C Compiler " ( ISBN 0-13-814724-8 ) or the Dr. Dobb's Small C Compiler Resource CD .
This of course means that the free C compiler is n't totally free , but then again , what is ?
If you 'd like to start learning about microcontrollers , but the thought of finding all the parts and then building one scares you , take a look at the line of boards available from American Educational Systems .
They have three boards : AES - 51 ( 8051 ) , AES - 11 ( 68hc11 ) , and AES - 88 ( 8088 ) .
All three boards are built along the same lines and include RAM , ROM , LCD display , keypad , A/D , serial ports , digital I/O ports , and logic probe .
Also included is a full bookshelf of documentation .
The AES - 51 comes with a hardware manual , language manual , and Intel 's 8051 User 's Manual ( over 500 pages of reference material ) .
The board has a built in BASIC - 52 and monitor built into external ROM on board .
The BASIC even includes commands for displaying on the LCD .
These boards are ridiculously easy to use and program - you can get started experimenting right away .
This is a perfect system for students and hobbyists .
Even professionals will find this system useful as a prototyping tool and test bed .
Highly recommended .

Systems ( Pune , India ) has announced version 3.0 of their C compiler for the 8051 .
The major new feature of this version is support for the " bit " type .
Although this version imposes some limitations on the use of this newly supported type , you can now use the bit manipulation capability of the 8051 .
One important benefit will be smaller code size and code which is easier to maintain and understand .
A working demo of the compiler package , which includes the library sources and permits the compilation of small programs , is available from their web site .

Take care , Uncle Russ 1 ) ABOUT THIS FAQ 1.1 )
Who put this FAQ together ?
I was prompted to put this FAQ together in response to my own frustration in searching for information , and to the constant occurrence of requests for information on this subject in various newsgroups .
Hopefully others wo n't need to go through what I did .
Normally , I spend all day programming in assembler or C on an IBM PC .
With my hobbyist hat on I decided to try my hand at a little microcontroller project design .
When it came time to start , I had no idea what to do .
I had nothing to start with - no assembler , no programming language , no simulator .
I cobbled together a simulator to help me learn about the workings of the chip .
It 's not being made available to the public since I 'm afraid the simulator is n't very good .
It was for my own use , so the user interface ( there is none ) really sucks eggs .
I decided to search the net for information on the 8051 .
This list was compiled the hard way , logging onto every anonymous ftp site I could find and looking around .
I also used Archie , other FAQs and lists , and every reference to the 8051 that appeared in the various news groups .
It took a long time till stuff finally started popping up .
I saved all of my notes and the result was the first version of this FAQ .
Responses have been pouring in , and the result is a much more complete and thorough FAQ .
1.2 ) How can I contribute to this list ?
I please ask that if you have any suggestions or additions , or you would like to correct any of the information contained herein , please send me a note .

2 ) ABOUT THE 8051 2.1 )
The 8051 microcontroller
The 8051 is an 8 bit microcontroller originally developed by Intel in 1980 .
It is the world 's most popular microcontroller core , made by many independent manufacturers ( truly multi- sourced ) .
There were 126 million 8051s ( and variants ) shipped in 1993 !!
A typical 8051 contains : - CPU with boolean processor - 5 or 6 interrupts : 2 are external 2 priority levels - 2 or 3 16 - bit timer / counters - programmable full - duplex serial port ( baud rate provided by one of the timers ) - 32 I/O lines ( four 8 - bit ports ) - RAM - ROM / EPROM in some models
The 8051 architecture is a tad bizarre , but then so are the architectures of most microcontrollers due to their specialization ( check out the PIC for creativity - for that matter , take a look at any RISC chip ) .
One vexing problem with the 8051 is its very non-orthogonal instruction set - especially the restrictions on accessing the different address spaces .
However , after some time programming the chip , you can get used to it - maybe even appreciate it .
One strong point of the 8051 is the way it handles interrupts .
Vectoring to fixed 8 - byte areas is convenient and efficient .
Most interrupt routines are very short ( or at least they should be ) , and generally can fit into the 8 - byte area .
Of course if your interrupt routine is longer , you can still jump to the appropriate routine from within the 8 byte interrupt region .
The 8051 instruction set is optimized for the one - bit operations so often desired in real - world , real - time control applications .
The boolean processor provides direct support for bit manipulation .
This leads to more efficient programs that need to deal with binary input and output conditions inherent in digital - control problems .
Bit addressing can be used for test pin monitoring or program control flags .
2.2 ) 8051 Flavors
The 8051 has the widest range of variants of any embedded controller on the market .
The smallest device is the Atmel 89c1051 , a 20 Pin FLASH variant with 2 timers , UART , 20 mA .
The fastest parts are from Dallas , with performance close to 10 MIPS !
The most powerful chip is the Siemens 80C517A , with 32 Bit ALU , 2 UARTS , 2K RAM , PLCC84 package , 8 x 16 Bit PWMs , and other features .
Among the major manufacturers are : AMD Enhanced 8051 parts ( no longer producing 80x51 parts )
Atmel FLASH and semi-custom parts Dallas Battery backed , program download , and fastest variants Intel 8051 through 80c51gb / 80c51sl ISSI IS80C51/31 runs up to 40MHz Matra 80c154 , low voltage static variants OKI 80c154 , mask parts Philips 87c748 thru 89c588 - more variants than anyone else Siemens 80c501 through 80c517a , and SIECO cores SMC COM20051 with ARCNET token bus network engine SSI 80x52 , 2 x HDLC variant for MODEM use Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) AMD was one of the first manufacturers of enhanced variants including such features as : dual data pointers , slave interface with arbitration unit , dual port RAM , FIFO buffers , and others .
They are now out of the 8051 business .
Atmel
The smallest current device is the ATMEL 89c1051 , a 20 Pin FLASH variant with 2 timers , UART , 20 mA .
ATMEL was the first with standard pinout FLASH , and with more program cycles than other custom pinout FLASH .
These parts compete with OTP and MASK product on price , but eliminate inventory problems and the hidden costs of OTP development .
This will put real pressure on " vanilla " micros like PIC and ST6 .
Dallas Soft Microcontrollers - DS5000 ( T ) , DS5001 ( T ) , DS2250 ( T )
The Dallas Soft Microcontrollers have standard 8051 cores with on - chip non-volatile RAM instead of ROM .
This gives the user the ability to easily alter the system and is perfect for data logging .
These processors are available in both chip and module solutions .
Among the features included in this family of products : - on -chip non-volatile RAM - loader in ROM for downloading programs ( eliminates the hassle of EPROM erase / program / install cycle ) - built in real time clock option - watchdog timer - software security ( program and data encryption )
The DS500x is a standard 40 pin DIP package ( well , mostly standard , it is really a BOX which is about double the height of a normal chip ) .
The DS225x is a SIP version which is functionally identical to the DS5000 but usually a bit less expensive .
The nice thing about having the RAM on - chip , is that the I/O ports are unaffected .
When the RAM is configured as CODE memory , the DS5000 behaves exactly as a single - chip 8051 .
The NV - RAM is static with a built - in lithium battery , and has no limitations on the number of writes .
You can download your code as many times as you like without damaging the device .
The DS5000 also includes a loader in ROM , which permits you to bootstrap code into the RAM to get underway .
The loader and on - chip RAM have an encryption feature with which you can protect your code from being read back from the device if you wish .
Dallas High - Speed Micros - DS80c320 , DS87c520 , DS87c530 Real barn - burners - performance up to 10 MIPS !
Dallas was the first to speed up the core .
Wasted clock and memory cycles have been removed using a redesigned processor core .
As a result , every 8051 instruction is executed up to 3 times faster than the original for the same crystal speed .
Clock speeds from DC to 33MHz !
High performance does n't just mean speed .
High integration gives the user 2 full - duplex hardware serial ports , 13 total interrupt sources ( 6 external ) , watchdog timer , power management , power - fail reset , and other features .
Intel MCS - 51 Introduced in 1980 , it has become the industry standard for embedded control .
Intel offers a wide variety of 8051 versions with different configurations of on - board EPROM / ROM .
Also low power , high integration , and specialized parts are also offered .
OKI OKI makes an 85c154 piggyback - an 8751 but with an EPROM socket on top !
Great with an EPROM emulator .
Philips Philips has more 8051 variants than anyone else .
Among the derivatives that they have : 40MHz , 24 pin skinny DIP , low voltage , quad flat pack ( QFP ) versions for saving board space , OTP , I2C bus , and so on .
The c5xx line features high integration , with many built - in features including built - in EMI / RFI suppression .
The c7xx series are very low - end , inexpensive micros .
They are offered with less memory ( 1 k , 2 k , etc. ) and fewer features .
In fact the 83c750 sells for only $ 1 in very high OEM volumes .
Siemens sab80c517a
The 80c517a is one of the most powerful 8051 variants available .
It features high clock speed ( 40 MHz ) , and high integration with 32 Bit ALU , 2 UARTS , 2K RAM , PLCC84 package , 8x16 bit PWMs , and more .
Standard Microsystems Corporation SMC COM20051
The COM20051 is an integrated microcontroller and network interface which features : - high performance and low cost - based on popular 8051 architecture - drop - in replacement for 80C32 PLCC - network supports up to 255 nodes - powerful network diagnostics - maximum 512 byte packets - duplicate node ID detection - self - configuring network protocol - retains all 8051 peripherals including Serial I/O and 2 Timers - utilizes ARCNET(R ) Token Bus Network Engine - requires no special emulators - 5 Mbps to 156 Kbps data rate - network interface supports RS - 485 , twisted pair , coaxial , and fiber optic interfaces - " receive all " mode allows any packet to be received Silicon Systems Inc. SSI73M2910/2910A
The SSI73M2910 is a high performance microcontroller designed for modem and communications applications .
- 8052 Compatible Instruction set . - 34 MHz Operation @ 4.5 - 5.5V - 44 MHz Operation @ 4.75 - 5.5.V ( 2910A ) - 22 MHz Operation @ 3.3 - 5.5.V - HDLC Support Logic ( Packetizer , 16 and 32 CRC , zero ID ) - 24 pins for user programmable I/O ports - 8 pins programmable chip select logic or I/O for memory mapped peripherals eliminating glue logic - 3 external interrupt sources ( programmable polarity ) - 16 dedicated latched address pins - Multiplexed latched / address bus - Instruction cycle time identical to 8052 - Buffered oscillator ( or OSC / 2 ) output pin - 1.8432 MHz UART clock available - Bank select circuitry to support up to 128 K of external program memory - 100 - Lead TQFP package available for PCMCIA applications - Also available in 100 - Lead QFP package 2.3 ) 16 - bit 8051 parts
A joint project between Intel and Philips Semiconductors has resulted in two new excting products - 16 bit 8051s !
Due to a disagreement between the parties , they each went their separate ways .
Intel developed the MCS - 251 , which was originally called the ZX ( this name can still be found on one of the Intel slide shows ) .
Philips came out with the eXtended Architecture ( XA ) line .
The Intel MCS - 251 is a drop - in replacement for the 8051 ( at least , after programming the mode control bits first ) , and is also binary compatible .
The XA is more of a 16 bit micro which also happens to be source code compatible .
One can argue the merits of which approach is better .
Pin compatible parts allow instant performance upgrades for existing designs , and the binary compatibility truly preserves users investment in code and tools .
By staying firmly in the 80x51 camp , Intel allows users transparent access to an enormous horsepower range .
To further improve throughput in numerically intensive areas , users can use INTEGER , LONGINT , and FLOAT libraries written for the MCS - 251 .
The Philips XA is not a drop - in replacement for the 8051 .
Binary code compatibility is nice , you can move right up to a more powerful engine without having to bust a gut ( We all know the Intel binary compatible success story with their 80x86 microprocessors ) .
But if you 're working on a new design , how necessary is binary compatibility ?
If you 're just looking for a souped up ' 51 , Dallas already has the 320 .
If you need the advanced features , you 'll need to recompile or rewrite your software anyhow .
You 'll also have to drag along some compatibility baggage with you in order to use the 16 bit operations - these are preceded by an escape code ( A5H ) , the only instruction not used in the 8051 instruction set .
With source code compatibility , you have to recompile your code ( with a new set of development tools ) , since the instruction set has been recrafted to allow the biggest bang for the buck .
This process is n't 100 % transparent , but then again , binary compatibility is n't either .
If you 're upgrading an existing design , the 251 is probably your only reasonable choice ( although you might also want to consider the Dallas 320 ) .
On new designs , you 'll have a tough decision to make .
Whichever path you choose to take , the 8051 will never be the same again .
Intel MCS - 251
The Intel MCS - 251 is 100 % binary and pin compatible with the 8051 , but with a 5 - 15 times boost in horsepower .
This is achieved by a six fold gain in bus cycles , and further hardware improvements to avoid wasted bus cycles .
Further performance gains are possible by recoding critical sections to take advantage of the new features : powerful 8/16/32 bit instructions , flexible 8/16/32 registers , 16 MB linear address space , 16 - bit stack pointer , enhanced BIT manipulations , and improved control instructions .
In addition to extra 16/32 bit instructions , the 251 includes 40 registers with Accumulator and Index functions overlayed as 16x8 , 16x16 , 10x32 .
Should we expect a 351 in the future .
How about a 451 ?
Or maybe a Penti-uC ?
Philips 8051XA
By tossing compatibility out the window , Philips was able to develop a true 16 microcontroller while at the same time preserving the basic 8051 instruction set ( source ) .
The benefits of this break with tradition result in a chip that has dual 16MB address spaces ( data and code ) , multitasking support with task protected memory segments , a separate SFR bus , fast context switching , and optimized code efficiency .
Other features include : hardware divide and multiply ( over 100 times faster than an 8051 ) , 32 vectored interrupts , 16 hardware exceptions , and 16 trap instructions .
2.4 ) 8051 representatives and approximate prices ( in USD $ ) There are many , many varieties of 8051 out there .
This is only a small sampling of typical prices on Intel chips .
8031 ( 128 bytes RAM ) ................................... 3.59 80C31 ( CMOS version of previous ) ....................... 6.95 8051AH ( 256 bytes RAM ) ................................. 6.95 8051AHBASIC ( w/ Basic interpreter built in ) ............ 29.95 8751 ( 4K EPROM , 128 bytes RAM ) ........................ 26.95 87C51 ( CMOS version of previous ) ...................... 39.95 2.5 ) Common and New 80x51 variants
Intel has announced that 8052AH - BASIC has reached its EOL ( end of life ) and is not any more in production .
Resellers may still have some chips in stock .
However , both source and object code is available in many ftp-sites ( and Intel BBS ) and can be loaded into any 8052 - compatible internal ROM memory ( or external ROM , but then PROG and DMA cannot be used ) .
At least few years ago , MicroMint Inc. ( 4 Park St , Vernon , CT 06066 , USA ) was selling their own 80C52 - BASIC at USD 25 , speed DC 12 MHz , CMOS .

Getting started
If you are interested in getting started with the 8051 , you will need to concern yourself with getting the appropriate hardware and software to develop your system .
A good start would be to pick up a couple of books on the subject .
Two really great books for beginners are " The Microcontroller Idea Book " by Jan Axelson ( Lakeview Research ) and " Programming and Interfacing the 8051 Microcontroller " by Sencer Yeralan and Ashutosh Ahluwalia ( Addison Wesley ) .
Both books contain complete plans for microcontroller boards / systems if you plan on rolling your own .
The Yeralan / Ahluwalia books also contains a diskette with just about all of the software that you 'll need to get started progamming for the 8051 ( assembler , simulator , etc ) .
These books also have many circuit and code examples and are very useful for the beginner ( I 'm going to need an extra copy of each for reading in the bathroom :-) .
Which software you choose is mostly a matter of personal preference , how much time you have to invest , how much money you have to invest , and what you want to accomplish .
Serious work can be accomplished using much of the free software listed in this FAQ , however in most cases technical support is unavailable .
Registering shareware , or buying a mainstream commercial package gives you backup and support and helps you get going much faster .
If you are a hobbyist or student , and would like to program in C , I would recommend looking at the Dunfield Development System .
I use this package and it is a powerful package for only $ 100 .
It includes a full suite of development tools including C compiler , assembler , linker , and much more .
A hardware - resident simulator / emulator is available for an additional $ 50 .
Another C compiler package from Micro Computer Control provides similar capabilities for the same price .
A wide range of development options exists for all budgets and purposes .
One convenient way to start is the Ceibo / Philips DS - 750 development system , based on the 80c75 x ( a scaled down 8051 variant ) .
The " emulator " board programs the chips ( so you wo n't need an EPROM programmer and the debugger has a user interface much like Borland 's Turbo Debugger .
The development system that I use is based on the Dallas DS5000 .
The nice thing about the DS5000 is that you can upload your programs directly to the chip ( no EPROM needed ! ) .
The Dunfield package provides excellent support for this chip , including plans for building a " pseudo-ice " .
With this setup , all you need to do is upload your program , and debug ( emulate ) on the target hardware .
This setup is highly recommended .
One other possibility is the 8052AH - BASIC chip .
With a Basic interpreter built in , you have an interactive development system when attached to your PC .
Jan Axelson 's book gives complete coverage on this chip , including plans to build your own system , programming in Basic , and interfacing to various peripherals and devices .
What might be the easiest way to get started , is by buying a complete development package .
The AES - 51 from American Educational Systems is a good example .
This package comes complete with everything you need to get started and do real work .
The microcontroller board has just about every peripheral you 'll ever need built right in ( LCD , keypad , A/D , D/A , I/O , etc ) and comes with a built - in monitor and BASIC .
Also included is a shelf full of tutorial and reference books and a diskette with the required support software for your PC .
For less than $ 300 , you get a complete and professionally designed and packaged educational tool .
AES also has two other boards ( based on the 68hc11 and 8088 ) which have the same basic appearance and functionality .
2.8 ) Technical Questions and Answers Q : Why are ports P0 and P2 unavailable for I/O when using external memory ?
A : The output drivers of ports 0 and 2 , and the input buffers of port 0 , are used to access external memory .
Port 0 outputs the low byte of the external memory address , time - multiplexed with the byte being read / written .
Port 2 outputs the high byte of the external memory address when the address is 16 bits wide .
Otherwise , the port 2 pins continue to emit the P2 SFR contents .
Therefore , when external memory is being used , ports 0 and 2 are unavailable for their primary use as general I /O lines .
Q : Is there anything I can do to use these ports for I/O when using external memory ?
A1 : Not really .
A2 : If you really want to make your life miserable , you can try to use P2 for output when it is n't being used for memory access .
The contents of the SFR latch for port 2 are not modified during the execution of a Data Memory fetch cycle on the Expanded Bus .
If an instruction requiring a cycle on the Expanded Bus is not followed by another instruction requiring a cycle on the Expanded Bus , then the original contents of the port 2 SFR latch will appear during the next machine cycle .
That is , when PSEN , RD and WR are all inactive , you can use port 2 for output ( check the timing charts in the data book ) .
The chip will emit the contents of the P2 SFR at that time .
Do you REALLY want to bother with this though ?
A3 : By including the external RAM " on-chip " , the Dallas DS5000 makes these ports available for I/O .
The SLIC E2 from Xicor does the same thing for other 8051 parts .
A4 : If you really need the extra I/O ports , there are number of 8051 variants that have additional ports .
Philips and Siemens are two such manufacturers that have these parts in their product lines .
Q : I 'm outputting a 1 to a pin on port 0 , but I 'm not getting a 1 out .
If I use a pin on port 1 instead , it works fine .
What am I doing wrong ?
A : Port 0 has open drain outputs .
Ports 1 , 2 , and 3 have internal pullups .
What does this mean ?
See the next question and answer .
Q : Port 0 has open drain outputs .
Ports 1 , 2 , and 3 have internal pullups .
What does this mean , and why should I care ?
A : When used as outputs , all port pins will drive the state to which the associated SFR latch bit has been set .
Except for port 0 , which will only drive low ( not high ) .
When a 0 is written to a bit in port 0 , the pin is pulled low ( 0 ) .
But , when a 1 is written to a bit in port 0 , the pin goes into a high impedance state - or in other words , " disconnected " , no value .
To be able to get a 1 as output , you need an external pullup resistor to pull up the port ( to 1 ) when the port is in its high impedence state .
Typical values for pullups might be 470 ohm to drive a LED , and 4.7 K or higher to drive logic circuits .
C : Any port pin may be used as a general purpose input simply by writing a 1 into the associated SFR latch bit .
Since ports 1 , 2 , and 3 have internal pull - up devices they will pull high and will source current when pulled low .
When a port 0 bit is programmed for input ( set to 1 ) it will go to a high impedance state .
Q : Why is such an oddball crystal frequency of 11.0592 MHz used so often for 8051 designs .
A1 : 11.0592 MHz crystals are often used because it can be divided to give you exact clock rates for most of the common baud rates for the UART , especially for the higher speeds ( 9600 , 19200 ) .
Despite the " oddball " value , these crystals are readily available and commonly used .
A2 : When Timer 1 is used as the baud rate generator , the baud rates in Modes 1 and 3 are determined by the Timer 1 overflow rate and the value of SMOD ( PCON.7 - double speed baud rates ) as follows : smod 2 Baud rate =
------ x ( Timer 1 overflow rate ) 32
Most typically , the timer is configured in the auto - reload mode ( mode 2 , high nibble of TMOD = 0100B ) .
In this case , the baud rate is given as : smod 2 Oscillator frequency Baud rate =
------- x
-------------------- 32 12 x ( 256 - TH1 ) Some typical baud rates for an 11.0592 crystal : Baud rate SMOD TH1 ---------------------
19200 1 0FDH 9600 0 0FDH 4800 0 0FAH 2400 0 0F4H 1200 0 0E8H 300 0 0A0H
Another way to look at it , would be to rework the formula to give us the crystal frequency that we need for the desired baud rate : smod Minimum crystal frequency =
Baud rate x 384 / 2
This gives us the minimum crystal frequency possible for the desired baud rate .
The frequency can be evenly multiplied to obtain higher clock speeds .
As an example , the minimum crystal frequency for 19.2 K baud is : 3.6864 = 19200 x 384 / 2 ( smod is 1 for 19.2 K baud ) 11.0592 = 3.6864 x 3
To determine the timer reload value needed , the formula can be changed to factor in the multiplier : smod Crystal frequency = Baud rate x ( 256 - TH1 ) x 384 / 2
From the example above , the multiplier ( 3 ) is used to determine TH1 : TH1 = 256 - 3 = 253 = 0FDH
The crystal frequency for 19.2 K baud is : 11.0592 = 19200 x ( 256 - 0FDH ) x 384 / 2 ( smod is 1 for 19.2 K baud )
Other values can also give good results , but 11.0592 is one of the higher speed crystals that allows high baud rates .
A : Well , you wanta talk about oddball values ?
Another good crystal value is 7.3728 MHz and its multiples .
Using counter1 this gives an even 38.4 kbps rate exactly , which is not possible with 11.0952 MHz Xtal .
< Thanks to Eero - Pekka Mand > Q : How do I decrement the data pointer ( DPTR ) ?
Where did the DEC DPTR instruction go ?
A1 : You ca n't decrement DPTR .
Although there is an INC DPTR instruction , there is no DEC DPTR .
In fact , there is no other way to change the contents of DPTR except for MOV and INC .
A2 : You can use the accumulator as an offset if you need to perform " calculations " on the DPTR .
As an example : MOV DPTR , #9000 ; load base address into DPTR MOV A , # 10 ; load desired offset MOVC A , @A+DPTR ; retrieve desired data A3 : Another method would be to use indirect addressing .
Instructions such as MOVX A,@Ri can address a 256 byte " page " of external RAM .
The value represented by @ Ri ( @R0 or @ R1 ) is emitted to Port 0 , which is the low byte of the external RAM address bus .
In addition , the contents of the P2 register is emitted to Port 2 , which is the high byte of the external memory address bus .
The indirect addressing register together with the P2 register , which specifies the " current page number " , gives us a 16 bit pointer into the external memory address space .
This technique can make moving data in external memory much faster than reloading DPTR every time .
The indirect addressing register can be manipulated much easier than DPTR which can only be loaded and incremented .
Just remember to make sure that P2 contains the proper value for the high byte of the address .
A4 : Inside the BASIC interpreter source code , and published in its manual , is a short and efficient subroutine to decrement data pointer , only 6 statements : XCH A , DPL ; JNZ $ +4 ; DEC DPH ; DEC A ; XCH A , DPL ; RET Only DPTR is affected , not A or any flags !
< Thanks to Eero - Pekka Mand > Q : I 'm trying to PUSH and POP the accumulator , but my assembler complains about the instruction PUSH A .
What 's wrong with this ?
A : In instructions that are accumulator specific , A is used to represent the accumulator .
However , PUSH and POP have no accumulator specific forms , only direct addressing forms .
Therefore , you need to specify the correct accumulator " address " - ACC .
Use the instruction PUSH ACC .
Q : The 8052 AH - BASIC interpreter seems to work OK when I perform simple interpreted commands .
For example : READY > PRINT " HELLO " HELLO
However , when I try to enter a [ numbered ] statement , I get an error : READY > 10 PRINT " HELLO " INVALID LINE NUMBER ..!!
I get the same error when I try LIST .
No matter what value I set a variable to , it returns a 0 .
What 's my problem ?
A1 : Faulty memory decoding or addressing is the most common cause for this error message .
This happens when RD / WR is affecting two ( or more ) active memory chips .
So , decode each CS very carefully !
A2 : Your address decoding might also indicate that there is more memory than really exists .
Go over your circuit design and inspect your wiring carefully .
Q : Can I use C for time critical code ?
A : The code produced by many of the excellent compilers today , is remarkably efficient - for both speed and size .
Modern compilers are quite adept at keeping track of register and variable usage .
Further optimization techiniques result in code that can be as good or better than hand written assembler .
Even for ISRs ( interrupt service routines ) , C should be acceptable for all but the most time critical routines .
Makes you think twice about breaking your head over assembly code .
Q : The Intel MCS - 51 assembly language defines alternate symbols AR0 ... AR7 for registers R0 ... R7 .
What is this good for ?
( Thanks to Wolfgang Heinz who submitted this Q & A ) A : Some 8051 instructions do not support all possible addressing modes .
For example , the PUSH and POP instructions are only available with direct addressing .
Since the registers R0 ... R7 are mapped into the internal memory , they must also have a DATA ( = direct ) address .
The special assembler symbols AR0 ... AR7 are simply the absolute DATA addresses of registers R0 ... R7 .
Although there is no instruction PUSH R5 with true register addressing , you can do it with PUSH AR5 ( = direct addressing ) !
Q : Usually the 8051 register banks are switched with the RS0 and RS1 bits in the status register PSW at runtime .
But how is it possible to switch the banks at assembly time with the USING instruction , implemented in so many 8051 assemblers ?
( Thanks to Wolfgang Heinz who submitted this Q & A ) A : Not at all !
This must ALWAYS be done with bits RS0 and RS1 at runtime .
The USING instruction switches only the absolute DATA addresses of the special assembler symbols AR0 ... AR7 according to the selected bank number .
With most assemblers that implement relocatable segments and object modules , the linker is forced to reserve space for the corresponding register bank in the internal memory .
Q : The Intel 8x151/8x251 wo n't " drop - in " for an 8051 .
What gives ?
( Thanks to Dave Baldwin of The Computer Journal for this one ) A : You need to use a programmer to set a couple bits to the correct state .
This info is hidden away in an app note available from their fax - back service .

4 ) 8051 PRODUCTS
This section includes descriptions and references to free and commercial software for the 8051 .
FTP sites and BBSs contain many quality packages and code samples for free .
For heavy duty use , you might prefer the many commercial packages that are available .
With the public domain ( or free ) stuff , you 're usually on your own .
The commercial packages usually provide extensive documentation and support .
4.1 ) Free languages and development tools
The following is a list of the languages and development tools that I could find on the net .
Nearly all of them include source code , however not all are public domain .

4.2 ) Free C compilers
There is finally a free C compiler for the 8051 .
The Retargetable Concurrent Small C ( RCSC ) compiler is featured in an article in the August 1997 Dr. Dobbs .
RCSC is downloadable from Dr. Dobb's at : http://www.ddj.com
ftp://ftp.mv.com/pub/
Several commercial C compilers have evaluation versions available .
These are not too useful ( even for hobbyist projects ) since they usually do n't include libraries .
However , they do afford the user the chance to inspect the quality of the code generated .
In most cases , it makes more sense to invest a bit , and get something serious .
Also , by buying a commercial package , you have the advantage of having the documentation , and being able to get technical support .
As Hershel Roberson says about the Dunfield package , " It is certainly worth the money .
It is probably 3 / 4 as good as compilers that cost 10 times as much ! "
There are three low - cost C compilers currently available for 8051 development : Dunfield Development Systems I 've been using the Dunfield Development System , and its really quite nice .
I 've also heard many good things about it from others .
For $ 100 you get a near ANSI - C compiler , run -time library with source , assembler , ROM debugger , integrated development environment , monitor with source , utilities , and other extras .
A high quality simulator for only $ 50 is also available separately .
The simulator has an option allowing you to interface to your target by using an on -chip monitor .
Although not freeware , the low price , the features , all of the extra goodies , and the good reviews make this a package worth looking at .
Also , if you 're interested in working on more than one family of microcontroller , Dunfield supports a wide range .
This means only needing to learn one system , instead of many .

Another low priced ( $ 100 ) C compiler comes from Micro Computer Control .
This package was unavailable for review , but according to the manufacturer , it features : Cross compilers running under DOS are available for the 8051 and the Z8 ( including Super - 8 ) .
This package includes a C compiler , assembler , linker , librarian , and extensive printed documentation .
A simulator / source code debugger is available for an additional $ 79.95 .
The simulator is completely configurable , so much so that you do n't even need the target hardware to test with .
You can configure all I/O and other features of your target chip or environment .

SPJ Systems C -31 is a new cross compiler from SPJ Systems .
The full package which costs $ 150 ( USD ) includes a C compiler ( ANSI compatible subset ) , assembler , source linker , and simulator ( source code debugger ) .
Compiler features include : support for floating point numbers , extensive collection of library routines , support for using Special Function Registers ( SFR ) , assembly language interface , peripheral keyword ( allows specifying an address of a standard peripheral ) .
The simulator allows source level debugging .
A few memory mapped hardware peripherals are simulated including an LCD display , 8279 keyboard processor , and an 8255 parallel port .
( SPJ also has a plain simulator available as a separate product for assembly / machine code debugging . )
A working demo of the compiler package , which includes the library sources and permits the compilation of small programs , is available from their web site .
This is a new package with a few rough edges , but it easy to use , has a decent price , and has good potential .
Check out the demo on their web site and see for yourselves .

Many firms ( large and small ) offer a variety of 8051 microcontroller variants , programming languages , support packages , and development systems .
No endorsement is implied by inclusion in this list .
I apologize to anyone I left out ;
It 's only because I did n't know about you .
If you want to be included in this list , just drop me a line - please .

Accused War Criminals Make Home in U.S.
What if somebody 's nightmare was your next - door neighbor ?
Feb. 19 , 2010  --
For many , mention of Somalia conjures images of a smoldering Blackhawk helicopter and AK - 47 - wielding pirates loaded onto an antique skiff .
What may not come to mind as quickly is the idea that the tipping point for Somalia 's downward spiral into an international no - go zone may have come decades before U.S. troops landed on a Somali beachfront in the mid 1990s .
It may have come during the regime of military dictator Siad Barre .
Barre and the men under him have been accused by the United Nations of committing horrific war crimes throughout the ' 70s , '80s and early '90s that the country is still reeling from .
Like citizens of other countries ravaged by brutal regimes , many refugees who survived Barre 's rule came to America to start over and live quietly among the population .
But shockingly , along with refugees and victims of war crimes , some alleged war criminals themselves have emigrated to the United States , escaping retribution for the monstrous acts they may have committed at home .
Men accused of human rights abuses from Somalia to Venezuela have laid their own claims to the American dream and now enjoy the same freedoms they 're accused of trying to take away from their own people .
It may seem impossible , but one of these men -- some allegedly responsible for mass murder , torture and the destruction of entire populations -- might literally be living next door .
Bashe Yousuf was one of the lucky ones .
He survived Barre 's notorious use of summary execution , rape , torture and imprisonment without trial to control what the dictator viewed as a dissident population in the northwest part of Somalia , today known as Somaliland .
Yousuf was a businessman in Hargeisa , the largest city in Somaliland .
The area was particularly targeted by the regime for destruction .
Along with his work in business , Yousuf said he was part of a group of community workers trying to clean up hospitals and obtain medical supplies .
Yousuf claims soldiers under the command of Barre 's minister of defense , Gen. Mohammed Samantar , arrested him after his group 's actions were deemed acts of political defiance .
" The government -- you know , took it as we were a political organization trying to challenge their power and put us all in jail , " Yousuf said in a recent interview with ABC News .
' The Worst Torture ... Is Isolation '
Yousuf said he was subjected to beatings , electric shocks and waterboarding .
Yet following what Yousuf said was months of torture , he was subjected to perhaps the worse form of punishment : six years of solitary confinement in a windowless cell .
" The worst torture that a person can take is isolation , " Yousuf said .
" Because you think so much , and the things that you think is the worst things that happened to you in all your life .
You never think about anything good .
All your nightmares haunt your every minute , every second . "
Yousuf said he would provoke the guards to drag him outside the cell to beat him , just for the opportunity to have a moment outside .
" Just to see the sky , and the stars , " he said .
Yousuf managed to survive those six years , and suddenly , as quickly as he had been arrested and thrown into jail , he said , he was released and pardoned .
By the time the Barre government collapsed in 1991 , throwing the country into deeper chaos , Yousuf was living in America as an American citizen working to forget his past , yet still haunted by nightmares of his ordeal .
" I wake up and sweat almost all night sometimes , " Yousuf said , " because I 'm scared . "
In 1998 , Yousuf 's nightmare came to life .
Mohamed Samantar , Somalia 's prime minister by that point , escaped the collapse of the Barre regime and eventually made his way into the Unites States .
Samantar settled in a split - level house in the Washington D.C. suburbs .
" I could n't believe it , that somebody who has done so much harm to so many people could be living in the United States , " Yousuf said .
Yousuf said Samantar was at the helm of the atrocities committed in Somaliland .
Samantar 's attorney , however , denied those claims , saying that Samantar was received in Washington while in office and was granted asylum in the United States in 1997 .
" He 's somebody who seems to be a wonderful family man , " said Julian Spirer , the attorney .
" He 's very much the sort of person you would want to have as a neighbor . "
Subject to U.S. Law ?
But Yousuf is n't buying it .
He , along with four other Somalis subjected to torture and human rights abuses , filed a civil suit with the Center for Justice and Accountability ( CJA ) against Samantar .
The suit seeks to hold the former general responsible for alleged abuses as the head of the Somali regimes ' military .
" The issue here is whether Gen . Samantar is held to be subject to U.S. laws while he 's living in this country , " said Pamela Merchant , executive director of the CJA .
According the Merchant , Samantar is one of possibly 1,000 alleged war criminals living here in the United States .
The CJA 's main mission is to hold the suspects responsible for the atrocities they are alleged to have committed in their foreign countries .
" I think the first time you realize that somebody 's living in your community that was responsible for serious human rights abuses , it can be shocking , " Merchant said .
According to his family , Samantar is gravely ill , but his legal team led by Spirer contends his innocence on the charges .
" There has n't been any proof yet .
At this point these are strictly allegations , " Spirer said .
Spirer said Samantar most likely was aware of the atrocities being committed in Somaliland , but there was very little he could do about them .
" Did he know that these were going on ? " Spirer asked .
" I expect he did know they were going on .
If the question is , could he do anything about them ?
There was probably a very limited amount that he could do . "
Merchant disagreed with that assumption .
" He was in charge of the military , " she said .
" He was the person who could stop it . "
But no matter what Samantar 's involvement may have been , a hard truth looms : Legally , it may not matter .
" We have a policy in this country , it 's actually established in law , that our courts are not available to prosecute or hold liable foreign officials for acts done in their official capacity , " Spirer said .
In 2007 a district judge ruled that Samantar had immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and dismissed CJA 's lawsuit .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturned that decision , ruling that the law only applies to foreign states , not individuals .
Samantar next appealed that decision to the Supreme Court , which could hand down a ruling in the early summer .
A major precedent could be set for trying officials -- including our own officials -- for war crimes .
For Yousuf , the case is about simple justice , and getting his day in court to confront a man he believes victimized so many .
" So many people died at the hands of this man , " Yousuf said .
" I want justice .
That is all . "
WHAT should you do if flight attendants wo n't examine your scrotum ?
Marcel Cote , a Canadian man , decided to sue .
Mr Cote 's lawsuit stemmed from a February 2008 incident during which flight attendants on Air Transat refused to look inside his pants .
The details make the litigious Mr Cote seem slightly more sympathetic — but only slightly .
The Toronto Sun reports :
The curious incident occurred February 15 , 2008 during a flight from Montreal to Puerto Vallarta , Mexico .
Marcel Cote was comfortably seated in business class an hour after takeoff when , for some unknown reason , he felt enough discomfort to make an emergency visit to the washroom , where he discovered spots of blood on his body .
In a panic , Cote asked for the help of a flight attendant , who quickly came to his side .
When the passenger noticed that the agent was female , he asked to be assisted by a male attendant because the bleeding seemed to be coming from his genital area .
When the male attendant came to him , Cote then asked to be closely examined so that the exact nature of the problem can be determined .
The employee declined , giving him absorbent paper instead .
Indignant and distressed , Cote quickly expressed his wish to see a doctor .
It turns out that Mr Cote had a ruptured vein , which was stitched up once he landed in Mexico .
( A friend sent him to the hospital in a taxi . )
Mr Cote argued that Air Transat should pay him $ 8,000 for his trouble , but a Canadian judge disagreed , and threw out the case .
The judge even made Mr Cote pay the airline 's court fees , putting him $ 189 further into the red .
While I do n't think Mr Cote was owed money for his ordeal , I am convinced that the flight crew could have been more helpful .
" Is there a doctor on board ? " announcements are a common feature of air travel — even for minor situations like airsick kids .
The judge was right that " it was not incumbent upon a flight attendant to conduct the medical examination of a passenger , a measure reserved for the medical profession . "
But while the flight attendants promised to " contact a physician if the illness was grave enough , " according to the Sun , that probably did n't make Mr Cote feel any better .
Checking to see if there was a doctor on board might have been a reasonable compromise .
A networking error has caused computers in Chile and the U.S. to come under the control of the Great Firewall of China , redirecting Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube users to Chinese servers .
Security experts are not sure exactly how this happened , but it appears that at least one ISP recently began fetching high - level DNS ( domain name server ) information from what 's known as a root DNS server , based in China .
That server , operated out of China by Swedish service provider Netnod , returned DNS information intended for Chinese users , effectively spreading China 's network censorship overseas .
China tightly controls access to a number of Web sites , using technology known colloquially as the Great Firewall of China .
The issue was reported Wednesday by Mauricio Ereche , a DNS admin with NIC Chile , who found that an unnamed local ISP reported that DNS queries for sites such as Facebook.com , Twitter.com and YouTube.com -- all of which have been blocked in China -- were being redirected to bogus addresses .
It is unclear how widespread the problem is .
Ereche reported getting the bogus information from three network access points in Chile , and one in California , but on Thursday he said that the problem was no longer popping up .
" The traces show us that we 're not hitting the server in China , " he wrote in a discussion group post .
This issue occurred because , for some reason , at least one outside ISP directed DNS requests to a root server based in China , networking experts say .
This is something that service providers outside of China should not do because it allows China 's censored network to " leak " outside of the country .
Researchers have long known that China has changed DNS routing information to redirect users of censored services to government - run servers instead of sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
But this is the first public disclosure that those routes have leaked outside of China , according to Rodney Joffe , a senior technologist with DNS services company Neustar .
" All of a sudden , the consequences are that people outside China may be subverted or redirected to servers inside China , " he said .
By using a China - based root server , ISPs are essentially giving China a way to control all of their users ' traffic over the network .
That could mean big security problems for people whose network accepted the leaked routes , Joffe said .
The ISP that used the bad routes probably misconfigured its BGP ( Border Gateway Protocol ) system , used to route information on the Internet , according to Danny McPherson , chief security officer with Arbor Networks .
" I do n't think it was done intentionally , " he said .
" This is an example of how easy it is for this information to be contaminated or corrupted or leaked out beyond the boundaries of what it was supposed to be . "
In February 2008 , BGP information from Pakistan -- which had just blocked YouTube -- was shared internationally , effectively knocking Google 's video site offline for millions of users .
In an e-mail message , Netnod CEO Kurt Erik Lindqvist said his company is not hosting the bad routes on its server .
They were most likely changed by machines somewhere on the Chinese network , McPherson said .
The incident shows that BGP remains a major weak link in the Internet , Joffe said .
" It 's really disconcerting form a security point of view and from a privacy point of view . "
This is the first time that this type of behavior has been made public , but it has apparently been going on for some time .
In a discussion group post on Wednesday , Nominet Researcher Roy Arends said that he has been studying this issue for a year .
Arends has compiled a list of 20 domain names that will trigger the kind of bad results , reported by Ereche .
Arends is keeping the names of those domains secret , but he did publish some of his data in his discussion post .
" I wanted to keep this internal , however , the cat is out of the bag now , " Arends wrote .
Jamie Oliver is launching a Food Revolution across America , one unhealthy Appalachian city at a time .
Jamie was n't satisfied by simply trying to improve the eating habits of people in England , so he hopped the pond and launched his very own American revolution at an elementary school in Huntington , West Virginia .
His journey has n't been easy , folks .
So far , he 's had to deal with a curmudgeonly radio DJ , an especially jaded lunch lady , and the emotional burial of a perfectly functional deep fryer .
And all that before the pizza breakfast was even served !
The horror !
If we learned anything on tonight 's episode , it 's that people in West Virginia love two things : funny haircuts , and chicken nuggets , both of which can be detrimental to the human body in large quantities .
Jamie thought if he showed the kids how chicken nuggets were made , they would n't want to eat them anymore .
So , he did what any of us would have done — grabbed a knife and started hacking at an old chicken carcass like Michael Myers after enrolling in summer classes at Le Cordon Bleu .
resembled a tomato sauce I once saw Sandra Lee whip up on an episode of Semi-Homemade .
Thinking his job had been done , Jamie smugly asked , " okay now , who would still eat this ? "
One by one , the kids all raised their hands .
They still wanted the nuggets , ultimately making his experiment a total fail .
resembled a tomato sauce I once saw Sandra Lee whip up on an episode of Semi-Homemade .
Thinking his job had been done , Jamie smugly asked , " okay now , who would still eat this ? "
One by one , the kids all raised their hands .
They still wanted the nuggets , ultimately making his experiment a total fail .
In the most emotional scene of the night ( it is ABC , after all ) , Jamie met up with a bunch of first graders who could n't identify a tomato or a potato .
Jamie suddenly started to cry .
I was n't sure if it was because the kids could n't discern broccoli from cauliflower , or because he just realized he was running out of flowers to name his daughters after .
Saddened by the incident with the first graders and still licking the wounds from his earlier nugget defeat , Jamie decided to dress up like a pea in a desperate attempt to get the kids excited about the healthy lunch they'd be served later that day .
As it turned out , the children still did n't eat their veggies .
But on the up side , they 'll all be able to check " witness grown man actin ' a fool " off of their bucket lists .
All jokes aside , Jamie seemed genuinely passionate about introducing healthier eating options to a city that 's clearly in desperate need of help ( after all , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did just label Huntington the nation 's unhealthiest city ) .
It 's hard to tell what resistance was real and what was edited in for ratings , but the local DJ and the lunch lady came across as unnecessarily rude to him .
They need to check their bad attitudes at the door , because this is the first generation of children that may actually have a life expectancy shorter than that of their parents .
And that 's not something that should be scoffed at .
Stay tuned next week , when Jamie takes on the older crew at Huntington High School !
Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'm off to throw away all of the chicken nuggets in my freezer .

Are we sex addicts , or just terrible people ?
Are our obese children going to live into adulthood , or are we just terrible people ?
Are those eyelashes real , or are you a terrible person ?
Science has answers .
Bad answers .
Sex addiction : a real psychological disorder , or just something David Duchovny says , for fun ?
It 's a question that 's divided psychiatrists and health professionals ever since the first psychiatrist used it as an excuse for having an affair .
" Patterns of extreme sexual acting out are described variously by therapists as an addiction , as a type of obsessive - compulsive disorder or as a symptom of another psychiatric illness , such as depression . "
Thanks for nothing , therapists .
New research indicates that obesity in children as young as three can lead to heart disease later in life .
Also , minorities are at a higher risk of childhood obesity .
But there is hope : " Researchers found an almost 40 % lower prevalence of obesity among 4 - year - olds who had regular family dinners at least six times a week , slept a minimum of 10.5 hours each weeknight and watched no more than two hours of television or videos every weekday . "
In the future , only white shut -ins with sleeping sickness will avoid fat - related heart attack deaths at 25 .

Elm Grove , near Milwaukee , Wisconsin
Other customers stare as Nik Clark and Kim Garny do their weekly shop at a large upscale supermarket .
It 's hardy a surprise as a TV camera is trailing behind their trolley .
But people would do a double - take even if the BBC were n't in tow .
In some ways Nick wants them to look .
There 's a revolver amid the ravioli , an automatic among the avocados .
Like cowboys out of Westerns , the couple carry handguns on holsters on their hips .
She has a Smith and Wesson .38 special with a cute pink grip that makes it look almost like a toy .
He has a rather more chunky Glock .
Wisconsin Open Carry .
Groups like this have been springing up all over the States in the last year and they 've been making an impact in the last week or so , getting Starbucks in California to agree people should be allowed into their coffee shops carrying guns .
The groups are made up of people who want to make a point about the Second Amendment right in the Constitution to bear arms , by bearing them openly .
Some want to make a point and test whether or not private firms like shops and restaurants recognise that right .
The movement is slightly different in the state of Wisconsin where concealed guns are banned .
Nick says wearing a gun in a visible holster is the only way he can carry a weapon legally and he wants others to be aware of their rights : he does n't want to confront but to convert .
" You have a right to self defence and open carry is a great deterrent .
It 's about personal protection , " he says .
He 's a beefy guy , with bulging muscles , so I ask :
Is n't he rather intimidating when he 's armed as well ?
" I 've been open carrying for about a year and most people do n't notice , or some might make a comment .
It 's a demonstration I am a law - abiding citizen , you have nothing to hide .
Criminals never open carry . "
He says that his group respects property rights and if a shop does n't want their custom and they are asked to leave they are happy to do so : they do n't want to patronise that business .
But he says most big companies know the law and have a policy that allows them to shop armed .
Kim says for her it is all about self protection : " I can guarantee if I am going to my car late at night and someone sees me carrying a gun they wo n't make me a victim . "
But Nick says he is also making a point : " I want people to see me and have a level of comfort , to know that if they are out walking their dog it is OK to carry a gun , if they are walking to their car after work it is legal to carry a firearm . "
When Obama was elected many gun enthusiasts expected the tightening of laws .
Many of those in favour of controls expected Obama to increase regulation .
As a senator he had always been in favour of restrictions on guns .
But it seems thing are rather going the other way .
Last year a ban on carrying concealed weapons in national parks was lifted .
In Virginia politicians are likely to change the law and allow people to buy more than one hand gun a month .
The supreme court is pondering whether to declare the 28 - year ban on handguns in Chicago unconstitutional .
They will take months before coming to a decision but observers who 've watched the case carefully believe they will rule against the ban , with huge implications all around the states .
In Wisconsin , Open Carry is taking legal action against the rule that bans handguns within a quarter of a mile of schools .
The supreme court judgement could have a bearing on that .
Still , when I meet around 30 people from Wisconsin Open Carry over lunch at a big restaurant there is a feeling that their rights need protecting .
There are grandparents and mums and little children , and all the adults are armed .
Most tell me that this is mainly about protection but what they refer to as civil rights comes a close second .
A couple of people tell me it is the other way around : the politics comes first .
One man , whose name I do n't catch , says he does n't feel very threatened in suburban Wisconsin but it is about resisting the encroachment of the last two administrations , it 's about not giving in to big government .
Matt Slavic , sitting next to his little granddaughter , observes that outside the United Nations is a sculpture of a gun , its barrel twisted in a knot .
" The Second Amendment gives teeth to the rest of the constitution , it keeps tyranny at bay .
I do feel it is under threat , not just from within the USA but from the UN - their small arms treaty would restrict hand gun ownership in the United States . "
Several people tell me the Second Amendment , the right to bear arms , underpins the first , freedom of speech .
One of those eating with a gun at their side , John Laimon , goes further : " It 's not about guns , it 's about civil rights .
It 's growing because of the plain fear about inadequate politicians .
They cut down guns but they 've got bodyguards .
Our rights are under fire . "

We should have seen the demons in Andy about the time he pulled out his night - vision monocular and crawled under my house .
Instead we just stood around in the dark .
That was seven years ago .
Andy Kubik had recently returned from Iraq and dropped by for lunch because a mutual friend thought we might get along .
Stationed at an Air Force base nearby , he rumbled into my small Alabama town on an enormous black Harley , like Thor returning from war .
Even before everything that followed , even before the cracks started to show , Andy seemed like a man formed from two conflicting types of clay : the heroic and the vulnerable .
The godlike and the human .
He removed his helmet and goggles , revealing his curled blond hair , and transformed into something smaller and quieter , apologizing for the noise before he dismounted .
After lunch that day , Andy spent three nights on our sofa , which spooked my wife .
Relax , I told her .
This guy 's a war hero .
One of the greatest alive , maybe .
Andy worked for the Air Force as a sort of supersoldier .
He had fought in covert operations and killed bad men in scores , and according to the Air Force itself , Andy 's actions in Afghanistan – his personal actions – " were overwhelmingly responsible for breaking the back of Taliban resistance . "
So if the guy needed to crash , he could certainly use our couch .
I pestered him for details about his life overseas – had he worked alone ?
in a team ?
– but Andy showed far more interest in the mundane details of our lives .
The make of our daughter 's crib , the maddening sound of a stray cat mewing under the house , the history of our little town .
" My wife would love this , " he said one day , sitting in the kitchen .
I had n't known he was married .
Conversation drifted with Andy .
From backpacks to foreign policy to photography .
Books , movies .
" My son loves that one , " he said .
I had n't realized he had a son .
" You may be wondering about this scar on my face , " he said one afternoon .
We had n't noticed , we said .
" Right here , " he said , touching the left corner of his mouth , where his lips met with a certain indistinctness , as though someone had erased and redrawn the line .
" It 's no big deal , " he said .
One day Andy pulled out a small rucksack .
" I want to show you something , " he said .
He dug around for a moment , then found photos from Afghanistan , shots of the dozen or so Special Forces and British SAS operators who made up his team .
He talked a bit about what happened there , mostly funny stories about surviving Afghan food .
I remember the watchful way he laughed ; he never closed his eyes or looked away .
Later , after dark , Andy and I sat on the porch , and he showed me his night - vision monocular and something he called an infrared pointer .
I had n't realized the military let people carry these things around back home in America .
While my neighbors slept , Andy 's laser danced over their roofs .
Beneath the house the stray cat wailed .
I hissed something about waking the baby and threw a lump of grass into the dark crawl space .
Andy frowned and flicked on the monocular .
I remember how funny that seemed at the time .
How cool .
The warrior , the thunder god , stooping to combat a stray cat after enduring years of real war .
Soon enough , though , we 'd see that the war was n't done with Andy .
–
A few months after his first visit , Andy showed up at our house again .
" I want you to hold on to something for me , " he said .
He would soon leave the Air Force , he said , and head to West Virginia .
He had a plan but would n't elaborate .
I understood ; being Andy 's friend meant accepting redacted conversations .
He lived in a classified world .
He hauled out an opaque plastic box , about the size of a suitcase .
" I 'll send for it later , " he said , " but I know you 'll keep it safe . "
Sure ,
Andy , I said .
I 'll keep it safe .
Later that night I lay awake and wondered :
What on Earth is in that box ?
To understand Andy – to understand what comes later – you 've got to first understand what he did .
During wartime , when the U.S. secretary of defense goes before the American people and wants to present a clear idea of our supremacy , of our precision , of our ability to project power from the West onto our enemies abroad , he 'll sometimes show a video clip .
It 's usually taken from a plane or unmanned drone and shows a missile hitting some impossibly small target .
A moving car , maybe .
A rooftop chimney .
Some Taliban fighter riding his horse through a mountain pass .
What you do n't see in those videos is the real conductor of the action .
There 's often a man hidden across the street or on the mountainside , tracking the car or chimney or horse with an infrared pointer – kind of a high - tech version of a laser pen – to help guide the missile .
He 's called a combat controller , and his job in the Air Force is to link the cleanness and geometry of the sky with the bloodiness and disorder on the ground .
It 's his job to parachute , sprint , spy , shoot , evade capture , and dodge bombs , all while running a stream of mathematic calculations in his mind and maintaining an even tone of voice over his radio .
It may be the most nerve - racking , dangerous job in the world .
And Andy Kubik excelled at it .
His first true test came in May 1999 .
At the time NATO forces were seeking to end Serbian aggression toward Albanians in Kosovo .
One night an American pilot was flying his F - 16 over Serbia to bomb a missile installation when an enemy missile exploded near the plane and sent it spiraling down into hostile territory .
The pilot parachuted out , scrambled into the brush , and called in his dire situation : Serbian forces were searching for him , and they had dogs .
Back across the border in Bosnia , Andy and his small rescue team piled into three helicopters and launched toward the downed pilot , flying without lights , using night - vision equipment .
Soon after liftoff three surface - to - air missiles corkscrewed past the nose of the chopper , like " flaming telephone poles , " Andy said .
As the team crested a ridge , they passed over a dark village that suddenly awoke with muzzle flashes .
The helicopter that Andy was in swung and rolled to avoid the fire , with Andy kneeling at the open door as bullets thunked into the bottom and sides of the craft .
The helicopter touched down in a clearing , and the F - 16 pilot burst out of his hiding place in the tree line and sprinted toward it .
As Andy leaped out , enemy gunfire erupted , and Serbian soldiers – closer than the Americans had realized – swarmed the site .
The rescue team , bristling with assault weapons and adrenaline , heaved the pilot onto the chopper 's floor .
As they lifted off again , Andy and two other soldiers lay across the jet pilot to shield him from incoming bullets .
An hour later the helicopter reached the Bosnian border just as the sun rose , and warmth splashed in through the open doors .
It was the sort of harrowing , high - speed mission that most normal soldiers rarely face .
But for Andy it was only a prelude .
He grew up in Harbor Beach , a small town at the edge of Lake Huron in Michigan , and he navigated a hazardous childhood .
At four years old , he climbed behind the family sofa without anyone noticing .
He pulled an extension cord from a lamp , put the plug into his mouth , and bit down .
The plug blew a hole through the side of his face ; you could see his teeth through his cheek .
Later he would wonder whether the shock had electrified his brain as well .
He started kindergarten as the boy with the burn on his face .
A prominent scar remained for years , through some of early life 's already difficult moments – playground negotiations , meeting girls , class pictures – until he had his final surgery at 14 , which reduced the mark to a thin line near his mouth .
" He was self - conscious about it , " his mother , Kathleen , told me later .
" I think especially around girls . "
For a while after the electrical - cord accident , Andy 's childhood passed in the typical way .
He played sports , but not particularly well .
He earned average grades .
He played with his friend Gautam and Gautam 's little brother , Vivek , who lived across the creek that ran through their neighborhood .
They were his sworn brothers , and he even traveled with their family on a trip to the father 's native India .
They , along with Andy 's younger brother and sister , became inseparable and ruled their neighborhood from a secret underground fort .
One day in September 1986 , when Andy was 13 , heavy rain turned the creek into a raging river , and the makeshift bridge was uncrossable .
The children walked farther down to the mouth of the creek , which emptied into Lake Huron , and Andy waded into the water to cross it .
The heaviness of the current surprised him , and he rode it like a waterslide , laughing .
The other children followed , and soon the current swept three of them – Andy , Vivek , and Gautam – into the cold Huron .
They swam against the flow , treading with thin legs , but it swirled away from the shore and separated the boys .
Gautam and Vivek both cried out for help from their bigger friend – " Andy ! " they called – and he paddled between them as all three drifted into deeper water .
Neighbors on the distant shore heard their screams and shoved a rowboat into the water .
A siren wailed somewhere in town .
The swollen creek spewed milk jugs and driftwood and litter , and amid the trash the boys rode the current toward the lake 's uninterrupted horizon .
Andy and Gautam were strong enough to keep their faces above the water as the rescue boat approached .
But eight - year - old Vivek slipped under several times , and then one last time as Andy reached for him in vain .
By the time the boat pulled Andy and Gautam from the water , Vivek had disappeared .
For the next several hours ,
Andy stood on the shore wrapped in a blanket as rescue workers continued to search .
Then he watched as a man walked up from the waterline with Vivek 's small and lifeless body draped across his arms , and no matter what the adults around him said , Andy knew better : I did this .
In the years that followed , he became fascinated with codes of power and protection .
He took a keen interest in the loyalties of Mafia families and Japanese Bushido , and then , as he got older , the brotherhood of modern small special ops military teams .
At 18 he joined the Air Force and tried out for the arduous , specialized combat controller program .
There are only 400 combat controllers in all the Air Force , and they employ every skill from HALO ( high - altitude , low - opening ) parachuting to underwater sabotage .
They are among the most expensive soldiers produced by the American military .
At the bottom of an Olympic - size pool at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas , Andy Kubik found what he needed .
As he and other hopeful candidates tried to crawl across the pool 's floor , instructors called " sharks " held them down , punched their kidneys , cut free their weight belts , and dared them to drown .
An instructor ripped off Andy 's face mask and chopped his neck so that Andy 's breath billowed around his face , escaping to the surface .
Blinded and stunned , he lay still on the bottom .
As other candidates gave up to instinct and surfaced , Andy relented to the sensation of drowning .
The perfect penance of the moment approached : So , Viv , this is what it felt like .
Eventually the instructor released him , and Andy crawled with his fingertips toward the opposite wall .
He emerged from the water reborn , with a new set of sworn brothers and a lifelong pain now hardened into loyalty .
One day in late 2003 , not long before he left the Air Force , Andy invited me into a restricted area on Hurlburt Field in Florida , where his elite squad lived .
He introduced me to his colleagues – including one man who has asked to be identified only as " Y , " and whose significance would later become clear – and showed off his team 's astonishing array of weaponry and technology .
It all looked so impressive that I laughed when I saw several miniature black off - road motorcycles parked around the staging area .
They looked like toys .
Then Andy told me their purpose :
He and his teammates would strap parachutes onto them , push them out of airplanes at sometimes high altitude , then jump after them .
On the desert floor the men would ditch their jump gear , mount the small bikes , and ride into the mountains .
Over the next two days , I would get a glimpse of who Andy really was .
That first night his team joined a visiting group of foreign soldiers for the special ops version of an international trade conference .
They all loaded into two Pave Low search - and - rescue helicopters , an AC - 130 gunship , and a couple of trucks , then charged over the countryside toward an abandoned building .
Once there they rappelled from the hovering helicopters , charged into the structure , and rescued a mock captured soldier .
The team sprayed bullets – live ones , not blanks – as they stormed in darkness onto the roof , where invisible helicopters descended and cut the air into buffeting layers .
I scrambled to keep up ;
Andy handed me his night - vision goggles , and for a moment I saw a rarefied world of activity : aircraft , weapons , soldiers , all waging war in an artificial daylight .
The next night in Florida , the soldiers withdrew to a nearby hotel , where they had reserved a block of rooms .
Andy waved me toward an empty one , where someone had set up a mobile video monitor .
" Wanted you to see this , " he said .
He cued a video , then left the room .
On the screen a scene flickered into view : a man , alone and facing the camera , inside a wind - whipped tent somewhere near Afghanistan .
The man wore a long beard over hollow cheeks , and his eyes burned like cave fires , deep in their sockets .
I looked more closely : Andy ?
A sharp voice from outside the frame announced that the following was an intelligence debriefing .
The questioner then hustled Andy through an account of recent clashes with Al Qaeda .
Something significant had happened , but the acronyms and obscurities piled up so fast I could n't keep pace .
They talked about technology , largely , and cooperation between the military and the " OGA " – Other Government Agency , as the CIA was sometimes called in Afghanistan .
The video stopped and I sat , bewildered .
I hardly recognized the man on the screen .
The Andy I knew was amiably distracted , always drifting , sometimes rambling .
The Andy onscreen – the bearded , wolfish one – was as bright and focused as the infrared pointer in his rucksack .
What exactly had happened over there ?
One morning in 2001 , Andy awoke at his home in Florida to a thought fully formed : " The 15th anniversary of Vivek 's death . "
He climbed to his feet and made his bed .
" Same memories , every September 11 . "
He made a cup of coffee and turned on his television , where he saw the horror of the day unfold .
The second plane 's appearance heralded , even in the instant between impact and fireball , Andy 's new covert mission .
He and his wife , Tina , immediately geared up for rapid deployment .
She worked for the Air Force as a kind of advance procurement officer , heading out with a teammate and a suitcase full of cash to set up an overseas launch site for men like Andy .
Within a few days , she would enter an electronics store in Oman and announce , " I need to buy your batteries .
All of them . "
As the Twin Towers smoldered on the family 's television , Tina packed her bags .
The day she left ,
Andy turned to see their five - year - old son , Travis , standing at the hallway door .
He had gone to his bedroom and put on an army helmet and backpack , and in his hand he held a small American flag .
Andy snapped a photo , a single frame that captured all that would propel him through the next few years .
He waved goodbye to Tina , and her parents picked up Travis for safekeeping .
Andy retreated alone into the house , sank to the floor , and wept .
Two months later Andy hit the ground in southern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border , attached to a 12 - man Special Forces team called Texas 17 .
A helicopter dropped the soldiers into the mountains where they linked with three CIA officers , took account of themselves , and realized the challenge before them .
They faced what was surely the hardest job in the world : to approach and take the city of Kandahar , the Taliban 's stronghold where Al Qaeda now massed .
Unlike in the north , where the indigenous Northern Alliance had battled the Taliban for years , in the south the team would have to create a fighting force from scratch as they ran full tilt toward their target .
Along the way they would escort and protect Afghan warlord Gul Agha Sherzai .
Meanwhile Andy 's counterpart – the man I have to call " Y " – entered Afghanistan with a team named Texas 12 on the northern side of Kandahar .
Their job was to escort exiled leader Hamid Karzai , already identified by the U.S. as a key potential ally , into the city .
According to the plan , the two teams would converge on Kandahar , Andy 's from the southeast and Y's from the north , and oust Osama bin Laden and the Taliban 's one - eyed supreme leader , Mullah Mohammed Omar .
Then they would install Sherzai as governor of Kandahar and pave the way for Karzai to become president of Afghanistan .
On its first day in country , Texas 17 set out across the desert for Kandahar , stopping in small villages along the way to pick up any sympathetic young men to gather an ad hoc army .
The night and second day passed the same way , as the team assembled a sort of rolling circus : a hundred or so pickup trucks , motorcycles , tractors , and Central Asian " jingle trucks " decorated with bells , mirrors , and rugs .
The Special Forces captain formed the impromptu troops into a V - shaped convoy so they could race across the desert without suffocating on dust .
But the Americans faced two larger problems : how to arm the group and how to secure Sherzai 's trust .
A cache of weapons falling from the sky would do both .
On the team 's fourth night in the field , Andy helped arrange an air drop into a hidden , narrow valley secured on three sides by a horseshoe of steep mountains .
As the team prepared for the drop , one of their Afghan fighters approached with a finger to his lips and whispered , " Taliban . "
A crowd of Afghans parted , and Andy saw three men tied together and sitting on the ground .
He and the captain quickly reeled back , not wanting to be seen .
But one Taliban man looked up and made eye contact ; he wore black makeup smeared under each eye , and Andy felt a powerful sense of foreboding .
At the same time , an F - 16 pilot radioed something about a nine - vehicle convoy quickly approaching .
Before the team could make sense of all this , the mountains around them erupted with gunfire from the convoy .
Mullah Omar 's forces had set an ambush .
Bullets and rocket - propelled grenades poured onto the valley floor as Andy leaped into the backseat of a truck , calling for air support and swiftly realizing that the batteries had died in his radio .
He could n't get word out .
The valley was too narrow to turn around in , so the trucks shifted into reverse as .51 - caliber anti-aircraft fire rained down in sheets .
Their only hope of getting out alive depended on quickly summoning air support to take out the enemy on the ridge .
With no time to replace the batteries and call in coordinates for a bombing run , Andy reached for his flare gun and fired a signal light out of the truck and onto the mountaintop .
The F - 16 streaked past , and seconds later a cluster bomb frothed the summit .
The military designates such strikes as " danger close " : so close that troops risk death by friendly fire .
Even the pro-American
Afghans screamed , crying out to Andy for mercy , because they had never seen nor felt such power , so near and so almighty .
Eventually the mountains fell quiet , but another F - 16 pilot warned that a second convoy was approaching from the north , and this one numbered 35 vehicles .
Andy grabbed his infrared pointer and night - vision scope , and with an Afghan lieutenant , he climbed the mountain they had just scorched .
By then the vehicles had arrived and started turning out their headlights to blend into the night .
" They 've joined your convoy , " the pilot said .
For another two hours ,
Andy stayed hidden on the mountaintop , passing his goggles to the Afghan leader so he could identify the unknown vehicles and men , then paint them with his infrared pointer until bombs arrived to blow them apart .
He killed scores that night .
At daybreak Texas 17 pushed onward to Kandahar .
Adrenaline coursed through Andy 's veins and bathed his brain .
He stayed awake , fighting without rest , for the next four days .
As Texas 17 fought their way to the city from the south , Y and his team to the north , Texas 12 , suffered a disastrous mistake .
A member of Y's group programmed his GPS unit with coordinates for a bomb strike .
After Y turned in for a few hours ' sleep , the teammate replaced the GPS 's battery as a matter of caution .
He did n't know that when the GPS shuts down , it automatically resets to new coordinates : its current location .
So when he turned it on and called in bombs that morning , he called for an attack on Texas 12's own position .
Eight people , including three Americans , died in the blast .
They were the first three American soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
Hamid Karzai survived after being knocked unconscious , and Y was injured badly enough that he had to be evacuated .
Andy 's subsequent advancement on Kandahar – clearing the way for both the city 's governor and Afghanistan 's future president – required a shocking sort of courage .
His tiny team took Tarnak Farms , the Al Qaeda training ground featured in the group 's propaganda videos and where it 's believed September 11 ringleader Mohammed Atta recorded his final testament .
The team sacked Kandahar , drove Mullah Omar from his palace , and cleared the airport so that American forces could establish a base there in coming days .
On top of the airport control tower , a member of the unit dipped a broom in black paint and wrote texas 17 to mark that they'd been there – an inside joke for special ops colleagues back home , who would later watch hundreds of soldiers " take " the airport on television .
" More than 200 Marines have set up a forward base , known as Texas 17 , at the airport , " a British newspaper later relayed , misunderstanding the signal , " which was the scene of the last stand in Kandahar of the foreign Taliban fighters believed to be loyal to Osama bin Laden . "
The world never learned what had really happened – the bravery of Andy and his small team in seizing the key city – but quietly , a couple of years later in a hangar in Florida , then Secretary of the Air Force James Roche awarded Andy with the Silver Star and described his actions as being responsible for breaking the Taliban .
And he had done it all without suffering any apparent injury .
andy 's first encounter with his demons came in late 2003 .
He 'd returned from war and found that while home seemed the same , he had changed .
He rode entire nights on his motorcycle , 16 hours at a time , and found that only by keeping the throttle wide open could he stay focused on the present moment and stave off the onslaught of memories .
His family crumbled around him – the strain of military life and Andy 's darkened mind - set had driven Tina to move out and take Travis with her – and Andy flung himself ever faster through the night .
In a library in Baghdad , Andy had come across a book by T.E. Lawrence and felt an immediate kinship .
Lawrence himself killed many men during the First World War and later died with his motorcycle 's throttle wide open .
" In speed we hurl ourselves beyond the body .
Our bodies cannot scale the heavens except in a fume of petrol , " Lawrence wrote .
" Bones , blood , flesh , all pressed inward together . "
Andy drew his last Air Force paycheck in January 2004 , but he had no desire to settle down and get a regular job .
Some of his colleagues had joined the CIA , but the agency initially rebuffed Andy .
In a bid to make himself more attractive , he decided to enter a master 's program in national security at Georgetown University .
But first he needed to finish his bachelor 's degree , and at school in West Virginia he saw a young Middle Eastern couple .
She was Iranian , he was Pakistani , and Andy became convinced they were watching him .
" I saw them sweep me , " he told me .
" I was like , ' Fuck .
They 're in West Virginia . ' "
The two halves of Andy 's brain wrestled for control , teetering toward insanity and back again .
" I gotta live with these people , " he said , laughing at his own paranoia .
" I ca n't just become a white supremacist . "
But then something would tilt his mind again .
At school one day , he spotted two teenagers breaking into his car .
He felt sure they had stolen the paper he'd been working on that spelled out how to improve international joint special operations .
In Andy 's mind , they had n't simply broken into his car ; they were agents who had violated national security .
He gave chase but the kids split up , and the one he nabbed was empty - handed .
Over the next couple of years ,
Andy spiraled out of control .
He flunked out of school in 2004 .
His divorce became finalized shortly after that .
He picked up jobs in landscaping and construction but was fired from both .
And in December 2004 he was hospitalized for the first time , for a month , because of his deteriorating mental state .
Andy had developed an obsession with the CIA .
He felt his experience in Afghanistan had given him invaluable insight – inexpressible , secret " solutions " – that the CIA needed to implement .
Solutions that would give the West an advantage against terrorists everywhere .
He mixed real and imaginary , practical and abstract , to create nonsensical theories that baffled his relatives and friends .
Most of us think of military intelligence as a collection of information , but Andy had used it as a dirt - covered , hands - on tool .
He had seen the miscommunications , the interagency misfires , the wasted opportunities , and from that he spun new ways to kill bad guys – everything from agency hierarchy to helicopter attack formations to filing a patent for a body - mounted remote - controlled spy drone .
He called one day in the summer of 2007 .
" Do you remember us talking about the OGA ? " he asked .
I did .
" Well , " he said , " you 're sending me signals about that , right ? "
I stood on the front porch in my socks and wondered what to say .
" Like , guiding me , " he said .
" Right ? "
For years now I had guarded Andy 's mysterious box .
I had dragged it from house to house , from state to state , every time we moved .
Finally I decided to look in it .
It held the tailings of a life now falling apart : a layer of sand from Afghanistan .
Various Arabic headdresses .
Several sheets of Mullah Omar 's personal stationery , which Andy had grabbed after overrunning his palace in Kandahar .
A photo Andy 's wife had given him to carry of her in lingerie .
Drawings Travis had sent .
And two little leather cases that held his now forgotten Bronze Star for bravery in Serbia and his Silver Star for " gallantry and devotion to duty " in Afghanistan .
No , I said , I was n't sending any signals .
" Cool , " he said .
" Just wondering . "
Then he said goodbye .
One day a few years ago , he traveled to Ohio to watch his son play hockey .
At the time Tina still allowed Andy to spend time alone with the boy .
The day of the first game , Andy and Travis sat together eating lunch , and Andy felt a growing sense that someone planned to assassinate Travis .
" Give me your hamburger , " he said , shoving his club sandwich across the table .
" You eat mine . "
At a game the next day , Andy noticed the local newspaper photographer on the arena floor .
Sure that the man was surveilling Travis , Andy snatched his camera cleanly and hid it in a locker room .
Someone called the police , and as they arrived Andy tried to escape .
In the process he broke a window and slugged an officer .
The police shot him with a Taser and found a weapon of sorts hidden under his jacket :
At the hotel where he was staying , he had taken a corded phone from the wall – something he could swing like a medieval flail – and wrapped it around his waist .
Andy would land in jail two times over the next few years for incidents stemming from his paranoia .
His training made him dangerous .
One time , for instance , his guards discovered he had covertly mapped the jail and stashed a pen in his cell as a weapon .
Several times
Andy ended up in hospitals , where doctors tried round after round of medicines in vain .
His hypervigilance and paranoia were " horrific , frustrating , fearful , helpless , " according to his mother .
" The inability to go into his world and bring him out …
To see the anger in his eyes or , at times , the blank stare . "
The only thing that seemed to work , Andy discovered , was cough syrup with dextromethorphan .
It disgusted him , and the taste sometimes made him vomit .
But Afghanistan had exploded his psyche like a fragmentation grenade , and cough syrup , he told me at one point , " slows everything down and defrags my memories . "
In the span of an hour or two , he once drank three full bottles .
–
In February 2009 , Andy launched one final mission .
Dearborn , Michigan , just outside Detroit , is home to one of America 's largest Arab communities , and Andy decided to travel there and advise the authorities on his solutions .
He envisioned coordinating and building a super - intelligence unit headquartered in the suburb – among America 's Muslims , instead of its politicians and lobbyists – with no other purpose than to hunt Al Qaeda .
Before he deployed , he met his mother at a small restaurant .
At first he refused to speak aloud , and instead passed her a note that said simply , SIXTEEN AGENCIES .
DEARBORN .
And she knew , as she watched him walk away , that her son might not survive this time .
Later , driving back to his apartment in Ohio , Andy felt sure someone was following him .
He took an evasive route .
Inside his apartment something seemed amiss .
Jazz music leaked from his radio .
Someone has been here .
He stuffed cash and clothes into a rucksack and fled to a friend 's house .
A solid guy , a retired Air Force guy , who could give him a place to hide out .
But there was no one home , so Andy slipped through the open back door and waited in the living room .
Then he heard it again : jazz music , from the same radio station .
Dear God .
Andy stole his friend 's old Mercury station wagon and launched toward Michigan .
He stashed the car at the Detroit Metro Airport , in the short - term parking lot , and hailed a taxi to take him into downtown Detroit .
He eyed the driver when he pulled into a substance - abuse clinic in suburban Franklin instead , possibly sensing Andy 's troubles .
This made
Andy even more paranoid :
What does this driver know ?
Where is he from ?
Andy threw a hundred - dollar bill over the seat and walked into the clinic , to appease the watchful taxi driver .
He grabbed the clinic 's phone and dialed 1-800 - FUCK - OFF .
Did these people really think they could corner him so easily ?
He slipped out of the clinic and ditched his rucksack in a trash can , saving some cash and his military identification card .
He crept into a nearby racquetball club and in the locker room grabbed a duffel bag full of clothes .
He then entered a golf - equipment store and within about 20 seconds emerged with a stolen jacket and a set of keys .
He pressed the key 's panic button , and a Dodge Charger lit up down the block .
He climbed in , then noticed a baby seat strapped into the back .
Ca n't take this one .
Ca n't involve children in war .
He walked to a store where construction was being done on the roof , and he found a set of keys and a dog in the crew 's work van .
He let the dog out , fired up the van , and took off as the men yelled from the roof .
He drove about an hour , evading his enemies until the van started to sputter .
He parked it in an industrial park and set out on foot , walking for hours through wooded areas , moving parallel to an expressway , and watching for signs of surveillance .
He slogged through creeks ; the sun had set hours before , and temperatures dropped to about 20 degrees .
He ignored the pain of the cold and changed into the clothes he had stolen .
He came across a concrete - making company and squeezed inside its gate , where he found an old snow - covered Chevy Blazer with the keys inside .
He pulled a knife from his pocket and cut his military ID into pieces , then pulled out a driver 's license he found in the pocket of the jacket from the golf store , transforming himself into respectable citizen Ray Lawson , of Rochester , Michigan .
By now it was night ; the lights on the Blazer did n't work and the door would n't stay shut , but he drove it until it died too , then hid it behind a local bar .
As he climbed out of it , a piece of exposed metal tore one leg of his wet blue jeans from his buttocks to his ankle .
Dangerous cold .
But Andy 's training from survival school stayed with him : Keep moving forward .
Police stopped him as he walked down a frozen road and asked for identification .
" Where have you been tonight , Mr. Lawson ? " one of the officers asked .
" Down at the bar with buddies , " Andy said , chuckling .
" Could you guys give me a lift home ? "
They called him a taxi instead , and as the sun came up Andy had the driver let him off in a nice golf - course community .
Then he followed a woman into a nearby construction office , pulled her keys from her purse when she was n't looking , and wheeled away in her black Jeep .
He needed to find a safe place , and fast .
He decided to make his way to his mother 's lake house , but along the way he drifted to sleep at the wheel and almost forced another car off the road .
Gotta stop .
He pulled over .
Gotta rest .
Police found him passed out on the wrong side of the road .
Breaking and entering .
Interstate grand larceny .
Identity fraud .
Trespassing .
Credit card theft .
The list went on .
The prosecutor and judge took one look at Andy and realized something in him had gone wrong .
There 's a catch - 22 in the system , though :
The judge could n't just release Andy back into the public ; he was dangerous and needed to be imprisoned , if only to protect himself .
But Veterans
Affairs wo n't take over a jailed soldier 's case until he 's released .
The ensuing bureaucratic disentanglement took months , leaving Andy in jail and his family discouraged almost to the point of despair .
Andy was n't a criminal .
He was broken .
This past June I visited Andy at the VA hospital in Battle Creek , Michigan , where he now lives in confinement .
For years he bounced in and out of VA medical - treatment centers and received care that often seemed , at best , inattentive .
But now doctors are working hard to unlock his mind with new drugs and therapies .
They have not yet issued a specific diagnosis , but he 's being treated for post - traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse , among other things , and a private doctor told him he showed symptoms of delusional disorder .
Battle Creek is an old facility , dating back to 1924 , and its exterior has a creaking sort of beauty .
On the inside of the lockdown ward , though , every surface is painted the same putty color .
Andy 's mother took me into a central room where nurses in old - fashioned uniforms pulled enormous rings of keys from their pockets , unlocking each door they passed through .
When Andy walked in , I did n't recognize him for a moment .
His blond hair had turned dark and retreated from his face , which seemed the color and consistency of glue .
We embraced .
" This sucks , man , " he said .
He seemed to veer between understanding his illness and clinging to the delusion of rejoining his elite colleagues .
So we talked about other , familiar topics .
The wars , my work , my family , and his hope to reassemble some sort of life with his son .
But then in a shrinking voice he told a story I had n't known , about what happened after Mullah Omar 's forces had ambushed his team from three sides outside Kandahar .
Andy had stayed awake through the night , pushing his mind with calculations and navigational cues , dropping bombs by the planeload on anything that approached .
The day after the ambush , he and the Special Forces team peeked over a ridge and saw a village – the village from which the ambush had launched , they felt sure , and so Andy called in air strikes on several Land Cruisers he could see .
Land Cruisers , he knew , meant Al Qaeda .
Later , after the team had come down from the ridge and entered another village a couple of miles away , Andy saw a figure coming over the horizon : a man carrying a little girl whose jaw had been blown off by a bomb .
The man had walked two miles with her in his arms to ask the Americans for help .
Andy stood nearby as the Texas 17 medic tried to put the girl 's face back together , then loaded her onto a helicopter headed back to an American outpost .
Something about seeing the girl 's small body lying across her father 's arms – something in her smallness , the shape and drape of her body – had sent a terrible jolt arcing from one synapse to another in Andy 's brain and across two decades of his life .
No matter what the guys around him said , Andy knew better : I did this .
–
Andy fought in Afghanistan on behalf of all 300 million Americans , and each American owns one - 300 - millionth of every bomb he dropped .
But unlike the rest of us , he lives with the consequences .
There 's hope for Andy .
Right now he 's allowed to leave the Battle Creek hospital for two days a week , with permission .
Then he 'll gradually move to an off - campus apartment and to independence , though he 'll continue to be treated by doctors at the hospital for the foreseeable future .
Not long ago he called with an announcement : " I 've got a date ! " he said .
" First one in years .
It 's with a third - grade teacher . "
Wonderful news .
And when he feels ready for it , I said , I 've still got the box with his stars inside .
Awards for bravery and gallantry from a former life .
" Just hang on to 'em a little longer , " he said .
" I 'll come visit soon . "

So at one of the recent Clojure dojos we had a situation where we had a number of functions to do with moving that essentially involved passing different keys to a map under different symbols that could be used in the REPL .
Well in Ruby this is the kind of thing you would do by metaprogramming abstracting the shared code into a single function that gets mapped under many names .
During the dojo Tom Crayford provided a map function that seemed to correctly generate the functions we wanted but did so under anonymous names .
We could n’t lick the problem during the dojo and it really drove me a little mad as it seemed we were very close .
Some people at the dojo were talking about macros but it seemed that was too strong for the short distance we had to cover to complete the task .
It also felt like there was an issue with the language if it could n’t do this .
After four hours , much consulting of the Halloway book and some fierce googling , a question at Stack Overflow put me on the trail on intern .
Adding this to Tom ’s function resulted in the right functionality .
Here ’s a simplified example .
However when I ran the code into the REPL the functions failed to appear .
Clojure namespaces are very dynamic and it seems they are very amenable to the kind of manipulation I wanted to do .
ns - interns gives you a list of the functions that are currently in a namespace so it was possible to confirm that the functions really had failed to appear .
Running the code in the REPL did add them though .
So the code was correct .
The final piece of the puzzle was the lazy sequence issue that had been mentioned at the dojo .
The map function was being immediately evaluated in the REPL but I had to add a doall to make the sequence unwind when it was invoked during the namespace loading .
The relevant code is part of my Clork fork .
The worst thing in trying to make this work is the old school nature of the Clojure documentation .
A lot of the functions tells you literally what the function does but not why you might want to use or more critically give examples of the expected usage .
Clojure supports documenting metadata but I think it really needs to be used more effectively .
A war of words is heating up between Google , Microsoft and a host of smaller sites over alleged anticompetitive behavior by Google in the Illustration : Steve Lyons online search market .
A variety of news outlets and blogs are reporting on allegations that Microsoft may be engaging in a proxy war against Google , using smaller companies to fight its battles .
The Allegations
In a recent blog post , Google discussed Microsoft 's ties to two European Websites that have filed antitrust complaints against Google with the European Commission .
Although the search giant did not come out and accuse Microsoft of having a hand in the comp laints , the implication that Microsoft was somehow involved was broadly understood .
Eric Goldman , an Associate Professor of Law at Santa Clara University School of Law , has also written about an alleged Microsoft antitrust campaign against Google .
Goldman pointed to the fact that two small U.S. - based companies -- MyTriggers and TradeComet -- hired the legal firm Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP to represent their antitrust concerns against Google .
Microsoft , Goldman said , is a longtime client of Cadwalader for antitrust issues .
Look At Them
Google may have been unwilling to accuse Microsoft of any behind - the - scenes shenanigans last week , but on Monday Google 's allegations were a little more direct .
" It 's become clear that our competitors are scouring court dockets around the world looking for complaints against Google into which they can inject themselves , " a Google spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal .
Do n't Look At Us . . .
Mostly
In a blog post on Friday , Dave Heiner , Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel , called Google out on its finger - pointing .
Heiner sticks to the issues , arguing that Microsoft is concerned about " Google practices that tend to lock in business partners and content ( like Google Books ) and exclude competitors . "
But Heiner never really denies Microsoft 's ties over current antitrust complaints against Google .
Instead , Heiner says some " concerned companies " have turned to Microsoft for advice in apparent antitrust issues against Google .
Microsoft 's advice to these companies is to talk to the relevant competition law authorities when " antitrust concerns appear to be substantial . "
It 's worth pointing out , however , that Microsoft flatly denied to the Journal that it had orchestrated any antitrust complaints against Google .
Vertical Search Is ( Sometimes ) Spam
Two of the Internet search companies involved in the current antitrust complaints against Google -- Foundem and Ejustice.fr -- are both known as vertical search companies .
Vertical search basically means these sites are focused on content for a specific subject or category ; Foundem is a price comparison shopping Website and Ejustice helps users find links to legal information in France .
Both sites say they have been harmed financially , because of low and penalizing Google search rankings .
Google has n't commented specifically on these cases , but the company did tell The New York Times it " penalizes some , but not all , vertical search engines because they are essentially spam . "
Google 's reasoning for penalizing some vertical search engines , according to the Times , is that the purpose of these sites is to collect " content and links from other sites to generate traffic and ad revenue . "
Funny thing is , that sounds a lot like what Google does too , does n't it ?
So what do you say ?
Is Microsoft orchestrating a campaign against Google , or does the search giant need more oversight from antitrust regulators ?

AIDA 's christenings are different from most , in that they are open to the public allowing thousands to partake in the celebration .
AIDA estimates that approximately 20,0000 people attended last night 's event .
For the " Fire & Ice " evening , AIDA had constructed a Winter Village at the Fish Market with almost like a street - fair atmosphere that included bands on several stages , and this one had ice - carving and fire - walking demonstrations at several stations ( hence the the evening 's theme , Fire & Ice ) .
As part of the spectacle , they used the ship as a giant canvas for a light show , as seen above .
Throughout the dock area , large LED screens are set up so everyone will have an excellent view of the ceremony .
Once the bottle was broken , and the ship was christened , the evening concluded with a huge fireworks show in the skies over the city for the entire community to enjoy .

Think of it : it s free ; non time - consuming ; theres none of that was it good for you , darling ? ; you dont need to dress up for it ( unless you want to , of course ) ; it relieves stress ; it¹s always on hand and the list goes on .

Okay : Female , married 15 years , one young child .
No sex with husband over last five years .
Have tried therapy , talking , not talking , confrontation — you name it , Dan , I tried it .
Lingerie , kink , porn .
Seriously , everything .
A year and a half ago , I got into a relationship with a married guy , a man who also was n’t getting any at home .
Our agreement is basically this : no strings , no ties that could hurt our families , have as much fun as we can .

My husband just got diagnosed with late - stage cancer .
He is dying .
Six months .
Leaving him is not an option .
On some level , I feel horribly guilty about still seeing my lover , but it ’s the only outlet I ’ve got .
Am I a complete skank / CPOS ?
No Good Acronym
You were doing what you needed to do to stay sane and stay married before your husband ’s diagnosis , NGA , and you should continue to do whatever it takes to stay sane and stay married — for your own sake , for your husband ’s sake , for your kid ’s sake .
If seeing your lover helps , I think you should continue to see your lover .
Advertisement
But see him less often , NGA , and redouble your efforts to keep the affair secret .
You are less the spouse and lover now , and more the nurse and caretaker .
In consideration of the good years you had together and with the knowledge that his undiagnosed illness could have been behind his lack of interest in sex , let go of whatever lingering resentments you have .
Do everything you can to make your husband comfortable and make his death “ good ” — and that includes keeping your affair from him .
Advertisement
Realistically and logistically , NGA , I think you wo n’t be able to see as much of your lover over the next six months as you have over the last 18 .
And six months is n’t that long to go without .
But if you need to see your lover a few times in order to stay sane and stay married and get through this awful time , then you should see your lover — for your own sake , for your husband ’s sake , for your kid ’s sake .
I ’ve been with my current boyfriend for a little over a year .
Since the get - go , he has refused to give me oral sex because he just plain does n’t like it , does n’t like the taste .
He says he does n’t even like looking at my vagina .
He does , however , like me to give him oral sex .
I ’ve tried explaining the importance of oral for me , but he thinks I ’m obsessing and says the act just grosses him out .
I ’m resenting this situation more and more .
So much so that now I really do n’t feel like giving him oral sex .
Any suggestions on how to improve this situation ?

Your situation will not improve , NOT , until you find yourself a boyfriend who is n’t a fag .
There may be a few straight boys out there who do n’t like to eat pussy , sad to say , but a straight boy who does n’t even like to look at pussy ?
Unless there ’s something very seriously wrong with your pussy ’s appearance — a web of scars from a waxing gone horribly , horribly wrong ; the Fox News logo tattooed on your pubic mound ; the glowering face of a parasitic twin where your clit should be — your boyfriend is a fag , NOT .

Just wanted to share a funny story with you .
It ’s also , we think , a great example of being GGG .
My ladyfriend generally requires more foreplay than I do , but on rare occasions , we focus on me exclusively .
Two nights ago , after three years together , we figured we ’d give a high - school classic a try : I was going to get a handjob .
I must ’ve been temporarily transported back to my Little League days , because as she was contentedly pumping away , I asked if she could adjust her grip , saying , “ Baby , could you choke up a little bit ? ”
Advertisement
“ What , ” she said , the sweetest , most GGG look on her face , “ you mean , like , cry ? ”
I really think she would ’ve done it , too , if I had n’t laughed so hard I nearly fell off the bed .

WHEREAS you ’re writing from Canada , and WHEREAS my Canadian readers patiently endure my rants about conservative American politicians ( like last week ’s rant about New Hampshire state representative Nancy “ Wiggle In Excrement ” Elliott ) , and WHEREAS my American readers might assume that Canada — where gay marriage is legal , everyone has health care , the boys are hot , and the girls are hotter — does n’t have any batshit - conservative politicians of its own , BE IT RESOLVED that I will make an effort to write about Canada ’s batshit - conservative politicians every once in a while .
Advertisement
No time like the present : I could write about your batshit - conservative prime minister , Stephen Harper , who ’s always proroguing the shit out of your parliament .
( I do n’t know what proroguing is exactly , but like the shit in French on breakfast - cereal boxes , it sounds pretty fucking filthy . )
But a better example of conservative batshittery would be Vic Toews .
Canada ’s unofficial “ Minister of Family Values , ” member of parliament Toews — surprise !— does n’t like the gays because we ’re a threat to the family and the institution of marriage .
Toews has described gay - marriage ceremonies as satanic “ Black Masses ” and insisted that adding gays and lesbians to existing Canadian civil - rights statutes would bring the “ jackboot of fascism [ down ] on the necks of our people . ”
You know where this is going , right ?
It turned out that Toews — who once warned that gay marriage could lead to polygamy — was cheating on his wife of 25 years .
After getting a much younger woman pregnant , Toews wound up getting divorced .
Another marriage destroyed not by gays stomping around in fabulous jackboots , but by another straight “ Christian ” shitfuck politician slamming his dick into someone who is n’t his wife .
Advertisement
Toews ’s affair became public two years ago , but the scandal did n’t destroy him — he became minister of public safety this January — because the Canadian press sniffed that Toews ’s affair and divorce were private .
Excuse me , Canadian - press pansies , but a politician who scares up votes attacking the private lives of others , a politician who insists that other people are out to destroy his marriage , ca n’t be allowed to hide behind “ my private business ! ” when it turns out that the only threat to the politician ’s marriage was the politician ’s own greasy cock .
Here ’s hoping that all straight folks everywhere one day realize that anti-gay ravers come in just two flavors : assholes who are externalizing their own internal struggles against homosexual desires ( Ted Haggard , Larry Craig , Charlie Crist , Joseph Ratzinger , et al. ) and assholes who are attempting to compensate for and / or draw attention away from their own moral shortcomings ( David Vitter , Mark Sanford , John Ensign , Vic Toews , et al . ) .
Advertisement
Toews is pronounced “ taves , ” and it seems to me that it should be a word for something nasty .
Get on it , Canada .
CONFIDENTIAL TO EVERYONE WHO ASKED :
If the mother of the 13 - year - old boy with the latex - glove fetish had written to me and not to Prudie — and she probably did n’t write to me for a reason — I would ’ve advised her to leave her son alone , told her that fetishes are n’t mental illnesses , and suggested that her son might be feeling “ horribly embarrassed and guilty ” about his fetish because HIS MOTHER IS HOUNDING HIM ABOUT IT .
And I would ’ve told her that any wife or girlfriend who would n’t indulge her son ’s kink — once he ’s an adult — would n’t be worthy of his time or affections .

Mercury 's Annual Sex Survey Results 2010 : SEXY TECHNOLOGY !
How Portland Makes Sex — And How Technology Makes it Better !
" It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity . "

" Bullshit , Albert Einstein ! " —

Sure , while technology may not have cured all our social ills — and may in fact have caused a few extra headaches — scientific advancement has done wonders for one thing in particular : sexy sexuality !
Thanks to the popularity of the internet , people who may have once been deathly afraid of their sexual feelings can now simply jump online and quickly realize they are not alone .
One thing is certain :
The more we talk openly about sex , the greater understanding we achieve — which in turn , adds to our humanity !
Sooooo ... I guess you can suck it , Einstein .
And trust me , nobody is more willing to talk about the multifaceted sides of sex than hot ' n ' horny Portlanders who , for the 10th year in a row , have turned out in droves to fill out our annual Mercury Sex Survey !
This year 's theme is " SEXY TECHNOLOGY " :
Not only did we learn tons about your old - timey methods of sexing each other , but we also found out how you 've been adding the latest technological advancements to get even MORE bang for your buck !
( Of course , all advancements are not created equal , and there have been times when sexual technology has turned around to bite some of us on the ass .
We 're looking at you , Greg Oden and Tiger Woods . )
So is this new sexual technology a force for good , evil , or both ?
Let 's find out in this year 's MERCURY SEX SURVEY !
But first , here 's our annual disclaimer :
NOTE : While this poll is one of the most scientifically accurate pieces of data on the planet , our respondents are n't .
Some answered the questions twice , some not at all , some passed out stinking drunk .
This means that our percentages may not always add up to 100 % ( or may add up to more ) .
In other words , science — like sex with your first cousin — is often awkward and a little bit ugly .
Thank you !
Now let 's get it on .
HEY , THAT'S ME !
Women stepped up in a big way this year , as 53 % of you filled out our survey , followed by men at 47 % .
That 's good , because as men already sadly know , when it comes to sex , women are extremely ( and often brutally ) honest .
Most of you are between the ages of 21 - 30 ( 64 % ) , primarily identify either as straight ( 70 % ) or queer ( 12 % ) , and are either in steady relationships ( 27 % ) or single ( also 27 % ) .
Unsurprisingly , most of you are monogamous ( 70 % ) though there has been a sizable uptick of cheaters ( 12 % ) — or at least an uptick in people who admit they cheat .
Now !
While 99 % of you agree that vaginal or anal intercourse indeed counts as " sex , " you were far more generous this year by also including handjobs / fingerings ( 52 % ) in the " is sex " category , as well as oral sex ( 79 % ) , mutual masturbation ( 50 % ) and " footjobs " ( 30 % ) .
Interestingly , guys are more inclined to consider handjobs as sex ( 30 % ) than women ( 20 % ) .
Which is a perfect segue into our next subject ...
INFLATING YOUR NUMBER OF SEXUAL PARTNERS !
People :
You need to start inflating your number of sexual partners .
According to this year 's survey , most of you ( 16 % ) have had sex with only four to seven partners , with " eight to 12 partners " coming in second at 15 % .
Now in 2008 , most of you claimed to have had sex with at least " 11 to 15 people " — SO WHAT HAPPENED ?
You 're counting handjobs and blowjobs , right ?
While you 're at it , count " titty fucking " too .
( Wait ... you already ARE counting that ?
Sheesh .
You guys need to pick up the pace in 2010 ! )
And you 're starting fairly early , right ?
Yeah ... our stats reveal that most of you started having sex at 17 or 18 years old ( both 17 % ) .
So again , why the low number of partners ?
Was the first time really that awful ?
Seriously guys !
Try it again !
It gets better , I swear !
Let 's see how many times per week you 're having sex .
Now that 's more like it !
Most of you do the bang - bang on average of either " once or twice per week " ( 27 % ) or a randy " three times per week minimum " ( 23 % ) .
However , even though you 're banging more than the national average , YOU KINDA STILL WANT MORE ( 42 % ) .
In addition , most of you ( 67 % ) consider yourself to be fairly attractive ...
Hmmmm ...
I think I 'm starting to see the problem with your poor " sexual partner " numbers .
You seem to be sticking with one person , and sticking it to them on a regular basis !
That 's okay , I guess ... but remember the old adage : " Life is a buffet — so why not at least taste the marshmallow soufflé ? "
Now here 's a " touchy " topic : MASTURBATION !
( Get it ?
" Touchy ? " " Masturbation ? "
" One touches oneself during the act of masturbation ? " OH FORGET IT !!) 39 % of you masturbate a few times a week , 17 % bang the baloney every day , and ... what 's this ?
Roughly 20 % of you only pound the pud on a " super rare basis ? "
Maybe you just need more practice .
Chatroulette is great for that , I hear .
And here 's an interesting stat : 56 % of you heteros have experienced fantasies about sexing someone of your same gender — and NO , that does not make you " gay . "
However , it does make you more " interesting . "
( And if you are currently screaming , " I bet all those heteros who think about banging their own sex are CHICKS , man ! " then you would be wrong : 25 % are men engaging in these fantasies as well .
So there , homophobe .
Nyaah . )
Now it 's time for some good news ... and some bad news .
The good news :
When your current partner has a secret crush on someone else , there 's only a 4 % chance he / she will fuck them .
The bad news is that if he / she has a NON - secret crush ( that is , he / she tells you ) there 's a 10 % chance she / he will fuck them .
Agreed , the chances are relatively low — but stats do n't lie !
If your lover tries to tell you about his / her crush , stick your fingers in your ears and run away singing , " NANANANA — I CAN'T HEAR YOU — NANANANANAAAA ! "
That is , unless you want to increase the odds of your lover cheating on you by 6 % .
So enough about you ...
LET'S GET TECHNO - SEXY !
Here 's how you 've been mixing sex and technology in recent years .
I have hooked up sexually ( or attempted to hook up ) via ...
Craigslist = 28 %
Facebook = 16 %
Mercury Lovelab = 16 %
Adult Friend Finder = 13 %
Ashley Madison = 5 %
Twitter = 5 %
( I agree : Nothing kills a boner like Twitter .
BTW , a 31 % majority of you who have hooked up via the internet have proclaimed the experience " hot ! " )
Have I ever deliberately misrepresented myself online , to make myself seem more attractive ?
Duh , YES ! = 12 %
Does omitting certain embarrassing facts count ? = 15 %
No , because it would be a recipe for disaster . = 59 %
( Oh REALLY , 59 % ?
That 's funny , because I never seem to run into any of you " honest " people online !
BTW , omitting the fact that you only have one eye COUNTS ! )
Look what I 've done !
I 've engaged in web cam sex ! = 26 % ( with 25 % more considering it ! )
I 've engaged in chatroom sex ! = 34 % ( Maybe I 've seen you there ? )
I have sent nude ( or partially nude ) photos of myself via text or email ! = 61 % ( WOW ! )
I have sent sext messages at least a few times !
= 48 % ( Again ... WOW !)
I look at internet porn at least every week ! = 30 % ( Not surprising . )
I look at internet porn with a partner ! = 36 % ( Surprising ! )
Now let 's take a closer look at some of these stats .
First , it was shockingly arousing that 61 % of you have sent nudie pix of yourself via text or email .
At the same time it was baffling that 60 % of you are NOT worried that they may wind up on ... say ...
THE INTERNET .
Ummm ... news flash !
I 'm looking at nude pictures of you on the internet RIGHT NOW .
And happily ?
You 're hot .
And check out the stats for this next question :
People who post dirty pics of their exes on the internet are ...
Worse than Hitler = 13 %
Worse than Bernie Madoff = 10 %
Worse than John Edwards = 18 %
Worse than Dick Cheney = 27 %
Worse than Avril Lavigne = 30 %
So the ex-lover of the Blazers ' Greg Oden who posted that nudie picture of him on the internet without his permission and as an obvious act of revenge is only worse than AVRIL LAVIGNE ??
( Wait .
For some reason I momentarily forgot that Avril Lavigne is worse than Hitler .
Sorry . )
Now let 's talk about " sexts , " baby !
It 's the newest thing , and all the kids are doing it .
As a matter of fact , a fun game the Mercury editorial team likes to play is to swipe a coworker 's phone and then send an absolutely filthy ( and awkward ) sext to that person 's lover or wife .
And it 's really funny — unless unbeknownst to you , that person was just diagnosed with cervical cancer .
Then it 's not so funny .
Oops ?
Anyway , " SEXTS ! "
As mentioned earlier a surprising number of you ( 48 % ) have sent these sexy text messages — that may or may not include a dirty photo — at least a few times .
Around 40 % of you keep these " sexts " as cherished mementos of your love , while 50 % of you quickly dispose of these messages before your partner finds out .
And it 's a good idea , too !
Because an unnerving 35 % of your partners admit to snooping on your cell phone for sexy texts .
Take note , Tiger Woods !
( Whoops .
Too late . )
But come on ... should the simple act of sexting with someone other than your partner be considered cheating ?
Let 's go to the stats !
Yep ! = 33 %
Nope ! = 10 %
Depends on the length and seriousness of the online relationship . = 22 %
Kind of — but it 's not grounds for dismissal . = 33 %
Okay , but does it count if you 're joke sexting one of your coworker 's wives who unbeknownst to you has cervical cancer ?
Okay , shutting up now .
And what about " TEEN SEXTING " ?
If the hyperbolic reports one might see on KATU are any indication , " Teen Sexting " is the last horseman of the apocalypse .
But how do YOU feel about it ?
" Teen sexting " is ...
A relatively safe sexual outlet .
= 46 % ( Unless I 'm the one sexting the teen , of course . )
Kind of a bad idea . = 35 % ( I already told you !
I 'm not sexting teens , okay ?!? )
Another reason to envy teenagers .
= 13 % ( They really do have all the fun do n't they ? )
A justified cause for moral panic . = 4 % ( Sorry , KATU and your " news partner " Willamette Week .
[ You know , whenever I hear that phrase it makes me think of my grandparents having sex . ] )
AND PLEASE !
LET US NOT FORGET ROBOT SEX !
The following is probably the most important question you answered on this survey .
We all know it 's just a matter of time before science develops a robot hot enough for us to want to fuck .
( And no , Megan Fox does n't count . )
However , just because we can fuck it , should we fuck it ?
It certainly would n't care if we fucked it .
It does n't have emotions .
But it would have a semblance of emotions I assume ... and what if it started nagging me like my ex-wife ?
Or started comparing me to other humans it fucked ?
On the other hand , having fuckable robots nearby would probably make Republicans , like 80 % nicer .
And it would probably do away with any reason to watch NFL football .
That would be cool .
Anyway !
As you can see , there 's lots to consider .
But let 's just start and end with one simple question :
If science were to create a fairly realistic humanoid sex doll / robot that was affordable and you could program , would you fuck it ?
Computing ...
Yes ... I ... Would .
Bzzzt ! = 42 %
No thanks !
Sex is already impersonal enough . = 48 %
Suits me , " no " voters !
That just means more impersonal simulated flesh for me .
Hey !
Let 's move on to this year 's write - in votes !

In August 1998 in a laboratory at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , geneticist Patricia Hunt was researching the impact of ageing on chromosomes , the bundles of DNA and protein in cells .
It was highly technical work , and to the outside world of no great interest .
Then she noticed something strange happening to the test mice ; something so peculiar and potentially so important that it has been widely reported since .
She spotted malformed cells in the control group of mice – the animals used for comparison with the ones that undergo experiments .
No experiments had been performed on these mice , yet perplexingly they were showing an " extraordinary increase " in cell failure .
While examining test tubes and other equipment to try to ascertain what might have caused this cell failure , Dr Hunt discovered cracks and bubbles in the plastic of the rodents ' cages , caused by the use of an unusually strong detergent .
As a result , a chemical had leached out of the plastic , and this , Hunt concluded , was behind the rodents ' malformations , which were so striking that Dr Hunt abandoned her original experiment and studied the control mice , instead .
The chemical Hunt had identified was Bisphenol A , or BPA , a hormonal substance and , even when injected at low levels into the mice , it reduced the mice 's " genetic quality " .
" What have lab mice or Bisphenol A got to do with me ? " you might ask .
The answer is that BPA is one of the commonest chemicals in the world .
Since it was discovered that it toughened plastic in the 1950s , the chemical has become embedded in the stuff of everyday life .
Every time you make a call on a mobile phone or tap something into a computer , handle a compact disc or sports equipment , put on sunglasses or paint your nails , drink water from your tap or run your tongue against a tooth filling , you may be in contact with BPA .
It is massively used by the food industry .
As a transparent resin , it lines food containers on supermarket and kitchen , your kitchen , shelves .
Most tinned food and drinks , including household names , are lined with a BPA membrane .
Most controversially of all , it is in baby bottles .
Biomonitoring tests show that the chemical – which can leach into humans – is present in more than 90 per cent of people ; it is almost certainly in your bloodstream now .
But why the concern ?
Because BPA – aka 4,4 ' - dihydroxy - 2,2- diphenylpropane – is an endocrine disruptorsomething which may synthetically mimic hormones , affecting the vital workings of the endocrine system of glands , which release hormones around the body , stimulating everything from puberty and the menopause to hunger cravings , fight or flight responses – and the programmed death of cells which would otherwise grow remorselessly , threatening the development of cancer .
Put bluntly , interfering with these processes , some scientists fear , may be causing a public health disaster , and BPA , they believe , may be a factor in the rising incidence of a myriad of human illnesses , such as breast cancer , heart disease and genital birth defects .
Breast Cancer UK and the Cancer Prevention and Education Society are so worried about BPA they are calling for it to be withdrawn from products .
Eminent British scientists have concerns , too .
At the end of last year , experts from five universities – London , Plymouth , Reading , Stirling , and Ulster – urged the Government to launch a review of BPA .
In a letter to the Health Secretary Andy Burnham , they wrote : " Although there are still some gaps in our knowledge on the health impact of BPA on humans , the major body of scientific research and evidence presented over the last decade strengthens the growing consensus that low - level exposure to BPA has a significant impact on increasing the risks of developing conditions such as cancer , diabetes , impaired brain function and behavioural problems in mammalian laboratory animals . "
Mr Burnham did n't reply ( an official in the Food Standards Agency did two months later ) , and efforts to encourage Britain to act have failed .
Other countries around the world have , however , not been so slow .
A decade ago Japan limited the levels of BPA in tins and has removed it from plastic containers used by children .
Canada listed BPA as a toxic chemical and banned it from baby bottles .
The biggest American firms no longer make BPA bottles and their sale has been banned in Chicago , Connecticut , Minnesota and Wisconsin .
And in January , after years of denying a problem , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) said it was concerned about BPA 's impact on the brain and behaviour of children and agreed to support industry 's attempts to remove it from infant feeding products and tinned food .
France 's Senate last week voted to ban baby bottles containing BPA .
Britain still takes its lead from a heavily - criticised assessment by the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) , which took a similar approach to the now - revised US position .
Critics talk darkly of a cover-up .
Some suspect the same tactics of " misinformation " that big tobacco companies once deployed to muddy the link between smoking and lung cancer .
What is certain is that there has already been a public health disaster involving a synthetic oestrogen like BPA .
***
On a wintry day in December , the US academic Alan Greene is giving a press conference on BPA to mothering magazines ( and The Independent ) at the Royal Society of Medicine in London .
In a wood - panelled room hired by Born Free , a maker of BPA - free bottles , Dr Greene – the " Al Gore of parenting " – starts by telling the story of Diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) .
He says what happened with this artificial oestrogen could give a disturbing clue to what is in store with BPA .
During the mid-20th century , millions of women worldwide took DES for the prevention of miscarriages .
Unfortunately DES did not prevent miscarriages .
" But what physicans said – and it chills me to think this , " says Dr Greene , pausing for effect , " was ' what harm could it do ? '
These women are worrying and they will feel better if we give them this pill .
" There was no benefit but DES continued to be prescribed until 1971 – because at that time daughters born to women using DES were showing up with a rare vaginal cancer .
It did n't happen except for in the daughters of women prescribed DES . "
Dr Greene , clinical professor of paediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine , says : " It took decades for anybody to figure this out . "
DES mothers have passed on their toxic legacy to their daughters and grandsons in the form of more breast cancer and birth defects .
Some scientists are concerned that BPA has a similar " long latency period " .
As its production has grown over the past 50 years , so have obesity , heart disease , diabetes and other reproductive and behavioural problems .
Breast cancer in Britain , for instance , is up by 80 per cent since the 1970s .
Hyperactivity in boys has increased seven - fold in 30 years .
Tests suggest sperm counts in industrialised countries have halved in 50 years .
As he hits his stride , Dr Greene makes a stark point .
" For all of the illnesses that are rapidly increasing in the last couple of decades and that includes , autism , ADHD , allergies of various kind , cancer , Type II diabetes , high blood pressure , it 's not that our genetics have changed , it 's the environment that has changed .
It 's environmental exposures , it 's how we eat , it 's how we move ... and it's the chemicals in our lives . "
He and other critics of BPA freely acknowledge that disorders such as breast cancer have complex epidemiologies : you might get them because of genetics , poor diet , lack of exercise , smoking , or a combination of all of those .
But , increasingly , they believe man-made chemicals are playing a significant and avoidable role too .
A group of 38 endocrine experts from around the globe who reviewed 700 scientific papers on BPA in the town of Chapel Hill , North Carolina , three years ago reached this conclusion .
In a flinty statement known as the Chapel Hill Consensus , they warned that recent trends in human disease " relate to adverse effects observed in experimental animals exposed to low levels of BPA .
" Specific examples , " they wrote , " include the increase in prostate and breast cancer , uro - genital abnormalities , decline in semen quality in men , early onset of puberty in girls , metabolic disorders including insulin - resistant diabetes and obesity , and neuro - behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . "
Studies suggest BPA most affects hormonally - influenced areas of the body , such as breasts and prostrate , brains and reproductive organs , and that its most powerful impact is on foetuses , babies and young children .
While strong , however , the evidence is not conclusive .
Not least because medical ethics forbid the deliberate exposure to humans of a substance suspected of causing harm , even though exposure is routine in everyday life .
As a result , there are no laboratory experiments on BPA in humans .
There are around 1,000 studies on animals , and they have found problems time and again .
Yale University , for instance , found that BPA harmed the brains of monkeys at a dose level deemed safe for humans in the US .
Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston found experiments on mice and human data on DES strengthened " the hypothesis that foetal exposure to xeno[ synethetic ] - oestrogens may be an underlying cause of the increased incidence of breast cancer observed over the last 50 years . "
Research has been carried out on humans , to check whether there is a connection between levels of BPA in individuals and ill - health .
The results have been remarkable .
Toddlers of mothers who had high BPA in their bodies while pregnant were more hyperactive , while workers in factories which handle BPA had far more erectile dysfuncton and other penis problems .
In the biggest study , Peninsula Medical School in Exeter found that people with high levels of BPA were a third more likely to have heart disease .
Professor Fred Vom Saal , an endocrinologist at the University of Missouri , says evidence that BPA badly damages human health is compelling .
He warns : " BPA is implicated in a host of diseases that are disrupting the lives of millions of people and costing vast amounts of money to treat .
Everyone recognises the complexity of diseases such as cancers of the breast and prostate , metabolic diseases , neurobehavioural abnormalities ...
" It is thus stunning that administration of daily doses of BPA to animals that leads to blood levels of BPA , at and below levels found in the average person who is examined anywhere in the world , causes all of these diseases . "
How can regulators say BPA is safe ?
***
Not all studies find problems with BPA .
Some studies funded by chemicals makers or trade organisations give it a clean bill of health .
The American Chemistry Council ( ACA ) , which represents the £ 458 bn - a - year US chemical industry , says BPA is " one of the most thoroughly tested chemicals " .
After the FDA performed its U - turn in January , the ACC said it was " disappointed that some of the recommendations are likely to worry consumers and are not well - founded " .
The British Plastics Federation accuses Breast Cancer UK of " misleading " the public .
The industry points to several studies that show BPA is harmless at doses above those experienced by humans .
And in this it enjoys the support of traditional toxicologolgy , which assumes that everything can be harmful – in big enough doses .
Or as the commonly used phrase goes , " the dose makes the poison " .
Confusingly , though , synthetic hormones do not appear to work this way .
Independent scientists have found repeatedly that they are active at infinitesimally small doses – parts per billion .
They insist US and European regulators have made catastrophically misguided decisions on BPA .
Two years ago the FDA issued its draft assessment before an expert report by another US Government - funded group , the National Toxicology Program , expressed its concern .
And this draft assessment , the Journal Sentinel in Milwaukee reported , was written largely by the plastics industry and financially interested parties .
Both US and European regulators have controversially set great store by research carrying the imprimateur of an industry protocol , Good Laboratory Practice .
GLP was introduced in the late 1970s to stop drug and other companies fiddling results and sets guidelines on such things as calibration and care of equipment .
Writing in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives , last March , 30 scientists complained that GLP studies were using out - of - date and insensitive equipment to test BPA .
They wrote : " It is of great concern that the US and EU regulatory authorities are willing to accept these industry - funded , antiquated , and flawed studies as proof of the safety of BPA , while rejecting as invalid for regulatory purposes the findings from a very large number of academic and government investigators using 21st century scientific approaches . "
In particular , they singled out industry - funded studies carried out by US toxicologist Rochelle Tyl at a private laboratory , RTI International in North Carolina .
Dr Tyl 's studies were particularly important in convincing regulators of the chemical 's safety – but the 30 independent scientists claimed they used " insensitive , out - of - date protocols and assays " , such as a feed that had been shown to interfere with responses to xeno - oestrogens , and rodents that had a " puzzling " low response to a control hormone , suggesting they would have been insensitive to BPA .
When asked by The Independent to comment on the criticisms , Dr Tyl rejected them : " The studies we have conducted at RTI International are large multigenerational reproductive toxicity studies with validated end points that are used for health risk assessment , " she said .
" They were conducted using governmental test guidelines ( GLP ) and are thoroughly documented ...
" The many smaller studies that raised concerns about the adverse health effects of BPA are basic research studies , which use novel exposure pathways ( intravenous or subcutaneous injections , implants , etc ) and non-validated endpoints , and are not useful for risk assessment .
Most of these studies were short term , with few dose groups and few animals per group . "
Dr Tyl added that while she was " 100 per cent confident " in her work , these other studies had resulted in " very different outcomes " , which was why the US Government was funding additional research .
Professor Vyvyan Howard , professor of Bio-imaging at the University of Belfast , believes there is enough evidence to act against BPA , without waiting for further research .
" We 're going to have to act on incomplete data , an absence of absolute certainty , " he insisted .
" The question the regulators have to answer is , is the weight enough to make us make the decision ?
But do n't get the idea that they are scientific decisions , they 're not .
The science is there and they [ regulators ] make a political decision . "

Professor Howard believes man-made substances such as BPA – in homes , offices and the environment – are leaving " an appalling chemical legacy " .
The academic , who uses a glass baby bottle and cleans his home with vinegar rather than chemical " witches brews " , has a track record of being right .
He warned children were being made hyperactive by artificial food colourings two years before the Food Standards Agency banned them .
His researchers found that , when combined , food additives had several times their individual effect , yet regulators had only checked them separately .
Professor Howard says there has been very little research on the combination of man-made chemicals , because there are so many permutations .
Some 143,000 chemicals registered for use in the European Union , of which around 30,000 are actively traded – making millions of potentially - harmful combinations .
ChemTrust , a British charity , is concerned about several individual chemicals , including the flame retardants in furniture , carpets and bedding , and perfluorinates which , among other things , repel water from clothing and non -stick cookware .
BPA , however , is at the very top of ChemTrust list , along with phthalates ( pronounced thalates ) .
Phthalates make plastics bendy and rubbery and are present in plastic furniture , shoes , PVC flooring and shower curtains .
They have been associated with asthma , allergies , obesity and diabetes .
A US study last year found two common phthalates were " feminising " boys ' brains and making them less likely to play with cars and trains .
Professor Richard Sharpe , a fertility expert at the Medical Research Council , believes phthalates and other chemicals may be damaging couples ' chances of getting pregnant .
In a report for ChemTrust last year , he concluded that the cocktail effect of chemicals in the environment were one of several factors " clearly responsible " for lowering sperm count in the West , and probably caused penis birth defects .
As well as harming humans , scientists warn that chemicals are threatening the ecological food chain on which humans ultimately rely .
The Chapel Hill scientists found that BPA harmed laboratory fish and wildlife , while a UK study reported problems among otters , polar bears , and antelopes .
To counter the threat of persistent environmental pollution , a UN treaty in 2001 introduced a worldwide ban on a " Dirty Dozen " chemicals , mostly pesticides .
Two years later the EU 's Research Commissioner , Philippe Busquin , gave a warning that man-made chemicals were a threat everywhere : " Under certain conditions , we can even be at risk while sitting in our sofa at home , not only while cycling downtown at the rush hour . "
His words turned out to be prescient – thousands of Britons received skin rashes while sitting on Chinese sofas lined with a dangerous mould - inhibiting chemical , DMF , for which they last year successfully sued the retailers Argos and Land of Leather .
Europe has become alarmed at the potential for harm of chemicals leaching into our lives .
Seven years ago a European Commission study found that , of the highest production volume chemicals , 65 per cent had minimal safety data and a further 21 per cent had none .
To close the knowledge gap , Europe has introduced the Reach directive ( Registration , Evaluation , Authorisation and Restriction of CHemicals ) .
Described as the most complex legislation in EU history , Reach may eventually answer some of the problems surrounding chemicals , but , after industry lobbying , individual chemicals may only be fast - tracked for extra testing at the request of a member state .
So far , no country has submitted BPA .
ChemTrust 's Elizabeth Salter - Green believes that BPA is now so heavily embedded in everyday life that no Government particularly wants to tackle it .
And she suspects industry lobbying may explain why regulatory action has been so slow .
" The companies that make a lot of chemicals are the hydrocarbon [ oil ] companies , " she said .
" They pull hydrocarbons out of the ground and make what they can into petrol or aviation fuel .
The bit they can't use they make into synthetic chemicals , BPA , phthalates , whatever .
So there 's this enormously powerful lobbying machine .
" It 's not just the chemicals companies who are lobbying , it 's the hydrocarbon companies and in the UK and in the US , and oil companies are among the strongest lobbyists we 've got . "
Two years ago two scientists in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed BPA makers were conducting " an aggressive disinformation campaign " using techniques first developed by the lead , vinyl , and tobacco industries to challenge the reliability of findings published by independent scientists .
A spokesman for the UK Petroleum Industry Association said he had " never heard of this issue in all my 12 years of working for UKPIA , so it 's never come up on our radar , " and declined to comment .
The American Chemistry Council insisted its behaviour was proper .
Spokeswoman Kathryn St John said : " Industry periodically meets with government regulators to openly discuss the science on BPA , as do others , such as non-governmental organisations .
Government regulators gather input from a wide range of stakeholders through written comments , public meetings and individual stakeholder submissions .
The entire process is transparent .
" We make products that are critical to the US economy and to the safety of the food supply – it is important for legislators to understand how their decisions may affect our products , our workers and the nation 's supply chain . "
Laboratory tests on humans for BPA would solve the debate once and for all .
But directly injecting humans with an allegedly harmful substance is not allowed .
Instead , it is flowing through the bloodstreams of billions of people in a vast unregulated global experiment .
OTTAWA – A former head chaplain with the Canadian Forces has been charged with buggery , sexual assault and gross indecency in an 1972 attack , dealing the military its second blow in as many weeks .
Roger Bazin was a Roman Catholic chaplain at CFB Borden and a young man in the early stages of his career when the incident is alleged to have occurred .
He rose through the ranks of the military to become a brigadier - general with command of all Catholic chaplains in the force .
“ He was a very , very nice man .
Very congenial , gracious .
Lots of sensitivity to people as a chaplain general .
Very positive , so this really comes as a shock to us , ” said Bishop Donald Theriault , head of the Roman Catholic Military Diocese of Canada .
“ This was right at the beginning of his career … so to reconcile any of that , it just does n’t fit yet , you know ? ”
The allegations that Bazin assaulted a male victim while serving as a captain in the military come one week after Col.
Russell Williams was removed from command at CFB Trenton and charged with the murders of two women and the sexual assault of two others .
Brig.- Gen. David Kettle , the force ’s current chaplain general , served in the Protestant chaplaincy stream before Bazin engineered the unification of all military chaplains ahead of his retirement in 1995 .
Kettle said in an interview that all chaplains hold positions of trust in the military community and alleged violations of that confidence are unacceptable .
“ Our concern is always for the victim .
It ’s part of what a chaplain is .
He ’s the guy that always sticks up for the underdog or those who are afflicted . ”
Still , Bazin appeared to be an upstanding officer and military leader .
“ What I saw I liked , ” said Kettle .
“ He was splendidly bilingual .
He was a sophisticated and brilliant man . ”
Screening procedures for military chaplains have become much more rigorous , particularly since the 1990s when the Catholic and Protestant chaplaincy streams were transformed into a multifaith service to accommodate Jews , Muslims and other religions .
Chaplain candidates must now pass through a religious screening process , military testing and an interfaith committee before being awarded the position .
Once in the force there are regular performance reviews and a strict code of ethics that chaplains must follow .
But all accounts suggest Bazin would have passed the modern tests .
There are glowing reports in local newspapers from northern Ontario of Bazin as a parish priest .
He even served as a representative of the Diocese of Thunder Bay for a time after he left the force in 1995 .
In 2002 , he survived a brutal car crash with a broken back .
He was pulled from his vehicle in the ditch of a rural road near his childhood home of St. Claude , Mb. moments before it turned into a flaming wreck .
A year later he was back at the altar .

“ Being the wonderful , kind , considerate man he is , ” the Kenora Daily Miner and News wrote in June 2003 , “ Bazin located his monsignor ’s robes and was back amongst his people once again … ”
For a while now , the Pentagon has been concerned about U.S. dependence on rare - earth metals .
Precision weapons , Priuses and iPhones depend on components made from rare earths like terbium , dysprosium , yttrium and thulium .
And the dependence threatens more than just national security :
It 's a major issue when it comes to developing renewable energy sources .
The House Committee on Science and Technology 's investigations and oversight panel is holding a hearing today on rare - earth metal supplies , focusing on China 's near - monopoly on the stuff .
As we 've reported here before , China has raised concerns by threatening to limit exports .
And to make matters more complicated , U.S. mining companies are dependent on China for processing .
As a recent LiveScience story points out , U.S. - based Molycorp Minerals has to ship rare earths to China for final separation .
Testimony is embargoed until the hearing begins today at 2 p.m. , but you can read a hearing overview ( .pdf ) and watch a live webcast once the hearing begins .
The hearing will include testimony from Mark Smith , the CEO of Molycorp Minerals , which is trying to restarting a mine in Mountain Pass , California , which is the primary source for rare earth minerals in the United States .
( That mining operation closed in 2002 . )
It 's not all doom and gloom : China has reportedly backed away from a sweeping ban on the export of some rare earths .
And the United States is sitting on significant reserves of rare - earth metals ( .pdf ) , as a U.S. Geological Survey report points out .
Perhaps more importantly , policymakers and politicians are now catching on to their strategic value .

Editorial : Quantum biology has come in from the cold
WHILE physicists struggle to get quantum computers to function at cryogenic temperatures , other researchers are saying that humble algae and bacteria may have been performing quantum calculations at life - friendly temperatures for billions of years .
The evidence comes from a study of how energy travels across the light - harvesting molecules involved in photosynthesis .
The work has culminated this week in the extraordinary announcement that these molecules in a marine alga may exploit quantum processes at room temperature to transfer energy without loss .
Physicists had previously ruled out quantum …
He was the undisputed star of the Scottish Labour Party – tipped as a future First Minister , perhaps even a potential incumbent at 10 Downing Street itself .
But for Steven Purcell , Glasgow 's youngest and first openly gay council leader , the fall from grace was to be as spectacular as it was rapid .
Even in a city where the art of politics is practised with a notoriously brutal tenacity , few can recall a career which imploded quite so dramatically as that of the 37 - year - old .
His demise has been charted in a daily barrage of lurid headlines that have painstakingly detailed everything from allegations of cocaine abuse to drug barons and blackmail threats ; from inevitable suggestions of homophobia to a friend 's tragic sudden death and even an unlikely cameo appearance in the plot by Lady Gaga .
Yet while the city 's wine bars and pubs are alive with speculation this weekend over exactly what befell Mr Purcell to make him quit as the head of the council with responsibility for 30,000 employees , a post he was elected to in 2005 , he has maintained a resolute silence that has only added fuel to criticisms that the increasingly bizarre affair has damaged the party as it prepares for the general election .
What is known , however , is that in an evening telephone call 12 days ago , Mr Purcell contacted council officials to tell them he was resigning his position immediately .
The following day his lawyer , one of the most powerful litigation specialists in Scotland , issued a statement explaining that his client was recovering from exhaustion and was having professional help after apparently being overcome by the pressures of work .
He pleaded for him to be left alone and given time to recover .
Those within the claustrophobic world of Glasgow 's intertwined political , business and media elites were baffled .
Only four days earlier Mr Purcell had been entertaining Gordon and Sarah Brown and a host of celebrities at a charity function in the Hilton 's grand ballroom .
Some at the lavish fundraising event recalled him bantering and joking .
He apparently showed no signs of stress as well - heeled political backers ate and drank , while refilling the party coffers with a fundraising auction which included a painting by the artist Peter Howson and a Manchester United shirt signed by Sir Alex Ferguson .
Others claimed he was already showing signs of strain , suggesting he left early and was in an uncharacteristically subdued mood when he was dropped at his home in the fashionable West End shortly after midnight .
The following day , however , it was clear something was badly wrong .
According to one friend something had " spooked " him .
Though he initially appeared relaxed on reporting for work at Glasgow City Hall , by the afternoon the man once tipped for the highest office was disintegrating in front of astonished colleagues .
One source described the change in character as a " complete metamorphosis " .
By the evening it was claimed he was talking gibberish , shouting and complaining of plots being hatched against him .
By now Mr Purcell had begun to express concerns over his own state of mind , apparently in the throes of a fully fledged nervous breakdown .
That weekend he checked himself into Castle Craig , one of Europe 's leading rehab clinics , which boasts a team of experts specialising in the treatment of drink and drug addiction .
But the troubles continued .
It was reported that the following night the council leader had gone missing in the open facility , which is set in 50 secluded acres of rolling landscape of the Scottish Borders .
He later returned soaking wet , prompting speculation he may have tried to drown himself in a river .
On Wednesday , Mr Purcell 's media adviser Jack Irvine , a former editor of The Sun in Scotland , issued another statement confirming that his client had now left the facility , where it was said he had not been treated for substance abuse .
But the story was causing serious difficulties for Labour , which has exerted an iron grip over Clydeside politics for generations .
At the end of the week Mr Purcell announced he had withdrawn from public life and was resigning his seat – effectively killing off his political career .
In a tragic coincidence one of the political leader 's friends , an 18 - year - old council employee called Danus McKinlay , dropped dead in the street outside the city chambers .
Despite pleas and threats to lay off the story , the torrent of claims continued .
The most damaging to emerge was that Mr Purcell had admitted to friends that he had taken cocaine , though he had since turned his back on drugs .
It also emerged that his lifestyle had come to the attention of detectives investigating one of Scotland 's biggest cocaine barons .
Officers from the Scottish Crime and Drugs Enforcement Agency held a meeting the previous May with Mr Purcell because of fears he was vulnerable to blackmail , after a dealer claimed to have incriminating mobile phone footage of him .
Political opponents are demanding that Labour put the record straight , and the party 's acting leader , Jim Coleman , is under mounting pressure to make a full statement explaining exactly what happened .
The SNP's Glasgow East MP , John Mason , has led the attack : " The whole thing stinks .
We need answers .
In relation to the visit of senior police officers to Mr Purcell , we need to know who are the people suggested as having applied pressure to him in terms of possible blackmail threats .
And crucially , has this had any impact on public policy in the city of Glasgow ?
" Given the massive budgets managed by the council , there is a clear case for Audit Scotland carrying out a thorough investigation .
The people of Glasgow , and Scotland as a whole , deserve to know the full facts . "
Mr Purcell was reported to be abroad this weekend , possibly in Australia .
Meanwhile , every aspect of his recent past is being scrutinised .
Journalists have monitored messages of support posted on his Facebook site by some of his more than 1,000 friends .
It was also reported that he had spent last New Year 's Eve at Miami 's luxurious five - star Fontainebleau hotel , watching a poolside concert by Lady Gaga from the balcony of his suite .
But those close to the one - time high - flyer are coming to terms with the unexpected loss of one of the party 's most exciting prospects in decades .
Mr Purcell was considered a powerful moderniser , well liked by Tony Blair and Mr Brown , who helped to bring the Commonwealth Games to the city he loved , and who stood firm during a spate of recent damaging battles , clashing bruisingly with the First Minister , Alex Salmond , over the scrapping of a proposed rail link to Glasgow airport .
Supporters claim his decision to come out in 2006 after the breakdown of his five - year marriage to Katrina Murray , a trades union activist , made him unpopular with the macho wing of the party .
Some observers have detected " old- fashioned homophobia " .
Fans of Kate Beaton 's " Hark ! A Vagrant " -- who created one of the longest lines at the Emerald City Comic Convention throughout the day yesterday -- got an unexpected treat at the booth of the popular webcomic artist :
Fat pony statues .
Inspired by her recurring Shetland pony comics , the tiny figures are hand sculpted by Nikki Malki ( wife of " Wondermark " creator David Malki ) , and priced at $ 50 .
Although the toys are only available at the Emerald City for the moment , they 're soon going to make their way to Beaton 's Topatoco store ,

While the entire world debates about the best ways in which they could do their bit for the environment and the planet , even mainstream commercial companies are trying to cash in on people ’s sentiments regarding the planet .
The good thing is that cell phone and handset companies can actually do something for the environment and Sony Ericsson is displaying just that with their latest “ Green ” phone - Naite that is all set to take over the world or at least that majority of the world who are concerned about the environment and their responsibility towards it .
And this number of people concerned about the bad effects we humans have on the environment is increasing every day , so it would be wrong to assume that there is no place or market for a phone that is targeted towards this specific sort of consumer .
What this model - Naite is basing its concept on is - carbon footprints .
What they claim is that you can calculate your carbon footprints at least fifteen points less if you are buying this model as it is made of recyclable plastic and recycled plastic as well .
This is one great feature about the phone that will have all environment - conscious people alert .
However , this is not the only one feature about the phone that will have everyone excited , there surely are other things that the phone has that you might find attractive .
For starters , the keypad is one of the best features of the phone .
Anybody who is more concerned about how user friendly the phone is will notice this great feature about the phone - that it can be used comfortably without any hassles .
The keypad itself is huge and all the keys are large and well spaced so that one does not face any trouble in typing or texting .
Lately among all the Sony Ericsson phones that have been released , this is one of the phones with the best keypad .

The user interface does n’t reek of genius - it is the same old typical Sony Ericsson interface that everybody uses with the same icons etc .
However , if you are worried about usability and comfort then this interface will certainly be something you will be happy about because it is just so easy to use .
However , one thing that is not something you will want to write home about is the look of the phone as a whole .
No of course it is n’t something that look repulsive but neither does it look like the designer could receive an award for .
But the point is that the price range that it falls in and the recycled plastic feature that the phone has is enough for the buyer to forgive the average looks of the phone .
The other feature of the handset that you might not find extremely attractive is the screen itself .
This is definitely one of those phone that are very hard to use in direct sunlight , it reflects all the light it can directly back at you and the resolution is also something that is quite an average number - 240X360 Megapixel display .
However just like we have been saying , if usability is your concern this phone has all the right features - for example the battery on this phone is something that is quite the conversation starter .
It boasts of a very solid battery and all our tests could also not disprove the figures of battery life that the company claims so we would like to accept what they guarantee .
However one cannot really expect all the phones to do everything , so going by that theory this phone definitely does its work of being a “ Green ” phone and being extremely comfortable to use .

New research from the Hood Center for Children and Families at Dartmouth Medical School ( DMS ) for the first time sheds light on the significant potential negative impact that food product placements in the movies could be having on children .
The study , which appears in the current edition of the journal Pediatrics , shows that most of the " brand placements " for food , beverage , and food retail establishments that are frequently portrayed in movies , are for energy - dense , nutrient - poor foods or product lines .
In addition , the study shows for the first time that product placements in movies may be a far more potent source of advertising to children in terms of food choices than previously understood .
" The current situation in the United States is very serious in terms of the health of our children , and we have to look seriously at all of the factors that may be contributing to it , including the impact of product placements in movies , " says Lisa Sutherland , Ph.D. the lead author of the study .
Sutherland says that the diet quality of U.S. children and adolescents has declined markedly during the past 20 years , and current estimates suggest that only one percent of children eat a diet consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's ( USDA ) My - Pyramid food guidance .
Additionally , fewer than one fifth of adolescents meet the dietary recommendations for fat or fruit and vegetable intakes , and during the last 20 years obesity rates have doubled for children aged 6 to 11 years and tripled for adolescents aged 12 to 19 years .
" While the issue of food advertising and its effect on children has been well documented in numerous studies , comparatively little is known about product placement in movies and how it affects the food and beverage preferences and choices of children and adolescents , " Sutherland said .
The study notes that while there are similarities between television advertising and movie product placement , such as the low nutritional quality of the majority of branded products , there are also interesting differences .
Recent studies that examined television ads during adolescent programming found fast food and ready - to - eat cereals and cereal bars to be the most prevalent during children 's programming .
In contrast , the Dartmouth study found that sugar - sweetened beverages , comprised largely of soda , accounted for the largest proportion of all of the movie - based food product brand placements , accounting for one of every four brand placements overall .
The study notes that of particular concern are the food and beverage product placements in comedies and PG - rated and PG - 13 - rated movies , which are often geared specifically to older children and teenagers , who are at an age where they are gaining independence with respect to their food choices .
Although the impact of this type of advertising on children is not fully known , it provides a likely avenue by which brand loyalty and product preference can be built in addition to eating patterns .
The study also revealed that six companies accounted for 45 percent of all brand placements and included PepsiCo , Coca - Cola , Nestle USA , McDonald's , Dr. Pepper / Snapple Group and Burger King .
The study acknowledges that many companies have made pledges not to direct advertising at children in order to encourage healthier dietary choices , and that while this is a step in the right direction , more clearly needs to be done .
In addition , the study 's authors say that a number of studies to date that focused on other health - related behaviors , including alcohol and tobacco use , showed that movies contain frequent portrayals of these risk behaviors and often include brand appearances of the products .
They say it is well established that children who view these risk behaviors in movies are more likely to engage in the behavior themselves .
" This is an area of study which clearly requires more research , " says Sutherland who was part of a team of advisers that , in 2006 , helped to develop the Guiding Stars program used by supermarkets to help shoppers better identify the nutritional values of food products .
" At a time in their development where children and adolescents are very susceptible to outside influences , we have to carefully examine the influence of all the factors that are combining to create what may end up being lifelong habits around food and lifestyle choices .
Certainly , food - product placement in movies is one of many factors , but it is one that may be far more influential than previously realized and perhaps the least well understood . "

YOU have all heard the cry of Teach the Controversy !
It ’s the propaganda slogan of the neo - theocrats at the Discovery Institute ’s Center for Science and Culture ( a/k / a the Discoveroids ) .
Wikipedia is quite straightforward about it :
Teach the Controversy is the name of a Discovery Institute campaign to promote intelligent design , a variant of traditional creationism , while attempting to discredit evolution in United States public high school science courses .
The central claim the Discovery Institute makes with ‘ Teach the Controversy ’ is that fairness and equal time requires educating students with a ‘ critical analysis of evolution ’ where “ the full range of scientific views ” , evolution ’s “ unresolved issues ” , and the “ scientific weaknesses of evolutionary theory ” will be presented and evaluated … [ … ]
The scientific community and science education organizations have replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of evolution and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics .
They also discuss the origin of the phrase , and point out :
The phrase was picked up by other Discovery Institute affiliates Stephen C. Meyer , David K. DeWolf , and Mark E. DeForrest in their 1999 article , Teaching the Controversy : Darwinism , Design and the Public School Science Curriculum , published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics .
The Foundation for Thought and Ethics also publishes the controversial pro-intelligent design biology textbook Of Pandas and People , suggested as an alternative to mainstream science and biology textbooks in the Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans proposed by Teach the Controversy proponents .
The campaign was devised by Stephen C. Meyer and Discovery Institute founder and President Bruce Chapman as a compromise strategy in March 2002 .
They had come to the realisation that the dispute over intelligent design ’s ( lack of ) scientific standing was complicating their efforts to have evolution challenged in the science classroom . …
Knowledgeable observers are well aware that “ Teach the Controversy ” is but one tool used in furtherance of the Discoveroids ’ infamous wedge strategy , the blueprint for their long - range goal of establishing a theocracy in lieu of ( what remains of ) our constitutional republic .
We ’ve written about that before .
See Intelligent Design : It ’s Not About Science .
We said :
[ The Discoveroids ’ ] purpose is — and always has been — social revolution .
They ’re nowhere in the world of science , industry , academia , etc .
They know this .
Aside from religion , which is the natural home of ID and creationism , the only arena where the Discoveroids can succeed is in politics . [… ]
Do n’t get over - confident because the Discoveroids are so amusingly inept at science .
ID is n’t about science .
It never was .
It ’s all about Philip Johnson ’s strategy for achieving social change by means of a decision of the US Supreme Court .
When that change comes , if it does , you ’re not going to like it .
Okay , we know what the Discoveroids want .
What shall we do about it ?
Shall we continue as we have been doing , by sending science experts to testify at the show - trials staged by creationist legislators and school board members , knowing ahead of time that the zealots will ignore the science and impose their religious dogma on the education system ?
Is that a winning strategy ?
Or should we , perhaps , counter with a slogan of our own ?
We ’re certainly not suggesting that a mere slogan should be the sole strategy in combating the resurgence of Dark Ages thinking .
There ’s a world of worthy arguments in favor of a proper science education , and in favor of a sound understanding of the constitutional role of religion in governmental institutions .
But a good slogan would be useful when the situation calls for it .
So what do we propose ?
We suggest that when the forces of darkness are demanding “ Teach the Controversy , ” our side — the rational side — should respond with a substantially better idea : Teach the Science !
That ’s not too terribly complicated , is it ?
Even a school board can grasp the message .
After the kids are properly educated in the subject matter , then — and only then — will they be prepared to consider whether there really is a scientific controversy , or if there ’s just a blizzard of blather being babbled by religious extremists .
If a school also wants to offer an elective course in propaganda techniques , that would be the appropriate place where “ Teach the Controversy ” should be examined .
But in science class , it ’s absurd for teachers to have any purpose other then what their job is supposed to be — Teach the Science !

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
When former in - house defense attorney Dimitrios Biller resigned from his top post at Toyota , he walked out with something potentially more valuable than his nearly $ 4 million severance package .
He took some 6,000 internal documents , including memos and e-mails potentially damaging to his former employer .
" Not potentially , they are .
They are very damaging , " Biller said .
Biller , now entangled in litigation with the auto giant , defended the company in product liability and negligence cases from 2003 to 2007 .
He says he quit because of what he alleges were " criminal acts " by Toyota -- specifically , withholding information the company was legally required to turn over to plaintiffs ' lawyers during litigation .
" There is a regular pattern and practice of not producing memos , minutes , reports , and e-mails , " Biller said .
" These documents can be used to establish liability against Toyota in product liability and negligence cases . "
The documents -- some of which were reviewed by CNN -- were sent by Biller to Toyota officials .
There are numerous references to so - called " Books of Knowledge , " highly confidential information on design , safety systems and testing records allegedly generated by Toyota engineers on everything from roll - overs and roof safety to sudden unintended acceleration .
The chairman of a U.S. House committee investigating Toyota seems to agree with Biller , saying Toyota engaged in a " systematic disregard for the law and routine violation of court discovery orders in litigation . "
Rep. Edolphus Towns , D - New York , whose committee subpoenaed Biller 's documents , said " The material , I must admit , is very , very disturbing . "
Toyota defends its actions , saying , " We are confident that we have acted appropriately with respect to all product liability litigation . "
Yet so far , the company has fought to keep the documents confidential and away from court cases -- like Pennie Green's .
The Texas native was 17 and driving to see a movie with her cousin when her life instantly changed .
" I did n't make it , " she said .
A car turned in front of Green and , with no time to react , her 1997 Camry swerved , rolled over and landed upside down .
" When I opened my eyes , my nose felt like it was almost touching my belly button I was so curled up . "
Green never walked again .
In 2005 she filed suit against Toyota , claiming the roof was defective because it did n't withstand the weight of the car like it should have .
Biller defended Toyota in that rollover case , brought by Green 's lawyer , Jeff Embry .
" We certainly requested everything that had any relevance to our case at all and , in fact , we had to go to the court to have Toyota ordered to provide their information , " said Embry , who added Toyota provided just enough information to show Toyota vehicles " met the minimum standards . "
Green 's case settled in 2006 for $ 1.5 million .
Included in Biller 's documents is an e-mail he said he sent to his bosses summarizing negotiations .
It says , " TMS [ Toyota Motor Sales USA ] concluded that it would be better to pay a premium to settle this case and avoid producing the ' Books of Knowledge . ' "
Embry said he had no idea how close he'd come to uncovering Toyota 's alleged secrets .
" I think they were very careful to keep design information , very important information in Japan , out of reach of our system as much as possible , " he said .
Although Toyota calls the materials " trade secrets , " Embry said , " That does n't mean that you get to keep them a secret from the court system . "
So why , if Biller knew a judge had ordered all information produced , did n't he produce it ?
He said he tried but was stopped by a superior who told him , " You have to protect the client at all costs . "
" Even if that includes , " Biller asked , " committing criminal acts or violating the law ? "
The answer , Biller said , was yes .
Did he break the law ?
" No , I did as much as I could as a lawyer for a client to not break the law , " he said .
" I wrote e-mail after e-mail , memo after memo , explaining the legal obligations Toyota and its affiliates needed to fulfill . "
In response to Biller 's documents and his allegations , Toyota spokeswoman Cindy Knight released this statement : " Mr. Biller continues to make inaccurate and misleading allegations about Toyota 's conduct that we strongly dispute and will continue to fight against vigorously . "
Before leaving Toyota four years ago , Biller had a nervous breakdown caused , he said , by stress .
Still , he said , he is confident his e-mails left a trail showing he tried to change Toyota .
" The documents speak for themselves .
I know what happened .
I know exactly what happened .
I know the names of the people who were responsible for it .
I know where the skeletons are hidden . "
As for Pennie Green , if a judge finds Toyota did hide documents , she said , " all I want is justice for that .
They just need to take responsibility for their actions . "
Embry has filed a motion in Texas with the state 's 18th District Court to investigate whether Toyota unlawfully withheld evidence in Green 's case and should be held in contempt .
So far Toyota has fought successfully to keep Biller 's documents sealed and Biller from testifying .
He was right .
In the grocery section of the Raynham supercenter , 45 minutes south of Boston , I had trouble believing I was in a Walmart .
The very reasonable - looking produce , most of it loose and nicely organized , was in black plastic bins ( as in British supermarkets , where the look is common ; the idea is to make the colors pop ) .
The first thing I saw , McIntosh apples , came from the same local orchard whose apples I ’d just seen in the same bags at Whole Foods .
The bunched beets were from Muranaka Farm , whose beets I often buy at other markets — but these looked much fresher .
The service people I could find ( it was n’t hard ) were unfailingly enthusiastic , though I did wonder whether they got let out at night .
During a few days of tasting , the results were mixed .
Those beets handily beat ( sorry ) ones I ’d just bought at Whole Foods , and compared nicely with beets I ’d recently bought at the farmers ’ market .
But packaged carrots and celery , both organic , were flavorless .
Organic bananas and “ tree ripened ” California peaches , already out of season , were better than the ones in most supermarkets , and most of the Walmart food was cheaper — though when I went to my usual Whole Foods to compare prices for local produce , they were surprisingly similar ( dry goods and dairy products were considerably less expensive at Walmart ) .
Walmart holding its own against Whole Foods ?
This called for a blind tasting .
I conspired with my contrarian friend James McWilliams , an agricultural historian at Texas State University at San Marcos and the author of the new Just Food : Where Locavores Get It Wrong and How We Can Truly Eat Responsibly .
He enlisted his friends at Fino , a restaurant in Austin that pays special attention to where the food it serves comes from , as co-conspirators .
I would buy two complete sets of ingredients , one at Walmart and the other at Whole Foods .
The chef would prepare them as simply as possible , and serve two versions of each course , side by side on the same plate , to a group of local food experts invited to judge .
I started looking into how and why Walmart could be plausibly competing with Whole Foods , and found that its produce - buying had evolved beyond organics , to a virtually unknown program — one that could do more to encourage small and medium - size American farms than any number of well - meaning nonprofits , or the U.S. Department of Agriculture , with its new Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food campaign .
Not even Fishman , who has been closely tracking Walmart ’s sustainability efforts , had heard of it .
“ They do a lot of good things they do n’t talk about , ” he offered .
The program , which Walmart calls Heritage Agriculture , will encourage farms within a day ’s drive of one of its warehouses to grow crops that now take days to arrive in trucks from states like Florida and California .
In many cases the crops once flourished in the places where Walmart is encouraging their revival , but vanished because of Big Agriculture competition .
This is probably the busiest year in Panic ’s history .
This is good .
But a lot of things happening means a high chance that I , the man who lives and breathes Panic and has a giant status board in my head , might not properly explain everything to everyone .
Steve and I realized it was high time we made this Cabel Status Board public … using technology !
So , with partial inspiration , Neven , Steve and I built the Panic Status Board .
Take a secret , sneek peek :
What ’s on the board ?
The idea quickly grew beyond “ Project Status ” , and has become a hub of all sorts of internal Panic information .
What you ’re actually looking at is an internal - only webpage that updates frequently using AJAX which shows :
E - Mail Queue — number of messages / number of days .
Project Status — sorry for the heavy censorship — you know how it is !
Important Countdowns
Revenue — comparing yesterday to the day before , not so insightful ( yet ) .
Live Tri-Met Bus Arrivals — when it ’s time to go home !
The Panic Calendar
Employee Twitter Messages
Any @Panic Twitter Messages — i.e. , be nice !
They go on our screen !
Instant Pay - Off
Les , one of our support guys , said it best after a week : “ That board is like magic . ”
Our support turnaround time is faster than it ’s ever been .
Just the simple act of “ publicizing ” those numbers — not in a cruel way , but a “ where are we at as a group ? ” way — has kept the support process on - task and , I think , made it a bit more like a video game .
( It helps that when all the boxes are at “ zero ” , a virtual bottle of champagne appears on - screen , and a physical one is likely removed from the fridge . )
We ca n’t wait to add more data in the future .
Open bugs ?
Implementation Notes
For the truly curious .
Display : I picked the Samsung 460UXN - 2 professional display for the thin bezel and lack of branding , airport - style .
To my surprise , it had a built - in Windows XP Embedded computer ( boo ) , which meant we did n’t have to waste a machine to drive the display ( yay ) .
We loaded Chrome on it , since it has a nice full - screen view — sadly , that meant we had to lose Safari ’s beautiful text anti-aliasing .
Display Mount : Hard to find a vertical mount !
Wound up with the Premier Mounts RFM , and like it .
Support Queue : I ’m weird , and PHP IMAP libraries felt too heavy for just getting message counts , so I decided to do raw IMAP protocol calls over a socket .
Bus Arrivals : this is using the fantastic Tri-Met real - time REST API .
Calendar : Steve used the PHP iCalendar library to parse our group Mac OS X Server calendar .
Twitter : feeds use Twitter ’s simple ( little - known ? ) blogger JSON service .
HTML / CSS : Neven says , “ This baby is all WebKit candy .
The only images here are the icons .
The rounded corners , the gradients , the animation – all CSS .
Learn - webkit - transform and love it !
Oh , I tried using Google Chart for the support graph , but it was n’t flexible enough .
Our little graph is infinitely scalable and stretchable . ”
From start to finish , this was about a three - week project .
And no , it did n’t slow down development on [ insert the app you want the most here ] .
Check the board !
PS : For one full year I ’ve been promising a blog about the “ new ” office .
If you can believe this , we ’re still waiting on a guy to finish processing a couple of nice QTVR ’s of the office under construction .
With any luck , he ’ll be done soon , and I ’ll start writing …
Education Secretary Arne Duncan signaled Monday the Obama administration ’s intention to step up enforcement of civil rights laws that apply to schools and colleges , many of which are often ignored .
In remarks delivered in Selma , Ala , timed to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the marches in which civil rights protesters were brutally attacked by police , Secretary Duncan said , “ The truth is that , in the last decade , the Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) has not been as vigilant as it should have been in combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities .
But that is about to change ....
We are going to reinvigorate civil rights enforcement . ”
In particular , Duncan discussed the Education Department ’s plan to issue guidance letters to schools across the United States , as well as its intention to conduct numerous compliance reviews around issues like discipline and equal access to educational opportunities .
He highlighted certain indicators that point to inequities existing today :
• Upon finishing high school , white students are about six times more likely to be college - ready in biology than African - American students .
In algebra , they ’re four - plus times more likely .
• Just 12 percent of high schools produce half the dropouts in America .
Three - fourths of African - American and Latino come from those schools .
• African - American students without disabilities are more than three times as likely to be expelled as their white peers .
Duncan also pointed to a Denver Post investigation that showed that three - quarters of teachers who had been let go and had trouble finding another teaching job over the past four years were placed in high - poverty schools .
That last issue – access to good teachers – is one that Amy Wilkins would like to see the department pay particular attention to .
Ms. Wilkins is a vice president of the Education Trust , which works to close the achievement gap .
Research shows that good teaching is important to success in school .
Wilkins also says that she hopes the department will not only try to enforce existing laws better through the OCR , but also work to keep civil rights and equity issues central to future legislation , such as the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind .
The department plans to initiate 38 compliance reviews this year , although Russlynn Ali , assistant secretary of education for civil rights , declined to name which districts will be the focus , saying that the department has to follow a notification process .
In a conference call with reporters , Ms. Ali said , “ You can expect to see our compliance reviews be a little broader in terms of issues ” than in the past .
The OCR , she said , will also be issuing 17 guidance letters to schools over a wide range of civil rights issues , including disabilities , access to math and science ( or STEM ) courses , sexual violence , and food allergies .
Rather than just determining whether a district complies with the letter of the law in certain areas , the department will look at what the outcomes are for students , Duncan said in the conference call .
“ This is really about us trying to close achievement gaps , ” he said .
“ We do n’t know what it will mean until we see it in operation , but it ’s good talk , ” says Gary Orfield , a professor at University of California in Los Angeles and co-director of the Civil Rights Project .
“ A lot of civil rights enforcement is done by signals from Washington about whether people need to pay attention to civil rights or not , and there have been no signals from Washington for a decade that civil rights is important . ”
Professor Orfield says he hopes the administration will make a concentrated effort on issues like segregation – which has grown harder to make strides in after a 2007 Supreme Court case restricted the ways that districts can use race in determining which schools students attend .
( For more on that case , click here . )
He also hopes it will follow up the tough rhetoric with real repercussions for districts that do n’t comply , such as withholding funding .
Civil rights laws for schools in the past have been “ a little like an income - tax law where nobody will ever be sanctioned , ” says Orfield .
“ They ’re turning on the auditing button again . ”
VATICAN CITY , March 5 ( UPI ) -- A French nun 's return to illness could delay the canonization of Pope John Paul II .
Pope Benedict XVI put his predecessor on the fast track for sainthood almost immediately , and there had been speculation John Paul would be beatified on Oct. 16 , the anniversary of his election to the papacy , the Guardian reports .
The Vatican has now scheduled the canonization of six saints on Oct. 17 , which would bar a beatification the day before .

To become a saint requires evidence of posthumous miracles .
Sister Marie Simon - Pierre said three years ago she had been relieved of the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease after praying to John Paul , who also suffered from Parkinson's .
Now , a Polish newspaper , Rzeczpospolita , reports Simon - Pierre 's symptoms have returned .
The newspaper also said her doctor , on his Web site , suggested she did not suffer from Parkinson 's but from a disease with the same symptoms that is known to go into remission .
Vatican sources told the Guardian a panel had been scheduled to meet in April to examine Simon - Pierre 's reported cure .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been visiting the US amid one of the most serious rows between the two allies in recent decades .
Israel angered both the US and the Palestinians last week by announcing it was pushing ahead with building in a Jewish area in occupied East Jerusalem earlier this month as Vice - President Joe Biden was visiting .
Palestinians feel Israel is squeezing them out of the city where they eventually want their future capital , and withdrew in anger from scheduled US - brokered indirect peace talks .
The international community considers East Jerusalem to be occupied territory .
Building on occupied land is illegal under international law .
Israelis and an American on the streets of Jerusalem give their views on US - Israeli relations .
OSNAT SCHWARTZ , LAWYER , 58 Things look bad now between Israel and the US .
The problem started a year ago when Obama , without enough experience , asked Israel to freeze all settlement building .
He announced it so strongly at first , which put the Arabs in the position that 'we do n't have to do anything , Obama will do the job for us ' .
I think that his people have realised that it was a big mistake tactically .
Mr Netanyahu has n't handled it well enough , but it all started with Obama .
His administration tried to show that now it 's a ' Palestinian America ' , that it 's not like it used to be .
I agree with Mr Netanyahu that building in Jerusalem is just like building in Tel Aviv .
There 's no question about it .
But I think right now , all building should be frozen , just to give the negotiations a chance .
ELI SHALEV , INSURANCE AGENT , 57 I live in Gilo , a Jewish settlement [ on the southern edge of Jerusalem ] , and I 'm from the left wing of Israeli society .
I think we need to make a distinction between Arab neighbourhoods and Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem .
It 's OK to build in Jewish ones , like Gilo , Ramot , Ramat Shlomo - Jewish people have to live somewhere .
But I think our government made a mistake in building in the heart of Arab neighbourhoods , like Sheikh Jarrah [ where right - wing groups have won court battles over land ownership to have Palestinian families evicted ] .
I hope Mr Netanyahu 's visit has improved relations with the US , but I 'm not sure .
Yesterday they approved a new building in Sheikh Jarrah - the Shepherd Hotel .
It 's stupid .
I hope Mr Obama will push Israel further .
SASHA KARASOV , STUDENT , 20 Even if now there are some problems between Israel and America , I do n't think they will continue .
Israel is like a little part of America , it 's almost the same country .
I agree with Barack Obama on settlements .
I think it is n't right that the Jewish government is trying to push the Arabs from the east of Jerusalem .
We need to live in peace .
If the Arabs closed the road to the Jewish part of the Old City , it would be the same thing for us - the Arabs are angry and I understand them .
The American pressure will make a difference .
I think we will find something that will be good for both Arabs and Jews .
YOACH IVRY , TEACHER , 55 I do n't think there is a crisis in Israeli - US relations .
We have the same interests in the world .
Now the big problem is what will happen with Iran .
The settlement problem is a very small problem - but some people want to make it into a big problem .
In a few weeks , the problem between us will be solved .
Israel is a democracy .
Mr Netanyahu can't just stop the building [ in East Jerusalem ] .
The people here have rights under the law in Israel .
It takes many years to build new areas in Jerusalem .
But anyway , at the moment the building is not the main problem .
Mr Obama is good for the US .
I do n't know if he 's good for Israel .
MARILYN KATZ , RETIRED , 66 I hope that the relationship between Israel and America gets better .
I know it will , and will always survive .
I kind of agree with Mrs Clinton [ that the Israeli announcement that 1,600 homes had been approved for East Jerusalem while Vice President Joe Biden was visiting was ' insulting ' ] , but I do n't want to say it too loud .
I do n't think Israel has the right to say anything bad against America .
America 's always helped us ; they 've always been on our side .
I 'm really on the fence about building in East Jerusalem .
I lived in Efrat [ a West Bank settlement ] for 16 years , which is considered ' over the green line ' .
But quite honestly , if I was born and grew up in Deheisha [ a Palestinian refugee camp near Bethlehem ]
I would hate the Jewish people also .
It 's a place where people live in poverty .
I understand the feelings .
Yet I 'm an orthodox Jewish woman and I can't leave Israel .
MOSHE SARUDI , SHOP MANAGER , 25 Israel and America has had a very good relationship in the past , and I think now it 's not as bad as everybody thinks .
I live in Ramat Shlomo [ where the 1,600 controversial homes are planned ] .
The plans were first worked on a long time ago , but when Joe Biden came to Israel , the left wing made a lot of noise about it .
Israel as a country needs to build as much as we can , but if it bothers so many people , we should stop the building for a while and try to talk .
But I think that if people want to talk , and make peace , they need to stop making excuses .
If we stop building and the Palestinians are still looking for excuses , then that 's different .
I really want two states , but I do n't know if it will ever happen .
Throughout history , people were always just looking for excuses not to make peace .
PATTY MOSS , 54 , FUNDRAISER FOR CHARITIES
Ms Moss is a Jewish American who visits Israel regularly on business
The relationship between Israel and the US is not going well at all .
President Obama has an agenda that is contrary to the best interests of Israel .
I think his naivety about the Middle East is abysmal , and as a result he has put Israel on the defensive .
He is responsible for souring the relationship .
Netanyahu has done a fairly good job of handling the crisis that Obama brought to his doorstep .
When Netanyahu first went to the US , he was received extremely rudely .
Mr Obama set the standard for the relationship , so he can hardly complain that Biden had a similar reception .
I 'm undecided about building in East Jerusalem .
It 's a very difficult situation .
But the big issue is not the building , it is the relationship that Obama started with a slap .

Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) introduced a constitutional amendment today to overrule a recent Supreme Court decision on campaign spending .
The court ruled 5 - 4 last month in Citizens United v. FEC that Congress cannot regulate independent expenditures by corporations and possibly labor unions .
The ruling could dramatically increase third party spending on elections .
Dodd 's amendment , co-sponsored by Sen. Tom Udall ( D - N.M. ) would explicitly grant Congress the authority to regulate campaign fundraising and expenditures for federal elections .
The amendment would also let states regular such activity in their own elections .
" I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court ’s conclusion that money is speech , and that corporations should be treated the same as individual Americans when it comes to protected , fundamental speech rights , ” Dodd said in a statement .
Dodd and Udall said they will also support " interim legislative efforts " to damper the impact of the ruling , including requirements that corporations disclose their campaign spending .
To pass , Dodd 's amendment must pass both Houses with a two - thirds majority and be ratified by three - quarters of the states .
China 's Multi-Billion Dollar Renewable Energy Program Set for Launch Soon
March 7th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
China is reportedly planning to produce 15 % of its electricity from low - carbon technology by 2020 , and to reduce it ’s carbon intensity by 40 - 45 % from the 2005 level .
[ social_buttons ]
Zhang Guobao , head of the National Energy Administration , told the government - owned newspaper China Daily this last week that a national program consisting of billions of dollars of investment in wind , solar and nuclear power would be launched sometime soon .
Zhang said that this program will stimulate fast and dramatic action in the renewable energy sector over the next five years .
“ Power projects take a long time to get up and running , and we are basically allowed five years to complete them although it is a 10 - year programme , ” he told the paper .
“ Otherwise , the facilities can not be put into use by 2020 . ”
Beyond this major plus for renewable energy and renewable energy investors in China , China ’s top legislature — the National People ’s Congress — also recently changed its renewable energy law to require that power grid companies buy 100 % of the electricity produced from renewable energy generators .
A key to making use of these renewable energy sources is a smarter grid , of course .
Noticing the great advancement of renewable energy and smart grids in China , IBM just recently announced the opening of a new $ 40 million “ Energy & Utilities Solutions Lab ” in Beijing .
Brad Gammons , vice president of IBM ’s Global Energy & Utilities Industry , said that their interest in the Chinese market is due to that fact that China is “ pursuing smart grids as aggressively or more aggressively than any other country in the world right now . ”
As I ’ve discussed previously on CleanTechnica , Obama is aware that “ the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy , ” but he is not the sole person in charge of bringing the US to the top ( he needs some help from the media and Congress , at least ) and China seems to be off to a quick lead with some very big plans for the coming years .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
D.C. residents are lucky to have the craft beer selection we enjoy , and I ’m reminded as much every time I walk into a good bar or store .
But if you drink lots of beer ( I call it “ research ” ) the selection can be maddening .
Though my heart is in it , I just do n’t have the constitution to try every good beer at a restaurant with , say , eight taps and a fetching bottle list .
Such are the problems in my life .
Enter the side - by - side tasting .
Every now and then , my friends and I convene around a dinner table for a beer tasting with a mission :
We choose one style , like IPA or stout , and taste each one “ blind . ”
( More on this in a minute . )
We compare notes , then reveal which beers were which .
Invariably , some of us discover new favorites .
If those old household commercials have taught us anything , it ’s that comparison is the best way to test something .
When you taste beers side - by - side and discuss them with friends , your impressions are more likely to stay with you and inform your buying decisions the next time you pick up a six - pack .
It ’s fun , educational , and just a bit nerdy .
But while I opt for the full - on , annotated geek - out , all you really need is friends , glasses , and beer .
Here are some tips to get you started :
Pick a beer style and stick to it .
You ’ll learn more by comparing stouts to stouts , lagers to lagers , etc .
Taste blind ( not literally ) .
Put the bottles in numbered brown bags so you can try each one without bias .
It ’s surprising how different some old favorites taste when you ’re not expecting them .
If you really want to get scientific , do n’t write on the bags — instead have a second person ( not the bagger ) assign a random letter to each number and write down a key .
That way not even the pourer will know which beer is which .
Cleanse your palate .
In the Pepsi Challenge , the two sodas were indistinguishable without eating an oyster cracker in between .
The snacky food should be light and minimal , like water crackers or saltines .
I prefer to skip the food altogether and sip some interstitial club soda .
Warm it up !
Beers should generally be drunk at temps in the 40s or 50s .
Forget the bullshit about “ frost - brewed ” and “ coldest - tasting ” — you ca n’t taste beer at 34 degrees .
Lagers should spend a few minutes outside the fridge , dark beers and Belgians can warm up even longer .
Six beers or less , and 3 - ounce pours .
OK , these numbers are arbitrary , but the point is , after a few tastes your palate gets tired and flavors start to run together .
Think back to the last beer festival you went to .
How well do you remember the third beer you tasted ?
How about the seventh or eighth ?
Do n’t lose your notes .
Sounds obvious , right ?
Well , try remembering that when you break rule # 5 and drink a dozen beers .
Tasting beer is fun , but you ’ll take more out of it if you do n’t lose your notes … and your phone … and your keys … .

CHICKPEAS are often cooked with spinach , from India to the New World .
But in southern Spain , they are mostly made with chorizo .
Combine these ideas , and you have a rich , deep , full - flavored stew perfect for a fast dinner on a cold night .
The texture of the dish is heightened by drying the cooked chickpeas between paper towels , then shallow - frying them in olive oil .
Instead of being mealy , they become crunchy - mealy  a change most people , I think , will like .
Once the chickpeas begin to brown  this will take a little while , 10 minutes or so  you add chorizo ( Spanish , please ; not the fresher , softer Mexican kind ) .
As the chorizo cooks , its color , which comes mostly from pimentón , will leach out a bit , turning the oil a nice orange and flavoring the chickpeas .
When the beans and chorizo are crisp , you scoop them out and put spinach in the pan with some sherry , a classic Andalusian ingredient .
The spinach will release its liquid , which will quickly evaporate , leaving behind not only a nice soft green but a deep iron -y flavor .
The losses at CNN continued a pattern in place for much of the last year , as the network trailed its competitors in every prime - time hour .
( CNN still easily beats MSNBC in the daytime hours , but those are less lucrative in advertising money , and both networks are far behind Fox News at all hours . )

About the only break from the bad news for CNN was that March was not as bad as February , when the network had its worst single month in its recent history , finishing behind not only Fox News and MSNBC , but also its sister network HLN — and even CNBC , which had Olympics programming that month .
CNN executives have steadfastly said that they will not change their approach to prime - time programs , which are led by hosts not aligned with any partisan point of view .
But the numbers are stark :
For the network ’s longest - running host , Larry King , who has always been regarded at CNN as the centerpiece of prime time because he drew the biggest audiences at 9 p.m. , the quarter was his worst ever .
Mr. King ’s audience dropped 43 percent for the quarter and 52 percent in March .
He dropped to 771,000 viewers for the quarter from 1.34 million in 2009 .
More alarming perhaps , Mr. King , whose show has been regularly eclipsed by Rachel Maddow ’s on MSNBC ( and is almost quadrupled by Sean Hannity ’s show on Fox ) , is now threatened by a new host , Joy Behar on HLN ( formerly Headline News . )

The basic formula for gaining and losing weight is well known : a pound of fat equals 3,500 calories .
That simple equation has fueled the widely accepted notion that weight loss does not require daunting lifestyle changes but “ small changes that add up , ” as the first lady , Michelle Obama , put it last month in announcing a national plan to counter childhood obesity .
In this view , cutting out or burning just 100 extra calories a day — by replacing soda with water , say , or walking to school — can lead to significant weight loss over time : a pound every 35 days , or more than 10 pounds a year .
While it ’s certainly a hopeful message , it ’s also misleading .
Numerous scientific studies show that small caloric changes have almost no long - term effect on weight .
When we skip a cookie or exercise a little more , the body ’s biological and behavioral adaptations kick in , significantly reducing the caloric benefits of our effort .
But can small changes in diet and exercise at least keep children from gaining weight ?
While some obesity experts think so , mathematical models suggest otherwise .
Saul Loeb / Agence France - Presse — Getty Images
As a recent commentary in The Journal of the American Medical Association noted , the “ small changes ” theory fails to take the body ’s adaptive mechanisms into account .
The rise in children ’s obesity over the past few decades ca n’t be explained by an extra 100 - calorie soda each day , or fewer physical education classes .
Skipping a cookie or walking to school would barely make a dent in a calorie imbalance that goes “ far beyond the ability of most individuals to address on a personal level , ” the authors wrote — on the order of walking 5 to 10 miles a day for 10 years .
This does n’t mean small improvements are futile — far from it .
But people need to take a realistic view of what they can accomplish .
“ As clinicians , we celebrate small changes because they often lead to big changes , ” said Dr. David Ludwig , director of the Optimal Weight for Life program at Children ’s Hospital Boston and a co-author of the JAMA commentary .
“ An obese adolescent who cuts back TV viewing from six to five hours each day may then go on to decrease viewing much more .
However , it would be entirely unrealistic to think that these changes alone would produce substantial weight loss . ”
Why would n’t they ?
The answer lies in biology .
A person ’s weight remains stable as long as the number of calories consumed does n’t exceed the amount of calories the body spends , both on exercise and to maintain basic body functions .
As the balance between calories going in and calories going out changes , we gain or lose weight .
But bodies do n’t gain or lose weight indefinitely .
Eventually , a cascade of biological changes kicks in to help the body maintain a new weight .
As the JAMA article explains , a person who eats an extra cookie a day will gain some weight , but over time , an increasing proportion of the cookie ’s calories also goes to taking care of the extra body weight .
Eventually , the body adjusts and stops gaining weight , even if the person continues to eat the cookie .
Similar factors come into play when we skip the extra cookie .
We may lose a little weight at first , but soon the body adjusts to the new weight and requires fewer calories .
Regrettably , however , the body is more resistant to weight loss than weight gain .
Hormones and brain chemicals that regulate your unconscious drive to eat and how your body responds to exercise can make it even more difficult to lose the weight .
You may skip the cookie but unknowingly compensate by eating a bagel later on or an extra serving of pasta at dinner .
“ There is a much bigger picture than parsing out the cookie a day or the Coke a day , ” said Dr. Jeffrey M. Friedman , head of Rockefeller University ’s molecular genetics lab , which first identified leptin , a hormonal signal made by the body ’s fat cells that regulates food intake and energy expenditure .
“ If you ask anyone on the street , ‘ Why is someone obese ? , ’ they ’ll say , ‘ They eat too much . ’ ”
“ That is undoubtedly true , ” he continued , “ but the deeper question is why do they eat too much ?
It ’s clear now that there are many important drivers to eat and that it is not purely a conscious or higher cognitive decision . ”
This is not to say that the push for small daily changes in eating and exercise is misguided .
James O. Hill , director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado Denver , says that while weight loss requires significant lifestyle changes , taking away extra calories through small steps can help slow and prevent weight gain .
In a study of 200 families , half were asked to replace 100 calories of sugar with a noncaloric sweetener and walk an extra 2,000 steps a day .
The other families were asked to use pedometers to record their exercise but were not asked to make diet changes .
During the six - month study , both groups of children showed small but statistically significant drops in body mass index ; the group that also cut 100 calories had more children who maintained or reduced body mass and fewer children who gained excess weight .
The study , published in 2007 in Pediatrics , did n’t look at long - term benefits .
But Dr. Hill says it suggests that small changes can keep overweight kids from gaining even more excess weight .
“ Once you ’re trying for weight loss , you ’re out of the small - change realm , ” he said .
“ But the small - steps approach can stop weight gain . ”
While small steps are unlikely to solve the nation ’s obesity crisis , doctors say losing a little weight , eating more heart - healthy foods and increasing exercise can make a meaningful difference in overall health and risks for heart disease and diabetes .
“ I ’m not saying throw up your hands and forget about it , ” Dr. Friedman said .
“ Instead of focusing on weight or appearance , focus on people ’s health .
There are things people can do to improve their health significantly that do n’t require normalizing your weight . ”
Dr. Ludwig still encourages individuals to make small changes , like watching less television or eating a few extra vegetables , because those shifts can be a prelude to even bigger lifestyle changes that may ultimately lead to weight loss .
But he and others say that reversing obesity will require larger shifts — like regulating food advertising to children and eliminating government subsidies that make junk food cheap and profitable .
“ We need to know what we ’re up against in terms of the basic biological challenges , and then design a campaign that will truly address the problem in its full magnitude , ” Dr. Ludwig said .
“ If we just expect that inner-city child to exercise self - control and walk a little bit more , then I think we ’re in for a big disappointment . ”

Remember when Canada used to take morally courageous stands on issues and was well - respected for it ?
Remember when it was America on the wrong side of so many issues , rather than Canada ?
And remember when the lust for profits did n't necessarily trump all else in every decision this country made ?
Well , I 've got something new for you to all remember and it's something , when the time comes , I sure hope no one forgets :
When you read about the complete collapse of the Atlantic bluefin tuna population and its eventual extinction in a few short years from now , remember that it was Canada , as much as any other nation ( aside from Japan ) , that was responsible .
Who gives a * $ %# about bluefin tuna , you ask ?
Well , short answer , certainly not Canada .
And if you did ask such a question then you 're most likely a strong supporter of this country 's current Conservative government and you probably should just stop reading here .
However , for those of you who do care but do n't necessarily follow all the goings on at meetings of groups like the U.N. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) , let me fill you in .
CITES is currently in the middle of an important meeting and just today ( March 18th , 2010 ) voted on a proposal to ban the export of bluefin tuna .
The proposal failed .
Some would argue that in order to let the stock replenish itself what is actually needed is a complete ban on catching these huge fish , but , sadly , even with both the European Union and America backing it , not even today 's proposed limited ban was able to pass .
And what about Canada ?
Well , the Canadian government 's position is quite clear and can be summed up rather succinctly ( and I paraphrase ) : " Screw the tuna , let 's make some more money while we still can ! "
Bluefin stocks may be down 85 % from their peak and on an unbridled path to almost - certain extinction , but why let that spoil a few more good years of fishing , right ?
Seriously , it was really terrific to see the world once again step up to the plate and forcefully say " Let 's do nothing " .
Just like at the U.N. climate change conference in Copenhagen a few months back .
Consistent To A Fault
The one thing you can say about this Stephen Harper - led government is that it is quite consistent .
That is , when it comes to the environment our government is consistently opposed to doing anything concrete to make things better .
Not if it 'll cost us a thing economically .
Four years ago it was a ban on bottom trawling that our country took a bold , strong stand against .
And it was an especially brave stand when you consider that the world 's fish stocks are forecast to disappear by the year 2050 and that bottom trawling is considered one of the main contributing causes .
Why would Canada not care about such a thing , you ask ?
Well , simply put , because Canada 's fishing fleet still makes big profits off of bottom trawling , of course .
Even George W. Bush , of all people , supported that ban .
And it really takes a lot to have George W. Bush make you look like a heartless environmental degrader .
But that 's exactly what happened .
In fact , in recent years many things about Canada 's environmental record have been making America 's record look quite good in comparison .
For instance , at this very same CITES conference this week Canada voted against a U.S. proposal to ban the international sale of polar bears skins , another animal on the decline that it seems Canada cares little about .
Then there 's the collapsing Fraser River sockeye salmon population , a collapse linked by many scientists to the fish farms dotting the B.C. coast .
Fish farms , it should be noted , that the government seems to consider untouchable .
I 'm starting to wonder whether there 's any ban this country would support , at least if there was a buck to be made in opposing it .
Of course , the most glaring of all this country 's environmental crimes is the lack of government control , or even concern , when it comes to that infamous , globally - despised wasteland known as the oil sands ( the single largest contributor to our title as " The World 's Worst Per Capita Climate Change Polluters " - and what a magnificent title that is ! ) .
Canada 's overall environmental record may rank as the worst among the G - 8 nations , and the WWF ( World Wildlife Fund ) may have recently ranked Canada as the " worst climate performer amongst [ the ] top 10 greenhouse gas emitters " and " 56th out of 57 countries evaluated , ahead of only Saudi Arabia " , but who really cares since , as Dave Chappelle playing Rick James on Chappelle 's
Show would say , " We 're rich , bitch ! "
Jaded Japan
Sure , you can say Japan , which imports 80 per cent of the Atlantic bluefin catch and has led the opposition to the ban , is the main villain in this whole tuna story , but , let 's face it , Japan has long been a joke when it comes to anything involving conservation and the sea .
After all , Japan 's government is , at this very minute , allowing its school kids to be fed toxic mercury - laced dolphin meat labeled as " whale " ( as was discussed in last year 's great documentary The Cove ) .
We 're also talking about the same government that is ferocious in its commitment to slaughtering a thousand or more whales every year in the name of " research " .
Research that has absolutely no scientific value .
I mean , really , what do you expect from such a country ?
At least they 're opposing the ban on the grounds that they can't do without their beloved " hon- maguro " sushi and sashimi ( that is , at least until it becomes extinct in a few years ) , while countries like Canada are simply opposed to the ban due to nothing more than good ol ' fashioned notions of greed and lust for profit .
Morally Bankrupt
You can scoff at me all you like , but some of us can actually still remember a time when Canada was n't completely morally bankrupt .
A time , say , in the 1990s , when we were n't on the wrong side of history on just about every single environmental issue .
At this point it almost would n't surprise me if our government came out in support of tiger hunting .
Or lead - based paint .
Or the export of asbestos ( oh , I forgot , as I reported in my Top Ten Things To Love and Hate About Canada piece , we already do that ) .
Certainly , Stephen Harper and his Conservatives are chiefly to blame for many of these reprehensible stands , but some of this predates their rise to power .
The fact is Canada has been on a slow road to environmental pariah status for years now .
The State Religion
Think back to the complete inaction on the Atlantic cod fishery 20 years ago that led to the catastrophic collapse of that once - thriving fish population .
In fact , it feels like we 're experiencing an almost identical case of negligent inaction with the bluefin .
It really feels like deja vu .
Clearly there 's really only one state religion in Canada and it's called Greed .
The planet be damned .
Future generations be damned .
And the bluefin tuna ?
Well , once again , it can go % &$* itself for all the Canadian government cares .
Just like the Atlantic cod .
And we all know how well that case of short - term thinking worked out .
What 's that saying again , the one about not learning from history ?

DADT repeal a ‘ radical social experiment ’
Oliver North , the former Marine implicated in the Iran - Contra scandal and current Fox News host , says allowing gays to serve openly in the military will lead to same - sex marriages in the military and the admission of pedophiles to the armed forces .
In an interview with Fox ’s Sean Hannity Thursday , North discussed what he sees as the implications of repealing the 17 - year - old “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” policy .

“ Now , here ’s what ’s next .
NAMBLA members , same - sex marriages , ” North said , referring to the North American Man-Boy Love Association , a group that advocates for pedophilia .
“ Are chaplains in the US military going to be required to perform those kinds of rituals ?
Do they [ pedophiles and homosexuals ] get government housing ? ”
North , who hosts Fox ’s War Stories , told Hannity that the effort to repeal DADT amounts to a “ stunning assault on the all - volunteer military , the very best in the world .
Barack Obama now intents to treat them like lab rats in a radical social experiment , and it can be very , very detrimental . ”
Citing the legal statute that forbids gays from serving openly in the military , North said that repealing DADT “ would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale , good order and discipline , and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability . ”
But “ those claims are heavily undermined by the fact that other countries allow gay men and lesbians to serve in the military , and many have said it has not created problems , ” reports media watchdog MediaMatters .
Writing at ThinkProgress , Igor Volsky says , “ The irony of a convicted felon who lied about diverting proceeds from arms sales to a rebel group in Nicaragua supporting a policy that forces gay and lesbian servicemen to lie about their sexual orientation was lost on both Hannity and North . ”

Volsky also criticized Hannity and North for not mentioning that Adm .
Mike Mullen has voiced his support for repealing the anti-gay law .
That “ would have forced North to condemn [ Mullen ] for treating the troops ‘ like lab rats in a radical social experiment . ' ”
The following video was broadcast on Fox News ’ Hannity , Feb. 4 , 2010 , and uploaded to the Web by ThinkProgress .
It might not have the pretty red handle or the Swiss Cross , but this Roman army knife did the trick for one rich traveler at the height of the empire .
The silver gadget included a knife , spoon , fork , spatula , a toothpick and a retractable spike — thought to be used to harvest yummy snails from their shell .
The 3in x 6in ( 8 cm x 15 cm ) knife was excavated from the Mediterranean area more than 20 years ago and was obtained by the museum in 1991 .
The unique item is among dozens of artifacts exhibited in a newly refurbished Greek and Roman antiquities gallery at the Fitzwilliam Museum , in Cambridge .
Experts believe it may have been carried by a wealthy traveler , who will have had the item custom made .
It ’s certainly not as easy to carry as a keychain knife , but it looks like it would do the trick — I ’ll take mine with a spork .

If you are a fan of horror movies , you would know how cool the classic Child ’s Play movies are , for they have entertained and scared the hell out of generations of kids and adults alike , with the scary antagonist Chucky the doll coming to our minds .
Chucky is one of the most terrifying of all the movie antagonists ‘ cos he provokes the fear of dolls within you .
Considering how dolls are represented in voodoo and how people perceive dolls may sometimes be possessed by malevolent spirits , Chucky truly scared the hell out of most people .
Debbie has baked a really scary looking Chucky Cake that looks as realistic as possible .
The cake not only looks scary , but also quite hideous ( in a cool way ) with all the stitches , wounds and the metallic weapon .
The Chucky Doll cake measures two feet tall and is a great way to scare kids at a birthday party .
I am sure baking a cake like that not only needs one to be artistic and creative , but also quite patient and well heeled .
I am not sure if the Chucky Cake is the most delicious cake in the world , but it certainly seems to be the scariest !
Talking about scary dolls , you might also want to take a look at the Michael Jackson Thriller Doll , but unfortunately you ca n’t eat it .
From shame to game in one hundred years :
An economic model of the rise in premarital sex and its de-stigmatisation
Jeremy Greenwood , Jesús Fernández - Villaverde , Nezih Guner
Attitudes to sex have changed dramatically over the last hundred years .
This column presents a model where socialisation – the passing on of norms and ideologies by parents and institutions such as the church or state – is determined by the technological environment in which people live .
Contraception has reduced the chance of unwanted pregnancies from premarital sex , and this in turn has changed social attitudes .
The last one hundred years have witnessed a revolution in sexual behaviour .
In 1900 , only 6 % of US women would have engaged in premarital sex by the age of 19 , compared to 75 % today ( see figure 1 ) .
Public acceptance of premarital sex has reacted with a lag ; in 1968 only 15 % of women had a permissive attitude towards the act , despite the fact that about 40 % of 19 year - old females had had premarital sex .
The number with a permissive attitude had jumped to 45 % by 1983 , a time when 73 % of 19 year olds were sexually experienced .
Figure 1 . Premarital sex , attitudes , and practice
Beyond the evolution and acceptance of sexual behaviour over time , there are relevant cross-sectional differences across females .
In the US , the odds of a girl having premarital sex decline with family income .
For instance , in the bottom decile 70 % of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have had premarital sex versus 47 % in the top decile .
Similarly , 68 % of adolescent girls whose family income lies in the upper quartile would feel " very upset " if they got pregnant , compared to 46 % of those whose family income is in the lower quartile .
The consequences for public policy of these observations are important .
Higher fractions of women engaging in premarital sex usually bring about more teenage childbearing , even when better contraceptives are available ( see Figure 2 ) .
Teenage pregnancies have unfortunate consequences for the welfare of children – see for example Hoffman and Maynard ( 2008 ) .
Similarly , the spread of sexually - transmitted diseases , such as HIV / AIDS , is a positive function of the proportion of young adults engaging in sex .
As a way to reduce teenage pregnancies and the prevalence of sexually - transmitted diseases , governments have funded programs aimed at promoting abstinence or creating good “ social norms . ”
Figure 2 . Effectiveness in contraception and out - of - wedlock births to teenage girls
The idea
These observations call out for a more thorough understanding of what drives the change in social norms and behaviour and what type of policies will be more effective in improving social welfare .
Fortunately , there is a long tradition in economics of studying these issues , going back at least to Gary Becker ( 1976 ) .
After Becker ’s pioneering work a literature has developed on modelling the formation of preferences , beliefs , and norms .
For instance , Becker and Mulligan ( 1997 ) , Bisin and Verdier ( 2001 ) , or Doepke and Zilibotti ( 2008 ) have emphasised how parents mould , at a cost of time and money , their children ’s preferences .
Our work follows this tradition .
The fundamental idea is that young adults act in their own best interest when deciding to engage in premarital sex .
They weigh the benefits from the joy of sex against its cost – the possibility of having an out - of - wedlock birth .
An out - of - wedlock birth has many potential costs for young women ; it may reduce her educational and job opportunities ; it may damage her prospects in the marriage market ; she may feel shame or stigma .
Over time the chance of becoming pregnant – the failure rate – from premarital sex has declined , due to the two facts that contraception has improved , and that more teens are using some method ( Figure 2 ) .
The cost of engaging in premarital sex has fallen as a result .
This leads to the paradoxical situation where , despite the fact that the efficacy of contraception has increased , so has the number of out - of - wedlock births .
The stigma that a young woman incurs from premarital sex may drop over time too .
Suppose that parents instil a proscription on premarital sex into their daughters ' moral fibres .
As the noted sociologist James Coleman ( 1990 , p. 295 ) nicely put it , “ the strategy is to change the self and let the new self decide what is right and what is wrong ( for example , by imagining what one 's mother would say about a particular action ) . ”
Parents do this because they want the best for their daughter .
They know that an out - of - wedlock birth will damage their daughter 's welfare .
As contraception improves , the need for the proscription diminishes and with it the amount of parental indoctrination .
The same shift in incentives may also change the moral commands from institutions such as the church and state .
Differences in the costs of an out - of - wedlock birth also explain the cross-sectional observations .
The desire for parents and institutions to " socialise " children – pass on norms , customs , and ideologies – will be smaller the less its impact is on a child 's future well being .
Therefore , there may be little incentive to socialise children at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale because they have nowhere to go in life anyway .
Some quantitative theory
In recent research ( Fernández - Villaverde et al. 2010 ) , we explore these mechanisms , both theoretically and quantitatively , and build an overlapping generations model where parents spend effort on socialising their children .
The concept of socialising children is operationalised by letting a parent influence his offspring 's tastes about an out - of - wedlock birth .
Doing so incurs a cost in terms of effort to the parent .
After socialisation , some offspring will engage in sex , resulting in a percentage of out - of - wedlock births , and others will not .
Of course , when deciding on whether or not to engage in premarital sex , a young teenage girl weighs the joy from sex against the cost of an unwanted pregnancy – the shame incurred and the loss of career or marital prospects .
First , we calibrate the steady state for our model to match some stylised facts for today 's US economy .
In particular , the model economy is consistent with the observations that more educated women are less likely to engage in premarital sex while they are teenagers – see Figure 3 – and that more educated parents spend more time socialising their children – see Figure 4 .
Figure 3 . Cross-sectional relationship between the odds of a girl engaging in premarital sex and her educational background , data and model
Figure 4 . Cross-sectional relationship between the time spent with a daughter and the mother 's educational background , data and model
Second , some transitional dynamics are computed for the situation where society faces a known time path of technological progress in its contraceptive technology .
It is demonstrated that the model – see Figure 5 – can replicate the observed rise in premarital sex and out - of - wedlock births due to a fall in the failure rate , and the associated decline in socialisation .
If socialisation did not change over the years and stayed at its initial 1900 values , then premarital sex would be much less prevalent than it is today – only around 40 % of its current level .
Last , illegitimacy is also costly for institutions such as the church and state , which have typically provided unwed mothers with some form of charity .
We briefly consider a Ramsey - style problem where the church and state tries to influence attitudes in order to minimise the number of out - of - wedlock births net of the cost of socialisation .
The upshot is that indoctrination by the church and state falls over time as contraception becomes more efficient .
Figure 5 .
The decline in socialisation ( time spent with a daughter ) and the rise in out - of - wedlock births , model
Our analysis also connects with the evidence regarding “ ethnic capital ” documented by Borjas ( 1992 ) , Fernández and Fogli ( 2009 ) , and Guiliano ( 2007 ) .
Imagine a young girl who is raised in a society where contraception is not widely available .
Her parents socialise her accordingly .
Now , suppose that at the start of her teenage years the family immigrates to the US .
This teenager should be less promiscuous than an American , because her shame from an out - of - wedlock birth will be greater .
If there is any aspect of habit persistence in preferences across the generations within a family line , this effect will carry over to the girl ’s own children and grandchildren .
Note that the effect will wither away over time , though .
The girl will have less incentive to socialise her own daughters against the perils of premarital sex because the need is less in the US , and thus they will feel less shame from an out - of - wedlock birth , and so on .
Lesson learnt
The great sociologist William Ogburn ( 1964 ) suggested that a large part of social change was a reaction to technological progress .
Our research presents a mechanism where socialisation , by parents and institutions such as the church or state , is determined by the technological environment that people live in .
While a simpler model that focused only on technological advances in contraception could generate the rise in premarital sex without an appeal to the socialisation process , it would miss the dramatic changes in sexual norms that history convincingly documents .
For example , 69 % of all criminal cases in New Haven between 1710 and 1750 were for premarital sex .
Such crimes could be punished by fines , public whippings , and jail terms .
This begs the question of why such draconian measures were initially adopted and then abandoned by parents , churches and states .

Jaromir Jagr : “ I would like to stay in Omsk ” ( Photo © sports.ru )
During an interview with Sovietskiy Sport Jaromir Jagr declared that he would like to spend another season with Avangard Omsk .
Jaromir Jagr : “ I really love Omsk and its inhabitants , their character .
Maybe it ’s strange to hear this from a Czech , and they wo n’t believe me .
But I like everything here .
I would like to stay in Russia , but I want to get something serious next year .
My career will be over soon and thus I can’t waste my chances .
I wanted to win something with Avangard , but we could n’t .
This is my fault too .
I never blame others .
I ’ve always hoped that if I would be playing well , then also other players would perform better .
I ’m not looking for other teams now .
I would like to stay in Avangard , but it ’s not up to me only .
I still do n’t know about my future .
I believe that God will help me in getting another chance .
I do n’t think about the money , that ’s for my agent .
But I will understand if Avangard will reduce its budget .
We did n’t play like we should .
Who can pay big salaries to players which do n’t give results on ice ? ”

I want to make it clear from the outset that I think Opera is great .
I have it installed and use it regularly , but it ’s never become my default browser .
Opera currently holds 2 % of the worldwide desktop market .
It ’s never moved significantly beyond that figure despite a constant rate of innovations from the company .
The market has grown so there are more Opera users , but newer browsers such as Chrome are growing at a considerably faster rate .
Marketing is one reason .
Opera could never match Google ’s advertising budget and the company is based in Norway so it has less impact on the massive US market .
The name and logo are not as recognizable as other web brands either .
However , this has never hindered Opera in the mobile arena .
That is a different market ; there are fewer competitors and Nokia has helped by pre-installing the browser on its phones .
But given Opera is so well entrenched on mobile devices , it ’s a little surprising more people do n’t use the desktop version .
Power = Pain ?
In my opinion , Opera ’s biggest strength is its downfall .
It ’s highly configurable and offers many options — possibly too many .
It takes time and effort to get the best out of the browser .
Opera is also configurable in ways which you do n’t see in other applications .
Perhaps that ’s innovative , but it can lead to confusion .
I ’ve been using the application for many years but I often have difficulty locating the option I need .
For example , version 10.5 hides the menu bar but it ’s easy to show it ( see screenshot ) .
That ’s great — but try and find the “ Hide Menu Bar ” option .
It ’s not in the “ View ” menu , Appearance or Preferences dialogs .
Even the help does n’t tell you that the option appears in the “ File ” menu ?
That may be a minor esoteric quirk , but it ’s an example of how the browser annoys new users .
The Opera - specific terminology rarely helps either — how many people understand that the “ Personal Bar ” is a bookmarks toolbar or that “ Opera Link ” is a synchronization tool ?
Opera is usable from day 1 , but you need to invest time to learn what features are available , how they work , and how they can be configured .
Few people are willing to climb the steep learning curve especially when competing browsers offer an easier and less disorientating experience .
Opera does appeal to a subset of power users , although I still prefer Firefox for ultimate customization .
If Opera is ever to attract a large mainstream audience , the company should :
Address the confusing terminology
That may mean copying other vendor ’s naming conventions , but it ’ll provide an easier user migration path .
Remove lesser - used features from the basic browser
Facilities such as Unite , Notes , some toolbars , Dragonfly , mail and chat could all be switched off by default .
They could still be provided as installation options or plugins .
Simplify the configuration options
“ Show Menu Bar ” should certainly be moved and all options should be logically arranged … why are toolbar settings in both Preferences and Appearances ?
Advanced options could be hidden , but a single tickbox could bring them all back .
Opera deserves a higher market share and the company has reported a 300 % increase in downloads following the introduction of the EU browser choice screen ( although this could be partly because existing users are downloading the new version ) .
However , they have n’t revealed actual figures and I suspect they remain relatively low compared with Chrome and Firefox .
Should Opera change ?
Should it target a larger audience ?
How would you improve the browser ?

The " exceptionally simple theory of everything , " proposed by a surfing physicist in 2007 , does not hold water , says Emory University mathematician Skip Garibaldi .
Garibaldi did the math to disprove the theory , which involves a mysterious structure known as E8 .
The resulting paper , co-authored by physicist Jacques Distler of the University of Texas , will appear in an upcoming issue of Communications in Mathematical Physics .
" The beautiful thing about math and physics is that it is not subjective , " says Garibaldi .
" I wanted a peer - reviewed paper published , so that the scientific literature provides an accurate state of affairs , to help clear up confusion among the lay public on this topic . "
In November of 2007 , physicist Garrett Lisi published an online paper entitled " An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything . "
Lisi spent much of his time surfing in Hawaii , adding a bit of color to the story surrounding the theory .
Although his paper was not peer - reviewed , and Lisi himself commented that his theory was still in development , the idea was widely reported in the media , under attention - grabbing headlines like " Surfer dude stuns physicists with theory of everything . "
Garibaldi was among the skeptics when the theory hit the news .
So was Distler , a particle physicist , who wrote about problems he saw with Lisi 's idea on his blog .
Distler 's posting inspired Garibaldi to think about the issue more , eventually leading to their collaboration .
Lisi 's paper centered on the elegant mathematical structure known as E8 , which also appears in string theory .
First identified in 1887 , E8 has 248 dimensions and cannot be seen , or even drawn , in its complete form .
The enigmatic E8 is the largest and most complicated of the five exceptional Lie groups , and contains four subgroups that are related to the four fundamental forces of nature : the electromagnetic force ; the strong force ( which binds quarks ) ; the weak force ( which controls radioactive decay ) ; and the gravitational force .
In a nutshell , Lisi proposed that E8 is the unifying force for all the forces of the universe .
" That would be great if it were true , because I love E8 , " Garibaldi says .
" But the problem is , it does n't work as he described it in his paper . "
As a leading expert on several of the exceptional Lie groups , Garibaldi felt an obligation to help set the record straight .
" A lot of mystery surrounds the Lie groups , but the facts about them should not be distorted , " he says .
" These are natural objects that are central to mathematics , so it 's important to have a correct understanding of them . "
Using linear algebra and proving theorems to translate the physics into math , Garibaldi and Distler not only showed that the formulas proposed in Lisi 's paper do not work , they also demonstrated the flaws in a whole class of related theories .
" You can think of E8 as a room , and the four subgroups related to the four fundamental forces of nature as furniture , let 's say chairs , " Garibaldi explains .
" It 's pretty easy to see that the room is big enough that you can put all four of the chairs inside it .
The problem with ' the theory of everything ' is that the way it arranges the chairs in the room makes them non-functional . "
He gives the example of one chair inverted and stacked atop another chair .
" I 'm tired of answering questions about the ' theory of everything , ' " Garibaldi says .
" I 'm glad that I will now be able to point to a peer - reviewed scientific article that clearly rebuts this theory .
I feel that there are so many great stories in science , there 's no reason to puff up something that does n't work . "

Palin says her family went to Canada for health care when she was young
Updated 12:32 p.m.
Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin , a fierce opponent of Democratic health - care reform efforts who has said America under President Obama is headed toward socialism , told a Canadian audience her family used to go to Canada to get medical care when she was growing up .
" My first five years of life we spent in Skagway , Alaska , right there by Whitehorse .
Believe it or not -- this was in the ' 60s -- we used to hustle on over the border for health care that we would receive in Whitehorse .
I remember my brother , he burned his ankle in some little kid accident thing and my parents had to put him on a train and rush him over to Whitehorse and I think , is n't that kind of ironic now .
Zooming over the border , getting health care from Canada , " Palin said a speech Saturday night , according to the Calgary Herald .
Palin spoke before a paying audience of 1,200 in Calgary , with tickets costing between $ 150 and $ 200 , the Medicine Hat News of Medicine Hat , Alberta , reported .
Whitehorse , in the Yukon , Canada , is north of Skagway .
Palin has also told an alternate version of the story that had her family traveling south by ferry to Juneau from Skagway for treatment of her brother 's burned foot , rather than to Canada , according to a 2007 report posted by the Skagway News .

I spied this Dramatic Hamster ( mom , this will explain ) , stitched up in visually inspired stitches by Carrie Dolashewich !
I am truly impressed by all the stitches Carrie wielded here .
I see chain stitches , stem stitches , French knots , cretan stitch , satin stitches , some nice combos of cross and straight stitch .... are those sequins I see , too ?
I give this eight " yays ! " .
She said it was inspired by listening to the Flaming Lips !
Even more fantabulous .

Released on December 22 , 2009 , Paranormal Entity is just another film in the long string of mockbusters that have been haunting Hollywood .
It is a direct - to - dvd release by The Asylum , the company responsible for such modern day classics like AVH : Alien vs Hunter , Transmorphers , Transmorphers : Fall of Man , 100 Million BC , and The Day the Earth Stopped .
No …
I ’m not mistyping the names of incredibly high budget movies .
Those are actually their titles .
I honestly have no qualms with companies making super low - budget versions of Hollywood “ blockbusters . ”
Probably because I feel that Hollywood has been pumping out 98 % bile over the past 10 years .
( Seriously ?
Did we need another Transformers movie ?
Could n’t we just have had two hours of video of Megan Fox watching the 80 ’s cartoon series ?
That would have been 100x more entertaining . )
I only feel bad for the pornography industry .
All these great titles are being stolen and used on non-pornographic films !
They only need “ An Erotic Adventure ” added as a subtitle to become some of the best porn titles ever .
But I digress .
Most of the movies that The Asylum is “ inspired ” by have budgets that are through the roof .
But what happens when you make a low budget movie based on a low budget movie ?
Surprisingly , the result is n’t half bad .
Is Paranormal Entity a complete rip off of Paranormal Activity ?
Yes .
Is the acting atrocious ?
Yes .
Does it need to be tossed into the garbage and forgotten for all time ?
No , actually .
I was entertained .
Truth be told , I was just as entertained as I was while watching Paranormal Activity .
Instead of following the plot of two people haunted by an unseen force , Paranormal Entity is about a small family of three who is haunted by an unseen force ( See ? Different movie .
In this one , there ’s one more person ! ) .
At the advice of a paranormal expert , the Finleys are told to document the activity that takes place in their house .
The son , Thomas sets up four inexpensive night vision cameras to monitor the entire house .
He puts one camera in the living room , one camera in his mother Cindy ’s room , and one camera in sister Samantha ’s room .
He carries the last one with him at all times ( At around $ 400 apiece , this felt like a better home monitoring investment than Micah ’s $ 4000 investment in a single camera in Paranormal Activity .
Point goes to PE for believability ! ) .
Paranormal Entity wastes no time at all as almost every night “ documented ” is filled with some rather spooky events .
Certainly a lot of the spooks are inspired by Paranormal Activity but Paranormal Entity seems to put a genuinely original and scary twist to almost every situation .
How do you make baby powder footprints made by an invisible beast scarier ?

And do n’t make them out of baby powder .

As the haunting escalates , it is clear the spirit wants nothing to do with Thomas .
The ghost mostly has an interest in the mother and the sister .
In time , viewers discover that the ghost wants Samantha . . . sexually .
That ’s right , Samantha is haunted by a Maron .
A nightmare ( in the absolutely traditional definition ) .
An incubus .
I like the fact that the demon is identified and classified .
In Paranormal Activity , the demon is just “ a demon ” and aside from the generic and predictable desire to claim souls , the demon in Paranormal Entity has a far more sinister motive .
Rape first , then steal souls .
Creepy .
Truth be told , Paranormal Entity would be as good of a movie as Paranormal Activity if it was n’t foiled by performances of Erin Marie Hogan and Fia Perera .
Both women completely overact their roles and break the fourth wall on more than one occasion .
The acting of Shane van Dyke ( who also directed the film ) is more than passable and it ’s unfortunate that he chose to not show his face at all on film .
In the end , Paranormal Entity has more than its fair share of genuinely scary moments as it blends the video styling of The Blair Witch Project with the story of Paranormal Activity .
It feels more like a platform to display the gorgeous Erin Marie Hogan , as she is almost always either in bra and panties , or she ’s seen in a very low cut shirt .
So , if you liked Paranormal Activity and you want a little more of that type of movie ; or if you disliked Paranormal Activity because you thought the pace was too slow ; or if you ’re simply a fan of shows like Ghost Hunters and Ghost Adventures , then by all means , rent Paranormal Entity .
It ’s not great .
The acting is terrible , but if you ’re in the right mood , it ’ll grant you a few pretty good scares .

Teaming of Delta 4 rocket and GOES a sweet success
BY JUSTIN RAY
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : March 4 , 2010
The Delta 4 rocket has accomplished a critical three - peat for the nation in flawless style , successfully capping a series of repetitive but highly important U.S. weather satellite launches with a beautiful blastoff at nightfall Thursday .

A trio of orbiting observatories , known as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites N , O and P , booked rides aboard Delta 4 rockets to get into orbit and serve meteorologists across America .
That teaming paid off superbly with three picture - perfect launches in 2006 , last June and Thursday evening , deploying a new generation of satellites that will be the mainstay in weather monitoring for many years to come .
" GOES is not just any satellite .
It 's more than that , it 's more than most .
It 's all about saving lives and property .
That 's one of its primary goals , and we do n't take that responsibility lightly .
We make sure we do this job right , " said Andre Dress , NASA 's deputy project manager .
The Delta 's main engine rumbled to life with the trademark hydrogen fireball harmlessly racing up the rocket , then the pair of solid - fuel boosters strapped to the first stage ignited to propel the 20 - story vehicle away from the launch pad at 6:57 p.m. EST ( 2357 GMT ) .
Arcing eastward over the Atlantic Ocean , the rocket ascended to space and disappeared from view at Cape Canaveral en route toward a geosynchronous transfer orbit that would take nearly four - and - a - half hours to reach .
Three systematic firings by the cryogenic upper stage stepped the attached GOES P satellite initially into an initial low - altitude parking orbit , then into an intermediate orbit and finally achieved the desired altitude to deploy the payload .
The targeted release orbit included a high point of 21,860 statute miles , low point of 4,100 statute miles and inclination of 12 degrees .
Satellite - builder Boeing will spend the next three weeks maneuvering the satellite into a circular geostationary orbit 22,300 miles over the equator where it can match Earth 's rotation and appear parked in the sky .
NASA will take control March 24 to conduct an extensive five - month testing period before the satellite is declared ready for use in NOAA 's weather observing system .
GOES P is a $ 500 million mission that wo n't immediately go into service .
Instead , the craft will become an in - space insurance policy against any potential disruption in weather data from other satellites , just waiting for one of the older craft to finish its usefulness before being activated as a replacement .
The GOES program has a long history of providing the weather imagery seen daily during news broadcasts , allowing meteorologists to track conditions and forecast the future across North America .
" We all look forward to those pictures every night on TV to see where the storms are and where they are heading .
That is GOES ' main job , " said Tom Wrublewski , NOAA 's technical acquisition manager .
" The meteorologists at the National Weather Service inject this data from the GOES imager and sounder into their daily forecasting products , " Wrublewski continued .
" Our National Weather Service is using this data to see how rapidly storms are developing , to see the altitude storms are getting to , to see whether hail is being formed and so on . "
This satellite is the third in an updated series of weather spacecraft with sharper vision and extended life to provide constant observations of clouds , atmospheric conditions and severe weather like hurricanes .
" The new series of satellites is about a factor of two improvement in our ability to locate severe storms , " Wrublewski said .
" It 's going to allow people to predict better warnings where lines are going to be for hail and tornados and severe weather of that nature .
And GOES can uniquely stare at those storms to see how they are developing over time .
So a couple of kilometers make a big different whether it's in your town or somebody else 's town a couple of miles down the road . "
That increase in accuracy is key for forecasters plotting the paths of hurricanes .
" For every mile we do n't have to evacuate , that saves about a million dollars and not disrupting people 's lives , " he added .
" This satellite is absolutely critical to accurate hurricane forecasting and warnings , " said Bart Hagemeyer , meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service forecast office in Melbourne , Florida .
" It 's amazing how the GOES satellite imagery , which is now ubiquitous on the TV and Internet , really helps the public understand the weather , too . "
The satellites also carry Solar X - ray Imagers to study the Sun and its storms that can impact life on Earth by upsetting satellites , inducing glitches in power grids and interfering with navigation and communications .
A suite of space environment sensors is aboard GOES P as well to monitor the magnetic field and charged particles .
" The SXI is improving our forecasts and warnings for solar disturbances , protecting billions of dollars worth of commercial and government assets in space and on the ground , and lessening the brunt of power surges for the satellite - based electronics and communications industry , " said Tom Bodgan , director of NOAA 's Space Weather Prediction Center .
The two primary satellites currently in operation are GOES 11 in the western coverage zone and GOES 12 in the east .
But the nine - year - old GOES 12 will be repositioned in April to focus on South America for the rest of its useful life .
The GOES 13 satellite , which was launched in 2006 under the name GOES N , will be brought out of orbital storage and placed into service as the new eastern craft .
GOES O , renamed GOES 14 after rocketing into orbit last June , now awaits the call for duty .
Projections show it replacing GOES 11 at the end of 2011 .
That will make the new GOES P , which will be re-branded GOES 15 after a successful delivery to orbit , the constellation 's main spare .
NOAA wants backup satellites already in space and ready to take over within 72 hours of a primary craft suffering a problem or failure .
GOES P was launched now since the opportunity was available on the Delta 4 rocket 's schedule and there 's no real harm in storing the craft in orbit .
It 's also cheaper than paying for care - taking on the ground .
" We are very anxious to get this satellite launched and maintain our continuity of service , " Wrublewski said .
" It will be a great feeling for NOAA because it helps guarantee we 're not going to have a break in service , it will give us the flexibility to put satellites covering the east coast and the west coast , and later this year we 'll even be able to dedicate a satellite to help South America out . "
The long - range expectations foresee the satellite remaining the spare until replacing GOES 13 ( formerly called GOES N ) sometime in 2015 .
But any surprise glitch aboard one of the operational birds would require GOES P coming to the rescue far sooner .
Boeing built the GOES N , O and P satellites and oversaw the launches under a commercial arrangement with the government .
A Delta 4 Medium + vehicle was used in launching the 7,000 - pound spacecraft .
This particular " 4,2 " version of United Launch Alliance - built rocket featured a four - meter payload fairing and two strap - on solid rocket boosters .
" This has been a tremendous nearly four - year partnership to place all three GOES satellites in their proper orbit , " said Jim Sponnick , United Launch Alliance 's vice president , Delta Product Line .
Some team members had worked 12 years designing , building and launching these new satellites .
Now that all three are in orbit , many will be moving on to other development projects .
" We have worked with a lot of excellent people in industry and NASA and NOAA .
A lot of their lifetime and their career dedicated to this series of satellites .
Everybody is extremely proud .
What other job could you have when you know you are helping to save lives and property every day .
It is a great mission , " said Wrublewski .
" It 's sad and happy , " Dress said of this final launch in the series .
" We have done our job but at the same time a lot of us will be on to something different and what that is we 're not sure yet . "

NGC 3079 :
Superwind Sculpts Filamentary Features
Chandra 's X - ray image ( blue ) has been combined with Hubble 's optical image ( red and green ) to compose this stunning and revealing picture of the spiral galaxy NGC 3079 .
Towering filaments consisting of warm ( about ten thousand degrees Celsius ) and hot ( about ten million degrees Celsius ) gas blend to create the bright horseshoe - shaped feature near the center .
The correlation of the warm and hot filaments suggests that they were both formed as a superwind of gas -- rushing out from the central regions of the galaxy -- carved a cavity in the cool gas of disk galactic disk .
The superwind stripped fragments of gas off the walls of the cavity , stretched them into long filaments , and heated them .
The full extent of the superwind shows up as a fainter conical cloud of X - ray emission surrounding the filaments .
A superwind , such as the one in NGC 3079 originates in the center of the galaxy , either from activity generated by a central supermassive black hole , or by a burst of supernova activity .
Superwinds are thought to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies by regulating the formation of new stars , and by dispersing heavy elements to the outer parts of the galaxy and beyond .
These latest Chandra data indicate that astronomers may be seriously underestimating the mass lost in superwinds and therefore their influence within and around the host galaxy .
I 've said it before : Democrats can't keep negotiating with ourselves while
getting nothing in return .
The President supports the public option .
Majorities of both the House and
the Senate support the public option .
And a whopping majority of the
American people supports the public option .
That 's what we should be doing , and that 's the only way we 're going to end
up with a plan that provides real competition to insurance companies and
reduces soaring premiums .
But I 'm not going to stop fighting and neither can you .
I 'll be right here
today liveblogging .
And do n't worry , I 'll be sure to call out Republicans
every time they sell out the American people to protect the insurance
industry .
I 'll be updating regularly , so come back often .
-----
12:37 PM
Moving my new updates to a new thread here .
Should make it easier to read the comments .
12:23 PM
Hey , Mr. President , I have a question to put to the table :
Why do we have an employer - based system that requires busnesses to be benefits managers ?
Nearly half of the country has a single payer system .
Which one has worked better ?
Sorry to change the subject , but is n't this the elephant that was n't allowed into the room ?
12:02 PM
I am prepared to rule on who is right about the cost up / cost down argument the Republicans are having with the President .
The President is right .
If you dont read Ezra Klein 's blog at the Washington Post , you should .
Check out his take here .
11:53 AM
The President is doing a great job teaching here .
His answers are clearly intended to cut through the claptrap of the GOP talking points .
I doubt he wins over the Republican members , but I 'm sure the uninitiated will understand the issues better .
I held 16 town hall meetings in my district .
I saw the same thing at each .
There was a lot of anger directed at the myths and not the facts of the debate .
But where did the myths come from ?
The answer is that they came from a deliberate campaign by many of the Republicans in that room .
11:30 AM
It occurs to me watching this session that we are seeing the limits of the seniority system in Congress .
These senators and House Members are mostly there because the are Chairmen or ranking Republicans on committees .
Maybe this would be more fun if some less senior members were invited .
I 'm not naming names , but ca n't we think of some ?
11:14 AM
Sen .
Coburn says there is 10 % fraud in Medicare and Medicaid .
It 's worth noting that the bills have proposed anti-fraud initiatives that in part explain why Medicare would be reduced 10 % or so .
That did n't stop the GOP and their scaremongers on Fox News from claiming we were stealing from seniors .
Funny .
11:07 PM
As they work out the facts about this disagreement over whether rates would go down under the Senate bill , I wonder if they will explain why the Senate bill is the foundation for this discussion .
The House bill is the better bill .
It contains the public option - which would without doubt save consumers and taxpayers money .
BTW -
We are an hour in and there has yet to be a mention of the public option .
10:53 AM
I like Sen. Reid 's tone here .
Bipartisanship is a means and not an end .
If the GOP members are allowed to portray themselves as " partners " in the effort , wihtout challenge , this thing will be a farce .
10:37 AM
Sen .
Alexander started referring to the " jamming " of health care reform via reconcilliation .
This is hypocrisy .
Check out Sen .
Boxer 's examination of the myth that we need 60 votes on everything .
We have been worshiping at the altar of 60 votes .
51 is what it takes .
10:21 AM
This notion of a lot of agreement overlooks the fact that there is stark disagreement on one thing - whether protecting the insurance industry should be a primary goal of our policy .
My GOP friends say yes .
Democrats believe we need to put consumers first .
Rachel Maddow explained this well last night .
The health insurance industry has a different goal than we policy makers have .
10:11 AM
Some things to watch out for this morning at the health care summit :
Will anyone actually explain the status of the public option ?
We know the President supports it .
We know that the Democrats at the table overwhelmingly support it .
We know that the American people support it .
And we know that the House of Representatives already voted for it .
So what 's the problem ?
At least in the game of Clue we find out who did the crime at the end .
Before we write the obituary on the public option , I hope somebody explains .
We 've already done roundups on Superheroes , so I thought it was time that we flipped the coin and unleashed a hoard of deliciously terrifying monsters into the mix !
This time I 've gathered together a list of 66 horrific creatures so meticulously crafted that the beauty of their workmanship even manages to overshadow their gruesome appearances .

The environmental group is demanding that Dell provides its roadmap for phasing out harmful chemicals by a 2011 deadline
A protest action by Greenpeace in Europe and India against Dell may continue for many days , and be extended to the U.S. in the next stage , a spokeswoman for the environment group said on Monday .
Greenpeace wants , at the least , Dell to outline the company 's road map to rid its products of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) and brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) by 2011 , said Iza Kruszewska , toxics campaigner at Greenpeace International .
" They do n't have to put it on their Web site , but it would give us more assurance if they let us see it under a non-disclosure agreement , " she said .
The environmental group is also demanding that Dell take a stand and lobby for the ban of PVC and BFRs in a revision of the European Union 's RoHS ( Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electronics ) Directive .
A legislative requirement to eliminate PVC and BFRs across the sector would level the playing field for all electronics companies , and bring down costs as there will be mass uptake from suppliers , Kruszewska said .
It would also mean that a large number of electronics makers , which are not part of the 18 companies in the campaign to eliminate harmful chemicals , would have to accept the new norms , she added .
Greenpeace held protests outside Dell offices in Bangalore , Amsterdam and Copenhagen on Monday .
Officials at Greenpeace said that the environmental group planned the action ahead of a meeting on Monday at Dell headquarters in Round Rock , Texas .
During the meeting company CEO Michael Dell is scheduled to discuss a variety of environmental issues including a road map for the transition to products free of PVC and BFRs .
" We will see what we could get today [ from Dell ] , and that would determine how long our action continues for , " Kruszewska said .
In Amsterdam , Greenpeace activists spread foam outside Dell 's office to convey that Dell should eliminate toxic chemicals from its products , Kruszewska said .
" Michael Dell drop the toxics " was a key slogan at the protests in Bangalore .
A Dell spokeswoman in Bangalore said she was unaware of the meeting in Texas .
The company stands by its commitment to rid its products of PVC and BFRs in their products by 2011 , she added .
How surprised is America about Northern Iowa ?
Let 's take a look at ESPN.
com 's Tournament Challenge , which includes just under 4.8 million brackets :

China 's central bank pledged on Saturday to keep the yuan 's exchange rate basically stable in 2010 and said it will enhance coordination with its foreign counterparts on major policy issues .
The People 's Bank of China will continue to push forward multi-polarization of the international money system , according to a statement issued ahead of a news conference on the sidelines of the annual session of parliament .
The central bank said it would keep sufficient liquidity in the banking system and further encourage domestic banks to issue yuan bonds in Hong Kong .
China to further improve formation mechanism of yuan exchange rate
China will further improve the formation mechanism of exchange rate of the renminbi , or the country 's currency yuan , to keep the exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and balanced level , the People 's Bank of China said Saturday .
The central bank made the statement in a report delivered to media during a press conference on the sideline of the annual parliament session .
China opposes politicizing monetary issues
China opposes politicizing monetary issues , said central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan Saturday .
Zhou made the comment when answering a question about the accusation that China manipulates the yuan 's exchange rate at a press conference on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , the country 's top legislature .
China 's stimulus package benefits world recovery
China 's stimulus package not only spurred up domestic demand , but also benefited world economic recovery and global policy coordinating , minister of commerce Chen Deming said Saturday .
Chen made the remarks at a press conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , the country 's top legislature .
" China 's stimulus incentives on domestic consumption and exports abide by the rules of the World Trade Organization and bear no protectionism , " Chen told reporters .
He said China always sticks to openess in foreign trade .
" Although China 's exports have regained momentum since the beginning of this year , it would take two or three years for exports to return to the level of 2008 , as uncertainties would remain in global recovery , " he said .
Chen noted the pro-consumption measures implemented last year including subsidies to the auto and home appliance buyers also invited the participation of foreign businesses .
" A couple of days ago , more than 20 business leaders of the Fortune 500 companies told me their business in China outshined their performance in other countries last year , " he said .
China 's exports slipped 16 percent in 2009 as global recession sapped demands for Chinese goods
China to face stimulus exit problem sooner or later
China will face the issue of withdrawing its economic stimulus package sooner or later , central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Saturday .
Zhou made the remarks at a press conference on the sideline of the National People 's Congress , the country 's top legislature .

Pirate Party Pillages Private Papers
Recently , a document that is allegedly a consolidated discussion paper of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement was leaked in full to the internet .
Today , due to the complete lack of a transparent public consultation process with ACTA , Pirate Party Australia will also be mirroring this controversial document , in order to fuel public awareness and debate surrounding government transparency .
You can view the PDF with
software such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or Foxit Reader by visiting the following link .
Download PDF Version of Secret ACTA Documents
Download PDF Version of Press Release
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , or ACTA , is a secret agreement in negotiation between the EU , Canada , the USA , Japan , NZ , Australia and other nations .
While it does propose some legitimate anti-counterfeiting measures , the copyright - related chapters are the result of commercial interests seeking to limit society ’s rights to material designed to enhance our culture .
These vested interests are the reason that the negotiating parties do not wish for the closeted discussions of ACTA to be public .
Proposals such as a graduated response scheme , or ‘ three strikes ’ as it is commonly known , have been considered in multiple leaked ACTA documents over the past two years .
‘ Three strikes ’ would force ISPs to disconnect households from the Internet upon three accusations of copyright infringement .
“ The most alarming part of these proposals is the complete lack of judicial oversight , allowing the copyright owners to play both judge and jury , while forcing ISPs to take on the
role of executioner , ” said David Crafti , Pirate Party President .
Pirate Party Australia has twice attempted to gain ACTA documents under a Freedom of Information request , but both were rejected .
Most recent attempt documented here .
Notable sections include Section 4 ( p25 ) which includes sanctions that would require ISPs to enforce copyright , effectively deeming them copyright police and overriding the AFACT vs iiNet trial verdict entirely .
It is disgraceful that this agreement continues to be negotiated without public oversight and transparency .
The EU recently voted to oppose ACTA , with 663 votes for and 13 against .
Many EU members claimed the negotiations were a violation of the Lisbon Treaty .
“ We have shown that we do not accept secrecy .
We have shown that we are prepared to stand up for a free internet open to everybody .
Christian Engström , Pirate Party MEP
Pirate Party Australia applauds the EU ’s opposition to the Treaty and in the interests of its citizens , calls for the Australian government to withdraw from negotiations .
We also encourage everyone to get informed about what the ACTA treaty will mean for individuals and all of us as a nation .
We need to make it clear that our personal liberties are more important than a record label ’s hip pocket .
Out of all the private torrent trackers online today , CN remains to be one of the most secretive .
However ,
It 's strict rules against publicity have not been able to prevent news from spreading across the BitTorrent universe – most people now know of it ’s existence and the tracker is known as one of the best movie trackers one could get into .
Thankfully , CN ’s administration have responded to the growing popularity is a positive manner .
Although the site has n’t directly opened signups , numerous other modes of recruitment have been presented which can be used to get invited into CN for free , without getting involved with malpractices such as invite trading or scamming .
If you missed out on CN IRC recruitment or E - mail invite requests earlier , here ’s another option you can try – they now have online invite applications through which potential new members can apply and join to the tracker .
Quoted below is a message posted on site homepage :
We have implemented a new external invite application system for non-members .
Now you can tell your friends to come and apply for an invite .
You can deliver this message :
" The link for the application is ( you can find it at the external page too ) :
https://www.cosanostra.mn/applyforinvite.php
You are expected to answer all these questions clearly and honestly if you really want to join CN .
For all liars , traders and cheaters :
Do n't apply , you will be banned sooner or later and you will be just wasting your time . " :: A3M
Before you flip out about us posting the full tracker URL , it was mentioned here with permission from CN staff .
This post would not have made much sense without it and we are grateful that CN staff were of the same opinion .
Anyways we wo n’t be posting detailed tracker information or screenshots of CN unlike in our usual tracker reviews .
Just know that with over 15000 movie torrents , one of the best unique tracker scripts and tons of site features , this is a tracker well worth getting into .
If you need more background information , we suggest you read the site overview found below ( this was sent to us by CN staff team sometime back , during their E - mail giveaway ) :
On the surface CN is a dedicated movies tracker , but peel back the layers and you will notice that it is so much more .
Our focus is on all types movies , regardless of language , genre or format .
CN is a tracker that prides itself on striving to be different as well as being quality conscious .
It is a community that values social cohesion and interaction with each other .
A place where we want hardcore movie lovers and the more casual movie watchers come together to discuss and share their opinions and recommendations on their favorite films .
It is a place that puts file sharing above all ; meaning we absolutely encourage seeding and leeching as opposed to buffering and ratio whoring .
People with seedboxes and fast connections are always welcome to help boost overall speed , but those who do not have either , need not be intimidated .
A fast connection is certainly not a requirement to " survive " at CN .
While CN does maintain a somewhat strict inactivity policy , we feel it is only fair and reasonable , as CN is a place where every member should play their part and contribute to the community and tracker .
If you have no intentions of doing so , then simply put , CN is not for you .
Most of the disabled users you see on the site statistics are due to inactivity .
Together with a unique and comprehensive promotion system which requires all - rounded site activity to advance and a simple but brilliant seeding and bonus system that does n’t exist elsewhere , maintaining a ratio is not a problem for even the user with the slowest connection .
In a nutshell , if you are looking for an extremely tight - knit community , unique tracker features found nowhere else , enjoy and love movies , are willing to play a role in achieving something bigger than yourself , CN is the place for you .
We ’ve said this before and we ’ll say it again – you have to become a member of this site to really see it ’s potential .
It has a lot of small yet useful features which all cannot be covered in a simple review such as this .
For example , their promotions system is pretty unique and it ’d take us ages to fully explain it in detail .
So , as said above we ’ll leave you to discover the site features – prepare to be awed the first time you log in :p
CN does n't have many members but the ~1400 of them that are registered there are pretty active .
Invite applications should bring in fresh new blood in and further boost the activity of this tracker .
If you are looking for a decent movie tracker , try your luck with the invite apps .

Beyond Wonderland at The Gorge
Friday , June 12 - Saturday , June 13
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - About 100 modern Russian tanks have been discovered abandoned on the side of a road in the country ’s Ural mountains , footage published on Saturday by websites showed .
Video clips from the E1.ru website that were rebroadcast on Russian television showed local people clambering over some of the unguarded T - 80 tanks that were parked in long rows in Kamishlovsk , about 100 km from the Ural city of Yekaterinburg .
Russian military prosecutors are probing how the tanks , Russia ’s main battle tank , came to be left in such a situation , state news agency RIA reported .
Russia is currently streamlining its massive military , with some commanders recently quoted in the Russian media as saying they only require half of the country ’s 20,000 tanks .

I 'm extremely shy but full of curiosity — the camera helps you get over shyness .
You hide behind the camera and it gives you a reason to be somewhere .
If you 're polite and you show a genuine interest , people embrace you .

It 's learning that last bit that we suspect helped Hurn overcome his shyness altogether .
As with nearly any fear , the real key to overcoming it almost always involves desensitizing yourself to it , and over time , photography can do just that for the shy set .

China reports on US human rights record ( Xinhua )
Updated : 2010-03-12 15:41
BEIJING - China Friday retorted US criticism by publishing its own report on the US human rights record .
" As in previous years , the ( US ) reports are full of accusations of the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions including China , but turn a blind eye to , or dodge and even cover up rampant human rights abuses on its own territory , " said the Information Office of the State Council in its report on the US human rights record .
The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2009 was in retaliation to the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2009 issued by the US Department of State on March 11 .
The report is " prepared to help people around the world understand the real situation of human rights in the United States , " said the report .
The report reviewed the human rights record of the United States in 2009 from six perspectives : life , property and personal security ; civil and political rights ; economic , social and cultural rights ; racial discrimination ; rights of women and children ; and the US ' violation of human rights against other countries .
It criticized the United States for taking human rights as " a political instrument to interfere in other countries ' internal affairs , defame other nations ' image and seek its own strategic interests . "
China advised the US government to draw lessons from the history , put itself in a correct position , strive to improve its own human rights conditions and rectify its acts in the human rights field .
This is the 11th consecutive year that the Information Office of China 's State Council has issued a human rights record of the United States to answer the US State Department 's annual report .
" At a time when the world is suffering a serious human rights disaster caused by the US subprime crisis - induced global financial crisis , the US government still ignores its own serious human rights problems but revels in accusing other countries .
It is really a pity , " the report said .
SPYING ON CITIZENS
While advocating " freedom of speech , " " freedom of the press " and " Internet freedom , " the US government unscrupulously monitors and restricts the citizens ' rights to freedom when it comes to its own interests and needs , the report said .
The US citizens ' freedom to access and distribute information is under strict supervision , it said .
According to media reports , the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) started installing specialized eavesdropping equipment around the country to wiretap calls , faxes , and emails and collect domestic communications as early as 2001 .
The wiretapping programs was originally targeted at Arab - Americans , but soon grew to include other Americans .
After the September 11 attack , the US government , in the name of anti-terrorism , authorized its intelligence authorities to hack into its citizens ' mail communications , and to monitor and erase any information that might threaten the US national interests on the Internet through technical means , the report said .
Statistic showed that from 2002 to 2006 , the FBI collected thousands of phones records of US citizens through mails , notes and phone calls .
In September 2009 , the country set up an Internet security supervision body , further worrying US citizens that the US government might use Internet security as an excuse to monitor and interfere with personal systems .
The so - called " freedom of the press " of the United States was in fact completely subordinate to its national interests , and was manipulated by the US government , the report said .
At yearend 2009 , the US Congress passed a bill which imposed sanctions on several Arab satellite channels for broadcasting contents hostile to the US and instigating violence .
WIDESPREAD VIOLENT CRIMES
Widespread violent crimes in the United States posed threats to the lives , properties and personal security of its people , the report said .
In 2008 , US residents experienced 4.9 million violent crimes , 16.3 million property crimes and 137,000 personal thefts , and the violent crime rate was 19.3 victimizations per 1,000 persons aged 12 or over .
About 30,000 people die from gun-related incidents each year .
According to a FBI report , there had been 14,180 murder victims in 2008 , the report said .
Campuses became an area worst hit by violent crimes as shootings spread there and kept escalating .
The US Heritage Foundation reported that 11.3 percent of high school students in Washington D.C. reported being " threatened or injured " with a weapon while on school property during the 2007 - 2008 school year .
ABUSE OF POWER
The country 's police frequently impose violence on the people and abuse of power is common among US law enforcers , the report said ,
Over the past two years , the number of New York police officers under review for garnering too many complaints was up 50 percent .
In major US cities , police stop , question and frisk more than a million people each year , a sharply higher number than just a few years ago .
Prisons in the United State are packed with inmates .
About 2.3 million were held in custody of prisons and jails , the equivalent of about one in every 198 persons in the country , according to the report .
From 2000 to 2008 , the US prison population increased an average of 1.8 percent annually .
The basic rights of prisoners in the United States are not well - protected .
Raping cases of inmates by prison staff members are widely reported , the report said .
According to the US Justice Department , reports of sexual misconduct by prison staff members with inmates in the country 's 93 federal prison sites doubled over the past eight years .
According to a federal survey of more than 63,000 federal and state inmates , 4.5 percent reported being sexually abused at least once during the previous 12 months .
POVERTY LEADS TO RISING NUMBER OF SUICIDES
The report said the population in poverty was the largest in 11 years .
The Washington Post reported that altogether 39.8 million Americans were living in poverty by the end of 2008 , an increase of 2.6 million from that in 2007 .
The poverty rate in 2008 was 13.2 percent , the highest since 1998 .
Poverty led to a sharp rise in the number of suicides in the United States .
It is reported that there are roughly 32,000 suicides in the US every year , double the cases of murder , said the report .
WORKERS ' RIGHTS NOT PROPERLY GUARANTEED
Workers ' rights were seriously violated in the United States , the report said .
The New York Times reported that about 68 percent of the 4,387 low - wage workers in a survey said they had experienced reduction of wages and 76 percent of those who had worked overtime were not paid accordingly .
The number of people without medical insurance has kept rising for eight consecutive years , the report said .
Data released by the US Census Bureau showed 46.3 million people were without medical insurance in 2008 , accounting for 15.4 percent of the total population , comparing 45.7 million people who were without medical insurance in 2007 , which was a rise for the eighth year in a row .
WOMEN , CHILDREN FREQUENT VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE
Women are frequent victims of violence and sexual assault in the United States , while children are exposed to violence and living in fear , the report said .
It is reported that the United States has the highest rape rate among countries which report such statistics .
It is 13 times higher than that of England and 20 times higher than that of Japan .
Reuters reported that based on in - depth interviews on 40 servicewomen , 10 said they had been raped , five said they were sexually assaulted including attempted rape , and 13 reported sexual harassment .
It is reported that 1,494 children younger than 18 nationwide were murdered in 2008 , the USA Today reported .
A survey conducted by the US Justice Department on 4,549 kids and adolescents aged 17 and younger between January and May of 2008 showed , more than 60 percent of children surveyed were exposed to violence within the past year , either directly or indirectly .
TRAMPLING UPON OTHER COUNTRIES ' SOVEREIGNTY , HUMAN RIGHTS
The report said the United States with its strong military power has pursued hegemony in the world , trampling upon the sovereignty of other countries and trespassing their human rights .
As the world 's biggest arms seller , its deals have greatly fueled instability across the world .
The United States also expanded its military spending , already the largest in the world , by 10 percent in 2008 to 607 billion US dollars , accounting for 42 percent of the world total , the AP reported .
At the beginning of 2010 , the US government announced a 6.4 - billion - US dollar arms sales package to Taiwan despite strong protest from the Chinese government and people , which seriously damaged China 's national security interests and aroused strong indignation among the Chinese people , it said .
The wars of Iraq and Afghanistan have placed heavy burden on American people and brought tremendous casualties and property losses to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan , according to the report .
Prisoner abuse is one of the biggest human rights scandals of the United States , it said
An investigation by US Justice Department showed 2,000 Taliban surrendered combatants were suffocated to death by the US army - controlled Afghan armed forces , the report said .
The United States has been building its military bases around the world , and cases of violation of local people 's human rights are often seen , the report said .
The United States is now maintaining 900 bases worldwide , with more than 190,000 military personnel and 115,000 relevant staff stationed .
These bases are bringing serious damage and environmental contamination to the localities .
Toxic substances caused by bomb explosions are taking their tolls on the local children , it said .
It has been reported that toward the end of the US military bases ' presence in Subic and Clark , as many as 3,000 cases of raping the local women had been filed against the US servicemen , but all were dismissed , according to the report .
For those of us who view the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as being an issue of injustice , there ’s plenty of reason to believe no resolution is in sight simply because justice is one of the weakest among the principles governing world affairs .
To this extent , Israeli leaders can feel confident in their sense of impunity .
But there is another line Israel crosses at its peril : where its actions conflict with the commercial interests of its allies .
Israel can be a moral liability but it can not be a financial liability .
US taxpayers have every reason to feel that Israel , as the largest single recipient of US foreign aid , is already a massive financial liability .
Even so , since most of those tax dollars get plowed straight back into the US defense industry , Washington is unlikely to become more attentive to the concerns of ordinary American citizens than it is to the interests of its corporate sponsors .
Nevertheless , there is now reason to think that with the murder of Mahmoud al Mabhouh in Dubai , Israel crossed a line that strains the limits of Western tolerance .
Western governments would have paid scant attention to this event were it not for one egregious error by Mossad : its flagrant disregard for the integrity of foreign passports .
For many international travelers from Western countries , a passport might seem like nothing more than an obligatory document of no extraordinary value , yet in many ways these carefully bound and embossed permits are the lubricants of globalization .
Swift passage through immigration control is one of the things that keeps the wheels of business turning smoothly .
But anyone traveling to the Middle East on an EU or Australian passport will now face a new level of scrutiny from immigration officers intent on blocking the passage of Israeli assassins .
Dubai ’s police chief Lt Gen Dahi Khalfan Tamim announced on Monday that any travelers suspected of being Israeli , even if they hold passports from another country , will now be barred from entry into the UAE .
Asharq Al - Awsat reports that any foreign traveler visiting Lebanon who has a Jewish name will now be placed under surveillance .
Major General Wafiq Jizzini , director general of the Lebanese Public Security , said : “ When someone comes to Lebanon on a foreign passport and the name of his family indicates that he is of Jewish origin , the border center sends the information to the central information office at the General Directorate of the Public Security .
Afterward , the directorate observes this person who would have already registered his address in Lebanon .
Both the visiting person and the one who receives him at the airport are observed . ”
Israeli leaders such as Israel ’s minister of industry , trade and labor , Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , who still regard the Dubai murder as a victory for Israel , have further reason to question that conclusion as fallout from the operation has now reached the United Nations General Assembly .
On Friday , the only countries willing to side with Israel in opposing a resolution that makes a renewed call for the investigation of war crimes committed during Israel ’s war on Gaza , were the United States , Canada , Micronesia , Nauru , Panama , and Macedonia .
Australian government sources informed the Sydney Morning Herald that there was a direct connection between the UN vote and the Dubai affair :
Britain , France and Germany have all recently expressed anger at Israel after their passports were caught up in the Dubai plot .
One Department of Foreign Affairs source told the Herald there was no doubt the decision to abstain was intended as a sign to Israel not to take Australian support for granted .
“ A number of things made it easier for us to switch our vote , ” the source said .
“ Firstly , the Americans helped the Palestinians to soften the wording of this resolution compared to the last one .
Secondly , a number of other countries had indicated that they were toughening their own positions on Goldstone .
But there is no question that the debacle surrounding our passports being used in Dubai helped to make up the government ’s mind to abstain .
The final decision was taken late on Friday , Australian time , just a few hours before the vote .
“ Our pattern in the past has been to vote with the US when it comes to Israel , to show as much support for Israel as possible .
“ We were also aware that the UK ’s decision to vote in favour of the resolution was influenced by the fact that so many of their citizens had been caught up in the Dubai assassination . ”
Israelis would do well to remember that even among their most effusive supporters , an allegiance to business invariably trumps all others .

The Stock Market As Propaganda ( March 10 , 2010 )
Since 91 % of stocks are owned by the Plutocracy , the much - ballyhooed rise in the stock market as proof the recession is over is perception management / propaganda .
The 75 % rise in the stock market from its lows a year ago is ceaselessly offered as " proof " the economy is recovering .
Too bad very few Americans are drawing any benefit from this stupendous rise .
As I detail below , the Great Middle Class owns at best only 7 % of all stocks and mutual funds .
So the constant , breathless heralding of the stock market 's carefully manufactured ascent has only one purpose : to create perceptions of " recovery " and distract the populace from the fact that in terms of employment and tax revenues , the U.S. economy is still shrinking rapidly .
Let 's begin with the facts presented in the Wealth , Income , and Power website ( G. William Domhoff ) .
In the United States , wealth is highly concentrated in a relatively few hands .
As of 2007 , the top 1 % of households ( the upper class ) owned 34.6 % of all privately held wealth , and the next 19 % ( the managerial , professional , and small business stratum ) had 50.5 % , which means that just 20 % of the people owned a remarkable 85 % , leaving only 15 % of the wealth for the bottom 80 % ( wage and salary workers ) .
In terms of financial wealth ( total net worth minus the value of one 's home ) , the top 1 % of households had an even greater share : 42.7 % .
Table 1 and Figure 1 present further details drawn from the careful work of economist Edward N. Wolff at New York University ( 2009 ) .
In terms of types of financial wealth , the top one percent of households have 38.3 % of all privately held stock , 60.6 % of financial securities , and 62.4 % of business equity .
The top 10 % have 80 % to 90 % of stocks , bonds , trust funds , and business equity , and over 75 % of non -home real estate .
Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income - producing assets , we can say that just 10 % of the people own the United States of America .
( end of excerpt )
Here is a chart from the website : According to the asset class breakdown on Wealth , Income , and Power , the bottom 90 % owned 18.8 % of all stocks and mutual funds in 2007 .
Since the bottom 60 % own very little ( only 22 % of the bottom 60 % own stock / mutual funds worth more than $ 10,000 ) , and the bottom 80 % own a mere 8.9 % of all stocks / mutual funds , then the top 10 % owns 81 % of all stocks ( of which the top 1 % own 38 % ) and the " managerial / professional " slice between 80 % and 90 % owns about 10 % .
Some 47 % of the " middle class " ( those between the bottom 40 % with few financial assets and the top 20 % with the vast majority of the assets ) own stocks / mutual funds worth more than $ 10,000 , but since the bottom 80 % own a mere 8.9 % of all stocks , it seems the Great American Middle Class owns about 7 % of all the stocks and mutual funds in the U.S. ( with the bottom 40 % holding the remaining 2 % ) .
According to BusinessWeek , the profits of the S&P 500 corporations rose in 2009 to over $ 500 billion - - a vast sum presented as " yet more proof " that the recession is over .
Over for some perhaps , but not for the bottom 80 % .
It is no secret that the spurt in productivity which fueled those gargantuan profits was made by reducing headcounts and getting more work out of the remaining workforce .
Bully for the S&P 500 managers and those who reap the profits .
Since there are about 130 million U.S. households and total corporate profits are around $ 1 trillion , we can do some simple math to see where all those profits flow .
If you dig through the BEA website and other sources , you find that Corporate profits were about 13 percent of GDP in 2007 , their highest level in 40 years and significantly above the post - World War II average of 9.4 percent of GDP .
Nonfinancial profits for 2006 were $ 1.08 trillion .
Real GDP peaked in Q2 2008 at 13,415.3 billion ; in Q3 2009 GDP was 12,973 billion ( calculated annually ) .
Even assuming corporate profits have dropped back to 9 % of GDP , we still get a number around $ 1 trillion in profit for 2009 .
Based on the ownership of stock and mutual funds , we can estimate that 9 % ( $ 90 billion ) of all that profit flowed to the bottom 80 % of households ( 104 million ) , $ 100 billion flowed to the 13 million Managerial / Professional households ( the 10 % of all households between 80 % and 90 % ) , and $ 810 billion flowed to the top 10 % ( 13 million households ) , of which $ 400 billion flowed to the top 1 % ( 1.3 million households ) .
Since total household income runs about $ 9 trillion , then the $ 90 billion distributed among 104 million households does n't really ring a lot of chimes when the estimated loss of wealth in the U.S. as the credit bubble popped has been estimated at $ 15 trillion .
The rise in the stock market and corporate profits benefitted the relative few - - yet is touted in the mainstream media as heralding the end of the recession for the entire nation .
That is pure propaganda .
How easy it 's been to manufacture a rising stock market , compared to engineering a recovery in the economy .
Indeed , the biggest problem facing the manipulators is the lack of participation by the professional and middle classes which have steadfastly kept their cash in money - market funds ( $ 3 trillion ) and put money in " safe " bond funds ( about $ 350 billion went into such funds in 2009 ) while they withdrew money from the stock mutual funds .
The Grand Game has always been to engineer a rising stock market , sell to the middle class suckers and then go short , making a fortune as the bubble pops and the middle class loses the " sure bet . "
Now that the middle class is n't responding to the endless propaganda about how great the stock market is doing , then the Powers That Be are forced to trade between themselves -- hence the low daily volume and high - frequency trading .
The stock market is n't about building middle class wealth , and the middle class seems to have finally figured that out .
The equity market is all about concentrating wealth and managing perception : if the top 10 % is doing well , then the bottom 90 % are supposed to feel better about the whole thing , too , even if they are poorer by every financial metric .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

Bowing to Pentagon concerns and an international outcry , a Michigan arms company said Thursday that it would immediately stop embossing references to New Testament Scriptures on rifle sights it sells the military .
The company , Trijicon Inc. , has multimillion - dollar contracts with the Pentagon for advanced telescopic sights that are widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Trijicon also said it would provide the Pentagon with 100 free kits to use for removing the lettering on existing weapons .
For years , the company acknowledged , it has put small scriptural references near the model numbers on some products , a practice started by its founder , who was a Christian .
The references , like JN8:12 and 2COR4:6 , referring to passages in the Gospel of John and in Second Corinthians , had not been widely noticed or debated until an ABC News report this week .
Scopes with biblical references were also sold to the Australian , New Zealand and British militaries .
They call it the " Call of Duty Effect . "
Last December , one of the hottest search terms on Google was for a gun , and not just any gun : an assault rifle made by arms manufacturer Bushmaster , designed specifically to become the main battle weapon for the United States military .
This is not entirely unheard of .
New firearms - especially those with military ties - are generally hot items , but the Adaptive Combat Rifle , or ACR , was a different story .
Although the rifle had been in the hands of military testers , even fielded with select units for some months , a consumer version had yet to be released and had only been hinted at by the manufacturer .
In fact , as of the time of this writing , the rifle still is n't available to the public and may never be .
And yet , for some reason , last holiday season , the " ACR " - a gun few people should have heard of and even fewer still have ever seen - was one of the top search items on Google .
Steve , who prefers to use only his first name for reasons of personal security , is the owner of The Firearm Blog , a website devoted to the latest news and current events in the world of guns , and one of the people who first noticed the strange phenomenon of the ACR 's Google rankings .
" I was surprised because compared to the AKs , M4s and Glocks of the world , the ACR is relatively unknown outside of the industry , " he says .
Although Steve had been following news related to the ACR for the entire history of its development , he was baffled as to why anyone outside of the small circle of firearm enthusiasts would even know of its existence , much less be interested in purchasing one .
Then it hit him :
Among the many modern firearms depicted in Activision 's Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 is the ACR , complete with an entirely fictional " heartbeat sensor " that alerts the player to the presence of enemies - a feature one member of The Firearm Blog calls " fantastic , " and not in the good way .
Blog member " Jim " shares this story :
He came into a Pawn Shop I was shopping around at and asked for an " Ess Em Gee " ( Submachine gun ) .
The owner said that he did n't carry them .
He then asked if he had any sniper rifles .
The owner showed him a .270 ( I believe ) .
As the punk ( hat cocked off to the side and his pants at a level where a belt would not allow them to fall ) looked down the scope , he asked how to " zoom it " ( a common feature of scoped rifles in video games ) .
The owner showed him how to magnify and clarify the image .
The punk said that he was just used to the rifle doing that for him .
Finally the owner asked what the kid was looking for , to which he replied , " I just want to headshot some noobs ! ... Like on Halo ! "
The conversation quickly degraded from that moment and ended very shortly ...
The entire thread about the ACR at The Firearm Blog is worth reading ( and not only because the blog itself is one of the least wonky of the many , many blogs and websites written for firearm enthusiasts ) .
Reading through the posts in response to the " Call of Duty Effect " article and seeing users share stories about their experiences with both firearms and videogames , it becomes clear that these are two communities that have a great deal in common and that there are more gun-owning videogamers than you might think .

Thin Mints are the Girl Scouts ’ best selling cookies – although Samoas , Do-si-dos and Tagalongs have their fans , too – when they have their annual cookie sale .
Even though they ’re a wonderfully tasty combination of mint , chocolate and crispiness , there are a couple of good reasons not to buy them no matter how tempting they seem .
First , only a small portion of the cookie sales go to the troops , and as the prices rise , the cookies themselves shrink .
I ’d rather donate to my local chapter and know where the money is going .
Second , the cookies are still made with partially hydrogenated oils , which means that they contain trans fats despite the fact that the boxes proudly proclaim “ zero trans fats per serving ! ”
Eat two servings , and those trans fats will start to add up .
I ’d much rather make my own .
These crispy cookies are easy to make at home and taste even better than the “ real ” thing .
The dough is made in advance , rolled into a log and chilled .
This allows the cookies to be sliced off easily into rounds so there is no need to fiddle with a cookie cutter .
Once baked , they are dipped into a dark chocolate coating .
I used Guittard chocolate for this batch and would definitely recommend getting a good quality dark chocolate to work with , starting with a bar and chopping it up .
Semisweet chocolate – by which I mean chocolate chips – will work pretty well , too , although you might need to add an extra tablespoon of butter if your chocolate does n’t get thin enough to ensure a thin cookie coating .
The cookies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for several days , but like “ real ” Girl Scout cookies , they taste great when frozen and will last for weeks – if not longer – in the freezer .
Homemade Thin Mints
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
6 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter , room temperature
1/3 cup milk ( any kind )
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3/4 tsp peppermint extract
In a small bowl , whisk together flour , cornstarch , cocoa powder and salt .
In a large bowl , cream together butter and sugar .
With the mixer on low speed , add in the milk and the extracts .
Mixture will look curdled .
Gradually , add in the flour mixture until fully incorporated .
Shape dough into two logs , about 1 1/2 inches ( or about 4 cm ) in diameter , wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for at least 1 - 2 hours , until dough is very firm .
Preheat oven to 375F .
Slice dough into rounds not more than 1 /4 inch thick – if they are too thick , they will not be as crisp – and place on a parchment lined baking sheet .
Cookies will not spread very much , so you can put them quite close together .
Bake for 13 - 15 minutes , until cookies are firm at the edges .
Cool cookies completely on a wire rack before dipping in chocolate .
Dark Chocolate Coating
10 - oz dark or semisweet chocolate
1/2 cup butter , room temperature
In a microwave safe bowl , combine chocolate and butter .
Melt on high power in the microwave , stirring every 45 - 60 seconds , until chocolate is smooth .
Chocolate should have a consistency somewhere between chocolate syrup and fudge for a thin coating .
Dip each cookie in melted chocolate , turn with a fork to coat , then transfer to a piece of parchment paper or wax paper to set up for at least 30 minutes , or until chocolate is cool and firm .
Reheat chocolate as needed to keep it smooth and easy to dip into .
Makes 3 1/2 - 4 dozen cookies .
I always thought that the First Amendment ’s free exercise of religion provision provided for , you know , the free exercise of religion .
But apparently that protection is not enough for right - wing groups in Colorado who are now pushing an amendment to the state ’s constitution that would guarantee them some sort of vague religious liberty exemption , presumably to bolster their belief that they should not be required to comply with or recognize things like hate crimes laws , marriage equality , or anything else that does not reflect their religious views :
A coalition that includes Colorado Family Action and the Colorado Catholic Conference has taken the first step toward amending the state constitution to prohibit the government from infringing on the religious liberty of an individual or a religious organization .
“ We have heard in our work in the state that many Catholics and other people of faith are growing uneasy as they sense a loss of religious freedom , ” said Jennifer Kraska , executive director of the Catholic Conference , the lobbying arm of the state ’s three Catholic dioceses .
Kraska , also a representative of a coalition called Coloradans for Liberty , said a ballot initiative to amend the constitution is being considered because of a general sense that religious freedom is eroding under governmental pressure .
Another coalition representative , Jessica Langfeldt , director of Colorado Family Action , a Focus on the Family affiliate , said taking the first step Monday — filing language with the Colorado Legislative Council — gives the coalition several weeks to determine whether its concerns are widely shared .
The ballot question asks whether the state constitution should include a section stating that government may not burden the right of a person or organization to act or to refuse to act in a manner motivated by a sincerely held religious belief unless the government has a compelling interest in infringing the act .
“ People want the freedom to express their religious beliefs in all aspects of community life , not just in the privacy of their homes , ” Kraska said .
The Tea Partiers are right .
There is socialism in the United States .
It ’s called the National Football League .
In fact , this fantastically successful experiment in corporate socialism is now at risk of being ruined by owners and players who are threatening to behave as rational market actors .
The league ’s business practices contradict the tenets of a free market .
With its salary cap and salary floor that oblige all 32 franchises to spend the same amount on players each year , the NFL effectively prohibits any team from gaining an investment advantage over its competitors .
A draft order that bestows the highest picks on the weakest teams punishes winners and rewards losers .
And at the root of all this leveling is the owners ’ collectivist arrangement to divvy up TV revenue equally among themselves .
But now the owners are complaining that a salary cap based on the players receiving nearly 60 percent of total gross revenue has become an unbearable burden for some franchises .
And players do n’t want to change the formula if they ca n’t see the owners ’ books .
So this year is already uncapped and next year could bring a lockout .
Labor and management are making an omelet out of a golden egg and threatening to kill the goose that laid it .
Karl Marx could explain this ; it ’s definitely not in the playbook of either Ron Paul or Sarah Palin .

That 's right ; guys like Magellan and Marco Polo opened up new frontiers of human exploration and when they returned , told stories that were laugh - out - loud ridiculous .
Why ?
Just for the hell of it , apparently .
If you take a list of history 's greatest explorers , and hold it up to a list of history 's greatest bullshitters , you quickly find out they 're the same list .

We use the term " successful " loosely , since he did n't exactly " survive " it , but he was still pretty close .
And since history books are like horseshoes and hand grenades in that " close enough " usually counts ( we 're looking at you Thomas Edison ) , Magellan gets full credit .
He not only found a route to the East , he also took invaluable surveys of his route , documenting things like the Strait of Magellan and the Magellanic Penguin .
He , uh ... he really took advantage of that whole " if you 're the first to see it , then you get to name it " thing did n't he ?
Please Magellanites , throw down your Magellan sticks and get off of Magellan Beach !

So What Did He Lie About ?
Giants .
A race of giants .
While traveling around the southern tip of South America , Magellan and his men claimed that they came across " a naked man of giant stature " who was " so tall that we reached only to his waist . "

AFP - Israel 's Labour Party may quit the ruling coalition over the decision to build 1,600 settler homes in annexed Arab east Jerusalem , Agriculture Minister Shalom Simhon warned on Thursday .
" Members of the Labour Party have more and more difficulty in taking part in a coalition government that they joined with the purpose of relaunching the peace process with the Palestinians , " Simhon told army radio .
" The anger of ( US Vice President Joe ) Biden is justified .
A grave error has been committed ( by Israel ) and there is a price to pay , " he added .
Israel 's interior ministry on Tuesday said it had approved the construction of 1,600 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo , a Jewish settlement in the mainly Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem .
The controversial move has infuriated Palestinians , who consider settlements to be a major hurdle to a peace accord , and who want occupied east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state .
The news also sparked an angry statement from Biden , on a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories , denouncing the move .

And for the transcript of the Armstrong interview on Kornheiser 's show , go here .
I did n't hear the show today ( or any show ever really ) but someone wrote me to say that on this morning 's radio show on AM980 , during a discussion of the new proposed bike lanes on Pennsylvania Ave , Tony Kornheiser condoned running down cyclists with his " big , more powerful car . "
I 'm listening to the show now ,
Once they put today 's show online , I 'll listen to it , so I 'll see if I can find where it happened ( update : sometime around minute 38 ) and what exactly was said .
But , let me know if you heard it .
The person who wrote me about this also said that they contacted the radio station about the comments and they did not deny them , said that they took it seriously and that many people had called to complain .
Update :
Here 's my take at the transcript .
It 's not perfect , but it captures it .
I do n't know the people so pardon my nicknames for them .
It starts around 31:15
Kevin : Reading : " The center of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the Capitol soon may be reserved for just two things : the president 's inauguration and people riding bicycles .
A pair of bike lanes are destined to grace the middle of one of the country 's most fabled boulevards , an avenue that ranks as a destination with Broadway , Fifth Avenue , Hollywood Boulevard and Bourbon Street .
The two lanes will be part of an expanding network of dedicated bicycle lanes in the District , soon to include L , I and Ninth streets NW and more of 15th Street NW . "
Tony Kornheiser :
When I read about this early this morning , and I just assumed this would be one of those dedicated bike lanes ...
Kevin :
To the right
Other Dude : Like you get at the beach , just a little strip
TK : ... on the right hand side , where bicycles are free to go - maybe two by two , but mostly one by one .
Kevin :
And they never use them
TK : And I 'm fine with those .
Then I heard on Channel 4 that these things were going to remove an entire lane of automobiles , which last time I looked the roads were made for automobiles , and that they were going to somehow be in the middle and not on the sides and we were somehow going to be dominated , as if this was Beijing , by hundreds of thousands of bicyclists .
And I do n't really care what they do on Pennsylvania Avenue , if they can't ride a car on that anyway , but how are they going to get the bikes down there ?
They 're going to have to go through other streets .
I think this is a terrible , terrible idea .
I do n't mind those one lanes , but you get in Rock Creek Park and 3 or 4 of these people start riding abreast , and I swear to you it 's all you can do to not RUN THEM DOWN , like Wile Coyote 's , run them over .
Just stay on the right .
Stay on the right .
I 'm happy to share the road with you , but by share the road what I mean is you have room on the right and I have room on the road .
Get the hell out of my way .
Am I wrong on this ?
Woman :
Here 's the problem I have .
I 'll give you bike lanes if we open up Pennsylvania Avenue on one side of the White House and the other street behind ... You add this and it 's going to make it even worse worse .
OD : These chesty cyclists , I mean they take that right lane and they 're already moving over to the middle .
TK : And they all wear ... my God ... with the little water bottle in the back and their stupid hats and their shiny shorts , they are the same disgusting poseurs that come out in the middle of a snow storm with cross country skiing on your block .
Run them down .
I mean , let them use the right I 'm OK with that .
OD : Or they can ride on the top of the curb
TK : I do n't take my car and ride on the sidewalk becaue I understand that 's not for my car .
Why do these people think that these roads were built for bicycles ?
Kevin :
Because they 're crunchy granola , they just want us to live in a cleaner world .
TK : I know someone 's going to hate me for this , am I wrong ?
Woman : I 'm all for people truly sharing the road .
I 'm all for people getting their exercise .
Kevin :
They do n't share it now .
TK : They do n't share the road .
They dominate the road .
They dare you to run them down .
Kevin :
Yes they do .
TK : And then when you do , they get angry .
What is that about ?
Kevin :
If you honk , they slow down ... in front of you
TK : And so you tap them .
I 'm not saying you kill them .
I 'm saying you tap them .
Tap them once .
Kevin : Just a spill , not a fatal spill , but a little spill .
TK : If you 're not rubbing , you 're not racing right ?
So you pop them a little bit and see what happens .
Kevin :
They 're so annoying .
This is a Fenty move .
He 's a big cyclist .
Woman :
With his security detail of course .
TK : But again , why can't they just .. what 's wrong with the little lane on the right .
I do n't drive in the little lane on the right .
Woman :
Here 's the argument they would make - because the little lane on the right is often covered up by cars that are parked at the wrong time of day and buses that have pulled into the path ...
OD : Tell them to take Metro
TK : Really ?
Then they can veer out a little bit .
My objection to them is when the ride in the middle of the road .
They give you the finger .
They do all the time .
They think they own it .
Because they think that you think that you own it .
I do n't think I own it .
I own it .
I have a car .
I have a large powerful car compared to your stupid little bicycle .
OD : It seems a little discriminatory to me .
What about unicyclists ?
Why can't they have a lane
TK .
They can have the same lane on the right .
Anything with less than four wheels , or three wheels ...
Kevin : ... can use the right lane , if there is one .
If there is n't one , take the Metro .
( Group makes fun of segways )
TK : so the whole city is going to be just for bicycles ?
I tell you , it 's Beijing .
It 's going to be buses and bicycles .
That 's all there 's going to be .
Kevin :
There are plenty of paths .
The Capitol Crescent Trail gets you to Georgetown and then you can take the Metro from there .
Get on a bus .
TK : Yes .
What is their problem ?
( Group makes fun of leg shaving )
Update : From the second hour at 32:03
Kevin : OK get this Tony , we talked last hour about the expansion of bike lanes in the District , apparently a right hand bike lane is n't enough for these people .
TK : It 's such a plague
Kevin :
We 've got to move them to the middle of the street .
TK : Why are they in the middle of the street ?
Kevin :
Well , who knows ...
TK : I want to be in the middle of the street .
I 'm driving a car .
OD : It seems to increase the likelihood that they 'll be struck
Kevin : Google doing more for these people , they 've come out with their latest product Google Maps for Bikers .
TK : yeah I know .
Kevin :
So now you can google map your ...
OD : Not bikers .
Cyclists .
Kevin : Cyclists .
OD : Bikers ride motorcycles .
Kevin : The Oregonian , which is the newspaper of note in Crunchville , USA - Portland , Oregon .
The Oregonian panned the new Google maps for cyclists , saying it was " incomplete and inadequate " .
Meanwhile a couple of cyclist stories that have broken in the last few hours that are reflective of this category of people .
In Brunswick Maine , two men on bikes tried to rob a pregnant woman .
In Windsor , Ontario , two men on bikes assaulted a male driver through the window of his car after a road dispute .
We 've all been there before .
TK : They do that all the time .
They go right up to your car and they start banging on your car , trying to make you feel guilty for owning a car and somehow the law does not allow you to run them down .
Kevin : In St. Louis , a woman on a bike riding in rush hour traffic blew a tire , tumbled into the middle of the road in front of oncoming traffic , she was run over by a taxi .
She survived , but the taxi driver had to be rushed to the hospital with an injured neck .
Meantime , Neal from Rockville wrote in to say that he recommends that you buy a Toyota , as it provides you with a built in defense if you accidentally strike a bicyclist while driving to work .
Later , in response to a story about a prom being canceled to prevent gay couples from attending , he said " People just need to stop being awful to each other " .
That 's good advice .
There were a few emails then about cyclists in the last two minutes .
He ends with " if you 're out there tonight in the rain cyclists , wear white .
Which you can wear with your ridiculous shirt and your fat thighs in bike shorts . "
So yeah .
Just full of a lot of ignorance , windshield perspective and anti-cyclist comments .
I do n't see a point in refuting them one by one .
They 're just so ridiculous .
After taking office last year , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel privately told many Americans and Europeans that he was committed to and capable of peacemaking , despite the hard - line positions that he had used to get elected for a second time .
Trust me , he told them .
We were skeptical when we first heard that , and we ’re even more skeptical now .
All this week , the Obama administration had hoped Mr. Netanyahu would give it something to work with , a way to resolve the poisonous contretemps over Jerusalem and to finally restart Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
It would have been a relief if they had succeeded .
Serious negotiations on a two - state solution are in all their interests .
And the challenges the United States and Israel face  especially Iran ’s nuclear program  are too great for the leaders not to have a close working relationship .
But after a cabinet meeting on Friday , Mr. Netanyahu and his right - wing government still insisted that they would not change their policy of building homes in the city , including East Jerusalem , which Palestinians hope to make the capital of an independent state .
President Obama made pursuing a peace deal a priority and has been understandably furious at Israel ’s response .
He correctly sees the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as a factor in wider regional instability .
Ali Dizaei was convicted of misconduct and perverting the course of justice
Disgraced senior officer Ali Dizaei has been dismissed from his job with immediate effect by the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) .
A tribunal had been deliberating on the action to be taken against the jailed police commander .
He was jailed in February for four years for misconduct and perverting the course of justice .
The former senior police officer was found guilty of attacking and falsely arresting a web designer in 2008 .
The 47 - year - old commander had remained a police officer without powers at Scotland Yard since starting his jail term , but the MPA has now dismissed him .
Speaking after the hearing , James Cleverly , vice chairman of the Professional Standards Cases Sub -Committee , said : " The tribunal recommended that the only appropriate sanction was dismissal from the service .
" The sub - committee has accepted the tribunal 's recommendation and has today dismissed Commander Dizaei from the Metropolitan Police Service with immediate effect .
" As far as the authority is concerned , this is the end of the matter . "
Mullen Wary of Israeli Attack on Iran Adm. Mike Mullen , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , came home with sweaty palms from his mid-February visit to Israel .
Ever since , he has been worrying aloud that Israel might mousetrap the U.S. into war with Iran .
Email
Printer friendly
This is especially worrying , because Mullen has had considerable experience in putting the brakes on such Israeli plans in the past .
This time , he appears convinced that the Israeli leaders did not take his earlier warnings seriously — notwithstanding the unusually strong language he put into play .
Upon arrival in Jerusalem on Feb. 14 , Mullen wasted no time in making clear why he had come .
He insisted publicly that an attack on Iran would be “ a big , big , big problem for all of us , and I worry a great deal about the unintended consequences . ”
After his return , at a Pentagon press conference on Feb. 22 , Mullen drove home the same point — with some of the same language .
After reciting the usual boilerplate about Iran being “ on the path to achieve nuclear weaponization ” and about its “ desire to dominate its neighbors , ” he included this in his prepared remarks : “ I worry a lot about the unintended consequences of any sort of military action .
For now , the diplomatic and the economic levers of international power are and ought to be the levers first pulled .
Indeed , I would hope they are always and consistently pulled .
No strike , however effective , will be , in and of itself , decisive . ”
In answer to a question about the “ efficacy ” of military strikes on Iran ’s nuclear program , Mullen said such strikes “ would delay it for one to three years . ”
Underscoring the point , he added that this is what he meant “ about a military strike not being decisive . ”
Unlike younger generals , such as David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal , Adm. Mullen served in the Vietnam War .
It seems likely that this experience prompted his philosophical aside about the war in Afghanistan : “ I would remind everyone of an essential truth : War is bloody and uneven .
It ’s messy and ugly and incredibly wasteful , but that does n’t mean it is n’t worth the cost . ”
Though the immediate context for that remark was Afghanistan , Mullen has underscored time and again that war with Iran would be a far larger disaster .
Those with a modicum of familiarity with the military , strategic and economic equities at stake know he is right .
Firing ‘ Fox ’ Recall that one of Mullen ’s Vietnam veteran contemporaries , Adm. William “ Fox ” Fallon was cashiered as CENTCOM commander in March 2008 for saying things like war with Iran " is n't going to happen on my watch . ”
Fallon openly encouraged negotiations with Iran as the only sensible approach , and harshly criticized the “ constant drum beat ” for war .
Fallon ’s attitude appears to be shared by the more politically cautious – and less rhetorically blunt – Mullen , as the same war - with - Iran drumbeat reaches a new crescendo today .
Fallon abhorred the thought of being on the receiving end of an order inspired by the likes of then - Vice President Dick Cheney and Deputy National Security Adviser Elliott Abrams to send American troops into what would surely be – in Mullen ’s words – a “ bloody , uneven , messy , ugly and incredibly wasteful ” war .
How strong the pressure was within the Bush administration to attack Iran – or to give Israel “ a green light ” to attack Iran – can be read between the lines in a Feb. 14 exchange between ABC News ’ “ This Week ” host Jonathan Karl and former Vice President Cheney .
Karl : “ How close did the Bush administration come to taking military action against Iran ? ”
Cheney : “ Some of that I can't talk about , obviously , still .
I 'm sure it 's still classified .
We clearly never made the decision – we never crossed over that line of saying , ‘ Now we 're going to mount a military operation to deal with the problem . ’ … " Karl : “ David Sanger of the New York Times says that the Israelis came to you – came to the administration in the final months and asked for certain things , bunker - buster bombs , air - to - air refueling capability , over - flight rights , and that basically the administration dithered , did not give the Israelis a response .
Was that a mistake ? ”
Cheney : “ I can't get into it still .
I 'm sure a lot of those discussions are still very sensitive . ”
Karl : “ Let me ask you :
Did you advocate a harder line , including in the military area , in those final months ? ”
Cheney : “ Usually . ”
Karl : “ And with respect to Iran ? ” Cheney : “ Well , I made public statements to the effect that I felt very strongly that we had to have the military option , that it had to be on the table , that it had to be a meaningful option , and that we might well have to resort to military force in order to deal with the threat that Iran represented .
… [ But ] we never got to the point where the President had to make a decision one way or the other . ”
Renewed Pressures
Clearly , those pressures have not disappeared during the first 13 months of the Obama administration .
Today , it appears that Mullen has replaced Fallon as the principal military obstacle to exercising the war option against Iran .
From his recent demeanor , as well as his many statements since he became the country ’s most senior officer , it is apparent that Mullen does not believe that a “ preventive war ” against Iran would be worth the horrendous cost .
Washington rhetoric , echoed by the many stenographers of the Fawning Corporate Media over the past eight years , has brought a veneer of respectability to the international crime of aggressive war , as long as done or sanctioned by the United States .
With nodding approval from the FCM , Bush and Cheney sold the notion that such attacks can be justified to “ prevent ” some future hypothetical threat to the United States or its allies , the supposed rationale for invading Iraq in 2003 .
Clearly , the Obama administration has not fully backed away from such thinking .
While in Qatar on Feb.
14 , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern over what she called “ accumulating evidence ” of an Iranian attempt to pursue a nuclear weapon , not because it “ directly threaten [s ] the United States , but [ because ] it directly threatens a lot of our friends ” — read Israel .
Mullen , for his part , seems acutely aware that the Constitution he has sworn to defend makes no provision for the kind of war he might be sucked into to defend Israel .
When he studied at the Naval Academy , his professors apparently were still teaching that the Constitution ’s Supremacy Clause ( Article VI , Clause 2 ) establishes that treaties ratified by the Senate become the “ supreme law of the land . ”
It would be , pure and simple , a flagrant violation of a supreme law of the land , the Senate - ratified United Nations Charter , for the United States to join in an unprovoked assault on Iran without the approval of the U.N. Security Council , which surely would not go along .
Adm .
Mullen also appears to be one of the few Americans aware that there is no mutual defense treaty between the United States and Israel and , thus , the U.S. has no legal obligation to jump to Israel ’s defense if it ignites war with Iran .
Now you may scoff .
“ Everyone knows , ” you will say , that political realities in America dictate that the U.S. military must defend Israel no matter who started a conflict .
Still , there was a time – after the 1967 Israeli - Arab war when Israel first occupied the Palestinian territories – that the U.S. did take soundings regarding the possibility of a mutual defense treaty , in the expectation that this might introduce more calm into the area by giving the Israelis a greater sense of security .
But the Israelis turned the overture down cold .
Such treaties , you see , require internationally recognized boundaries and Israel did not want any part of parting with the territories it had just seized militarily .
Besides , mutual defense treaties usually impose on both parties an obligation to inform the other if one decides to attack a third country .
Israel wanted no part of that either .
This virtually unknown background helps to explain why the lack of a treaty of mutual defense is more than a picayune academic point .
Why Is Mullen Worried ?
Yet , if Adm .
Mullen is an old hand at reining in the Israelis , why is he so visibly worried at present ?
He ’s had experience in reading the riot act to the Israelis .
So what could be so different now ?
Last time , in mid-2008 , Cheney and Abrams were arguing for an aggressive military posture toward Iran but lost the argument to Mullen and his senior commanders , who – in the final days of the Bush administration – won the backing of President Bush .
When former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert seemed intent on starting hostilities with Iran before Bush and Cheney left office , Bush ordered Adm .
Mullen to Israel to tell the Israelis , in no uncertain terms , do n’t do it .
Mullen gladly rose to the occasion ; actually , he outdid himself .
With Bush ’s full support , Mullen told the Israelis to disabuse themselves of the notion that U.S. military support would be knee - jerk automatic if Israel somehow provoked open hostilities with Iran .
We also learned from the Israeli press that Mullen went so far as to warn the Israelis not to even think about another incident at sea like the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty on June 8 , 1967 , which left 34 American crew killed and more than 170 wounded .
Never before had a senior U.S. official braced Israel so blatantly about the Liberty incident , which was covered up unconscionably by Lyndon B. Johnson ’s administration , the Congress , and by the Navy itself .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Navy Vet Honored , Foiled Israeli Attack . ” ]
The lesson the Israelis took away from the Liberty incident was that they could get away with murder , literally , and walk free because of political realities in the United States .
Never again , said Mullen .
He could not have raised a more neuralgic issue .
So , again , what ’s different about today ?
How to account for Mullen ’s decision to keep expressing his worries about “ unintended consequences ” ?
I believe the admiral fears that things are about to spin out of control .
Whether there will be war does not depend on Mullen — or even Obama .
It depends on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
And Mullen does well to be worried .
Netanyahu ’s Impression of Obama
It is altogether likely that Netanyahu has concluded that Barack Obama is — in the vernacular — a wuss .
Why , for example , does the President keep sending an endless procession of the most senior U.S. officials to Tel Aviv to plead with their Israeli counterparts :
Please , pretty please , do n’t start a war with Iran .
Loose - cannon Vice President Joe Biden arrives on Monday , hopefully with clearer instructions than when he blithely told ABC on July 4 , 2009 , that Israel is a “ sovereign nation ” and thus “ entitled ” to launch a military strike against Iran , adding that Washington would make no effort to dissuade the Israeli government .
Will Biden manage to keep his foot out of his mouth this time , or will his nearly four decades of experience in the U.S. Senate – learning how to position himself politically in regards to Israel – again reassert itself ?
It is a safe bet that Netanyahu is wryly amused at such obsequious buffoonery .
But his impression of Obama ’s backbone – or lack thereof – is key .
The Israeli Prime Minister must be drawing some lessons from Obama ’s aversion to leveraging the $ 3 billion a year the U.S. gives to Israel .
Why does n’t he simply pick up the phone and warn me himself , Netanyahu might be asking himself .
Is Obama so deathly afraid of the powerful Likud Lobby that he cannot bring himself to call me ?
Is the President afraid his chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , might listen in and leak it to neoconservative pundits like the Washington Post ’s Dana Milbank ?
Netanyahu has had ample time to size up the President .
Their initial encounter in May 2009 reminded me very much of the disastrous meeting in Vienna between another young American president and Nikita Khrushchev in early June 1961 .
The Soviets took the measure of President John Kennedy , and a result was the Cuban missile crisis which brought the world as close as it has ever come , before or since , to nuclear destruction .
The Israeli Prime Minister has found it possible to thumb his nose at Obama ’s repeated pleas for a halt in illegal construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories — without consequence .
Moreover , Netanyahu has watched Obama cave in time after time — on domestic , as well as international issues .
Netanyahu styles himself as sitting in the catbird ’s seat of the relationship , largely because of the Likud Lobby ’s unparalleled influence with U.S. lawmakers and opinion makers — not to mention the entrée the Israelis enjoy to the chief executive himself by having one of their staunchest allies , Rahm Emanuel , in position as White House chief of staff .
In the intelligence business , we might call that an “ agent of influence . ”
Emanuel ’s father , Benjamin Emanuel , was born in Jerusalem and served in the Irgun , the pre-independence Zionist guerrilla organization .
During the 1991 Persian Gulf War , Rahm Emanuel , then in his early 30s , traveled to Israel as a civilian volunteer to work with the Israeli Defense Forces .
He served in one of the IDF ’s northern bases .
Mullen ’s Worries
So , Netanyahu is supremely confident of the solidity of his position with the movers and shakers in Congress , Washington opinion makers , and even within the Obama administration , and he gives off signs of being singularly underwhelmed by the President .
These factors enhance the possibility Netanyahu will opt for the kind of provocation that would confront Obama with a Hobson ’s choice of either joining an Israeli attack on Iran or facing dire political consequences at home .
And so Mullen continues to worry — not only about “ unintended consequences , ” but about what might be accurately described as intended consequences , as well .
The most immediate of these could involve mouse - trapping Obama into committing U.S. forces to war provoked with Iran .
And for those fond of saying that “ everything is on the table , ” be advised that this would go in spades in this context .
Very little seems outlandish these days .
Remember Seymour Hersh ’s report about Cheney ’s office conjuring up plots as to how best to trigger a war with Iran ?
Hersh said : “ The one that interested me [ Hersh ] the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy Seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up . ”
In other words , another Tonkin Gulf incident , like the one that President Johnson used to justify a massive escalation in Vietnam .
Only a modern - day Gulf of Tonkin in the Strait of Hormuz could be even more problematic , given the waterway 's vital role as a supply route for oil tankers necessary for maintaining the world ’s economy .
The navigable part of the Strait of Hormuz is narrow , and things often go bump in the night without trying .
For example : DUBAI , United Arab Emirates ( AP ) – On the evening of Jan. 8 , 2007 , a U.S. nuclear - powered submarine collided with a Japanese oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz , through which 40 percent of the world 's oil supplies travel , officials said .
The collision between the USS Newport News and the Japanese - flagged motor vessel Mogamigawa occurred at approximately 10:15 in the evening ( local time ) in the Strait of Hormuz while the submarine was transiting submerged .
AP , March 20 , 2009 : “ The USS Hartford nuclear submarine and the amphibious USS New Orleans collided in the waters between Iran and the Arabian peninsula today .
Fifteen sailors were slightly injured aboard the Hartford … the New Orleans suffered a ruptured fuel tank , spilling 25,000 gallons of diesel… .
The ships were on routine security patrols in a busy shipping route . ”
Think back also to the bizarre accounts of the incident involving swarming Iranian boats and U.S. naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz on Jan. 6 , 2008 .
Preventing Preventive War The Persian Gulf would be an ideal locale for Israel to mount a provocation eliciting Iranian retaliation that could , in turn , lead to a full - scale Israeli attack on Iran ’s nuclear - related sites .
Painfully aware of that possible scenario , Adm .
Mullen noted at a July 2 , 2008 , press conference , that military - to - military dialogue could “ add to a better understanding ” between the U.S. and Iran .
If Mullen ’s worries are to be taken as genuine ( and I believe they are ) , it would behoove him to resurrect that idea and formally propose such dialogue to the Iranians .
He is the U.S. government ’s senior military officer and should not let himself be stymied by neoconservative partisans more interested in regime change in Tehran than in working out a modus vivendi and reduction of tension .
The following two modest proposals could go a long way toward avoiding an armed confrontation with Iran — whether accidental , or provoked by those who may actually wish to precipitate hostilities and involve the U.S. 1 – Establish a direct communications link between top military officials in Washington and Tehran , in order to reduce the danger of accident , miscalculation or covert attack .
2 – Launch immediate negotiations by top Iranian and American naval officers to conclude an incidents - at - sea protocol .
A communications link has historically proven its merit during times of high tension .
The Cuban missile crisis of 1962 underscored the need for instantaneous communications at senior levels , and a " hot line " between Washington and Moscow was established the following year .
That direct link played a crucial role , for example , in preventing the spread of war in the Middle East during the Six - Day War in early June 1967 .
Another useful precedent is the " Incidents - at - Sea " agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union , signed in Moscow in May 1972 .
That period was another time of considerable tension between the two countries , including several inadvertent naval encounters that could well have escalated .
The agreement sharply reduced the likelihood of such incidents .
I believe it would be difficult for American and Iranian leaders alike to oppose measures that make such good sense .
Press reports show that top U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf have favored such steps .
And , as indicated above , Adm .
Mullen has already appealed for military - to - military dialogue .
In the present circumstances , it has become increasingly urgent to discuss seriously how the United States and Iran might avoid a conflict started by accident , miscalculation or provocation .
Neither the U.S. nor Iran can afford to allow an avoidable incident at sea to spin out of control .
With a modicum of mutual trust , these common - sense actions might be able to win wide and prompt acceptance by leaders in both countries .

As programmers , we love writing code .
Opening a fresh , clean editor , bringing up a blank form in Visual Studio , the world crisp and uncluttered and ready to receive your vision .
It ’s easy to understand why starting a new project is fun .
However , mostly we do n’t like reading code .
Dropped into the middle of some densely - packed jungle of a project , filled with obfuscated filenames and cryptic little comments like :
if ( section == 0 ) /* ca n’t validate section this way */
and having to fight your way through to fix a bug or add a featurette without breaking anything else .
It ’s a lot like going to certain modern art exhibitions ; you end up feeling as if those responsible are deliberately obscuring things just to piss you off .
Actually , in the programming world this is sometimes the case .
It ’s easy to understand why people will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid reading and understanding complicated , real - world code .
This is unfortunate , because reading code – even bad code – is the key to writing good code .
When I was learning to program someone told me that I should try to read as much code as possible .
Budding genius that I was , I thought this was advice for stupid people who needed to learn from their betters .
I thought the only reason to read code was to pick up tricks from it .
How wrong I was .
The real reason to read code has nothing to do with learning from the programmer who wrote it .
Recently I discovered that learning a foreign language teaches you two things : how to communicate in that language and how to communicate in your own language to non-native speakers .
You learn that simple grammatical structures and shorter sentences are easier to understand .
You get a feeling for when someone ’s following you and which words in the sentence are most important to pronounce clearly .
It ’s the same with reading and writing code .
Reading code teaches you how to read code and it teaches you how to write code that ’s easy to read .
Both of these are desperately important .
Actually reading code is something most of us subconsciously avoid .
I ’ve lost track of the number of times I ’ve been through this little dance :
Decide to fix a bug or add a feature to a piece of code someone else has written
Take a brief look at said code Frown in distaste because the original programmer – curse his blackened soul – put the opening brace on the end of the if statement instead of on a new line , as God intended *
Spend the next 90 seconds not being able to work out why it was put together the way it was , or what ’s calling what and why Tell myself : “ Boy , this code is a real mess !
Even I ca n’t understand it !
The best thing to do is clearly to make a clean start and write it myself – it ca n’t be that hard and I can always refer back if I run into problems ! ”
Spend the next few hours , days or ( on one memorable occasion ) weeks reimplementing a slightly buggier , less complete version of the original code .
I now have something that is n’t noticably better by any metric , but I feel I understand it and that lifts a weight from my heart “ Phew ” , I say , wiping my brow with the back of my hand , “ it ’s a good job I rewrote that ! ”
* 😉
It ’s only after years and years of repeating this pattern that it has begun to dawn on me that each time I do this I ’m really just wasting precious , precious time on something that does n’t improve the product at all .
What ’s worse , I ’m only doing it because I can’t face the thought of reading somebody else ’s code .
If I spent one fraction of the time reading and understanding it then I ’d learn a lot more about the problem it ’s trying to solve and would be in a great place to tweak or refactor it to suit my needs .
The desire to start afresh comes from the fear of reading code , and it ’s always , always a waste of time because – guess what ?
When you ’re done , there ’s just as much code to be read next time you come back to it .
The right thing to do is to read it , grok it and gently massage it into a more suitable shape .
Or hack it apart brutally and repurpose it .
It does n’t matter !
Once you understand it , you can do what you want with it .
Code does n’t rust and it does n’t go off .
Just read it , change it and use it .
Every time I do this now , it makes me happy .
Just being able to read complex code quickly and effortlessly is a wonderful aim in itself , but the real benefits come from the effect it has on your own code .
When you first learn to program , you ’re really learning to write code that communicates your intentions to the compiler .
Initially this seems like hard work , but actually a compiler jumps through a lot of hoops to work out what your convoluted code is supposed to mean .
To become a better developer , however , you need to learn to write code that simultaneously communicates your intentions to the compiler and to other programmers , who would rather do anything than work out what you were trying to achieve .
Even when working on your own you benefit hugely by writing code that clearly communicates its intentions , because most interesting programs end up being larger than you can hold in your head at any one time and end up being worked on for more than one session .
If you think your intentions are clear , but you ’re not in the habit of reading code , you ’re probably wrong and they ’re only clear to you ( and only today ) .
It ’s when you summon up your courage and dive into the deep end of someone else ’s code and try to work out what ’s going on without any reference points that you start to notice what makes this easy and what makes it hard .
Would a brief comment here have saved you looking things up in that other set of nested classes ?
When you come back to write more code yourself , you recognise which parts might be confusing , where a helpful comment or carefully - chosen function name would clear up any potential ambiguities .
You recognise that a future maintainer who comes in to change this function will need to know that it ’s affected by this other class over here .
In short , you learn to see your code with the eyes of a reader , and in doing so you become better at writing it .
You can work on it faster and your team can work on it faster .
Everybody wins .
I worked professionally for years – years – without ever really reading anyone else ’s code .
Once I started , I began to see the whole field in a new light .
I wish I ’d started reading code years ago , I really do .
The Byzantine art of war and diplomacy would prove useful in today ’s Afghanistan
Even by the shortest reckoning , the Byzantine empire survived for eight centuries ( from the fourth to the twelfth ) — longer than any other in history .
Although the Byzantines were supremely tenacious in combat , their strategy — invented in response to the unprecedented threat of Attila ’s Huns in the 5th century — relied on diplomacy , evolving into a body of rules and techniques that is still relevant today .
Unlike the Romans , the Byzantines wrote official guidebooks on statecraft , foreign relations and espionage : writings I find especially fascinating , as I once helped compose the main field manual of the US army .
These ancient techniques centred on a single , paradoxical principle : do everything possible to raise , equip and train the best possible army and navy ; then do everything possible to use them as little as possible .
With Afghanistan , the west faces a simple strategic calculus : too costly to stay in , too risky to leave .
A Byzantine response would be , first to withdraw the west ’s scarce , expensive troops , and arm local proxies instead .
This was the standard remedy for turbulent , worthless lands where no taxes could be collected , but which were to be denied to enemies : an improvement over the Romans ’ fondness for battles of attrition and annihilation .
In Afghanistan , a banal case of divide and rule is impossible .
There is no unitary nation to divide .
This is well suited to a Byzantine strategy , which would aim not to rule Afghanistan , but to stop the Taliban from doing so .
Little persuasion would be needed to co-opt allies .
The Shia Hazara distrust the Taliban , who view them as heretics deserving death , while the country ’s Tajiks and Uzbeks , who can be as extreme in religion as the Taliban , would not want to be ruled by them either .
The Byzantines would use diplomacy to deal with Afghanistan ’s diverse neighbours .
They once even persuaded a rival empire to split the cost of guarding strategic border passes , so both could keep invaders out .
Today Uzbekistan , which is just across the river from Afghanistan , and its patron Russia , which is just beyond , have every reason to keep the Taliban at bay , given their internal struggles against armed Islamists .
Accordingly , the Byzantines would demand from Russia and Uzbekistan the weapons and ammunition that were needed to arm the Tajiks , Hazara and Uzbeks in Afghanistan .
Most Pakistanis , too , have had their fill of Islamists — during the …

Rep Harry Mitchell - ( D ) from Arizona is the latest member of Congress to witness the insanity .
via Andrea Mitchell :
Caller :
You are going to have to look over your f*&king shoulder because people in your district hate your f*&king face .
I love my insurance company and to have you come between me and my f*&king doctor .
I cannot tell you how much I wish a panty bomber would come in and just f*&king blow your place up .
A recorded message to his office from a woman who said she hates his f*&king face and hopes a bomb will blow his office up .
Nice .
U.S. Rep. Harry Mitchell , D - Ariz. , has received death threats over his vote in favor of federal health care reforms .
“ Congressman Mitchell ’s life was threatened both prior to and following the vote , ” said press secretary Adam Bozzi .
Bozzi said Mitchell also received calls at his Tempe home and someone left a note about health care with coal and dog feces at his congressional office in suburban Phoenix .
One caller said she was so filled with rage that the Congressman should ‘ watch his back ’ and called for a bomber to blow up his Scottsdale office , Bozzi said .
" His wife has been harassed at their Tempe home , and his son – a Tempe city councilman – also received menacing calls , as well , " Bozzi said .
Just wait until the summer strolls along .
And the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19th , is right around the corner .
Law enforcement is not looking forward to the day that Timothy McVeigh launched his terrorist attack on US soil .

MONTGOMERY , Ala . ( AP ) --
A bill that would scrap the " winner - take - all " system of dividing Alabama 's nine electors in presidential elections has been approved by a House committee on a party - lines vote .
The House Constitution and Elections Committee voted 7 - 5 Wednesday in favor of the bill that would divide Alabama 's electors proportionately .
Currently only Nebraska and Maine do not give all electoral votes to the winning candidate .
Democrats on the panel supported the bill saying it would make people voting for the losing candidate feel like they also had a part in the process .
Republicans argued scrapping the " winner - take - all " system would work only if all 50 states used that system .
The bill faces trouble in the House , where Republicans have enough votes to keep it from coming up for debate .
What does this look like ?
class ThreadSafeQueue<T> : ThreadStateful { private readonly Queue < T> _queue = new Queue < T >( ) ; public void Enqueue ( T item ) { Loudly ( ( ) => _queue.Enqueue ( item ) ) ; } public T Dequeue ( ) { return When ( ( ) => _queue .
Count !=
0 ) . Silently ( ( ) => _queue .Dequeue ( ) ) ; } }
Okay , it looks a bit weird .
But basically , if you strip away the weird parts , it ’s almost the same as :
class NotThreadSafeQueue <T> { private readonly Queue < T> _queue = new Queue < T >( ) ; public void Enqueue ( T item ) { _queue .
Enqueue ( item ) ; } public T Dequeue ( ) { for ( ; ; ) { if ( _queue .
Count != 0 ) break ; } return _queue .
Dequeue ( ) ; } }
So it ’s a queue that you can push items into freely , and when you try to pull an item out with Dequeue , the call will hang up until there ’s an item to give you – in a way that will seriously heat up your CPU , as it just loops at full speed until the queue has something in it .
It ’s pretty pointless in this form , because if your one thread is hung up waiting for an item to appear in the queue , then you obviously need another thread to insert something in the queue , and that ’s no good because this implementation is hopelessly non-threadsafe .
The advantage of the weird kind , as indicated by the name , is that it ’s thread safe , and also it has a more efficient way of waiting than spinning in a loop .
The methods When , Silently and Loudly are threading primitives .
What do they mean ?
When means “ Wait until this condition is true before allowing one thread to execute what comes next . ”
It must always be followed by a “ chained ” call to one of the other two primitives .
If two or more threads are waiting at the same time , when the condition becomes true only one thread will return from the wait .
Silently means “ I need to access some mutable data , but I ’m not going to affect the value of any of my When conditions . ”
Loudly means “ I need to modify some mutable data so as to possibly cause a When condition to become true . ”
Both Loudly and Silently can be used without waiting first , i.e. without a When prefix .
The distinction between Loudly and Silently is actually not totally essential for correct programs .
A
When condition only needs to be re-evaluated right after some Loudly code executes .
You could forgo Silently and simply use Loudly all the time .
Silently is just a way of helping the system to minimize the time it spends re-evaluating When conditions .
So this makes writing a thread safe queue very neat .
And it ’s applicable to other more complex scenarios ; regardless of how complex the state of our object is , and our inter - thread dependencies , by inheriting from ThreadStateful and using the three primitives we can keep the code pretty readable .
A hatch is a kind of window in an interior wall , like a serving hatch between a kitchen and a dining room .
It has a small shelf , only big enough to hold one thing at a time .
So it ’s either occupied with a single occupant , or not .
If you want to put something into the hatch , you have to wait for it to become unoccupied .
If you want to take something from the hatch , you have to wait for it to become occupied .
With our new primitives , this is ridiculously simple :
class Hatch <T> : ThreadStateful { private T _occupant ; private bool _occupied ; public void Put ( T item ) {
When ( ( ) => !_occupied ) .
Loudly ( ( ) => { _occupant = item ; _occupied = true ; } ) ; } public T Get ( ) { return When ( ( ) => _occupied ) .
Loudly ( ( ) =>
{ _occupied = false ; return _occupant ; } ) ; } }
No need to use locks , events , whatever .
Inside the primitives , we can just write ordinary code , because we know only one thread at a time is running the code inside the primitives .
No need to worry about the exact order in which we update variables .
And the fluent , chained way the primitives work means that our code stays left - to - right readable .
Here ’s a little test that combines both the classes we ’ve come up with so far :
var hatch1 = new Hatch < int >( ) ; var hatch2 = new Hatch < int > ( ) ; var queue = new ThreadSafeQueue<int >( ) ; const int count = 10000 ; ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(o => { for ( var n = 0 ; n < count ; n++) { hatch1. Put(n ) ; queue.Enqueue( hatch2.Get ( ) ) ; } } ) ; ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(o => { for ( var n = count ; n < ( count * 2 ) ; n++) { queue. Enqueue( hatch1.Get ( ) ) ; hatch2 .
Put (n ) ; } } ) ; for ( var n = 0 ; n < count ; n++) { Debug.Assert( queue .Dequeue ( ) == n ) ; Debug.Assert( queue .Dequeue ( ) == n + count ) ; } Console. WriteLine ( " Done " ) ;
There are three threads there .
Two are passing things back and forth via a couple of hatches , and also logging their activities to the queue , and the third thread is monitoring what appears in the queue , checking that everything appears in exactly the right order .
An important type of resource is a “ many readers , single writer ” .
Rather like a file handle , it has one kind of use ( “ reading ” ) that any number of threads can indulge in simultaneously , but another kind of use ( “ writing ” ) that is exclusive .
And writing is so exclusive , it even clashes with reading , not just other attempts at writing .
So to open the resource for reading , you have to wait until any writer has closed the resource .
To open it for writing , you have to wait for all readers or any writer to close it first .
How hard is it to implement with these three primitives ?
Firstly , for demonstration purposes only , we need something to represent a handle to the resource .
The simplest version of that must be :
public class Handle : IDisposable { private readonly Action _closeAction ; public Handle ( Action closeAction ) { _closeAction = closeAction ; } public void Dispose ( ) { if ( _closeAction != null ) { _closeAction ( ) ; _closeAction = null ; } } }
It ’s really just an Action delegate wrapped up in IDisposable , to make it seem more resource - like .
It means the caller will be able to say :
using ( var handle = resource .
OpenForWriting ( ) ) { // blah ... }
Obviously for a real resource , we ’d make OpenForWriting return a class with operations that allow mutation of the state of the resource , and OpenForReading return a class that only has simple getter properties .
Also I ’m being extra picky about getting IDisposable right – according to the docs , the caller is allowed to call Dispose multiple times on the same object and it should be no different to calling it once .
Strange but true .
So I just guard against that by discarding the delegate after it ’s been called once .
In the same way , a real implementation would throw ObjectDisposedException if any of its other methods were called after Dispose .
Anyway , so on to the implementation :
class OneWriterManyReaders : ThreadStateful { private bool _writing ; private int _reading ; public IDisposable OpenForReading ( ) { When (( ) => !_writing ) . Silently ( ( ) => { _reading ++ ; } ) ; return new Handle ( ( ) => Loudly ( ( ) => { _reading --; } ) ) ; } public IDisposable OpenForWriting ( ) { When ( ( ) =>
! _writing && _reading == 0 ) . Silently ( ( ) => { _writing = true ; } ) ; return new Handle ( ( ) => Loudly ( ( ) => { _writing = false ; } ) ) ; } }
Behold the simplicity !
It practically writes itself .
The state is just ordinary variables .
The code is almost plain English .
You can see it ’s correct .
Each lambda that we pass to one of the primitives is like a tiny oasis of calm , where we do n’t have to worry about the complexities of threading .
One more interesting class : a channel .
This is something described in Tony Hoare ’s famous book CSP .
It ’s a lot like a hatch , except when you put something on it , you hang around and wait until someone picks it up .
So it seems like it should be a simple matter of modifying Hatch .
But this first version has a bug in it .
Can you spot it ?
class BrokenChannel <T> : ThreadStateful { private T _occupant ; private bool _occupied ; public void Send ( T item ) { When ( ( ) => !_occupied ) .
Loudly ( ( ) =>
{ _occupied = true ; _occupant = item ; } ) ; When ( ( ) => !_occupied ) .
Silently ( ( ) => { } ) ; } public T Receive ( ) { return When ( ( ) => _occupied ) .
Loudly ( ( ) =>
{ _occupied = false ; return _occupant ; } ) ; } }
All I ’ve really done ( apart from some creative renaming ) is put in that extra wait ( passing a no - op , because I just want to wait , and When has no effect unless it is followed by another primitive ) .
After storing a new occupant , I wait until there is no occupant .
What could possibly be wrong with that ?
The problem is that a second thread could put in a new occupant !
So then we might never return from our wait ; it depends on a third thread removing the second thread ’s item .
Our original thread can’t remove it , because it ’s still mistakenly waiting for its own item to be removed .
So this could lead to a disastrous permanent deadlock .
This is an example of the ABA problem – the mistaken assumption that , because things now look the same as they did the last time I looked , then obviously nothing happened during that time .
But by taking advantage of the simplicity of the primitives , here ’s one way to solve it :
class Channel <T> : ThreadStateful { private T _occupant ; private bool _occupied ; private uint _counter ; public void Send ( T item ) { uint myCounter = 0 ; When ( ( ) => !_occupied ) .
Loudly ( ( ) =>
{ _occupied = true ; _occupant = item ; myCounter = ++ _counter ; } ) ; When ( ( ) => _counter != myCounter ) . Silently ( ( ) => { } ) ; } public T Receive ( ) { return When ( ( ) => _occupied ) .
Loudly ( ( ) =>
{ _occupied = false ; ++_counter ; return _occupant ; } ) ; } }
We give each new occupant ( or lack of occupant ) an effectively unique identity by using a counter .
This makes it extremely easy to see if our occupant is still in there – we just wait for the counter to change .
The only danger is if the counter wraps all the way round during a single call to Send , but that will take 4.2 billion increments , so it ’s pretty safe .
If you ’re concerned you could use ulong , and allow for 18 billion billion increments , but I think that would be a little paranoid !
So all the remains is to present the implementation of the primitives .
It ’s actually very simple .
All they do is encapsulate a simple usage pattern for Monitor .
Wait and Monitor .
Pulse .
Firstly , to allow the fluent - style chained method calls , we need a type that we can return from When :
public struct WaitingOperation { private readonly object _locker ; private readonly Func< bool > _waitCondition ; public WaitingOperation ( object locker , Func< bool > waitCondition ) { _locker = locker ; _waitCondition = waitCondition ; } public T Silently < T>( Func < T > readOp ) { Debug .
Assert ( _locker != null ) ; Debug.
Assert( _waitCondition != null ) ; lock ( _locker ) { while ( !_waitCondition ( ) ) Monitor .
Wait ( _locker ) ; return readOp ( ) ; } } public T Loudly < T>( Func < T > writeOp ) { Debug .
Assert ( _locker != null ) ; Debug.
Assert( _waitCondition != null ) ; lock ( _locker ) { while ( !_waitCondition ( ) ) Monitor .
Wait ( _locker ) ; T result = writeOp ( ) ; Monitor .
Pulse ( _locker ) ; return result ; } } public void Silently ( Action readOp ) { Silently ( ( ) => { readOp ( ) ; return 0 ; } ) ; } public void Loudly ( Action writeOp ) { Loudly ( ( ) => { writeOp ( ) ; return 0 ; } ) ; } }
It just stores the wait condition ( as a Func delegate ) and an object to lock on .
Then it has the Loudly and Silently methods , which encapsulate the lock / wait / pulse pattern .
The only different between them is that Silently does n’t bother to pulse .
For convenience there are also overloads of the two methods which accept Action delegates , where no return value is needed .
Then there ’s the base class used in all the above examples :
public class ThreadStateful { private readonly object _locker = new object ( ) ; protected WaitingOperation When ( Func< bool > waitFor ) { return new WaitingOperation ( _locker , waitFor ) ; } protected T Silently < T>( Func < T > readOp ) { lock ( _locker ) { return readOp ( ) ; } } protected T Loudly < T>( Func < T> writeOp ) { lock ( _locker ) { T result = writeOp ( ) ; Monitor .
Pulse ( _locker ) ; return result ; } } protected void Silently ( Action readOp ) { Silently ( ( ) => { readOp ( ) ; return 0 ; } ) ; } protected void Loudly ( Action writeOp ) { Loudly ( ( ) => { writeOp ( ) ; return 0 ; } ) ; } }
It creates a private object to use for locking , and has the When method which is just a factory for instances of WaitingOperation .
It also has its own simpler versions of Loudly and Silently which do n’t wait on a condition .
Throughout the design , it is ensured that when the code passed into the primitives is executing , the _locker object is owned by one thread .
So in all the code passed to the primitives , you can directly access the mutable state of your derived class .
As a wrapping layer , it ’s so thin it ’s almost see - through .
But I find it much more instantly comprehensible than using the Monitor APIs directly .
They are actually quite difficult to explain clearly ; they have somewhat spooky behaviour with regard to the state of the _locker object , temporarily unlocking it to allow other threads to progress .
If you do n’t have language support for anonymous methods with closure over local variables then the Monitor APIs are probably the simplest interface that could be offered .
But as C# does have such support , we can make the programming interface more natural .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
There have been a lot of well - kept secrets among the global warmists - which is primarily why the so - called “ Climategate ” stolen e-mails proved such a scandal .
They showed that , in addition to squelching dissenters , the warmists were admitting things to each other that they were denying to the public .
They felt , as a Jack Nicholson character put it , “ You ca n’t handle the truth ! ”
But now the truth is coming out .
One fact is that there has been no statistically significant warming for quite awhile .
The other is that temperatures in the Middle Ages , at the very least in the Northern Hemisphere , were considerably warmer than they are now .
Conceding both these points in a BBC interview utterly without the need for waterboarding or other “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” was professor Phil Jones .
He was director of the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit , where the hacked Internet server released thousands of e-mails and other documents .
Mr. Jones has temporarily stepped down pending an investigation .
According to the widely accepted authority on the subject , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the evidence for manmade warming is “ unequivocal . ”
As Kevin Trenberth , a lead author , told Congress in 2007 when the group ’s latest report appeared : “ The planet is running a ‘ fever ’ and ‘ it is apt to get much worse . ’ ”
( Not incidentally , that report won half the Nobel Peace Prize , with the other half going to global warming guru Al Gore . )
But in one of those hacked e-mails , Mr. Trenberth stated that “ we ca n’t account for the lack of warming at the moment ” which he deemed “ a travesty . ”
That most definitely was not meant for public consumption .
Mr. Jones , however , told the BBC there ’s been no “ statistically significant ” warming since 1995 .
That ’s something highly educated , highly esteemed skeptics like Massachusetts Institute of Technology meteorologist Richard Lindzen and former NASA senior climatologist Roy Spencer have been pointing out for awhile .
“ In the IPCC view , climate change is mostly under the control of humans , ” Mr. Spencer told me .
“ I believe [ temperature trends ] are essentially natural . ”
Naturally , Mr. Jones insisted the recent nonwarming is n’t a trend , but rather a “ blip . ”
And while a study in Nature magazine said two years ago the “ blip ” may last another decade and we might even see some cooling , Mr. Jones may well be right and temperatures may resume their climb .
The importance of any current plateau is that during that same period we ’ve belched so - called “ greenhouse gases ” ( GHGs ) into the atmosphere at rising rates , from 6,510 million metric tons in 1996 to 8,230 in 2006 - a 26 percent increase in just one decade .
Atmospheric concentrations have also reached the highest levels ever observed .
That also concerns Mr. Jones ’ second major concession , which is apparently the strongest admission by a major warmist that the earth could have been warmer during medieval times - around 800 - 1,300 .
Warmists have tried to dismiss this altogether , or insisted it only applied to northern climes .
Mr. Jones admitted , however , that information from tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere did n’t contradict those in the north , merely that relatively speaking , there were n’t many .
But if they were found , “ then obviously the late 20th century warmth would not be unprecedented . ”
It ’s been found .
A Nature study last year showed water temperatures in the Indonesia area were the same in medieval times as they are today .
Therefore the grossly simplistic formula of “ greater GHG emissions equals greater warming ” is false - and we absolutely know there are major natural factors affecting warming .
Unless you ’ve seen images of Viking ships with smoke stacks you know that , aside from some small herds of very small methane - belching cows , mankind was producing virtually no GHGs back then .
If the medieval warming was n’t manmade , then the recent warming may not be , either .
So let ’s salute Phil Jones for his honesty - even if he came by it relatively late in life .

Today GMA previewed an upcoming National Geographic Channel special on a Canadian polygamist sect that 's a bit different from the American variety ;
They 've denounced Warren Jeffs , campaign for society to accept polygamy as moral lifestyle , and even tell jokes .
Patriarch Winston Blackmore has admitted that he 's forgotten the names of some of his children .
His second daughter , Mary Roundy , says she did n't spend much time with her father growing up , " But whenever he'd do things with us , it would be really special . "
She 's in a monogamous marriage with a man who was also raised in the polygamist lifestyle .
" Even with my father 's children , most do n't seem particularly interested in living that lifestyle , " she said .
" I do n't see it dying out right away .
Maybe a few generations .
Who knows ? "

There 's more data coming in on the extent to which low income Americans depend on public institutions for broadband .
A new report released by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says that 44 percent of those living below the poverty level access e-mail and the Web via their local public library .
And nearly a third of Americans over 14 used library Internet services in 2009 .
That 's about 77 million people .
The study was based on almost 50,000 telephone and Web form surveys .
It also found that :
Forty percent of those 2009 users accessed library Internet resources to find employment .
Seventy - five percent of these looked for a job online .
Half posted their resume or filled out an online job application .
Another 37 percent researched some illness or medical problem , or searched for or made an appointment with a doctor .
Forty - two percent used their local library 's Internet for education ; over a third of these did their homework online .
A big portion of these users were teenagers .
Sixty percent accessed a library computer to contact someone else .
The study is further confirmation ( if more is needed ) that low income Americans know that broadband is now an absolute necessity in this economy .
It 's also more evidence of the huge pressure on libraries to meet this demand .
About a third of libraries say they lack both the ' Net connections and staff power to provide the services for which low income patrons ask .
Doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital ( GOSH ) along with colleagues at the University College London , the Royal Free Hospital , and Careggi University Hospital in Florence have successfully transplanted a trachea into a 10 year old boy using his own stem cells .
A donor trachea was taken , stripped of its cells into a collagen - like scaffold , and then infused with the boy ’s stem cells .
The trachea was surgically placed into the boy and allowed to develop in place .
Because his own cells were used , there was little to no risk of rejection .
This was the first time a child had received such a stem cell augmented transplant and the first time that a complete trachea had been used .
This also marks only the second time that an organ has been transplanted into a person while stem cells were still forming the new body part .
Previous attempts required the donor organ to be infused with stem cells and incubated for weeks before transplantation .
This surgery is an amazing step forward for regenerative medicine and organ transplants , and could be a sign of a new direction in these kinds of surgeries .
We reported earlier about the first person to ever receive a stem cell grown windpipe .
Claudia Castillo was around 30 when her stem cells were used to grow a new bronchea on a donated trachea scaffold in 2008 .
That windpipe was incubated in a lab for weeks before she was operated upon .
In 2009 , Dr. Macchiarini ( leader of the team responsible for the earlier procedure ) operated on a 53 year old Italian woman , replacing a portion of her trachea with a scaffold covered in her stem cells .
As with the recent 10 year old boy , this operation did not require weeks of incubation .
In fact , the stem cells were applied just hours before the scaffold was placed inside the patient .
In just two years time , then , Dr. Macchiarini ( and his colleagues in the EU and UK ) has gone from producing the first stem cell organ transplant , to streamlining that procedure so that the organ is mostly reformed while still in the body .
That ’s simply incredible .
Following this trend forward several iterations , and it may be possible to completely renew an organ , or replace it , simply through the correct application of stem cells .
Compared to the newest non-stem cell surgical options , this procedure was considerably faster and less expensive .
The unnamed 10 year old boy had Long Segment Tracheal Stenosis , a condition which narrows the trachea and makes the patient feel as if they are breathing through a straw .
It is a potentially fatal condition .
Typical treatments ( which are still relatively new ) involve a conventional transplant .
The boy had received such a treatment but a metal stent used in that procedure damaged his aorta several years later .
Rather than face the uncertainties of another transplant , with the risk of rejection , GOSH doctors requested Dr. Macchiarini ’s help in transplanting a stem cell covered scaffold .
Letting the trachea develop in the patient may eventually make this process cost just tens of thousands of pounds rather than hundreds of thousands .
The procedure can be seen in a simulation developed by Dr. Macchiarini .
The video can be found on the UCL News site by clicking the photo below .
There is no sound .
To further the development of the stem cells on the trachea scaffold , Dr. Macchiarini used various cytokine drugs ( shown as injections in the video ) .
These drugs help signal to the stem cells where and how to develop .
While not directly stated in the press releases or news segments about this procedure , I suspect that such drug augmentation may become a more integral part of stem cell therapies in the future .
As multipotent cells are directed to replace a wide variety of different organs and tissues , proteins and other chemicals may be necessary to speed stem cell specialization and keep it focused on the type of cell that is desired .
When Claudio Castillo received her stem cell scaffold windpipe the procedure was basically just a lab test .
It had never been tried before and was likely years from being developed to a point of clinical use .
Now , with two more patients having undergone a new ( and improved ) version of the transplant , we can cautiously pronounce this a developing trend in treatment .
Oh , we ’re still years from seeing transplants of this kind from becoming commonplace , but every successful case is a step in the right direction .
Also , with every new patient there are more doctors that gain experience in the procedure .
I think that we are very likely to see more of these transplants ( at the rare , lab - based level ) in the near future .
Hopefully we ’re all a little closer to being able to use stem cells and scaffolds to grow new organs when we need them .
I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll say it again : medicine is cool .

It goes without saying it just was n't The Disco Biscuits without Barber but all the guest guitarists came out and held it down .
Both Indobox guitarists did very well this weekend , especially Mike Carter .
The set started off with simple yet great choices using two songs they hardly play in one nice segment .
Just being able to catch Commercial Amen > Liquid Handcuffs was a treat .
Caterpillar > Confrontation > Cyclone >
Confrontation segment which was definitely the highlight of the night for me though .
This was part of the 2nd set for the Boston show which was shut down before they could finish the show .
Caterpillar peak was botched and was missing Barbers signature riff but it was still decent .
The >
Confrontation ending had some wonderful layering / delay effect work by Mike Carter than REALLY added well to the ending .
Sammy on guitar for two amazing bust - outs was not only a treat but played exceptionally well .
Trooper McCue had a nice little jam in it and Barfly was an all around great way to end the set with some beautiful Blues guitar by Sammy .
Set II started off with a bang , MEMPHIS > Buddha was amazing .
Buddha ending was a shredfest but it was n't Barber after all so no complaints .
After a lackluster but fun Boom Shanker the show started to take off again with Tom Hamilton absolutely killing the song choices .
As a member of Electron he knew the material well and played his best as always .
My ONLY complaint was Quad D , it completely ruined the flow of the show in my opinion .
Home Again encore was decent , you could barely tell there were 3 guitarists on stage because they were all shredding their hearts out so it kind of blended in .
Overall I want to thank The Disco Biscuits for doing what they do best and that 's making the best of a situation and playing their best to accommodate their fans .
I also want to wish Jon a speedy recovery , it 's just not the same without you !
- March 24 , 2010 Excellent Show For What It 's Worth
Provantage of North Canton ( is n't that the birthplace of Marilyn Manson ? ) is featuring a number of 12 - core AMD Opteron processors on its retail website .
Obviously , this is well - ahead of the launch -- and subject to the usual caveats -- but if you 're a chip - head the info is rather interesting nonetheless .
The most expensive of the lot , the Opteron X12 6176 SE ( pictured above ) is a 2.3GHz processor with an 18 MB cache , 105 watts , and it can be yours for $ 1,485.61 .
If you 're not quite in the mood to break the bank , the X12 6128 SE is a 2GHz chip with 16MB , 80 watts , and it 's currently listed at $ 291 .
According to PC World , the processors ( codenamed Magny - Cours ) should start shipping to retailers " around the time Intel announces the eight - core Nehalem - EX processor , " later this month -- even if it appears that someone in Ohio has jumped the gun a little bit .
Differences in the number and speed of cometary impacts onto Jupiter 's large moons Ganymede and Callisto some 3.8 billion years ago can explain their vastly different surfaces and interior states , according to research by scientists at the Southwest Research Institute appearing online in Nature Geoscience Jan. 24 , 2010 .
Ganymede and Callisto are similar in size and are made of a similar mixture of ice and rock , but data from the Galileo and Voyager spacecraft show that they look different at the surface and on the inside .
A conclusive explanation for the differences between Ganymede and Callisto has eluded scientists since the Voyager Jupiter encounters 30 years ago .
Dr. Amy C. Barr and Dr. Robin M. Canup of the SwRI Planetary Science Directorate created a model of melting by cometary impacts and rock core formation to show that Ganymede and Callisto's evolutionary paths diverged about 3.8 billion years ago during the Late Heavy Bombardment , the phase in lunar history dominated by large impact events .
" Impacts during this period melted Ganymede so thoroughly and deeply that the heat could not be quickly removed .
All of Ganymede 's rock sank to its center the same way that all the chocolate chips sink to the bottom of a melted carton of ice cream , " says Barr .
" Callisto received fewer impacts at lower velocities and avoided complete melting . "
In the Barr and Canup model , Jupiter 's strong gravity focuses cometary impactors onto Ganymede and Callisto .
Each impact onto Ganymede or Callisto's mixed ice and rock surface creates a pool of liquid water , allowing rock in the melt pool to sink to the moon 's center .
Ganymede is closer to Jupiter and therefore is hit by twice as many icy impactors as Callisto , and the impactors hitting Ganymede have a higher average velocity .
Modeling by Barr and Canup shows that core formation begun during the late heavy bombardment becomes energetically self - sustaining in Ganymede but not Callisto .
The study sheds new light on the " Ganymede - Callisto dichotomy , " a classical problem in comparative planetology , a field of study that seeks to explain why some solar system objects with similar bulk characteristics have radically different appearances .
In particular , the study links the evolution of Jupiter 's moons to the orbital migration of the outer planets and the bombardment history of Earth 's moon .
" Similar to Earth and Venus , Ganymede and Callisto are twins , and understanding how they were born the same and grew up to be so different is of tremendous interest to planetary scientists , " explains Barr .
" Our study shows that Ganymede and Callisto record the fingerprints of the early evolution of the solar system , which is very exciting and not at all expected . "
Distant galaxy clusters mysteriously stream at a million miles per hour along a path roughly centered on the southern constellations Centaurus and Hydra .
A new study led by Alexander Kashlinsky at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , tracks this collective motion -- dubbed the " dark flow " -- to twice the distance originally reported .
" This is not something we set out to find , but we cannot make it go away , " Kashlinsky said .
" Now we see that it persists to much greater distances -- as far as 2.5 billion light - years away . "
The new study appears in the March 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The clusters appear to be moving along a line extending from our solar system toward Centaurus / Hydra , but the direction of this motion is less certain .
Evidence indicates that the clusters are headed outward along this path , away from Earth , but the team can not yet rule out the opposite flow .
" We detect motion along this axis , but right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going , " Kashlinsky said .
The dark flow is controversial because the distribution of matter in the observed universe cannot account for it .
Its existence suggests that some structure beyond the visible universe -- outside our " horizon " -- is pulling on matter in our vicinity .
Cosmologists regard the microwave background -- a flash of light emitted 380,000 years after the universe formed -- as the ultimate cosmic reference frame .
Relative to it , all large - scale motion should show no preferred direction .
The hot X - ray - emitting gas within a galaxy cluster scatters photons from the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .
Because galaxy clusters do n't precisely follow the expansion of space , the wavelengths of scattered photons change in a way that reflects each cluster 's individual motion .

This results in a minute shift of the microwave background 's temperature in the cluster 's direction .
The change , which astronomers call the kinematic Sunyaev - Zel ' dovich ( KSZ ) effect , is so small that it has never been observed in a single galaxy cluster .
But in 2000 , Kashlinsky , working with Fernando Atrio - Barandela at the University of Salamanca , Spain , demonstrated that it was possible to tease the subtle signal out of the measurement noise by studying large numbers of clusters .
In 2008 , armed with a catalog of 700 clusters assembled by Harald Ebeling at the University of Hawaii and Dale Kocevski , now at the University of California , Santa Cruz , the researchers applied the technique to the three - year WMAP data release .
That 's when the mystery motion first came to light .
The new study builds on the previous one by using the five - year results from WMAP and by doubling the number of galaxy clusters .
" It takes , on average , about an hour of telescope time to measure the distance to each cluster we work with , not to mention the years required to find these systems in the first place , " Ebeling said .
" This is a project requiring considerable followthrough . "
According to Atrio - Barandela , who has focused on understanding the possible errors in the team 's analysis , the new study provides much stronger evidence that the dark flow is real .
For example , the brightest clusters at X - ray wavelengths hold the greatest amount of hot gas to distort CMB photons .
" When processed , these same clusters also display the strongest KSZ signature -- unlikely if the dark flow were merely a statistical fluke , " he said .
In addition , the team , which now also includes Alastair Edge at the University of Durham , England , sorted the cluster catalog into four " slices " representing different distance ranges .
They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice .
While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation , the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement .
The researchers are currently working to expand their cluster catalog in order to track the dark flow to about twice the current distance .
Improved modeling of hot gas within the galaxy clusters will help refine the speed , axis , and direction of motion .
Future plans call for testing the findings against newer data released from the WMAP project and the European Space Agency 's Planck mission , which is also currently mapping the microwave background .
The Tories questioned the figures used by Gordon Brown in his podcast Prime Minister Gordon Brown has acknowledged that he " misused " immigration figures , after being criticised by the statistics watchdog .
In a podcast on Friday , Mr Brown said net migration into the UK fell from 237,000 in 2007 to 163,000 in 2008 and provisionally 147,000 in 2009 .
But the head of UK Statistics Authority agreed with a Tory complaint that he had made inaccurate comparisons .
Downing Street said it accepted the statistics had been " unclear " .
But it insisted that Mr Brown had since corrected them .
The rebuke came hours after the prime minister talked up government progress on immigration .
In a speech in London , Mr Brown said there had been a significant drop in asylum claims and net immigration thanks to Labour 's " tough and hard - headed " policy and warned would - be illegal migrants they were not " welcome " in the UK .
' Care needed '
In the podcast , Mr Brown cited the figures to argue that a new points system introduced in 2008 - determining which skilled workers from outside the EU can enter the country - had " radically changed the way we are dealing with immigration " .
The Conservatives said the PM had used two different sets of statistics to make his case and left out important caveats about the figures .
The Statistics Authority hopes that in the political debate over the coming weeks all parties will be careful in their use of statistics , to protect the integrity of official statistics
Sir Michael Scholar
Brown steps up immigration battle Mark Easton on the statistical row They said he had failed to point out that the net immigration figure for 2009 only covered the year up to June , while asylum seekers and people overstaying their original visas were included in the figures for 2007 and 2008 but excluded for 2009 .
Sir Michael Scholar , the head of independent UK Statistics Authority , said he had written to Mr Brown to point out that the figures he cited for net immigration between 2007 and 2009 were " not comparable " .
In addition , he said the prime minister 's comments had not taken into account the fact that the figure for 2007 had been revised .
However , Sir Michael noted that the figures used by Mr Brown in Wednesday 's speech were correct .
He added : " The Statistics Authority hopes that in the political debate over the coming weeks all parties will be careful in their use of statistics , to protect the integrity of official statistics . "
Responsibility
In response to Sir Michael 's letter , a Downing Street spokesman said : " We accept that some of the statistics used in the prime minister 's podcast were not strictly comparable and as a result were unclear .
" As the chair of the Statistics Authority points out in his letter , the prime minister clarified the position in his speech today [ Wednesday ] .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The figures he used in his speech are consistent with the analysis set out in the accompanying note from Sir Michael Scholar . "
Immigration Minister Phil Woolas urged people not to " dance on a pin head " when it came to the battle over statistics .
" The fact is the figures are down , " he told Channel 4 News .
" That is what is important . "
But shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said the prime minister had given an " inaccurate picture of his record on immigration " .
" Britain should expect better from its prime minister , " he said .
" No wonder we need change . "
BBC home affairs editor Mark Easton said that despite the watchdog 's desire not to get involved in political controversy , it had found itself in the middle of a pre-election spat .
The Statistics Authority was set up by Mr Brown last year to ensure the correct use of official data .
It has ticked off both Labour and the Conservatives in recent months about their use of statistics , saying they had a responsibility to ensure their claims were not misleading .

By Linda Killian , Thomas Jefferson Street blog
Sarah Palin did her best to try to channel Ronald Reagan in her speech to the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville this weekend .
She may believe that adopting his conservative rhetoric and following his example will take her to the White House , but let ’s face it -- she ’s no Reagan .
She began her speech by wishing Reagan a “ Happy Birthday ” -- it would have been his 99th - - and one ca n’t help wondering what he would have made of the speech .
She hit all of Reagan ’s favorite issues and combined them with the populist anger manifested by the tea party movement .
She derided the bank bailout and conveniently forgot to mention it happened during the Bush administration .
She warned of the attempted government takeover of healthcare , out - of - control spending and huge national debt , and of course , called for lower taxes .
“ The government that governs least , governs best … only limited government can expand prosperity and opportunity for all , ” she declared .
“ These enduring truths have been passed down from Washington to Lincoln to Reagan ” -- to , presumably , Palin .
She threw in Reagan ’s shining city on a hill reference and closed by declaring , “ There is nothing wrong with America that together we ca n’t fix as Americans , ” which comes alarmingly close to a famous Bill Clinton speech quote .
She also channeled Reagan in talking about national security issues and America ’s place in the world , but when she dismissed Barack Obama ’s efforts at fighting terrorism by saying , “ We need a commander in chief , not a professor of law , ” she diverged sharply from the Reagan script .
Reagan effectively used humor , but did so disarmingly and with a warm smile .
Even his political opponents ended up laughing along .
Palin ’s jokes are caustic and angry ,
This is what above all else distinguishes a Sarah Palin speech -- the snide put - down and the snarky remark delivered with a broad , sneering smile and spitfire demeanor .
She does n’t seem to think a speech is complete if she has n’t winked and name - called her way through it .
It ’s not a coincidence that her nickname as co-captain of her high school women ’s basketball team was “ Sarah Barracuda . ”
She probably was n’t afraid to throw a few elbows then and she certainly is n’t now .
It must take an awful lot of self - confidence , or maybe just bad judgment , to refer to the president as a “ charismatic guy with a teleprompter ” when you have crib notes scribbled on your hand .
If her implication was that Obama is an empty suit , she could n’t be farther off the mark .
As illustrated by his recent meeting with Republicans , he is supremely intelligent and has an impressive command of facts and public policy issues -- something even her most ardent supporters would have trouble claiming about Palin with a straight face .
There ’s nothing wrong with questioning the Obama administration ’s policies or its effectiveness , but why not leave it at that ?
Why does Palin feel compelled to ask those who supported Obama , “ How ’s that hopey , changey stuff working out for you ? ”
Because , to turn the phrase made famous by George W. Bush on its head -- she ’s a divider , not a uniter .
And that , along with a host of other reasons too numerous to mention , is why she will never be president .
But it is also why she draws a crowd .
She speaks to the angry , populist voters who love her so .
It ’s performance art .
Toward the end of the 2008 campaign , her events were drawing many times the number of people as were John McCain ’s rallies .
And for much of the media , one of the most irritating things about Palin is that she revels in the politics of personal destruction at the same time that she believes she should be off limits .
Should the Eastern , liberal media establishment call her out on her more egregious gaffes or lack of knowledge , they are taking sides , picking on her , and being unfair , according to Palin and her supporters .
Members of the Republican Party establishment can’t stand her .
Privately , they are all too happy to tell you they do n’t think she works hard or knows her stuff and they certainly do n’t think she ’s paid her dues .
But they have come to the realization that they have to take her seriously .
Palin made a not - so - veiled reference to this when she talked both in her speech and in her Sunday Fox interview with Chris Wallace about how great hard - fought primary battles are for the system .
“ Contested primaries are n’t civil war -- they are democracy at work and that ’s beautiful , ” she said .
Watch out , Mitt Romney .
Should Palin decide she wants to run for president in 2012 , you ’ll be fighting “ Sarah Barracuda . ”

Banks are showing their true colors and what little regard they have for the average American .
As they advertise with cute and friendly faces assuring consumers they are looking out for their best interest , behind their backs they send in a locust of lobbyist onto Washington to do everything in their power to gut any sensible financial regulation .
The vultures are picking off every piece of what used to be the middle class .
This is the model of the new banking and financial system that many will have to contend with .
Americans have seen their access to loans and credit contract at the fastest pace in history while banks have now opened up an unlimited credit card with the taxpayer paying the bill for too big to fail .
Banks are doing their best to create a narrative that “ if we did n’t bailout the banks then the world would have ended storyline ” but the vast majority of Americans did not support the banking bailout .
If you want to see how quickly credit is contracting take a look at this :
The chart above merely highlights what you already know .
Banks no longer trust the average American .
While they based all their bailouts on the idea that taxpayer money was needed to keep banks lending this has been a lie .
In fact , banks need the money to plug the hole that their toxic assets are burning on their balance sheets .
You can also look at the amount of credit card offers you are getting in the mail to gauge how quickly the market has changed .
No longer do banks want to give credit out ( that is , unless it is government backed like mortgages which they are all the more willing to lend out ) .
The U.S. has over 8,000 banks with the large concentration of assets in 10 banks .
These banks continue to use bailout funds to plug the problems from the boom years .
But this is not in the best interest of average Americans .
If Wall Street and politicians were honest , the bailouts would have been labeled as a massive charity to the elite of the country who made disastrous bets over the past decade .
The public takes the lumps while Wall Street actually gets richer .
While banks do n’t want to reel in their spendthrift ways , Americans are pulling back :
Americans are now having to save more and more of their money as is expected in a tough economy .
Yet banks are back to gambling in the stock market while shutting down lending to consumers .
Banks are playing the poor me card by arguing that with too much tight regulation , they ca n’t make loans because they are worried about future balance sheet problems .
Thanks for telling us after you took the public money under false pretenses !
But this is all a political ploy to steal from the working class .
With so many people just unable to even service the debt and rising bankruptcies , banks are now going after good customers who pay their bills on time each month just because they are running out of “ options . ”
Do n’t be fooled .
They are reaping billion dollar profits because they are using excuses to squeeze the golden goose dry .
How about we allow the typical American to borrow at the subsidized low rate from the Federal Reserve directly ?
Why in the world do we need banks to operate as loan sharks in between ?
What we need is to transform the banking industry into a utility model .
A model designed to serve the people , not the banks .
After all , why should they get the privilege of borrowing at criminally low rates while everyone else has to pay the interest and subsidize their gambling adventure ?
Even after all the correction in the market American households still carry an inordinate amount of debt :
A giant portion of income simply goes to pay off debt .
A large part of the debt is interest or money the banks can suck out of the neck of middle class Americans .
Banks live off this margin .
Take for example a $ 100,000 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 6 percent :
Principal : $ 100,000 Total Interest : $ 115,838
In the end , you are paying more than the initial cost and all that interest goes to who ?
What purpose does it serve ?
Banks are delusional and want the public to believe in the propaganda that they need to charge a higher rate because of “ risk ” in the loan .
Are they kidding ?
We already know that they are being supported by the entire Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury .
They can make the most insane kind of bets and ultimately the taxpayer will eat the bill .
And keep in mind many of these banks are borrowing at low levels from the Federal Reserve .
Why not allow the public to keep some of that interest ?
How is this bad ?
If banks were lending their own money it would be a different story but they are not .
They are creating a dishonest narrative and most Americans are not buying it because they operate in reality and not some parallel universe where you can create something out of nothing .
Just think of the billions charged in overdraft fees .
This is criminal .
Why not just default debit cards to stop once the account is dry ?
Instead they want people that charge a $ 2 burger a $ 39 over draft “ convenience fee ” for this nonsense .
Are you kidding ?
Most people do n’t want this .
They find out the hard way and now billions have left the wallet of consumers for this nice little loan shark fee .
$ 39 can buy you lunch for a few days so this is nothing to laugh at when 38,000,000 Americans find themselves on food assistance .
The bulk of the billions are paid by the poor .
Good job banks for helping your fellow Americans .
Yet banks are leeches sucking the productive life blood out of the economy with gimmicks like this .
Time to break the banks up and turn them into utilities .
Take for example JP Morgan .
They announced a Q4 profit of $ 3.28 billion .
Where did they make their money ?
“ ( Huff Po ) JPMorgan ’s biggest trouble spots were in consumer banking and credit card lending .
The bank ’s retail financial services division , which includes its mortgage operations , lost $ 399 million .
That was worse than the final quarter in 2008 , when credit markets had essentially shut down because of the collapse of banks including Lehman Brothers .
The company reported increases in mortgages that were charged off , or classified as uncollectible , including prime mortgages , the highest quality home loans .
It also reported an increase in home equity loan charge - offs . ”
Wait .
So mortgages are being charged off as foreclosures remain high .
And this has spread to so - called prime mortgages as the unemployment and underemployment rate remains at 17.9 percent .
So let us write off mortgages to average Americans .
Where in the world did they get those billions ?
Maybe they made good money in their credit card unit :
“ The credit - card lending division lost $ 306 million during the final three months of 2009 .
Results would ’ve been worse had the bank not had a payment holiday in the period . ”
More losses here ?
So we ’ve ruled out credit cards and mortgages which have become the life blood for Americans .
We ’re running out of places to look for where they can make a $ 3 billion profit :
“ Despite the ongoing problems with consumer banking , JPMorgan is still performing well because of its robust investment banking unit .
As long as stock and bond markets continue to improve , the bank will be able to churn out profits and reward its employees handsomely .
JPMorgan ’s investment bank earned $ 1.9 billion during the fourth quarter , while its asset management division generated $ 424 million in net income .
Fees from financing debt and stock offerings continued to surge in the fourth quarter .
Debt financing fees jumped 58 percent to $ 732 million from the same quarter a year earlier , while stock financing fees climbed 66 percent to $ 549 million . ”
And there you have it .
We are financing Wall Street ’s wonderful gambling casino once again while the traditional banking model has collapsed .
How this is n’t the number one priority for the government and the people to fix is simply astounding .
How we have had no serious financial reform after 26 months of the Great Recession boggles the mind .

PARIS ( AFP ) – Researchers have discovered the genes that allow the opium poppy to make codeine and morphine , according to a new study .
The findings could lead to engineered plants and micro-organisms that efficiently make codeine , one of the most widely prescribed painkillers in the world , the researchers said .
Unlike morphine , codeine cannot be easily converted to heroin .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The enzymes encoded by these two genes have eluded plant biochemists for a half - century , ” said Peter Facchini , a professor at the University of Calgary in Canada and co-author of the paper .
“ In finding not only the enzymes but also the genes , we ’ve make a major step forward , ” he said in a press release .
Opium poppy remains the world ’s dominant source of codeine , morphine and another opiate called oxycodone , according to the study , published Sunday in Nature Chemical Biology .
In clinical medicine , morphine is often regarded as the drug - of - first - choice to relieve severe pain and suffering .
Codeine can be extracted directly from the opium plant , but mostly it is synthesised from the much more abundant morphine found in the opium poppy .

Most morphine produced for pharmaceutical use around the world is converted into codeine .
Once ingested , codeine is converted by an enzyme in the liver to morphine , which is the active painkiller and a naturally occurring compound in humans .
“ With this discovery , we can potentially create plants that will stop production at codeine , ” said Facchini .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Our discovery now makes it possible to use microorganisms to produce opiate drugs and other important pharmaceuticals . ”
Co-author Jillian Hagel , a post - doctoral scientist in Facchini ’s laboratory , used cutting - edge sequencing techniques to sift through some 23,000 different genes to find the one — codeine O - dementhylase ( CODM ) — that produces the plant enzyme which converts codeine into morphine .

“ We have found the missing pieces that were needed to understand how the opium poppy makes morphine , ” she said .
The opium poppy has been grown and exploited for thousands of years for both its medicinal and mind - altering properties .
Morphine was isolated in the early 19th century , while codeine was first identified in 1832 by French chemist Pierre Robiquet .
Apple is on pace to potentially sell more iPads in its first three months than it sold iPhones in the three months after the touch - screen handset made its debut back in 2007 , people familiar with the company 's running sales totals say .
Since going on sale for pre-order last Friday morning , customers have purchased " hundreds of thousands of the device , " those same people told The Wall Street Journal .
By comparison , Apple sold roughly 1.2 million iPhones in the three months following its June 29 , 2007 launch .
Meanwhile , the newspaper claims that Apple is ' racing ' to tie up a broad number of content licensing deals before the iPad officially hits the market in under three weeks .
In particular , the company is trying to convince television networks to drop the price of TV shows that users would downloaded directly to the device .
These efforts and others have reportedly seen the Cupertino - based company temporarily reduce its emphasis on working with newspaper , magazines and textbook publishers on new ways to display their digital content .
" But nailing down the content has proven difficult as some potential collaborators weigh the advantages of working with Apple against the potential threats to their current sources of revenue , " the Journal said , citing people familiar with the situation .
One of the biggest challenges I ’ve had as a writer is separating proper English from Newfoundland English .
I come from a province where the dialect is not only often entirely different from the rest of North America , but it also takes on different forms across the island .
While my mother dropped her h’s from her speech ( “ ’oly ” instead of “ holy ” ) , my father living just 20 minutes away would not pronounce his th’s ( “ maff ” instead of “ math ” ) .
In fact , we have our own dictionary .
I ’m not kidding .
There ’s nothing wrong with this use of language , and I ’m often surprised when others criticize the way we talk ( Newfoundlanders included ) .
Why should we be ashamed of individuality ?
Being from “ the bay , ” people automatically assume I should have a rough accent .
Mostly it ’s disappeared over the years , but when my parents came to visit last summer , I slipped back into words and phrases I had n’t used in awhile .
My roommate could n’t understand me .
So it ’s my duty to school you all about Newfie - speak , in hopes of easing the transition should you ever make it here .
We ’ll begin with one of the most fundamental words in the language : b’y .
“ B’y ” ( pronounced “ bye ” ) is dynamic and complicated .
Even the Newfoundland Dictionary does n’t seem to know much about this word , but I ’m certain it is n’t a warped version of “ boy ” as it applies to females too .
My best guess is that it ’s a shortened form of “ buddy . ”
You can toss this word into almost any conversation , but you have to do it right .
There certainly cannot be any pauses , hints of uncertainty or improper emphasis .
Your best bet is to use it when speaking with friends and acquaintances , as “ b ’y ” suggests amiable terms or at least an open , honest setting .
Here are some examples .
Disbelief , shock , dismay : “ Go on b’y !
You ’re not serious ? ! ”
Sarcasm , ridicule , impatience : “ Oh yes b’y , like I ’d do something like that . ”
Happiness , endearment , excitement : “ You knows I loves you b’y ! ”
You also ca n’t throw it into a normal conversation void of other Newfie words / attitude .
Not okay : “ Excuse me b’y , could you please hand me that glass of expensive Merlot ?
I ’d be ever so grateful . ”
Fail .
The delivery is just as important as the word itself .
Nobody should be able to tell that you are an outsider .
One evening my roommate , while removing his coat , said something like , “ It ’s pretty cold out there tonight b’y . ”
I looked up slowly from my laptop .
The word just hung there in the air , fat and lazy and uncomfortable .
While the context of the sentence was fine , it lacked attitude .
And he knew it .
The word should flow like music .
For your homework , I ’d like you to study the following musical example and use the word at least once in your conversation with a respected superior tomorrow .
There you have it , your first lesson in Newfoundlandia .
I hope you ’re all the wiser for it .

The ebb and flow of gas and electricity into your home contains surprisingly detailed information about your daily life .
Energy usage data , measured moment by moment , allows the reconstruction of a household 's activities : when people wake up , when they come home , when they go on vacation , and maybe even when they take a hot bath .
California 's PG&E is currently in the process of installing " smart meters " that will collect this moment by moment data — 750 to 3000 data points per month per household — for every energy customer in the state .
These meters are aimed at helping consumers monitor and control their energy usage , but right now , the program lacks critical privacy protections .
That 's why EFF and other privacy groups filed comments with the California Public Utilities Commission Tuesday , asking for the adoption of strong rules to protect the privacy and security of customers ' energy - usage information .
Without strong protections , this information can and will be repurposed by interested parties .
It 's not hard to imagine a divorce lawyer subpoenaing this information , an insurance company interpreting the data in a way that allows it to penalize customers , or criminals intercepting the information to plan a burglary .
Marketing companies will also desperately want to access this data to get new intimate new insights into your family 's day - to - day routine–not to mention the government , which wants to mine the data for law enforcement and other purposes .
This is n't just a California issue .
Many threats to the privacy of the home — where our privacy rights should be strongest — were detailed in a 2009 report for the Colorado Public Utility Commission .
The federal government has been promoting the smart grid as part of its economic stimulus package , and last year , EFF and other groups warned the National Institute of Standards and Technology about the privacy and security issues at stake .
For example , security researchers worry that today ’s smart meters and their communications networks are vulnerable to a variety of attacks .
There are also questions of reliability , as PG&E faces criticism from California customers who have seen bills skyrocket after the installation of the new " smart meters . "
Unsurprisingly , California legislators are questioning the rapid rollout .
Texas customers are also complaining .
There are far more questions than answers when it comes to this new technology .
While it 's potentially beneficial , it could also usher in new intrusions into our home and private life .
The states and the federal government should ensure that energy customers get the protection they deserve .

Harnessing Anarchy for Hitler The Nazis ' Bid to Control Carnival
Germany 's Carnival is an expression of anarchic fun and mockery of those in power .
Yet the Nazis sought to harness the potential of the festivities for their own ends .
Anti-Semitic floats and speeches attacking Germany 's enemies were commonplace , and defiance was rare .
Von Siobhán Dowling
You 've probably noticed by the abundance of funny glasses available at your local Cineplex lately that 3D technology is the latest gimmick to become all the rage at movie theaters .
It 's only the first in a long line of techniques aimed at getting movie patrons in theater seats .
Here are a few others .
1. Light tricks .
Has anyone seen Wait Until Dark ?
Starring Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin , horror master Stephen King has called the film 's ending one of the scariest moments in movie history .
Perhaps it was the treatment theaters gave to this film that left such an impression on King : in the movie , there 's a part where Audrey 's character breaks all of the light bulbs in her apartment and shuts all of her window blinds so she is hidden in complete darkness .
As she goes around the place breaking bulbs , theater employees dimmed the lights one by one and eventually turned them all off completely , plunging the theater into total darkness .
2. Smell - o-vision .
There 's a reason this technique was employed on just a single movie " “ it was expensive to install in multiple theaters , distracting ( the smells made a hissing noise when they were emitted ) and somewhat ineffective ( the smells often did n't show up until after the thing that was supposed to be odorous had left the screen ) .
Moviegoers were unimpressed and bad word of mouth killed this gimmick almost immediately .
Although the movie , Scent of Mystery , was a huge flop , a similar but improved technique has been employed in more controlled environments " “ Disney uses smells in several movie - like attractions in their parks .
3. Odorama .
Leave it to John Waters to pay homage to the kitch factor of Smellovision .
When he released the movie Polyester in 1982 , Waters gave all movie patrons scratch and sniff cards .
When a number appeared on the screen , people in the audience were supposed to scratch the corresponding card .
Smells included pizza , flowers , gas , grass and poo .
Waters later commented that he was amused that audiences literally had to " pay to smell sh*t . " 
4. Seat belts .
This was actually a gimmick that was scrapped before the movie 's release .
For William Castle 's 1965 I Saw What You Did starring Joan Crawford , Castle released a statement saying that all movie theaters would have a section equipped with seatbelts .
The reasoning ?
So people would n't be scared out of their seats , of course .
He intended to follow through on this little marketing ploy until his financial backers informed him that it was just too costly .
5. Punishment Poll .
Castle was the poster boy for movie gimmicks " “ he'd try anything once , no matter how silly or impractical .
For Mr. Sardonicus , the audience received cards with glow in the dark thumbs on either side " “ thumbs up on one side and thumbs down on the other .
Near the end of the movie , the audience is asked whether they want to help the main character or let him die .
Their responses would determine which ending would be shown .
Supposedly , no audience ever voted to let the man live , so the alternate ending was never needed .
But one of the actresses in the movie claims a second ending was never shot at all , so the vote was all a sham .
6. The Tingler . Another William Castle for you .
Told you this guy was crazy for weird marketing ploys !
The 1959 thriller The Tingler was about a little parasite appropriately named the Tingler that affixed itself at the base of people 's spines and could only be killed by the sound of the human scream .
Scientists are studying this strange little creature when one of them escapes from the lab and heads directly into a packed movie theater .
This is where Castle got his kicks in " “ select seats in the theaters had little vibrating devices wired on to them , which would go off at random during this scene .
7 . Not one , not two , but three different endings .
You might remember this one .
Back when Clue was released in 1985 , three endings were filmed " “ and all three were used .
You did n't know which one you were going to see until you got to that point in the movie .
Eventually , movie theaters started printing that information ( " Ending A , B or C "  ) in the newspaper next to the time listing .
Not a bad way to get fans to pay to see the same movie three times , huh ?
8. Race Car Chairs .
At least , that was the idea .
Several D - Boxes , vibrating theater chairs , were installed at Grauman 's Chinese Theater and at another theater in Surprise , Arizona ( surprise ! ) for the release of Fast & Furious last year .
The chairs vibrated , leaned , tilted and shook according to the action happening on the screen .
I 've not heard of the D - Boxes being used for any film since Fast & Furious , so perhaps it was n't a very effective gimmick .
9. Emergo .
You can probably tell by the grandiose name that this is another William Castle brainchild .
This one occurred at the end of House on Haunted Hill , the original 1959 version .
As a skeleton gave chase to a character in the movie , a glow in the dark skeleton suspended on wires " floated "  across the top of the theater .
Hey , no one ever said Castle 's tricks were all high - tech .
People were n't always scared , though " “ it seems as if most of the time , it became a game to see who could pelt the skeleton with the most Milk Duds .
10 . Sensurround .
Sensurround = really , really loud movie .
OK , it was slightly more complicated than that .
Theaters had to install large , low frequency speakers in custom cabinets that often required removing a couple of rows of seats .
It was used for the 1974 movie Earthquake and a few more films throughout the rest of the " ˜70s , but after theaters complained of structural damage , movie patrons complained of being ill from the vibrations , and businesses near the theaters complained of noise pollution , Sensurround was basically halted .
Did you experience any of these little tricks first - hand ?
What did you think ?
MOGADISHU , Somalia —
The Somali government is preparing a major offensive to take back this capital block by crumbling block , and it takes just a listen to the low growl of a small surveillance plane circling in the night sky overhead to know who is surreptitiously backing that effort .
“ It ’s the Americans , ” said Gen. Mohamed Gelle Kahiye , the new chief of Somalia ’s military , who said he recently shared plans about coming military operations with American advisers .
“ They ’re helping us . ”
That American assistance could be crucial to the effort by Somalia ’s government to finally reassert its control over the capital and bring a semblance of order to a country that has been steeped in anarchy for two decades .
For the Americans , it is part of a counterterrorism strategy to deny a haven to Al Qaeda , which has found sanctuary for years in Somalia ’s chaos and has helped turn this country into a magnet for jihadists from around the world .
The United States is increasingly concerned about the link between Somalia and Yemen , a growing extremist hot spot , with fighters going back and forth across the Red Sea in what one Somali watcher described as an “ Al Qaeda exchange program . ”

Moving In Together Before Wedding Can Decrease Chances of Having a Lasting Marriage , Study Says CDC survey says cohabitation can decrease chances of a lasting marriage .
March 2 , 2010  --
" All marriages are happy , " Canadian playwright Raymond Hull once said .
" It 's the living together afterward that causes all the trouble . "
In recent decades , more people have tried to avoid wedded trouble by living together before tying the knot .
People say they want to see if things work out before committing to a ring .
But a new government study suggests that cohabitation can actually hurt the chances the chances of having a long marriage .
Among women between the age of 15 to 44 who lived with their first husband before getting married , the study found their marriages had a 61 percent chance of surviving 10 years .
Women who had not cohabited with their first husband before marriage had a 66 percent chance that their marriage would last 10 years .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study was based on a 2002 survey of men and women for the National Survey of Family Growth .
Generations Differ on Whether It 's Good to Move In Together
New Yorkers Gladys and Otto Mond have had a successful marriage by any measure .
They 've been married nearly 51 years , and have four children and seven grandchildren .
For them , the secret to a great marriage comes down to simple things like trust , mutual respect and compromise .
Those are things they say you can't learn just by living with another person .
You 've got to be married .
" You might know the other person , but you know them in a relationship .
You do n't know them in a marriage relationship , " Otto said .
Younger couples often see it differently .
Ashley Moore and Mike Batistick live together in New York City and are now engaged to to be married .
" I think there is the fear that you might move in too soon and rush into the marriage , " Moore said .
" We 'd been dating for two years , and I actually made the conscious choice to move in . "
To the couple , it was important that moving in with each other meant commitment , that they were " not just moving in to save a grand a month , " Moore said .
Better Odds of Long Marriage for Those Engaged Before Moving In
The sense of purpose is important according to the study , which concluded it made a big difference whether couples are engaged when they move in together .
Women who were engaged before cohabitating had a 10 percent better chance of having a 10 - year marriage , and engaged men had 18 percent better odds than those who were not committed before moving in .
Engaged men who lived with their fiances actually had a slightly higher chance of a 10 - year marriage than men who had never cohabitated before getting married .
Couples Say Secret to Marriage About More Than Statistics
New Yorkers Shirley and Errol Harry have been married for 30 years , and they said the key to a successful marriage can't be discerned in numbers .
" With me , I made a commitment , and I take my vows very seriously , " Shirley Harry said .
" I think trust , communication , honesty , values , there 's no formula , but there 's a lot of moral criteria that needs to be implemented , " said her husband .
The Harrys do n't think it 's a good idea to move in before getting married .
It 's better to " make a commitment and make a go of it . "
More than half of couples who live together marry within five years , the study found , and a greater percentage of college - educated people use cohabitation as a stepping stone to marriage than people with less education .
But ultimately , said Shirley Harry , a successful marriage depends on one thing .
" Love , " she said .
" I do n't know what my life would be without him .
I mean , I truly love Errol . "

Restoring the back
( always when sanding keep a thumb / finger above the camera to avoid scratching the glass lens ! )
Orange
Blue
This is awetsanding guide .
If you have never wetsanded before , or wonder why you never get good results this should help .
This will let you restore anything that is plastic , or using harder / finer grits you can polish metal / aluminum / painted parts .
I apologize for the length of the guide but I think the tips here will help you get great results .
Sandpaper 320 ( or 500 ) ,800,1000,1500,2000,2500,3000 grit3M
Rubbing compoundMachine Polisher ( Power Drill or small buffer ) MicrofibersSticky tack and or tapeIf you want to save time and money I recommend just purchasing a 3 M headlight restoration kit ( available at almost all car part stores ) $ 10 bucks at amazon right nowIt will have almost everything you need , but you still need to buy 1000,1500 and 2000 grit sandpaper + a microfiber on the sideDry sand with the least aggressive sandpaper needed to remove scratches .
If you have deep scratches you may have to go down to 320 - 800 , but if you have light scratches , 1000 or 1500 might be enough .
The best way to test this is to run your fingernail around your phone and try to find a deep scratch .
Start at a high grit ( 1500 ) and see if that removes the scracthes .
If you still see deep scratches , try the next most aggressive grit , etc .
For me I had to go all the way down to 320 grit , due to several 2 - 3 mm deep defects .
This first step is really time intensive , but make sure you do n't use water , on the first step because it tends to hide scratches .
When you dry sand you can see all the fine sanding marks you are making which allows you to see the scratches you have n't removed .
Dry sanding clogs sandpaper , but you can either buy more sandpaper or wash the sandpaper in water and dry it before you use it .
Before you finish this first step , make sure all your sanding marks are in one direction ; you 'll see why later .
1 )
Use very little water when you wetsand ( do n't want to kill you iPhone ) 2 )
Make sure the previous sanding marks are completely gone before moving on to the next higher gritThe 2nd point is important , and the reason many people get poor results when wetsanding .
It 's a simple technique but it takes practice / patience to get right .
But here are some tips : a)
Before moving on to a higher grit make sure all your sanding lines are in the same direction .
When you first start sanding the part you can sand in any direction you want , but before you move to a higher grit make sure to sand the entire part down in one directionb )
When you have moved to your next higher grit you do n't have to sand in a single perpendicular direction ( a common myth ) .
Just try to sand the part down as best you can in any direction .
Howeveryou move on to a higher grit , make sure you sand perpendicular to the grit you before .
This will let you know where you have to keep sanding before moving on .
So if your last sanding marks using 800 grit were left to right , the last sanding marks on 1000 should be top to bottom , then 1500 should be left to right , etcc )
Before you move on , dry the part a bit , to make sure all the previous sanding marks are gone ( again water tends to hide scratches ) The most time consuming jumps for me were sanding 800 grit lines with 1000 grit , and the 1000 grit lines with 1500 grit .
These two are time consuming steps , but make sure you take your time , because the finer grit sandpapers will be unable to remove these deep marks ( especially 800 grit lines ) .
When wetsanding the phone it should look like below , not too much water and a slight white film .
I kept all my wetsanding paper in a bowl of water , and then dried it on a towel on my lap before using it on the phone .
You want the paper to be wet , but not running !
After 1500 After 3000
In all these pictures you will notice a few thingsa )
All the sanding marks are in one direction , and you can see that there are Zero sanding marks in any other direction .b)
The phone is dryYou may be wondering why all my sanding marks are lengthwise .
When I wetsand I still follow what I said above ( last step is to sand in the perpendicular direction to make sure all the previous sanding marks are gone ) but then additionally I lightly sand in the longest dimension of the part , this helps me make sure I have n't left any deep sanding marks of the similar grit ( ie , I lightly sand 1000 grit sanding line with 1000 grit sandpaper so that sanding with 1500 is easier ) Before you start polishing make sure you cover up your headphone port , volume buttons , vibrate button and 30 pin dock with sticky tack ( that blue stuff ) .
You can cover the camera glass , but the polishing compounds are not abrasiveness enough to scratch it ( unlike the sandpaper ) .
Sticky tack is easy to apply , and come off in one piece .
Tape will probably work too but I found that the tape kept lifting off when I was buffing .
Refer to the # 2 in the following picture ( the gray stuff )
Only two steps here , bringing back the shine , and then removing polishing " halos You can use what is found in the 3 M headlight kit using a power drillPolishing Pad =3 m

As you can see it leaves you " Halos " To remove these use the 3M rubbing compound and polish the halo 's off with a microfiber towel ( this is softer than the orange 3 m Pad ) .-----------------------------I had access to detailing products so I used the following ( using a rotary tool ) Polishing Pad =3 M PadPolish = Meguair 's 205 Then I finished with some Meguair 's NXT 2.0 waxResults = completely flawless mirror finish

Pope Benedict XVI has condemned British equality legislation for running contrary to " natural law " as he confirmed his first visit to the UK later this year .
In a letter addressed to the Catholic bishops of England and Wales , the pope praised Britain 's " firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all " .
However , he criticised UK legislation for creating " limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs " .
It is thought his comments relate to laws that came in last year preventing adoption agencies from discriminating against gay couples and also Harriet Harman 's equality bill , currently going through parliament .
The pope , whose visit is expected in September , made the comments after hearing representations from English and Welsh bishops on their concerns about the place of religion in an increasingly secular society .
They told him sexual orientation legislation that came into effect on 1 January 2009 had forced the closure of half the Roman Catholic adoption agencies because the law making it illegal to discriminate against gay applicants went against their beliefs .
In his letter the pope said : " The effect of some of the legislation designed to achieve this goal has been to impose unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs .
In some respects it actually violates the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded and by which it is guaranteed . "
It is also thought the pope was referring to the equality bill , which narrows the special exemption enjoyed by churches allowing them to exclude people whose lifestyles do not fit in with the religious ethos of an organisation when hiring staff .
The bishops cited it as another restriction of their freedom of religious belief .
The archbishop of Westminster , the Most Rev Vincent Nichols , who is in Rome , said : " It has been clear that he knows the situation and applied it to a move in legislation to look for equality . "
The pope urged the bishops to make their voices heard and to defend the faith , saying Christian teaching did not undermine or restrict the freedom of others .
His remarks drew swift criticism from the National Secular Society , which said it would stage protests during the visit .
Terry Sanderson , the society 's president , said : " The taxpayer is going to be faced with a bill for £ 20 m for the visit – in which he has indicated he will attack equal rights and promote discrimination . "
Hundreds of genetic mutations accumulated over thousands of years have transformed the red jungle fowl of South Asia into the domesticated chickens that are a fixture on farms -- and dining tables -- worldwide , according to a scientific analysis of poultry DNA published this week in the journal Nature .
Swedish and American scientists identified about 7.5 million genetic variations between domesticated chickens and the jungle fowl , their primary wild ancestor .
Then the scientists zeroed in on a few dozen differences that seemed particularly important based on their frequent prevalence in eight distinct populations of birds raised for meat or eggs .
One of the key genetic changes was in the DNA that carries the code for the thyroid - stimulating hormone receptor .
Among other things , this receptor helps regulate reproduction in birds and mammals based on changes in the length of day .
It normally restricts reproduction to certain times of the year .
But the researchers hypothesize that the mutation in chickens -- which changed a single amino acid in the structure of the receptor -- may have enabled them to breed year - round , said Leif Andersson , a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden and the study ’s senior author .
Andersson and his colleagues also found genetic changes that were unique to broiler chickens , which are raised for their meat instead of their egg - laying abilities .
One of them involves a gene called TBC1D1 .
In humans , a version of this gene appears to increase the risk of becoming obese ; in mice , a mutation that renders the gene inactive causes animals to be lean .
In chickens , the variant might help birds grow meatier breasts and legs .
The broiler chickens also shared a deletion in another gene that caused it to lose its normal function .
The gene , called SH3RF2 , is known to affect body weight .
The researchers conducted breeding experiments and discovered that 10 - week - old birds that inherited the deletion from both parents were 20 % bigger than birds that did n’t inherit the deletion from either parent .

I had to explain to friends -- smart people , honest , concerned , well informed but not car people -- yet again last week why I believe that even if something goes wrong with the car , and even if that was the result of a manufacturing flaw , the driver bears primary responsibility for what happens next .
The context , of course , was Toyota and particularly the perception that there are “ poor innocents ” serving jail time on convictions for reckless driving and similar offenses after accidents in which their cars might have malfunctioned .
First , I 'd bet that fewer than one in 10 who claim that the car was at fault could muster any evidence to support that claim .
Everyone in jail is innocent .
After that ?
At best , if the cars truly malfunctioned , that 's a contributing factor that might argue for a reduced sentence .
But no driver who crashes and injures others is “ innocent ” or blameless .
Sometimes when I expound on this point , I remind myself how shocked I was to hear an extreme version from the late American Formula One champion Phil Hill .
Whenever Hill mentioned a driver who'd died while racing , he 'd always say so - and - so “ killed himself . ”
When asked whether that was his belief , that the drivers were always at fault , Hill quoted another driver to the effect that “ if you get hit by lightning , it 's your fault for standing where the lightning wants to be . ”
We all make choices , in other words , but too few of us are willing to accept responsibility .
I 've had very few crashes in nearly 40 years of driving and even fewer for which I was legally at fault , yet I 've never held myself blameless .
I should have looked a second time , should have had better control of the car , should have anticipated the other driver 's action , should have reacted more quickly or adjusted those factors -- following distance , speed , sightlines -- that would have given me more time to do so .
Thinking this way helps me learn how to avoid trouble the next time .
Ditto when the car does something unexpected .
Stuck throttle , faded brakes , busted clutch cable , tire blowout ?
Sitting behind that steering wheel means that I alone am responsible for what happens next .
If I lose control , it 's my fault .
Only after that may I point to contributing factors and say , “ I did the best I could in the circumstances . ”
And that 's a claim I can make only if I really did do the best I could , which means I have to have a plan and knowledge beforehand .
It 's not the best I could do if all I know how to do is throw up my hands and say , “ The car 's broken , ” or -- Lord love a duck -- pick up a cell phone and call 911 .
It 's a principle that goes back to at least the first time a boat left the safety of shallow water , which states that the commander of a vessel - - whether it's a rowboat or a massive airliner -- is responsible for his own life and that of others .
We do n't seem to have trouble understanding the basics ; schoolchildren can tell you the difference between the captain of the Exxon Valdez and Capt .
Chesley Sullenberger , “ Hero of the Hudson . ”
But it can sure be discouraging to discuss this in the context of what happens on the road .
We 've done such a miserable job of educating drivers , they do n't even get this first principle .
And if we do n't make them learn how to do so before we issue them a license , how can we hold them responsible for failing to respond appropriately when things go wrong ?
Also , we live in an era when mountain climbers get in trouble and then use their cell phones to dial up the rescue squad with no more embarrassment than you 'd find in a driver who'd left his lights on in the grocery - store parking lot and had to call for a jump - start .
Modern sailors set out to sea in storms because , well , that 's why we have a Coast Guard , right ?
Maybe this train left the station nearly 50 years ago , when Ralph Nader convinced America that if a Corvair crashed , it was General Motors ' fault and only GM 's fault .
If it 's your Corvair that just crashed , this can be a comforting illusion .
No less so if it 's your Toyota .
But it 's an illusion all the same .

You wo n't believe House Minority Leader John Boehner 's ( R - OH ) defense for calling a fellow congressman " a dead man " for supporting health care reform :
Boehner also abruptly ended his Thursday press conference after a reporter asked whether it was inappropriate to refer to a Democratic member as a " dead man " politically in this charged environment .
Boehner told the National Review last week that Rep. Steve Driehaus ( D - Ohio ) " may be a dead man " politically in his congressional district if he voted in favor of the health care reform bill .
" I do n't think so , " Boehner said .
" No one saw this quote of mine in this publication before Mr. Driehaus and others made a public issue out of it .
Thank you . "
That 's really rich .
Boehner gives an " exclusive " interview to a widely read conservative site , but until it was magically unearthed by Driehaus , no one saw it .
This " not my fault " response by the Republican party as a whole to the wave of violence and hate - filled rhetoric that they unleashed with their non -stop lies about health care reform has been nothing short of unbelievable ... from not being responsible for their own words in a national publication , to tepid " denouncements " of violence while at the same time suggesting that Democrats had it coming , to blaming victims of criminal acts , to outright lies from Eric Cantor about his office being shot at .
Of course all of this does give the traditional media a fair and balanced hook to hang their false equivalency hat on .
Which was the whole purpose of this latest round of Republican - created outrage .
Naked , beheaded , and tangled , the bodies of 51 young males found in the United Kingdom have been identified as brutally slain Vikings , archaeologists announced Friday .
The decapitated skeletons — their heads stacked neatly to the side — were uncovered in June 2009 in a thousand - year - old execution pit near the southern seaside town of Weymouth ( United Kingdom map ) .
Already radio- carbon dating results released in July had shown the men lived between A.D. 910 and 1030 , a period when the English fought — and often lost — battles against Viking invaders .
( Related : " Viking Weapon - Recycling Site Found in England ? " )
But until now it had n't been clear who the headless bodies had belonged to .
Analysis of teeth from ten of the dead — who were mostly in their late teens and early 20s — indicates the raiding party had been gathered from different parts of Scandinavia , including one person thought to have come from north of the Arctic Circle .

The new study , led by Jane Evans of the U.K. 's NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory , investigated telltale chemical markers called isotopes , which can reveal a person 's geographic origins .
Oxygen isotopes from drinking water , for example , become fixed in people 's teeth as they age .
Since isotope ratios vary with climate , Evans could tell that the had all been raised in much cooler regions than Britain .
" The values these individuals gave us could not be British , " Evans said , but the ratios do match those from Norway and Sweden .
In addition , nitrogen - isotope readings showed the men enjoyed a meaty , high - protein diet — similar to readings from remains from the same period found in Sweden .
" What 's fascinating about these findings is that Vikings are renowned for their pillaging , ransacking , and raping , " Evans said .
( Related : " Vikings ' Barbaric Bad Rap Beginning to Fade . " )
" But here we 've got real evidence that it was the other way round : Anglo - Saxons rounded up these Vikings and executed them . "
Vikings Found With Hacked Heads , Naked Bodies
Many of the skeletons have deep cut marks to the skull , jaw , and neck .
This suggests the men were war captives whose heads were savagely hacked off , said David Score of Oxford Archaeology , leader of the preconstruction survey that found the Vikings ' execution pit .
" The majority seem to have taken multiple blows , " he noted .
Other injuries hint that some of the slaughtered attempted to shield themselves from their executioners ' blows .
For instance , the hand of one victim had its fingers sliced through , Score said .
The heads were neatly piled to one side of the pit , perhaps as a victory display .
( Related : " Headless Man's Tomb Found Under Maya Torture Mural . " )
Unusually , no trace of clothing has been found , indicating the men were buried naked .
Even if only their weapons and valuables had been taken , " we should have found bone buttons and things like that , but to date we 've got absolutely nothing , " Score said .
( Related : " Huge Viking Hoard Discovered in Sweden . " )
Aside from their injuries , the headless Vikings " look like a healthy , robust , very strong , very masculine group of young males , " he added .
" It 's your classic sort of warrior . "
Vikings Forced to Surrender ?
The burial 's prominent location on a hilltop by the ancient main road to Weymouth also points to the victims being Vikings , Score said .
" Locations like this are classic sites for executions [ by British - born warriors ] in late Saxon and medieval times , " he said .
" If you 're a Viking raider , you 're much more likely to leave people where you killed them in the town or on the beach . "
What 's more , the new isotope findings suggest that the slain men had much more diverse origins than would be expected among soldiers from the Saxons ' other enemies , such as ethnic Danes in northern Britain , tooth - study leader Evans noted .
Even before the new results were released , Kim Siddorn , author of Viking Weapons and Warfare , had thought the dead were Vikings .
" They had left their ship , walked inland , ran into an unusually well - organized body of Saxons , and were probably forced to surrender , " Siddorn speculated in July .
Despite the Vikings ' brutal reputation , there was actually little to differentiate Vikings and early English warriors on the battlefield , said Siddorn , also a founder of Regia Anglorum , a historical - reenactment society .
" You would find it very difficult to tell the difference between a Viking and a Saxon if they stood in front of you in war gear , " he said .
Both used spears as their primary weapons , with swords and axes as backups , Siddorn added .
But Vikings usually had surprise and , in some cases , numbers on their side .
" Whilst the Vikings were no better than the Saxons at fighting , they did come by the shipload , " he said .
" During the height of the Viking raids , it 's reasonable to say it was unsafe to live anywhere within 20 miles [ 32 kilometers ] of the coast . "
Miami , Florida ( CNN ) --
The parents of an injured baby girl who was flown to Florida for treatment after Haiti 's earthquake have been told what they already know :
They are the biological parents of the little girl .
The International Red Cross notified Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis in Haiti that DNA testing proves that the infant is theirs , said Mark LaPoint , an attorney representing the baby .
Rescuers dubbed her Patricia , but her parents call her Jenny .
On Wednesday morning , Miami - Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman decided that Jenny 's parents will get to take her back to Haiti after doctors and nurses in Florida finish treating her .
" This is a case where these were really good parents , and I can't wait for these parents to be reunited with their baby , " the judge said .
" This is one happy day . "
Federal authorities have pledged to help Devilme and Alexis travel from Haiti to the United States to reunite with their daughter , though the timing of that trip has not yet been determined , said Bob Martinez , an attorney for the parents .
The baby still has a hard time closing her left hand and needs some medical therapy , LaPoint said in court Wednesday .
The judge scheduled a hearing for April 7 to get an update on the baby 's condition .
Jenny was 4 months old when the January 12 earthquake destroyed large swaths of Haiti .
Her mother was knocked unconscious in the 7.0 - magnitude temblor and taken to a hospital .
When she awoke , she urged her husband to go home to search for their baby .
Alexis searched through the broken rubble for four days , but found nothing .
The couple says that on the fifth day , January 16 , witnesses saw a cleanup crew rescue Jenny from the rubble .
She reportedly was found in the arms of her baby sitter , who was dead .
The witnesses got word to Devilme , who was in the hospital with her own injuries .
Rescuers apparently assumed the baby was an orphan and whisked her away to a different hospital in Port - au - Prince , one run by the University of Miami and Project Medishare , where a team of pediatricians worked desperately to keep her alive .

With several broken ribs , the baby was having trouble breathing .
The doctors stabilized her , and a few hours after the baby 's rescue , a United Nations truck took her to a plane that was minutes away from leaving for Miami , Florida .
" I told the ambulance driver if she got there in time , we 'd name the baby after her , " says Dr. Arthur Fournier , a University of Miami physician working at the hospital .
The driver , Patricia , did make it on time , and thereafter , doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami referred to the infant by that name .
Devilme says the friend who told her of Jenny 's rescue did n't know where the baby had been taken .
By the time she found out , the baby had already been flown to Miami , Devilme says .
Devilme and Alexis say it was " God 's will " that Jenny went to Miami , as she might not have survived if she 'd stayed in Haiti .
Jenny was discharged from the hospital and is living in foster care in Florida .
Her parents are living in a tent city in Port - au - Prince and recently had the DNA testing needed to prove the baby is theirs .
The DNA tests have taken more than a month because of logistical difficulties getting the test to Haiti and because of a legal dispute over whether the baby should become a ward of the state of Florida or a ward of the U.S. government , says Mark Riordan , a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families .
I ’ve been meaning to write for a while about a rather fascinating , but not very well known , area of research that I think might have significant implications for several areas of space transportation .
The research I am referring to is focused on exploiting Magneto - hydrodynamic forces to manipulate weakly - ionized plasmas caused by hypersonic flight in rarefied flows–ie using magnets to shove around the hot flamey stuff caused by slamming into the thin air above us at crazy - high speeds .
I ’m going to be a tease , and not go into some of the ramifications until later posts in this series , but for now I want to give a bit more of an explanation than I ’ve found available in the popular press so far .
Oh , and one small caveat before I jump in –while I think there ’s some real potential here , electromagnetics is a topic that I ’m truly awful at .
I ’ve never had another class , including a PhD level turbulent fluid dynamics class that made me feel like such a brow - dragging neanderthal as my Physics 122 class on Electromagnetism .
This may be yet another niche technology that while somewhat interesting , ends up not being all that useful .
But it looks at least possible that this may become a game changing technology in many space transportation fields .
Without further ado , let ’s go over some of the basics .
Some Background on MHD Aerobraking and Thermal Protection
The basic concept behind MHD Thermal Protection is that during hypersonic flight , above about Mach 12 , the shockwave formed in front of a blunt - bodied vehicle reaches a high enough temperature to form a weakly ionized plasma that is conductive enough to be manipulated by strong magnetic fields .
A powerful magnet near the leading part of the vehicle interacts with charged particles in the plasma via the Lorentz force .
This force bends the trajectory of charged particles , creates large hall currents , which if I ’m understanding correctly repel the magnetic field .
These charged particles also impact with the uncharged gas particles nearby ( the plasma is only “ weakly ionized ” ) transmitting these forces to them as well .
Here ’s an interesting diagram I ’ll reference from one of the papers I ’ll talk about more later ( “ Trajectory Analysis of Electromagnetic Aerobraking Flight Based on Rarefied Flow Analysis ” by Otsu , Katsurayama , and Abe–well worth the $ 28 ) :
If the magnet is strong enough , this leads to two interesting effects–first , the distance from the vehicle to the bow shock increases ( I think the plasma density between the bow shock and the vehicle also decreases , but I ’m less sure about that ) .
This can significantly reduce the heat transferred into the vehicle for a given velocity and altitude .
The other big effect is that the Lorentz forces create forces that can produce drag or lift .
At high altitudes these Lorentz forces can greatly augment the aerodynamic drag forces , effectively making it as though the vehicle had a much lower ballistic coefficient .
It should be noted that this force is electrically controllable .
In fact , depending on the sophistication of the magnetic apparatus and its location within and orientation with respect to the vehicle , it can possibly also produce lift as well as control torques without the need for aero control surfaces .
Both of these help from a reentry thermal standpoint , because by the time you hit the denser air , where the heating is the highest , you ’re going a lot slower than you would ’ve been otherwise , and a lot of that earlier braking is done at much lower heating loads than would have been the case without the electromagnetic effects .
Several of the papers I ’ve read introduce an interaction parameter term , Q , that relates the relative strength of the Lorentz forces to drag forces .
The relationship takes the form :
Sigma is the conductivity of the weakly ionized plasma , B is the magnetic field strength , L is a reference length ( I think related to the magnet configuration ) , rho is atmospheric density , and V is velocity .
As you can see , for a given magnet , the drag forces start dominating as the conductivity drops and as the atmospheric density increases .
Atmospheric density increases dramatically as you descend from orbit , so for a reentry application , you get most of your benefit from the first little bit of descent .
We ’ll go more into some of these ramifications starting in my next installment .
DETROIT --
As the Detroit Red Wings ’ eighth defenseman , Derek Meech has little chance of cracking the lineup anytime soon .
But as their 12th forward , he has an opportunity to contribute , even if it ’s for only a few minutes a game .
So while Meech would prefer to play defense , his regular position , he embraces every chance he gets to play forward .
Meech will fill in again Tuesday for the injured Dan Cleary against the Edmonton Oilers at Joe Louis Arena .
This time , he will look to provide speed and energy on the fourth line with Darren Helm and Patrick Eaves , replacing Kris Draper , who was moved to the third line with Drew Miller and Jason Williams .
“ He ’s fast , he ’s quick , he ’s hard on the puck , ” Eaves said .
“ We practiced ( Monday ) for the first time together .
There ’s chemistry there already .
We ’re really fortunate he could step in and play forward at this level .
We ’re not going to miss a beat . ”
Said Meech : “ It ’s going to be good playing with those two .
They ’re hard - working guys , got a lot of speed .
Hopefully , we can create some chances . ”
Injuries to Andreas Lilja and Niklas Kronwall allowed Meech to regularly play on defense from late November to the Olympic break in February .
Now , the club has seven healthy defensemen ahead of Meech but only 12 forwards on the roster because of to salary - cap constraints .
Meech , who played several games at forward last season , gets tabbed to play up front whenever there is an injury .
“ He ’s making the best of a situation that at times has n’t been very positive for him , ” coach Mike Babcock said .
“ Would he like to play 20 minutes a night , play on D every night ?
He would .
Ideally , one day , it ’ll work out for him .
But right now , to help us , that ’s not his role .
“ He has been positive all the time , even when he does n’t play .
The guys really like him and he competes hard . ”
Cleary aims for Thursday return
Cleary plans on skating the next couple of days in hopes of returning Thursday at home against Columbus .
But there always is a danger of reaggravating this type of injury , as he did Friday against Minnesota , and being shelved longer .
So the club will be cautious .
Cleary said an MRI showed swelling and fluid , but no torn muscles .
“ It ’s feeling better each day , but nobody knows until you ’re on the ice , ” Cleary said .
Meech is prepared to play forward the final seven games of the regular season , if needed .
“ With that injury , it ’s something you do n’t want to rush , ” Meech said .
“ He ’s got to make sure he ’s 100 percent come playoff time .
I ’m going to be in there to support the guys and chip in any way I can . ”
The Red Wings do n’t have the salary - cap space to recall anybody from Grand Rapids .
And players ca n’t be placed on long - term injured reserve with less than 10 games remaining in the season ( the minimum number of games a player on LTIR must sit out ) unless they ’re done for the entire playoffs .
There is no roster limit or cap restriction in the playoffs , enabling teams to bring up whomever they please from the minors .
Red Wings try to solve Oilers
Edmonton has the worst record in the NHL , by far , but the Oilers are 3 - 0 against the Red Wings , including a pair of shootout wins .
“ They beat us like a rented mule , ” Babcock said .
“ They just slap us around every time we play them .
We ’re usually down two after about six minutes .
So we ’re hoping they ’re going to let us touch the puck ( Tuesday ) . ”
Jimmy Howard will make his 23rd consecutive start , the longest streak by a Detroit rookie goaltender since Roy Edwards started 23 in a row in 1967 - 68 .
Howard was named the NHL ’s second star of the week after going 4 - 0 - 0 , with a 1.22 goals - against average and .958 save percentage .
When a citizen signs a petition to place an initiative on the ballot , is he or she acting as a voter or as a legislator ?
How the Supreme Court answers that question will determine whether states can make the names of signers public .
It ’s a close call , but the court should decide in favor of disclosure .
In a sequence of events reminiscent of the battle over California ’s Proposition 8 , opponents of gay rights in Washington state gathered enough signatures to force a referendum on overturning a generous domestic - partnership law .
The initiative failed to pass , but controversy continues about whether the names of those who signed the ballot petitions should be released ( and possibly posted on the Internet ) .
Unlike California , Washington treats petitions as public records accessible to all .
But in October , the Supreme Court temporarily blocked release of the 138,500 names after Protect Marriage Washington filed suit , claiming among other things that disclosure would expose signers to scorn and harassment .
( Proposition 8 proponents used a similar argument to persuade the Supreme Court to block the televising of the current trial over the constitutionality of that measure . )
Now the court has announced that it will decide whether petition signers have a constitutional right to have their names kept secret .
Protect Marriage argues that signing a petition is an exercise of free speech , and that the court has recognized that anonymous political expression is protected by the 1st Amendment .
But that principle , announced in a 1995 Ohio case involving anonymous leaflets , had to do with speech , not the legislative process .
As Washington ’s secretary of state pointed out in a brief to the Supreme Court : “ Under the Washington Constitution , the people of the state reserve the legislative powers of initiative and referendum , ” making them akin to legislators whose names are public .

Some might argue that voting in a referendum is also part of the legislative process .
But voting is traditionally a private act .
Not so signing a petition , which takes place in public , not behind a curtain .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , ruling in favor of disclosure , noted that “ each petition sheet contains spaces for 20 signatures , exposing each signature to view by up to 19 other signers and any number of potential signers . ”
Signatures also are examined by election officials and lawyers .
Finally , the argument that disclosure will bring harm to petition signers is overblown .
Like legislators , citizens who sign a petition are potentially subject to harassment .
Many political movements -- from the civil rights revolution to the campaign for abortion rights -- have inspired violent opposition .
But the remedy for that problem is enforcement of criminal laws , not the withholding of public documents .
If a state acts on its commitment to transparency , it should n’t be thwarted by a fallacious 1st Amendment argument .
In recent week President Obama has been vocal on the issue of the artificially low currency .
“ China and its currency policies are impeding the rebalancing [ of the global economy ] that ’s necessary , ” Mr Obama told Bloomberg last month .
“ My goal over the course of the next year is for China to recognize that it is also in their interest to allow their currency to appreciate because , frankly , they have got a potentially overheating economy . ”
Recently by Gary North : When Death Precedes the Applause
On March 11 , I spoke at the annual Austrian Scholars Conference , sponsored by the Ludwig von Mises Institute .
It was gratifying to see so many attendees that they could not fit into one room .
The Mises Institute is a high - tech outfit .
They set up a video camera , and the speech appeared on monitors in other rooms .
It will also go on - line within a few days .
This will be free .
Anyone in the world with Web access can see it from now on .
This is a great model for communication and education .
My topic was “ Keynes and His Influence . ”
My goal is to recruit half a dozen bright young scholars to begin a joint project in refuting Keynes ’ General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money ( 1936 ) line by line .
I have set up a department on my Website to this end .
I tried to make four main points in my speech .
1. Keynes ’ influence has been indirect ( mediated ) .
2 .
His legacy will soon be uniquely vulnerable .
3 .
Only the Austrians called the 2008 recession .
4 .
It is time for a comprehensive refutation of Keynes
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MODERN ECONOMIST
There is no question that John Maynard Keynes was the most influential economist in the 20th century .
Yet his influence has been different from what economists and the intelligentsia have believed .
In a filmed interview of Keynes ’ main rival in 1935 , but not in 1965 , F. A. Hayek , an Austrian School economist , made an important point .
Keynes was influential in 1946 , the year of his death , but his influence was not yet overwhelming .
That came later .
Hayek did not say how much later .
It came within five years .
You can see the video here .
The key to Keynes ’ influence was the 1948 textbook written by Paul Samuelson , Economics .
It became the most widely assigned college textbook in economics .
It had no major competition for at least three decades , and its competitors were also Keynesian in outlook .
Samuelson promoted Keynes ’ ideas , but he used a very different format .
He did not quote Keynes at length .
He presented what has since been called the neo-Keynesian synthesis .
He applied Keynes ’ fundamental principle of deficit spending in the Great Depression to the overall economy in a post - depression world .
He really did try to make general the General Theory , which the book had not been .
The General Theory was highly specific .
It was a program designed to counteract falling spending and a falling money supply in an era in which there was no government insurance for failed banks or their depositors .
It was a program to offset widespread hoarding of currency .
From the day that the FDIC was created in 1934 , American banks stopped failing , and the money supply started to rise .
Keynes wrote his book after this transition in the United States .
The book was a theoretical defense of policies that had already been adopted in the United States and Western Europe , and which World War II would escalate : deficit spending , mass inflation , and a vast expansion of the government ’s share of the economy .
This is not how the Keynesians have told the story .
It is how the story ought to be told .
I am trying to recruit economists and historians who will commit several years of research to telling it .
Keynes ’ “ General Theory ” has long been an unread book that sits on the shelves of economics graduate students and professors .
No one actually has read it except specialists in the history of economic thought .
The book is close to unreadable .
Compared to his earlier books and essays , it is uniquely unreadable .
We do not see its formulas quoted as proof of contemporary policies or recommended policies .
The literature cited in economists ’ footnotes is what we can legitimately call Keynesian , but this literature is an extension of Keynes ’ work , not Keynes ’ actual work .
Whether Keynes would approve of what is recommended in his name is moot .
Hayek spoke to Keynes a few weeks before he died .
According to Hayek , Keynes was not happy with developments being offered in his name .
Keynes had always been an opponent of inflation .
His earlier works repeatedly warned against the threat of inflation .
Yet , by 1945 , inflation was a way of life in the West .
We should compare The General Theory to Charles Darwin ’s Origin of Species .
Darwinists rarely quote Darwin to support their latest papers .
They cite him as the originator of the idea of evolution through natural selection .
Attacks on Darwin ’s actual exposition are shrugged off by his followers as irrelevant .
We find an entire school of Darwinists who preach an idea that is opposed to what Darwin taught : the “ punctuated evolutionism . ”
Darwin believed in tiny changes over long periods of time .
They believe in huge changes in brief periods of time .
Still , they call themselves Darwinists .
Why ?
Because they believe in his Big Idea : purposeless , random causation prior to man .
The same is true of Keynes ’ General Theory .
It was Keynes ’ primary idea that dominates the thinking of economists : government budget deficits as the means of overcoming economic slumps .
As to simple formulas and concepts in the book , modern economists rarely cite them in professional journals .
If one or more specifics of the book are refuted , his supporters shrug it off .
Keynes ’ influence relates to the one big idea , just as Darwin ’s influence does .
The specifics in the book are forgotten today , such as his statement that the government could plant bottles full of money , bury them , and let workers dig them up for a living .
He also said that building the equivalent of Egypt ’s pyramids would help restore prosperity .
He really believed this .
His disciples do not refer to these passages .
When pressured by critics , they dismiss them as merely rhetorical .
They were rhetorical , but not merely rhetorical .
A VULNERABLE LEGACY
Today , Keynesians insist that their man was right .
They take credit for the recovery since late 2009 , such as it is .
This assertion is widely accepted .
It is so widely accepted that Wikipedia has an article on it : “ Keynesian Resurgence . ”
Yet the reality is far different from the perception .
Keynes ’ solution in 1936 was a program of fiscal deficits , coupled with mild monetary expansion in a time of monetary contraction .
These government deficits were supposed to stimulate consumer spending .
Yet the heart of the U.S. government ’s program in 2008 was not the $ 787 billion spending program .
Rather , it was the prior doubling of the Federal Reserve ’s monetary base , the FED ’s face - value swaps of its marketable Treasury debt for unmarketable toxic assets owned by the biggest banks , the AIG bailout , and the subsequent $ 1.25 trillion pumped into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , after their nationalization by Henry Paulson in September 2008 .
None of this was Keynesian .
All of it was ad hoc monetary inflation and central bank subsidies to large banks .
Keynes recommended government spending and employment by government .
He did not recommend central bank bailouts of large banks .
He focused on fiscal policy , not monetary policy .
The biggest banks were saved by these interventions .
Small banks continue to go under , Friday afternoon after Friday afternoon .
The banking industry as a whole has contracted its loans to commercial and industrial firms .
Banks have added over $ 1 trillion to their excess reserves at the FED , thereby sterilizing money .
This is anti-Keynesian : a restriction of spending , meaning a reduction in aggregate demand compared to what would otherwise have been the case .
Keynesianism as an idea has received a shot in the arm — mainly with fiat money , not Federal deficits .
Yes , the deficits have been enormous , just not by comparison to central banks ’ money creation .
The deficits are unprecedented , all over the world .
Yet the economic recovery is universally criticized as weak .
If enormous deficits are not serving as stimuli for widespread recovery , then what credit should Keynes get ?
Keynesians are saying that government policies kept the world economy from collapse .
But this is not the same as saying that the policies have restored prosperity .
They have n’t .
There have been some protests by economists .
Several hundred academic economists , mostly in obscure universities , publicly protested the stimulus package .
But no group of economists , other than the Austrians , said in 2008 that the FED should do nothing , that Fannie and Freddie should be allowed to go under , and that the stimulus bill should be voted down .
With only this exception , the entire academic community of economists became cheerleaders for the FED ’s bailouts of 2008 .
They sold their non-Keynesian birthrights for a mess of Federal Reserve pottage .
The silence of the profession in 2008 and after has boxed them in .
They are defenders of moral hazard , despite their timid warnings to the contrary .
If one person has summarized the alternative economic scenarios facing us , it is Merle Hazard .
Merle is not his real name .
He is a financial planner in Nashville .
He began performing on YouTube in 2009 .
He and his partner , Bretton Wood , sang the question : “ Will it be Zimbabwe or Japan ? ”
So far , it ’s Japan .
The governments of the West have made one thing inescapably clear .
They do not intend to enforce high bank capital ratios established by the Bank for International Settlements .
The European Union and the European Central Bank have also made it clear that they will not enforce EU rules on the deficit - to - GDP ratio .
There is only one rule today : “ Tax and tax , spend and spend , inflate and inflate . ”
The looming bankruptcies of Western governments and Japan are now becoming clearer to the literate public .
Observers are becoming more Austrian in their perception .
Investors do not accept this scenario emotionally , but the numbers are clear .
There will have to be a cutting back of Medicare , Social Security , and unemployment benefits , either sooner or later .
It is also clear that unemployment will not be significantly reduced by the present recovery .
The Keynesian tools are not working .
They have not worked in Europe for a generation , where life on the dole is permanent for 10 % of the work force .
When the bust comes , the Keynesians will take the blame .
They have demanded credit for the recovery , and they have received it .
They are consuming public favor today .
They will pay for it later .
“ WE TOLD THEM SO ! ”
The Austrian School ’s representatives predicted the recession .
The defining moment was Peter Schiff ’s debate with Art Laffer in 2006 .
Schiff said a crash was coming .
Laffer ridiculed him .
Because of YouTube , this story will not go away .
It never does any good to go to the losers and say , “ I told you so . ”
It does a great deal of good to go to the general public , which is always in search of leadership , and say , “ We told them so . ”
You do n’t convert true believers and spokesmen very often , but you can undermine their leadership .
The Austrian theory of the business cycle was the tool that enabled Schiff and others , such as me , to predict in 2006 that a recession would hit in 2007 .
It did — in December 2007 .
We told them so .
This establishes our credentials , but more to the point , it establishes Ludwig von Mises ’ credentials .
He thought that economic logic alone was necessary to defend a position .
But in political debate , having the numbers demonstrate that you were right is also necessary .
When the USSR went bust economically in 1988 , then lost the Afghan war in 1989 , and finally committed suicide in 1991 , Marxism died .
All the footnotes in the Marxist books no longer mattered in academia .
All the post -1991 wailing by Marxists that the Soviet Union really had never been truly Marxist has been ignored .
Why ?
Because the Marxists took credit for the USSR for 74 years .
They praised the Soviet Union ’s central planning .
So , in 1991 , they could not get off the sinking Soviet ship in time to justify the Marxist system .
By 1991 , China ’s economy was booming because of Deng ’s abandonment of Marxist economics in 1978 .
That left only Albania , Cuba , and North Korea .
The Marxists had nowhere to turn to that offered evidence of economic success .
Overnight , they became a laughing stock on campus .
This will be the fate of Keynesians when the governments of the West finally go bust or else abandon the deficits and the fiat money .
Who will still be standing to pick up the intellectual pieces ?
The Chicago School economists did not predict 2008 .
They did not defiantly protest the FED ’s bailouts of September and October .
Neither did public choice economists , rational expectations economists , or behavioral economists .
They all climbed aboard the Good Ship Keynes , which was in fact the Good Ship Bernanke .
The Austrians did not .
The Austrians , few in number , are the last men standing to challenge the Keynesians .
This is their great opportunity .
They have waited a long time .
GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE OFFENSIVELY
As W. C. Fields said so long ago , “ Never give a sucker an even break . ”
This also applies to bloodsuckers .
The Keynesians are apologists for the bloodsucking class : tax collectors , deficit - expanders , and boondogglers of all shapes and sizes .
I have set up www.KeynesProject.com to help mobilize the guerrilla troops in a comprehensive assault on Fort Keynes .
This is a supplement to the vast collection of free books and materials found on www.Mises.org, especially the books in the Literature section of the home page .
There has to be a full - scale assault on the General Theory that shows how it is illogical , line by line .
This has been done sporadically in the past , but not systematically .
To oppose Keynes ’ overall system was to commit academic suicide .
When the decks are cleared , then there must be a systematic critique of the post - Keynes literature .
But this is too large a job for a handful of scholars .
It will take at least a decade to produce the basic critique of Keynes .
My hope is that this project will be complete in time for the crisis produced by today ’s policies .
To persuade the next generation of economists and talking heads that Keynes was wrong , and therefore his apologists are wrong and have been wrong , we need two things : ( 1 ) a body of material in all the media that shows that The General Theory was a con job from day one ; ( 2 ) an economy universally suffering from the effects of the policies that have been justified in the name of Keynes .
Since we are going to get the second , why not work on the first ?
CONCLUSION
We have lived in the shadow of Keynes since 1936 .
That shadow has darkened academia for over 70 years .
Keynes justified what politicians and salaried academic bureaucrats always wanted : more power for politicians and tenured bureaucrats .
Keynes justified this system of parasitic bloodsucking .
The bills are now coming due .
The voters are going to join a tax revolt against these bills .
They will seek justification .
Austrian School economics is best positioned today to offer that justification .
To become even better positioned , a younger generation of Austrian School economists must publicly gut The General Theory .

Important to note , these numbers are as of September 30 , 2009 and could have become much worse since .
Awesome , awesome , awesome .
That about sums up these poster redesigns for some of Hitchcock ’s greatest films .

A research paper entitled ‘ The Price of Gold : A Global Required Yield Theory ’ ( RYT ) holds that “ since gold fulfills the unique function of a global store of value , its yield must vary inversely to the yield required by any financial asset class , thus providing a hedge in the case where such assets are losing value .
Our theory explains about 88 % of actual $ USD gold prices and 92 % of actual gold returns on a quarterly basis , including the peak prices of gold , over the 1979 - 2002 period . ”
The original article , as written by Christophe Faugère & Julian Van Erlach MBA , is presented below in a slightly edited ( [ ] ) and abridged ( … ) format by the editorial team at munKNEE.com to ensure the reader with a fast and easy read .
Assessing the fair value of gold largely remains a mystery in Finance .
While in some instances the existing literature has found empirical relationships between gold prices and macroeconomic variables such as inflation and exchange rates , little evidence has been offered for connections between gold and other asset classes .
[ Up until now there has been ] no comprehensive theory of gold valuation showing how inflation , exchange rates and other asset classes may together affect gold pricing ; or how gold and other asset classes may be affected by common underlying factors .
In this paper , we offer a gold asset pricing theory that treats gold as a store of wealth .
We demonstrate a theoretical and empirical link between gold price , inflation , and foreign exchange rates and the general valuation of the stock market .
Gold is a store of value , that is , a hedging instrument against inflation and the collapse of the value of other asset classes .
Throughout the history of civilization , gold has been the single most important global store of value .
To this day , it fulfills this unique function .
For the purpose of extending Required Yield Theory to gold pricing , we postulate the following :
1 ) The global real price of gold essentially is a real P/E ratio for gold , where “ earnings ” represent purchasing power or a global price index .
2 ) The global real price of gold must vary inversely to all other main financial asset classes ’ real P/E to preserve the real value of any investor ’s capital against adverse movements in the values of financial asset classes .
3 ) Law of One Price : exchange rate fluctuations must impact local currency - denominated gold prices to eliminate potential international gold arbitrages .
4 ) Mining supply must be stable in relation to supply movements in the aboveground stock and the worldwide stock of gold per capita should not increase in the long run .
Condition 1 ) recognizes that even though gold does not produce actual earnings , its primary purpose is to provide a stream of services by maintaining real purchasing power over time .
The same unit of gold can serve to purchase a representative basket of economic goods repeatedly .
We define the forward P/E for gold as the price of gold divided by expected next period ’s GDP deflator .
It is easy to check that the real price of gold is the same as the real forward gold P/E ratio .
Condition 2 ) insures that gold behaves as a store of value , that is : capital flows to gold are dictated by changes in the minimum expected return achievable by other asset classes .
It is important to emphasize that gold per-se does not require the same yield as other assets , as it stands outside of the conventional realm of investment goals , and acts mostly as a global hedging tool against financial downturns , and inflation .
Hence , our theory postulates that movements in the global real price occur because of the precautionary demand for gold , which largely depends on changes in the inverse real P/E ( or required yield ) of other assets classes combined .
A consequence of this postulate is that a decline in the value of the stock market index does not necessarily entail flight to gold when , for example , expected stock earnings are also falling to maintain a constant real P/E ratio .
On the other hand , flight to gold will happen when stock market prices are dropping faster than expected earnings due to acceleration of inflation for example .
In condition 3 ) we state that since gold is a global homogeneous durable commodity its price must be equalized across countries after currency conversion .
Condition 4 ) states that the supply of gold must be stable so that investors ’ precautionary motive is fulfilled without major price movements driven by supply shocks .
Indeed this condition seems to be characteristic of the precious metal mining industry .
A preliminary empirical investigation of the price of gold reveals a non-trivial connection between real gold prices and the US stock market .
Gold ’s real price varies inversely to the S&P 500 P/E , and thus with the earnings - to - price ratio .
The theory we develop below predicts and explains this high level of correlation based on viewing gold as a global store of value .
We have extended the Required Yield Theory ( RYT ) developed by Faugere - Van Erlach [ 2003 ] to value gold and to determine its return .
RYT states that since global assets are priced to yield a global constant real return , and since gold is a global store of value , its price will vary directly with the global required yield and the global inflation rate .
In the course of developing this asset valuation model we introduced a new exchange rule parity based on required yields comparisons across countries .
Specific predictions include :
1 ) the real price of gold varies proportionately to the change in long - term economic productivity as measured by GDP / capita growth .
2 ) Real gold prices vary proportionately to changes in the foreign exchange rate ( direct quotation ) when the domestic required yield is constant .
3 ) When the foreign exchange rate is constant and there are no major geopolitical or natural crises , real domestic gold price increases with domestic inflation .
4 ) When our new exchange rate parity rule holds , then effectively the real domestic price of gold is mostly determined by the domestic required yield .
This entails that foreign exchange effects will impact the domestic real gold price to the extent that equalization of required yields is not taking place worldwide and / or that PPP is violated as well .
5 ) In the long - term , the gold per-capita supply remains constant .
6 ) The average long - term absolute price of gold is marked - up cost where the profit margin is given by the global average long - term per-capita rate of GDP growth .
While we suspect that central bank activities , hedging activities , supply / demand fluctuations , global real GDP growth changes or changes in global income and capital gains tax rates , affect gold prices as well , the valuation approach developed here performs very well absent these factors , with over 92 % accuracy in predicting US Gold returns over a 23 - year period .
As for the practical implications of these findings :
1 . In the long run , the gold mining industry ’s real profit margin is constant and equals the real per capita productivity .
2 . The price of gold , on average , must be the average production cost plus a constant mark - up .
3 . Furthermore , in order for the real value of gold to be maintained on a per investor basis , the stock of gold has to grow at a rate that can be no greater than population growth in the long - term .
If the supply of gold grew at a lesser rate than population growth for reasons other than depletion of the exhaustible ore , gold price would grow faster than inflation and the quantity demanded for gold would drop .
4 . Eventually the supply of mined gold will dwindle , which will drive prices up unless world population experiences zero growth in the foreseeable future .
In that circumstance , far off in the future , a substitute medium of storing value may be discovered and used .
Another prediction of our theory of gold pricing is that the decrease in proportion of gold total value as compared to world wealth is explained by the Required Yield Theory in the fact that relative to financial assets , the long - term nominal value of gold must increase at the inflation rate , whereas the value of other assets rise with inflation plus real productivity .
Thus , the proportion of investable wealth declines at an annual rate equal to real per share earnings growth or GDP / capita growth .
While we are certain that this paper ’s findings will not even bring the massive divide between gold fans and pessimists even an inch closer , having a solid , reproducible basis in which to reproduce the authors ’ results could be sufficient for some crazy quant to put together a HFT algo which will trade gold based on the postulates presented herein .
With an 88 % prediction rate ( absent major outliers events ) , we are confident that this could be an appropriate problem to reverse engineer ( if it has n’t been already ) .

Lawmakers working to craft a new comprehensive immigration bill have settled on a way to prevent employers from hiring illegal immigrants : a national biometric identification card all American workers would eventually be required to obtain .
Under the potentially controversial plan still taking shape in the Senate , all legal U.S. workers , including citizens and immigrants , would be issued an ID card with embedded information , such as fingerprints , to tie the card to the worker .

Irish girl killed herself after enduring months of torment by classmates in person and online
Nine teenagers have been charged over the death of a 15 - year - old Irish migrant who killed herself after months of merciless and sometimes violent bullying by fellow students at a Massachusetts school .
Phoebe Prince took her life in January in desperation at harassment led by female students who resented her dating an older American football player .
Six of the teenagers , four females and two males , face charges ranging from criminal harassment , stalking and breach of civil rights over the bullying which included text messages and abuse on Facebook .
The male students are also charged with statutory rape , apparently over relationships they had with Prince .
Three younger girls , aged under 16 , face delinquency charges .
One has also been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon , listed as a bottle or can .
Prince hanged herself at home at the end of a day at South Hadley high school in which she was bullied repeatedly by three students , including one she had a brief relationship with .
District attorney Elizabeth Scheibel said that on the day Prince killed herself she was verbally abused as she studied in the school library and pursued in the corridors .
The teenagers then followed her as she walked home .
" From information known to investigators thus far , it appears that Phoebe 's death on January 14th followed a tortuous day for her , in which she was subjected to verbal harassment and threatened physical abuse , " said Scheibel .
" Their [ the students ' ] conduct far exceeded the limits of normal teenage relationship - related quarrels . "
The district attorney said at least one school official observed the bullying but failed to report it .
Three of the students have since been expelled from the school .
The Massachusetts legislature has passed tough new anti-bullying laws in response to Prince 's death and that of 11 - year - old Carl Joseph Walker - Hoover , who also took his own life .
The legislation would oblige schools to take action when they are informed about bullying .
Prince 's death is one of several in recent months that have been attributed to bullying .
The police in New York are investigating whether cyberbullying played a role in the decision of 17 - year - old Alexis Pilkington to take her own life a fortnight ago .
The attacks on her continued after her death on an internet page set up in tribute to Pilkington .
In Missouri , 13 - year - old Megan Meier took her own life in 2006 after taunts from a fellow student 's mother .
Prince 's family have not commented on the charges against the teenagers .
In a death notice in the Springfield Republican newspaper , they said of Prince : " What her family and friends from both sides of the Atlantic grieve is the loss of the incandescent enthusiasm of a life blossoming .
She enjoyed life with an energy only the young possess . "
Few events arouse more teenage angst than the springtime arrival of college rejection letters .
With next fall 's college freshman class expected to approach a record 2.9 million students , hundreds of thousands of applicants will soon be receiving the dreaded letters .
Teenagers who face rejection will be joining good company , including Nobel laureates , billionaire philanthropists , university presidents , constitutional scholars , best - selling authors and other leaders of business , media and the arts who once received college or graduate - school rejection letters of their own .
Journal Community
Both Warren Buffett and " Today " show host Meredith Vieira say that while being rejected by the school of their dreams was devastating , it launched them on a path to meeting life - changing mentors .
Harold Varmus , winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine , says getting rejected twice by Harvard Medical School , where a dean advised him to enlist in the military , was soon forgotten as he plunged into his studies at Columbia University 's med school .
For other college rejects , from Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy and entrepreneur Ted Turner to broadcast journalist Tom Brokaw , the turndowns were minor footnotes , just ones they still remember and will talk about .
Rejections are n't uncommon .
Harvard accepts only a little more than 7 % of the 29,000 undergraduate applications it receives each year , and Stanford 's acceptance rate is about the same .
" The truth is , everything that has happened in my life ... that I thought was a crushing event at the time , has turned out for the better , " Mr. Buffett says .
With the exception of health problems , he says , setbacks teach " lessons that carry you along .
You learn that a temporary defeat is not a permanent one .
In the end , it can be an opportunity . "

Harvard rejection prompted him to settle down and stop partying .
' The initial stumble was critical in getting me launched . '
Mr. Buffett regards his rejection at age 19 by Harvard Business School as a pivotal episode in his life .
Looking back , he says Harvard would n't have been a good fit .
But at the time , he " had this feeling of dread " after being rejected in an admissions interview in Chicago , and a fear of disappointing his father .
As it turned out , his father responded with " only this unconditional love ... an unconditional belief in me , " Mr. Buffett says .
Exploring other options , he realized that two investing experts he admired , Benjamin Graham and David Dodd , were teaching at Columbia 's graduate business school .
He dashed off a late application , where by a stroke of luck it was fielded and accepted by Mr. Dodd .
From these mentors , Mr. Buffett says he learned core principles that guided his investing .
The Harvard rejection also benefited his alma mater ; the family gave more than $ 12 million to Columbia in 2008 through the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation , based on tax filings .
The lesson of negatives becoming positives has proved true repeatedly , Mr. Buffett says .
He was terrified of public speaking — so much so that when he was young he sometimes threw up before giving an address .
So he enrolled in a Dale Carnegie public speaking course and says the skills he learned there enabled him to woo his future wife , Susan Thompson , a " champion debater , " he says .
" I even proposed to my wife during the course , " he says .
" If I had been only a mediocre speaker I might not have taken it . "
Columbia University President Lee Bollinger was rejected as a teenager when he applied to Harvard .
He says the experience cemented his belief that it was up to him alone to define his talents and potential .
His family had moved to a small , isolated town in rural Oregon , where educational opportunities were sparse .
As a kid , he did menial jobs around the newspaper office , like sweeping the floor .
Mr. Bollinger recalls thinking at the time , " I need to work extra hard and teach myself a lot of things that I need to know , " to measure up to other students who were " going to prep schools , and having assignments that I 'm not . "
When the rejection letter arrived , he accepted a scholarship to University of Oregon and later graduated from Columbia Law School .
His advice :
Do n't let rejections control your life .
To " allow other people 's assessment of you to determine your own self - assessment is a very big mistake , " says Mr. Bollinger , a First Amendment author and scholar .
" The question really is , who at the end of the day is going to make the determination about what your talents are , and what your interests are ?
That has to be you . "
Others who received Harvard rejections include " Today " show host Meredith Vieira , who was turned down in 1971 as a high - school senior .
At the time , she was crushed .
" In fact , I was so devastated that when I went to Tufts [ University ] my freshman year , every Saturday I 'd hitchhike to Harvard , " she says in an email .
But Ms. Vieira went on to meet a mentor at Tufts who sparked her interest in journalism by offering her an internship .
Had she not been rejected , she doubts that she would have entered the field , she says .
And broadcast journalist Tom Brokaw , also rejected as a teenager by Harvard , says it was one of a series of setbacks that eventually led him to settle down , stop partying and commit to finishing college and working in broadcast journalism .
" The initial stumble was critical in getting me launched , " he says .
Dr. Varmus , the Nobel laureate and president of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York , was daunted by the first of his two turndowns by Harvard 's med school .
He enrolled instead in grad studies in literature at Harvard , but was uninspired by thoughts of a career in that field .
After a year , he applied again to Harvard 's med school and was rejected , by a dean who chastised him in an interview for being " inconstant and immature " and advised him to enlist in the military .
Officials at Columbia 's medical school , however , seemed to value his " competence in two cultures , " science and literature , he says .
If rejected by the school you love , Dr. Varmus advises in an email , immerse yourself in life at a college that welcomes you .
" The differences between colleges that seem so important before you get there will seem a lot less important once you arrive at one that offered you a place . "
Similarly , John Schlifske , president of insurance company Northwestern Mutual , was discouraged as a teenager when he received a rejection letter from Yale University .
An aspiring college football player , " I wanted to go to Yale so badly , " he says .
He recalls coming home from school the day the letter arrived .
" Mom was all excited and gave it to me , " he says .
His heart fell when he saw " the classic thin envelope , " he says .
" It was crushing . "
Yet he believes he had a deeper , richer experience at Carleton College in Minnesota .
He says he received a " phenomenal " education and became a starter on the football team rather than a bench - warmer as he might have been at Yale .
" Being wanted is a good thing , " he says .
He had a chance to pass on that wisdom to his son Dan , who was rejected in 2006 by one of his top choices , Duke University .
Drawing on his own experience , the elder Mr. Schlifske told his son , " Just because somebody says no , does n't mean there 's not another school out there you 're going to enjoy , and where you are going to get a good education . "
Dan ended up at his other top choice , Washington University in St. Louis , where he is currently a senior .
Mr. Schlifske says , " he loves it . "
Rejected once , and then again , by business schools at Stanford and Harvard , Scott McNealy practiced the perseverance that would characterize his career .
A brash economics graduate of Harvard , he was annoyed that " they would n't take a chance on me right out of college , " he says .
He kept trying , taking a job as a plant foreman for a manufacturer and working his way up in sales .
" By my third year out of school , it was clear I was going to be a successful executive .
I blew the doors off my numbers , " he says .
Granted admission to Stanford 's business school , he met Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla and went on to head Sun for 22 years .
Paul Purcell , who heads one of the few investment - advisory companies to emerge unscathed from the recession , Robert W. Baird & Co. , says he interpreted his rejection years ago by Stanford University as evidence that he had to work harder .
" I took it as a signal that , ' Look , the world is really competitive , and I 'll just try harder next time , ' " he says .
He graduated from the University of Notre Dame and got an MBA from the University of Chicago , and in 2009 , as chairman , president and chief executive of Baird , won the University of Chicago Booth School of Business distinguished corporate alumnus award .
Baird has remained profitable through the recession and expanded client assets to $ 75 billion .
Time puts rejection letters in perspective , says Ted Turner .
He received dual rejections as a teenager , by Princeton and Harvard , he says in an interview .
The future America 's Cup winner attended Brown University , where he became captain of the sailing team .
He left college after his father cut off financial support , and joined his father 's billboard company , which he built into the media empire that spawned CNN .
Brown has since awarded him a bachelor 's degree .
Tragedies later had a greater impact on his life , he says , including the loss of his father to suicide and his teenage sister to illness .
" A rejection letter does n't even come close to losing loved ones in your family .
That is the hard stuff to survive , " Mr. Turner says .
" I want to be sure to make this point : I did everything I did without a college degree , " he says .
While it is better to have one , " you can be successful without it . "

Members of Parliament from three parties — Conservative , Liberal , and New Democrat — are poised to present petitions with thousands of signatures seeking to stop the extradition to the U.S. of Canada ’s Prince of Pot , Marc Emery .
The politicians are Conservative MP Scott Reid of Ontario , Vancouver South Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh , and Vancouver East NDP MP Libby Davies , the Georgia Straight has learned .
“ That ’s correct , ” Reid ’s aide Mike Firth confirmed by phone from Ottawa .
“ We have n’t arranged a day yet .
We ’re still trying to get a day when the three of them will be available at the same time . ”
Last summer , Emery entered into a plea bargain with American authorities that will likely see him thrown in a U.S. jail for at least five years for distributing marijuana seeds .
The petitions ask Conservative justice minister and attorney general Rob Nicholson not to sign the extradition papers of the Vancouver - based cannabis activist .
In a phone interview , Jodie Emery , Marc Emery ’s wife , related that she and her husband met Reid at a Liberty Summer Seminar organized by the Ontario - based Institute for Liberal Studies .
“ Scott Reid was there one year , and we talked to him and he understands that prohibition is a bad idea , ” she said .
Emery also recalled that Reid told them his wife once used marijuana when she was undergoing a series of medical treatments .
“ She does n’t need it anymore , I do n’t think , ” she said .
“ He said it helps with the nausea .
So I guess he ’s willing to say that he thinks this [ the extradition ] is wrong too .
There are a lot of Conservative party members who said they do n’t like this happening . ”
Reid was n’t available for comment .
By Davies ’s estimate , the offices of the three MPs have received petitions signed by about 12,000 people who are opposed to Emery ’s extradition .
She confirmed that her office is communicating with Dosanjh ’s and Reid ’s offices to pin down a day when they will bring the petitions to the floor of the House of Commons .
“ I ’m very happy that we should try and do it on the same day , ” Davies said by phone from Ottawa .
“ You ca n’t necessarily do it one after the other because the Speaker recognizes you not necessarily in the order you want . ”
In a separate interview , Dosanjh said that presenting petitions in the House is one of the duties of MPs .
Said Dosanjh on the phone from Ottawa , “ Members from three different parties are doing it — it ’s really a nonpartisan issue . ”
In an interview with the Straight in December , after he was released on bail from the North Fraser Pretrial Centre , Marc Emery said that American authorities are out to get him because of the significant work he has done on legalizing marijuana .
Emery cited a media statement issued by then –U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration head Karen Tandy following his arrest in 2005 .
The release stated that his arrest was “ a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada , but also to the marijuana legalization movement ” .
The second crash test of a small lightweight helicopter at NASA 's Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va. , was a smashing success , literally -- just as engineers had predicted .
[ image - 47 ]
" Three , two , one , release , " said the technician on the loudspeaker at the Landing and Impact Research Facility .
With that countdown the helicopter smacked hard into the concrete .
Its skid gear collapsed , its windscreen cracked open and its occupants lurched forward violently , suffering potentially spine - crushing injuries according to internal data recorders .
The crash test was all in the name of research to try to make helicopters safer .
[ image - 62 ]
" The goal of any research program that has an element of impact dynamics is to develop an understanding of the crash response of the vehicle , " said Karen Jackson , an aerospace engineer who oversaw the test .
" Once we understand that response we can look at ways to improve the crash performance . "
In December 2009 researchers dropped the same MD - 500 at a similar angle from the same height of 35 feet ( 10.7 m ) .
Inside were the same instruments that collected 160 channels of data and the same four crash test dummies .
Three of the dummies were full bodies and one was a special torso model equipped with simulated internal organs .
Technicians set up the same cameras to record the impact from inside and outside the helicopter .
› Dec. 2009 Test
The test conditions on both days were the same too , simulating what would be a relatively severe but survivable helicopter crash .
The flight path angle was about 33 degrees and the combined forward and vertical speeds were about 48 feet per second or 33 miles per hour ( 53.1 kph ) .
In the first test the MD - 500 skidded to a stop , with very little damage to the helicopter or its silent occupants , because its underside was outfitted with an expandable honeycomb cushion called a deployable energy absorber .
" It 's made of Kevlar and has a unique flexible hinge design that allows the honeycomb to be packaged and remain flat until needed , " said Sotiris Kellas , the Langley engineer who created the idea as a way to cushion the next generation of astronaut - carrying space capsules , but realized it could be used in other ways .
[ image - 78 ]
The more recent drop on March 10 , 2010 involved just the helicopter .
No new technology was attached .
That was the point .
Engineers wanted to determine exactly how efficient the deployable energy absorber had been in the earlier test and how much it might help reduce occupant injuries .
So they dropped the same helicopter in the same way and measured and recorded the same conditions with the same instruments .
" We were fortunate enough that the helicopter survived so well the first time that we could use it again , " said engineer Martin Annett .
There will be no third crash test for this helicopter .
It was too damaged .
Researchers say the " g " forces the MD - 500 experienced more than tripled those recorded in the previous test .
But that does n't mean the research is over .
Engineers have gigabytes of data to analyze to confirm exactly what impact the new honeycomb cushion technology might have for helicopters in the future .
The drop tests were conducted by the Subsonic Rotary Wing Project of NASA 's Fundamental Aeronautics Program , and funded by the agency 's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate in Washington .
Congressman Eric Massa , D - N.Y. , announced Friday afternoon that he will be resigning his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Earlier this week , reports surfaced saying Massa was under investigation by the House ethics committee for allegedly sexually harassing a male staffer .
The committee formally announced on Thursday that they were investigating the freshman representative .
Massa already announced he would not be seeking a second term because of a cancer scare last December .
Rep .
Massa released a statement taking full responsibility for things said to a staff member that made him feel " uncomfortable . "
He also added that the House Ethics Committee had failed to inform him they were investigating him , and that he found out on the Internet .
" I own this reality , " he said .
" There is no doubt in my mind that I did in fact , use language in the privacy of my own home and in my inner office that , after 24 years in the Navy , might make a Chief Petty Officer feel uncomfortable . "
He added , " In fact , there is no doubt that this Ethics issue is my fault and mine alone . "
Massa , who represents the 29th Congressional District in Upstate New York , will resign from his position at 5 p.m. on Monday .

I had a high school English teacher named Mr. Turk , who insisted that the best sentences in the world were just two words .
Subject and verb .
He said our class had proven too dense to understand prepositions .
" We define the limitations of experience with action , " he said .
So he had us practice one afternoon , on a single piece of paper , writing these two - word sentences , which he considered elemental .
Irreplaceable , even .
" Two words , " he said .
I worked .
I do .
I insist .
You will .
She flew .
I thought it was a pointless exercise .
I was seventeen ; we all were , more or less .
In a year , some of us would have jobs .
Within two years , one of the boys in the room would be dead .
( He died . )
But I persisted , because the exercise was incredibly easy .
At one point , someone raised his hand and asked , " What about a one - word sentence ?
Would n't that be even more pure ? "
Turk allowed that it might .
" What would that word be ? " he asked .
" Yes , " the kid said .
" Just ' Yes . '
Like ' Yes , ' period .
Would n't ' Yes ' make the best sentence ever ? "
Mr. Turk pursed his lips .
" No , " he said .
And then he said nothing else .
I 've never been a guy who can figure out puzzles .
Tell me a riddle , I 'll ask for the answer .
But I understood this one right away .
He was n't saying , " No , that answer is wrong . "
He was saying , " No . "
The purest sentence is n't " Yes , " with all its affirming possibilities ; it is the loud door - slam of " No . "
He was proving that much .
The kid argued .
Though there were people who thought he was being cruel , Mr. Turk just kept saying , " No . "
Yes suggests pleasure .
It wants something .
Salesmen train themselves to use yes at the beginning of a sentence , no matter what , which is why when you say it enough , the word yes starts to feel like a con .
But no is cold and heavy .
It puts an end to things .
In that way , it is a word of control .
Its very use suggests a speaker who actually knows something , who wo n't bend , who wo n't give in to what you want simply because you want it .
No says the case has not been made .
Cops use it .
Operators use it .
Good teachers , too .
I 'd always wanted to be a guy who simply said no .
So that 's what I did for a month .
Whenever I did n't want to do something , I did n't hesitate , did n't explain .
I just said no .
I did n't say it more often than usual -- this was not a diet .
I was just going to say no .
Not " Hell no . "
Or " No way . "
Or " Nope . Sorry . " Just " No . " I was going to change this one behavior , my own tendency to elaborate , to explain , to set the record straight when turning people down , when risking the disappointment of others , just to see what it changed in the equation of influence .
I 'm a parent , so it was n't hard to imagine saying no to my children .
Trouble is , I 'd fallen into a pattern of explaining like some soft TV father every time I said it .
I wanted them to understand .
I wanted to be fair .
So I tended to explain .
To my eighteen - year - old , I might have said : " No , Gus , you can't have a drink .
I do n't like the law , but the drinking age is twenty - one .
When I was a kid , it was eighteen , so I know you can handle it .
But that really had its good side and its bad side .
Believe me .
In the end , I think I have to say no . "
Fucking Alan Thicke .
But when he really did ask if he and a couple of buddies could have a few beers at my house , I just said no .
No follow - up , no prevarication , no buddying up for a sympathy injection .
Clarity .
That 's the first lesson : A simple no grants clarity .
It makes your agenda transparent .
It asserts what you want as clearly and fairly as any sort of affirmation , but there 's no risk of muddying your message .
Waiters .
Shuttle - bus drivers .
Flight attendants .
I began to see how many meaningless questions came my way through the service industry .
By asking questions -- Did I want a take - home box ?
Fresh ground pepper ?
Could they take that bag for me ?
-- they were saliently asserting that the conventions of their typical service were somehow favors they might grant me .
The problem was n't my answer , it was their questions .
In their own way , these endless questions were an attempt to dominate the transaction , to make it be about them and not me .
My nos gave me control .
No. No. No .
At the video store , returning a movie , the kid who had recommended it asked if I 'd liked it .
No .
He waited a beat , then two .
" I gotta comp that then , " he said , without a pause .
" Sorry , man .
How about Derailed ?
You like Jennifer Aniston ? "
No .
He put his hand to his chin , thinking .
Now he was working for me .
Same week , at the car wash , where the idiot attendant always runs me through every choice before letting me choose the cheapest wash , I gunned him down at every turn .
Deluxe ?
No. Super Wash ?
No. Wash ' n ' Wax ?
No .
I was n't pushing back or acting annoyed .
I just was n't wasting time .
The pointlessness of this sort of daily transaction dropped away .
My mind felt clean .
Meanwhile , he was reconsidering his own behavior .
The simple no had cleaned up the transaction .
He nodded , message received .
" You just like a basic wash , " he said , sliding my debit card .
" I remember . "
He has n't forgotten since .
I even refined my delivery : a level affect , a calm demeanor , an internalized respect for the job , but nothing else .
I just fell into a smaller me , shooting for a nice , even voice on my single - syllable response .
For a while it felt like a costume , as I 'm usually a talker .
I like the schmooze , and I 've always been able to talk my way in .
But that stuff was still available .
I just was n't explaining or apologizing , nor was I expressing anything tacit .
No annoyance .
No anger .
But no false appreciation , either .
It stripped me a little .
Less artifice .
I 'd even say it gave me the upper hand more often than I expected .
Late in the year at the college where I teach , students approach teachers with a million questions , each born of their own anxiety .
They want independent studies .
They want special permission to get into my class .
Could I read this thesis by the next night ?
Could they get extra credit ?
Once again , I said yes when I determined I could or when I wanted to .
But when I gave a question some thought and decided it should n't happen , I simply said no .
I never offered an apology or rationale .
It pissed many of them off mightily , I could see -- and I understood that those were the ones who felt that I worked for them , that I was more their houseboy than their teacher .
But most welcomed the clarity and direction .
Two days before the end of the semester , a kid from my class approached me .
I 'd told him his grade range ; he was worried about it , though he should not have been .
Was there anything else he could do to raise his grade ?
he asked .
These are moments of truth for me .
I knew the answer , but I wanted him to feel better , too .
Before , I might have scrounged around to give him some hope .
Now that just seemed silly .
He was passing , his work was done .
I rolled the answer around in my brain and looked at him .
As I did , I began to see what he was worried about -- his other classes .
He wanted to raise my grade to pull up his average .
I could see he actually needed some help .
" No , " I said , thumbs in pockets , briefcase hanging from my fingers .
His reaction was swift and without drama .
I looked up at the trees .
" Do you want to get some coffee ? " I said .
" To talk about the grade ? "
" No , " I said .
" To drink some coffee ? " he asked .
" We can talk about your other classes , " I said .
" See where you stand . "
He looked relieved , grateful .
I asked if he drank coffee .
He said no .
We went anyway , as there was work to be done .
Problem is , of course , it feels rude to say no .
I did n't like saying no to my girlfriend , because she has at least some right to the inside of my mind .
Saying no just locked her out .
First time I did it , she was asking about a movie to rent , and she looked a little hurt .
The second time , when we were discussing her daughter 's band concert , she squinted at me .
The third time we were driving by a restaurant we both like from time to time , and I said no when she asked if I wanted to grab a bite there .
At times like this , with people I love , the no just felt empty and a little incomplete .
At the stoplight , she leaned over and spoke : " I think I want to be left out of this little experiment . "
But I wanted her in .
I did n't see how it could work without her .
" No , " I said .
And she shook her head and said nothing .
She grabbed me , put her hands to my cheeks , and pressed in .
" No , " she said .
She was n't repeating after me .
She was saying what she would not bear .
She was using the clearest word of all to tell me what she did n't want .
This was her form of clarity .
And it was clear .
As I 'd learned , that kind of thing can change minds .
" Okay , " I said , putting my arm around her , pulling her in .
" No more .
I promise . "
Then I turned , and we went back to the restaurant .
We ate .

The Pentagon Invades Farmville
By : OMER SHACHNAI
Published : March 2nd 2010
The Pentagon Pic : NULL
Washington - Everyone from combat troops in the field to the highest ranking personal and civilian leaders will be allowed to tweet , blog and use Facebook on military 's non classified computers .
The US armed forces are connecting to Twitter , Facebook and other web 2.0 social networks that are based on users ' content .
The Defense Department had announced on Friday a new policy , which authorizes the use of social networks from military computers that are n't connected to the army 's intra-secured network .
The Pentagon officials behind the announcement , also claimed the new policy will allow to quickly share information and data and will increase the cooperation among the different armed forces .
The new policy comes after a seven - month long review , in which the Defense Department looked over the threats and benefits of allowing the use of these Internet services .
The new directive practically seeks to manage the risks while recognizing the Internet is a powerful tool for a great number of tasks such as recruiting , cooperation with a wide range of people , communication between soldiers and their families and even , yes , public relations , which are in need these days .
Nevertheless , the announcement protruded the importance of data protection .
The new policy gives commanders the right to cut off access to the web for a specified time only , in order to guard security and the integrity of military operations .
The policy also standardizes all the previous web related commands across the entire department .
Workers of the Defense Department and the army , still are prohibited to visit certain sites such as gambling , pornography and hatred sites on military computers .
Up to this point , the official policy of the Defense Department was not to allow access to social networks and other services , in order to prevent the leakage of classified data .
Moreover , access to YouTube , MySpace and more than a dozen other sites was blocked due to bandwidth usage and now will be allowed to use once again .
David M. Wennergren , US deputy assistant secretary of defense for information technology , says the Pentagon can no longer treat social networks as a safety threat only and the new policy recognizes the need to be both " responsible and use these tools to help get the job done " .
Makes you wonder whether the guys at the Defense Department ever took into consideration the implications on the soldiers ' personal time usage and priorities .
The assistant pushed the red velvet sacks across the counter discreetly .
The customer quickly slipped them into her bag .
With a brief , nervous look around , she walked briskly from the shop , already clutching her car keys .
Few people feel comfortable lugging around a kilo of pure gold bars .
But that does n't stop Chinese shoppers from thronging to Caibai , the number one place for buying the precious metal .
The Beijing store 's 5,000 daily customers are at the forefront of a new gold rush .
Since 2007 , when South Africa fell behind , China has been the world 's biggest gold producer .
Now the World Gold Council and industry analysts believe it may have overtaken India – for centuries the dominant buyer – to become the biggest consumer too .
The China Gold Association estimated demand would exceed 450 tonnes last year , up from 395.6 tonnes in 2008 ( the actual figures are not yet available ) .
The country 's rising consumption both drives , and is fuelled by , the increase in global gold prices .
Last January , an ounce of gold cost about $ 750 ( £ 550 ) .
But on 3 December , it hit a record high of just over $ 1,226 .
Since then it has slid to $ 1,095 , but is still far above its level in the past few years .
Much of the gain is recent .
In the third quarter of 2009 , gold demand on the mainland soared 12 % year - on - year to a record high of 120.2 tonnes .
Internationally , demand for jewellery was down 30 % , but in China it rose 8 % to 93.5 tonnes while retail investment rose a staggering 30 % to a record 26.8 tonnes .
Albert Cheng , Far East managing director for the World Gold Council , points out this is partly because China 's continued economic growth is enabling consumers to indulge in a favourite luxury .
" The Chinese have a deep affinity to gold which dates back thousand of years , " he says .
" No marriage will be ideal if the bride does not receive gold jewellery . "
China is hardly the only culture to prize gold .
But the council , which is funded by mining companies , has spotted something distinctive about its consumers .
In India , Turkey and the Middle East , buyers have been deterred by the soaring cost of the metal .
In China , however , it noted in a recent report , " the rising gold price is seen as a positive factor – consumers like to buy into a rising price " .
That is why , even on a weekday morning , the shop floor at Caibai is rammed .
On busy days , 10,000 people pass through its doors .
This store is to gold what Marks & Spencer is to underwear in Britain : not the most glamorous source , nor the cheapest , but the tried and trusted favourite .
In 2008 , the company sold gold worth 3.5 bn yuan ( £ 316 m ) .
In the first 11 months of 2009 , it sold 4.1 bn yuan , and the lead up to the Chinese new year – which falls next month – is always a busy period .
Customers are picking over delicately wrought earrings and gazing covetously at huge , embellished collars .
Increasing prosperity is enabling middle - class consumers to treat themselves ; Liu Hongxia , leaving the store with a newly acquired bangle , recalls splashing her first pay packet on a ring for herself and earrings for her mother .
No wonder she feels nostalgic – that was more than a decade ago .
" Now the price is three times higher , " she said ruefully .
Nearby shelves are stacked with solid gold statuettes : busts of Chairman Mao , frolicking labradors , soaring eagles and majestic galleons .
Laughing Buddhas sit beside writhing dragons .
Every item is labelled by weight , and charged according to the metal 's price on the day of sale .
But a glass case close to the entrance – and closer to security guards – offers a clue to the hottest draw .
Inside sits a 50kg , 24 - carat bar : so big , it looks as though it should be made of chocolate and covered in foil .
Upstairs , shoppers are buying smaller versions .
To them , gold is not just a lavish gift or a reward for hard work , but a hedge against uncertainty and a potential money maker .
" This is the first time I 've invested in it , " said Ji Junqing , a 38 - year - old accountant , hugging her treasure - filled handbag as she spoke .
" I used the stock market before , but I think this is more stable .
I 've been reading about it in all the newspapers and magazines , so I 'm putting in about 20 % of my assets .
" Whether it 's a short - or long - term move depends on how it fares , but I believe the price will keep going up .
When you buy gold you see real gold – when you buy something else it 's simulated . "
Shares are too risky , agree other buyers , stung by last year 's freefall of Chinese stocks .
Housing is too expensive .
They fear inflation could whittle away the value of cash holdings .
Gold looks attractive to the government too .
Last year , Beijing revealed it had been buying gold since 2003 , increasing its holdings from 600 to 1,054 tonnes .
So far it has bought domestically , but its foreign exchange reserves – the world 's largest , at $ 2.27tn – are largely invested in US government bonds .
Given concerns about the US economy , many expect China to buy gold internationally to diversify its assets , as other central banks have done recently , driving up the price .
Production is on the increase as well : the China Gold Association predicted it would hit a record 310 tonnes in 2009 , up from 282 tonnes the previous year .
Newspapers report that coal bosses , driven out of business by a nationalisation campaign , are caught in bidding wars for gold mines instead .
" People are running around with bags of cash to buy the right to exploit gold as soon as possible , " Liu Jun , a former coal boss from Zhejiang , told the Xinmin Evening Post .
Some of these mines have yet to produce gold .
But many buyers do not seem to mind : they are simply flipping the mines , reselling them as soon as the price goes up .
" It makes money quicker than real mining , " said another former coal boss .
Like Caibai's shoppers , they see gold not just as an investment haven but as an irresistibly accumulating asset .
Yet while some experts predict a long - term rise in the international price , others fear prices could fall sharply .
In 1999 , at its lowest , gold was worth just $ 252.8 an ounce .
No one expects it to plummet to that level , or to drop tomorrow .
But it may not always look so glittering to today 's eager Chinese buyers .
The law can fall behind new developments in technology Consumers are confused by copyright laws that mean it is still illegal to copy a CD onto their computer , a watchdog says .
Consumer Focus said that copyright law was outdated and millions of people were unaware they were breaking laws .
But a legal expert has said that there was no danger of individual consumers being prosecuted for copying music and films for their own use .
Instead commercial operations are the focus of law enforcement .
Rules
The current state of the law means that it is illegal for somebody to copy a CD or DVD onto a computer or an Ipod for their own use .
This copying to a different device is known as format shifting .
In a poll of 2,026 people , some 73 % said that they did not know what they could copy or record .
Jill Johnstone , of Consumer Focus , called for the law to be updated to take the advance of technology into account .
" The world has moved on and reform of copyright law is inevitable , but it is not going to update itself , " she said .
However , IT lawyer Nick Lockett , of DL Legal , said that nobody was being prosecuted for the technical breach in the law .
Those who set up commercial operations were more at risk of prosecution , he added .
He said a similar issue arose when video recorders allowed people to record a television show and watch it later in the day - which at the time was illegal .
An amendment to copyright laws only came after video recorders had been on the market for some time .
One argument against allowing people to shift their music or films onto a different format was that the artists could claim that these works only had a limited lifespan and so people should pay them again for having the work on a different format .
' No quick fix ' Separate proposals to disconnect so - called peer to peer file - sharers has caused concern among internet campaigners .
This is when people share music or films even though only one of them has bought the original .
A spokesman for the Intellectual Property Office said that a short - term fix on copyright issues was not appropriate .
" We would welcome EU wide action to develop a copyright system that would bring real benefit to consumers .
However , there would need to be fair compensation to creators and rights holders for any new exceptions to copyright , " he said .
" While many European countries do this through imposing a levy on the price of electronic goods , we do not wish to push up the price of computers and MP3 players for cash - strapped consumers .
" The government has already consulted on a very narrow exception to copyright for format - shifting .
The response to that consultation suggests that a format shifting exception is insufficient to meet either consumer or business needs in the digital age . "

In 1972 , three men in a Louisiana prison were placed in solitary confinement after a prison guard was murdered .
Two of them are still there – even though many believe they are innocent
Angola prison , the state penitentiary of Louisiana , is the biggest prison in America .
Built on the site of a former slave plantation , the 1,800 - acre penal complex is home to more than 5,000 prisoners , the majority of whom will never walk the streets again as free men .
Also known as the Farm , Angola took its name from the homeland of the slaves who used to work its fields , and in many ways still resembles a slave plantation today .
Eighty per cent of the prisoners are African - Americans and , under the watchful eye of armed guards on horseback , they still work fields of sugar cane , cotton and corn , for up to 16 hours a day .
" You 've got to keep the inmates working all day so they 're tired at night , " says Warden Burl Cain , a committed evangelist who believes that the rehabilitation of convicts is only possible through Christian redemption .
Undoubtedly there is less violence and abuse among the prisoners under his wardenship than there was under his predecessors .
But Angola is still a long way from being a " positive environment that promotes responsibility , goodness , and humanity " , as he proclaims in the prison 's mission statement .
In fact at the heart of Cain 's prison regime is an inhumanity that would make Jesus weep .
For more than 37 years , two prisoners , Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox , have been locked down in Angola 's maximum security Closed Cell Restricted ( CCR ) block – the longest period of solitary confinement in American prison history .
Having experienced the isolation of " 23 - hour bang - up " during my own 20 years of imprisonment , for offences of which I was guilty , I can attest to the mental impact that such conditions inflict .
My first year was spent on a high - security landing where the cell doors were opened only briefly for meals and emptying of toilet buckets .
If decent - minded prison officers were on duty we were allowed to walk the yard for 30 minutes a day .
The rest of the time we were alone .
The cells were 10ft x 5 ft , with a chair , a table and a bed .
You could walk up and down , run on the spot , stand still , or do push - ups and sit-ups – but sooner or later you had to just stop , and think .
As the days , weeks and months blur into one , without realising it you start to live completely inside your head .
You dream about the past , in vivid detail – and fantasise about the future , for fantasies are all you have .
You panic but it 's no good " getting on the bell " – unless you 're dying – and , even then , do n't hope for a speedy response .
I had a lot to think about .
When the man in the cell above mine hanged himself I thought about that , a lot .
I still do .
You look at the bars on the high window and think how easy it would be to be free of all the thinking .
Such thoughts must have crossed the minds of Wallace and Woodfox more than once during their isolation .
They are fed through the barred gates of their 9ft x 6ft cells and allowed only one hour of exercise every other day alone in a small caged yard .
Their capacity for psychological endurance alone is noteworthy .
Wallace and Woodfox were confined to solitary after being convicted of murdering Angola prison guard Brent Miller in 1972 .
But the circumstances of their trial was so suspect that there are no doubts among their supporters that these men are innocent .
Even Brent Miller 's widow , Teenie Verret , has her reservations .
" If they did not do this , " she says , " and I believe that they did n't , they have been living a nightmare . "
One man who understands the nightmare that Wallace and Woodfox are living more than anyone else is Robert King .
King was also convicted of a murder in Angola in 1973 , and was held in solitary alongside Wallace and Woodfox for 29 years , until his conviction was overturned in 2001 and he was freed .
Together , King , Wallace and Woodfox have become known as the " Angola three " .
The case of the Angola three first came to international attention following the campaigning efforts of the Body Shop founder and humanitarian Anita Roddick .
Roddick heard about their plight from a young lawyer named Scott Fleming .
Fleming was working as a prisoner advocate in the 1990s when he received a letter from Wallace asking for help .
The human tragedy Fleming uncovered had the most profound effect on him .
When he qualified as a lawyer , their case became his first .
" I was born in 1973 , " he says .
" I often think that for my entire life they have been in solitary . "
Through Fleming , Roddick met King and then Woodfox in Angola .
Their story , she said later , " made my blood run cold in my veins " .
Until her death in 2007 Roddick was a committed and passionate supporter of their cause .
At her memorial service King played two taped messages from Wallace and Woodfox .
In the congregation was film - maker Vadim Jean who had become good friends with Roddick and her husband Gordon during an earlier film project .
" Anita 's big thing was , ' Just do something , ' " says Jean .
" No matter how small an act of kindness .
Listening to Herman and Albert 's voices at her memorial was like having Anita 's finger pointing at me and saying , ' Just do something ' . "
And so he decided to make
In the Land of the Free , a searing documentary , released later this month .
The story Jean 's film tells is one that has resonance on many levels .
All three men were from poor black neighbourhoods
In New Orleans .
They grew up fearing the police , who would regularly " clear the books " of crimes in the area , according to King , by pinning then on disaffected young black men .
" If I saw the police , I used to run , " King says .
He admits to being involved in petty crime in his early years , but " nothing vicious " .
Eventually King was arrested for an armed robbery he says he did not commit and was sentenced to 35 years , which he began in New Orleans parish prison – and there he met Albert Woodfox .
Woodfox had also been sentenced for armed robbery – and given 50 years .
On the day he was sentenced he escaped from the courthouse .
He made his way to Harlem in New York , where he encountered the Black Panthers , the revolutionary African - American political movement .
He witnessed the Panthers engaging with the community in a positive , constructive way , educating and informing people of their rights .
He says it was the first time in his life that he had seen African - Americans exhibiting real pride , pride that emanated from the young activists , he says , " like a shimmering heatwave " .
Two days later Woodfox was caught and taken to New York 's Tombs prison where he saw first - hand the militant tactics of imprisoned Panthers who resisted their guards with organised protests .
In Tombs , Woodfox was labelled " militant " and sent back to New Orleans where he joined King on the parish prison block , known – due to the high concentration of Panther activists – as " the Panther tier " .
There Woodfox became a member of the Black Panther party .
Outside , confrontations between the Panthers – described by FBI director J Edgar Hoover as " the greatest threat to the internal security of the country " – and the police were escalating .
In an attempt to undermine the influence of the Panthers in New Orleans parish prison , officials tried to shoehorn men they termed " Black Gangsters " on to the tier – men like Wallace , also serving decades for armed robbery .
One day Wallace was suffering from the pain of ill - fitting shoes .
One of the Panthers , on his way to a court appearance , took his shoes off and handed them to Wallace .
" Right then I knew that that was what I needed to be a part of , " he says .
In the summer of 1971 Wallace and Woodfox were shipped to Angola .
The civil rights bill had been signed in 1964 , but seven years later Angola was still operating a segregated regime .
Prisoner guards carried guns and were also responsible , according to well - documented sources , for organising systematic sexual abuse of vulnerable prisoners , which flourished in the prison 's mostly dormitory accommodation .
And violence between prisoners had reached such levels that Angola was known as " the bloodiest prison in America " .
Woodfox and Wallace quickly extended the New Orleans chapter of the Black Panthers into Angola , establishing classes in political ideology and exposing injustices .
They organised work stoppages , demonstrating to fellow prisoners the liberating power of acting with a " unity of purpose " and worked to eradicate the prevalent sexual abuses .
But their political activities made them targets for the administrators .
By the spring of 1972 , tensions in the prison were dangerously high .
These were the conditions in which Brent Miller met his untimely death .
That April , a prisoner work strike drew the attention of the guards who were called from normal duties to deal with the disturbance .
Miller , a strong , athletic young man of 23 , stayed behind alone .
He entered a dormitory holding 90 prisoners and sat on an elderly prisoner 's bed , drinking coffee and chatting .
Moments later he was attacked and stabbed 32 times .
Two days later , four men identified as " black militants " , including Wallace and Woodfox , were accused of the murder .
It was quickly ascertained that one of the four had been inserted into the case by the prison administration .
Charges against him were dropped .
Another , Chester Jackson , admitted to holding Miller while the guard was stabbed to death .
Jackson turned state 's evidence in return for a plea to manslaughter .
The case was tried in a town called St Francisville , the closest courthouse to Angola .
The jury had been picked from the local populace , many of whom earned their living from the prison or had families and friends that worked there ; all were white .
Wallace and Woodfox were found guilty of Miller 's murder , sentenced to life imprisonment without parole and taken from the court straight to Angola 's CCR block to begin their life in isolation .
Robert King was brought to Angola from the parish prison two weeks after Miller 's killing , as part of a roundup of black radicals .
King had never met Miller and was in a prison 150 miles away when the murder took place .
Yet he was investigated for the crime and identified as a " conspirator " before being transferred to lockdown on CCR alongside Wallace and Woodcock .
The following year a prisoner named August Kelly was murdered on King 's CCR tier .
A man named Grady Brewer admitted that he alone was responsible for the killing , which he said he carried out in self - defence .
But King was also charged .
The two men faced trial together in the same St Francisville courthouse where Wallace and Woodfox had been convicted the year before .
The sole evidence against King came from flawed prisoner testimony .
He and Brewer had not been allowed to speak to their attorneys for any length of time before their trial .
When they protested , the judge ordered their hands to be shackled behind their backs and their mouths gagged with duct tape for the duration of their trial .
The men were convicted and sentenced to life without parole .
King later won an appeal ; the federal court ruled that he had not been sufficiently unruly in the dock to warrant the shackling and gagging .
He went back to trial in 1975 , was re-convicted and immediately sent back to CCR .
When , after Scott Fleming 's intervention in the case of Wallace and Woodfox in the 1990s , new lawyers reviewed the original trial of both men , discovering " obfuscation after obfuscation " .
The state had used a number of jailhouse informants against them , many of whom gave contradictory accounts of what they saw .
One was registered blind .
The key witness in the case was a man called Hezikiah Brown who testified he witnessed the murder .
In his initial statement to investigators however , Brown said he had not seen anything .
Three days later , when he was taken from his bunk at midnight by prison officials and promised his freedom if he testified , he agreed to say that he saw Wallace and Woodfox kill Miller .
At the time Brown was serving life without parole for multiple rapes .
Immediately after he agreed to testify he was given his own minimum security private house in the prison grounds and a weekly cigarette ration .
Wallace and Woodfox did not give up .
They fought their convictions from their cells and in 1993 Woodfox was granted an appeal , forcing a new trial .
The case was sent back to the same courthouse to be tried in front of a new grand jury .
A local author , Anne Butler , who had published a book in which she detailed the case and was convinced that the right people had been convicted , acted as jury chairperson .
No witnesses were called .
Instead Butler was called upon to explain the case .
Once again , the jury was composed of people who worked in Angola or were related to people who worked there .
Butler 's husband and co-author was Murray Henderson , who had been the warden of Angola when Brent Miller was murdered .
It is worth noting that Henderson was a key member of the original investigation team and that , during that investigation , a bloody fingerprint was found close to Brent Miller 's body .
It was determined that it did not belong to Woodfox nor to Wallace , but despite the prison holding all the fingerprints of all the prisoners , no attempt was made to find out whose it was .
The bloody print was also ignored at Woodfox 's retrial .
He was reconvicted and sent back to isolation in Angola 's CCR .
It was 26 years before King won the right to another appeal .
In 2001 the Federal court found that the jury in King 's original trial had systematically excluded African - Americans and women and agreed that the case should be reheard .
This time around the prisoner witnesses recanted and the federal court sent the case back to the district court for review .
The state negotiated a deal with King .
Reluctantly , and with his left hand raised instead of his right , he pleaded guilty to conspiracy ; an hour and a half later he was freed .
In September 2008 , Woodfox 's conviction was overturned ; the federal court ruled that his core constitutional rights had been violated at his original trial .
Louisiana attorney general Buddy Caldwell could have set Woodfox free immediately .
Instead he decided to contest the federal decision and Woodfox , now 64 , was returned to Angola 's CCR , where he remains .
Herman Wallace , now 68 , was moved to another Louisiana prison last year , where he too continues to be held in solitary confinement .
Today King , now 67 , is still campaigning for justice for his friends .
Albert Woodfox : " Our primary objective is that front gate .
That is what we are struggling for and we are actually fighting for our freedom .
We are fighting for people to understand that we were framed for a murder that we are totally , completely and actually innocent of . "
Robert King says he is free of Angola , but until his friends are free , " Angola will never be free of me . "
Jean hopes his film will make a difference .
" These men need help , " he says .
" Louisiana needs to be shamed into doing the right thing . "

In the Land of the Free is released on 26 March
The Million “ Fag ” March is an annual event held at Gage Park in Topeka , KS near the home of Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church .
The MFM is a rally designed to protest the antics of Phelps and his church , who have become a symbol of the homophobia that remains throughout the United States .
And to have a good time in the process .
( Learn more about the WBC | Watch CNN ’s Coverage of the MFM )
The main goal of the MFM is to turn the tables , using the very same rights and laws the members of the WBC use to shield themselves .
However , the March also sends an opposing message of respect and acceptance for all people .
We believe that ignoring a problem will not make it go away , and that we must take advantage of the rights given to us to speak up when we see wrong - doing in our communities , cities , and country .
Each year the MFM draws hundreds of people .
The crowd is an extremely diverse mix of race , gender , sexual orientation , religious ( and non-religious ) affiliation , military , civilian , and political viewpoint .
Past MFMs have garnered national media attention and special guest speakers such as Nate Phelps , an ex-member of the WBC who now advocates against the church .
As we stress the use of peaceful and lawful demonstration , we are able to hold a meaningful event without any negative incident .
In fact , the March tends to be as much about fun as it is about the WBC .
One might even call it family friendly .
Please join us on Saturday , April 30 at 2 PM at the corner of 10th Ave. & Gage Blvd. in Topeka , KS .
Bring a sign , a good attitude , and friends .

Welcome to HealthCare4AllPA
We are building a movement across Pennsylvania to support all advocates of single - payer healthcare and hold those in power accountable to the challenge of true healthcare reform .
Health Care for All PA is outraged at the killing of George Floyd and the rampant police brutality aimed at protesters and even journalists during the past two weeks .
As an organization committed to social justice we are obligated to speak out .
Health Care 4
All PA was founded in 2006 and has been relentless in educating the public and legislators about the social justice advances and economic advantages of a New and Improved Medicare for All ( aka Single Payer ) model of health care for all Pennsylvanians .
We have also joined other groups in advocating for federal solutions .
But we have long recognized that providing quality , comprehensive , and affordable health care for all will not address all the gaps in public health and all the structural racism that is embedded in our system .
The vastly greater impact of the pandemic on people of color and immigrants has highlighted the tragic inequality that has its roots in slavery , Jim Crow , mass incarceration , and genocide .
As we continue to work for universal healthcare , we will take action to insure that the specific health needs of people of color and the immigrant community are addressed , partnering with NAACP , Make the Road and like - minded organizations .
Ending this inequality is a moral imperative , but also benefits everyone ’s health as the pandemic has made starkly clear .
Commandment Alert Level Punishment
2 . Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image Severe Genocide .
Entire cities with men , women , children and animals must be killed .
( See above . )
3 . Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain ; High Capital punishment
7 . Thou shalt not commit adultery .
High Capital punishment ( Leviticus 20:10 )
6 . Thou shalt not kill .
Elevated Capital punishment in some cases ( For killing Cain , Yes , for killing Abel , no : Genesis 4:15 . )
8 . Thou shalt not steal .

9 . Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
Low Despisement and scorn
A company spokesman praised staff who had " done a fantastic job "
Nearly 200 employees are to lose their jobs with the closure of a telephone call centre in Devon .
The 118-118 telephone directory inquiries centre in Plympton , Plymouth , is expected to close its doors in June .
The company , which has begun a 90 - day consultation period , said its 180 workers were being offered voluntary redundancy .
Some members of staff are being given the chance to apply for vacancies at 118 - 118 call centres in South Wales .
When the Plympton centre opened in 2003 , it employed 300 staff , but that number has fallen in the past year or so , with an increase in the number of people using the internet to access information .
Company spokesman William Ostrom said of the staff reaction : " They were n't necessarily surprised - we have reduced numbers somewhat in the past year - but it 's been quite a shock . "
Mr Ostrom praised the employees and said the Plympton call centre had been a " great success " since it opened seven years ago .
" They 've done a fantastic job , so I think they 're shocked and inevitably they face the prospect of losing their jobs , which nobody welcomes , " he added .
The teabaggers ' response ?
They want to build as broad a coalition as possible .
an in - depth study of 49 tea party leaders by the free - market oriented Sam Adams Alliance suggested that the leadership consciously avoids social issues and plans to continue doing so .
" None of them chose social issues as the sole direction for the movement , " said the group ’s marketing director , Anne Sorock , who oversaw the study .
She said that while many of the leaders held conservative views on social issues , " they were completely adamant that [ the issues ] were not a part of their agenda for the long term . "
" Across the board everyone had the same answer :
It ’s so important that they achieve their goals that social issues cannot distract them , because they need to cast the widest net of consensus with the widest group possible , " she said .
That sentiment probably explains the presence of GOProud at CPAC .
Additionally , a large segment of born - agains do n't like the teabaggers ' vitriol against Obama .
Remember last week , when Mark DeMoss closed his checkbook in response to the infamous " Joker " fundraising pitch from the RNC ?
Well , you 'd expect many younger evangelicals to be just as repelled .
But surprisingly , his sentiments are shared by many old - time religious right leaders .
Take Richard Land , for instance .
Land said liberals can be equally faulted for demonizing Sarah Palin , but said that if he were an RNC donor , he ’d stop giving .
" What [ liberal blogs ] do with Sarah is just really unacceptable and dastardly , but that does n’t mean we should respond in kind , " he said .
Obama , he said " provides a tremendously positive role model for tens of millions of African - American men " and " seems demonstrably fond of his wife and children , which is a positive role model for people of all ethnicities . "
" I would want to be free to attack the character of President Clinton — but this guy , he gives every indication of being a decent guy , " Land said .
I 've long thought that eventually , the Repubs will be torn apart by a spat between the neo-libertarians that seem to dominate the tea parties and the fundies .
If this article is at all accurate , the civil war in the GOP might be closer to getting underway .
On a hot summer evening two months ago in the Lebanese capital of Beirut , a catastrophic explosion ripped through the city .
It looked like a scene from a disaster movie , but it was very real .
Four Corners pieces together the story of the explosion , tracking down many of the people who filmed the blast as well as those who were dramatically shown on screen .
Using previously unseen footage , the program tracks the final minutes of the emergency responders who had no idea what they were walking into .
In this city with so many connections to Australia , the pain and grief is immense , as is their anger .
Suddenly there is a huge demand for earthworms , and people who are producing them are getting rich .
Suddenly there is a huge demand for earthworms , and people who are producing them are getting rich .
Suddenly there is a huge demand for earthworms , and people who are producing them are getting rich .
In a corner of Beed , one of the worst drought - affected areas of Maharashtra , seven women have found a traditional answer for the farmers ’ bugbear of debt : earthworms .
Lots of earthworms .
When she grew weary of her job as a cashier at a Bank of Baroda branch in 2001 , Asha Shivajirao Bhise studied various projects offered by the Ministry of Agriculture and settled on cultivating worms .
The incentives of the ministry were good and the project was not too popular .
She studied the vermicompost pilot project set up on the premises of the local agricultural office and decided that it was her calling .
In 2003 , armed with her VRS money and a loan from her bank ( a total of Rs 15 lakh ) , Bhise started her facility in Renapur , Latur , becoming the first woman to start a commercial vermicompost farm .
Along the way , Bhise was joined by six other women — all wives of farmers who wanted to supplement their family ’s meagre income .
Earthworms break down organic matter and enrich the soil .
Also , they improve the chances of water retention .
More importantly , when earthworms do what chemicals do , it is called organic — a lucrative adjective today .
So there are huge commercial rewards for mass producing earthworms efficiently .
At her model farm , fences ( essential to keep away mongoose , rats , frogs and snakes ) surround earthworm beds that are 2 ft wide mud racks layered with a 3 ft high bed of soyabean waste and cow dung ( the soyabean is replaceable with tur , urad , groundnut or moong waste ) .
While the waste is fodder for the worms , cow dung nurtures the soil and helps keep it cool when water is sprinkled .
The earthworm beds are located in a corner of her farm and are manned round the clock to ensure that worms do not escape from beds .
A plastic sheet is laid at the bottom of the bed and is covered with a pile of soil .
The sheet prevents the creatures from digging too deep into the soil .
The top layer of the bed is covered with earthworm fodder ( which includes just about everything in the vegetable market ) .
Bhise learnt that the beds needed constant sprinkling with water to keep them cool ; slight temperature changes can be fatal to worms .
She quickly figured that their prolific breeding rendered replenishing worm stock unnecessary .
She learnt the quiet messages they sent : the quantity of compost they produced indicated when breeding had started .
“ I bought about 110 kg of earthworms at Rs 800 per kg and set up the business .
Within 40 days of laying earthworm beds , I harvested 20 tonnes of compost .
All of it was picked up by farmers within days , ” says Bhise .
As a commodity , worms are recession - proof .
Sold at Rs 800 about four years ago , worms , depending on their quality and size , now fetch a market price of anything between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,500 a kg .
Yet , earthworm suppliers can barely keep up with demand .
When Bhise started out , she was laughed at .
No one believed that earthworms could generate money .
But now , “ Farmers are calling in from all corners of Maharashtra .
A majority of them want the ready compost but we encourage them to buy the earthworms too and teach them how to make the beds , ” says Bhise .
She receives at least 100 queries a month .
With multinationals offering more incentives and higher prices for organic produce , an increasing number of Maharashtra ’s farmers have turned to earthworms to net profits .
Since cosmetic and pharmaceutical companies began offering good money for organically grown aloe vera , there has been renewed interest in the project .
Using earthworms , an aloe vera grower can earn a substantial profit of up to Rs 25,000 per hectare on medium fertile soils per month .
Even on sub-marginal and marginal land unsuitable for most other commercial crops , profits from sale of aloe vera leaves can be as much as Rs 12,000 per hectare per month .
What makes them even more attractive is that earthworms are a one - time investment — they multiply freely .
A kilogram of worms ( anywhere from 600 to 800 worms ) produce up to 5,000 eggs a week .
Within six weeks of their birth , they are ready for reproduction .
Every seven to 10 days , an earthworm lays one egg capsule containing seven embryos .
At least three to seven worms emerge from one egg capsule .
The life span of an earthworm is two years .
Breeding has been so prolific that Bhise has not replenished her stock of worms since she began in 2003 .
She has also set up an earthworm wash unit to prepare organic pesticide from their excreta .
It acts as a natural pest repellant .
This too has high demand .
The state ’s agriculture department has offered incentives such as providing help in setting up the beds , guaranteeing earthworms at concessional rates and buying the vermicompost until they find buyers .
Also , the government is aware that the key to earthworm cultivation lies with women .
Backed by self - help groups , cultivation has become popular in rural areas .
Men might see its benefits , but are hamstrung by their standing in society .
( Since cow dung is the main ingredient used in the earthworm pits , upper - caste farmers are unwilling to touch it .
Traditionally , cow dung is handled by lower castes in many rural areas . )
There are no such reservations among women .
“ Women have no problems touching cow dung as they plaster their houses and courtyards with it .
Hence more women are cultivating earthworms , ” Bhise says .
According to experts , the erosion of soil nutrients and general land degeneration are also responsible for farmers ’ newfound love for earthworms .
Nareshbhai Bhaskar Save of Save Farms in Umergaon , a Mumbai suburb , is a major earthworm cultivator .
“ Earthworm cultivation is helping in soil regeneration .
The size and quality of the produce is much better than the ones grown with chemicals , ” Save says .
He adds that his consultancy is also popularising the concept of earthworm cultivation .
While private promotion of earthworm cultivation has an effect , there ’s nothing like a good governmental diktat .
When the Pune municipality made it compulsory for all housing societies , hotels and restaurants to develop vermicompost pits , demand for earthworms exploded .
The civic body reasoned that scarcity of land for garbage disposal had made it expensive to transport garbage to the city ’s outskirts .
It believed that earthworms would ease the burden by feeding on wet garbage , and turning it into compost .
“ I help them set up the pits , ” says Vishnu Najan , a Pune - based earthworm cultivator .
“ I sell them for Rs 500 to Rs 800 per kg , as the market is just picking up in Pune . ”
The price of earthworms is lower in urban areas as city people are reluctant to pay higher prices .
“ A farmer knows the importance of the earthworm , whereas many people in cities have never seen them .
There is a need for sustained campaigns on vermiculture and its importance in urban areas . ”
Najan sees the business of earthworm cultivation getting bigger as people become more organically conscious .
Today , Bhise and her team are on a mission to help women in Maharashtra ’s interiors understand earthworm economics and set up their own cultivation pits .
Backed by the agriculture department , their project has found numerous takers among farmers in the states of Orissa , Bihar , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh .
They all feel that this is n’t a passing phase .
A growing awareness and sensitivity towards lifestyles , quality of life , and sources of food have made earthworms more important than ever before .
And as the old makes way for the new , the growing tribe that believes in this revolution says that it ’s here to stay .
Is Apple Evil ?
Today ’s iPad introduction has to be about the most depressing Apple product launch I ’ve ever watched .
As has been noted , Jobs ’ Reality Distortion Field only works when he believes in what he ’s selling and he did n’t seem to really believe in this .
The audience must have further added to the disappointment , expecting a revolutionary product and only getting an oversized iPhone ( iPod touch , actually ) .
That ’s not to say the iPad wo n’t sell , or that I do n’t want one .
The scariest thing is that I think it probably will .
It ’s clear that Apple plans for the iPhone OS to be the future of its product line .
And that ’s scary because the iPhone OS is designed for Apple ’s total control .
A lot of people have argued that requiring Apple to approve every application for the iPhone OS is some kind of “ mistake ” , something they ’ll remedy as soon as they realize how bad things have gotten .
But recent events —
Phil Schiller ’s personal interventions , comments on their call to analysts , etc. — have made it clear it ’s not a mistake at all .
It ’s their plan .
The iPad is their attempt to extend this total control to what ’s traditionally been thought of as the computer space .
This is just the first step , but it ’s not hard to imagine Apple doing their best to phase out the Macintosh in the next decade , just as they phased out OS 9 .
In their ideal world , all computing will be done on the iPhone OS .
And the iPhone OS will only run software that they specifically approve .
No Flash or other alternate runtimes , no one - off apps or open source customizations .
Just total control by Apple .
It ’s a frightening future .
I do n’t know why they ’re doing it .
It ’s hard to see how it makes them more money .
( Curating all those apps must be expensive , not to mention the lost sales from the unapproved ones . )
I can only presume it ’s a result of Jobs ’ megalomaniacal need for control — not only does the hardware have to be flawless , the software must be too .
And the only way to ensure that is to have Apple approve every inch of it .
I love Apple products .
I ’m a huge Apple fan .
I ’d buy an iPad right now if I could .
But , for the first time , I ’ve got a real sinking feeling in my stomach .

One day after being sworn into office , President Barack Obama instructed federal agencies to ensure government transparency by complying with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act law .
“ All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure , in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA , and to usher in a new era of open Government , ” Obama wrote in a memo to federal agencies Jan. 21 , 2009 .
“ The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA . ”

“ The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public , ” the newly - installed president continued .
“ They should not wait for specific requests from the public .
All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and down by their Government .
Disclosure should be timely . ”
One year later , Obama ’s requests for transparency have apparently gone unheeded .
In fact a provision in the Freedom of Information Act law that allows the government to hide records that detail its internal decision - making has been invoked by Obama agencies more often in the past year than during the final year of President George W. Bush .
Major agencies cited that exemption to refuse records at least 70,779 times during the 2009 budget year , compared with 47,395 times during President George W. Bush ’s final full budget year , according to annual FOIA reports filed by federal agencies .
An Associated Press review of Freedom of Information
Act reports filed by 17 major agencies found that the use of nearly every one of the law ’s nine exemptions to withhold information from the public rose in fiscal year 2009 , which ended last October .
The AP review comes on the heels of another bit of government transparency news : that the Obama Administration has threatened to veto a congressional intelligence bill because it objects to efforts to increase intelligence oversight .
ADVERTISEMENT
Among other things , the proposed legislation would subject intelligence agencies to General Accountability Office review .
US intelligence agencies are currently immune from review by the Congressional auditing office .
Departments used the government decision making exemption more even though Obama ’s Justice Department told agencies to that disclosing such records was “ fully consistent with the purpose of the FOIA , ” a law intended to keep government accountable to the public .
For example , the Federal Aviation Administration cited the exemption in refusing the AP ’s FOIA request for internal memos on its decisions about a database showing incidents in which airplanes and birds collided .
The FAA initially tried to withhold the bird - strike database from the public , but later released it under pressure .
ADVERTISEMENT
The FAA claimed the same exemption to hold back nearly all records on its approval of an Air Force One flyover of New York City for publicity shots — a flight that prompted fears in the city of a Sept. 11 - style attack .
It also withheld internal communications during the aftermath of the public relations gaffe .
In all , major agencies cited that or other FOIA exemptions to refuse information at least 466,872 times in budget year 2009 , compared with 312,683 times the previous year , the review found .
Agencies often cite more than one exemption when withholding part or all of the material sought in an open - records request .
ADVERTISEMENT
All told , the 17 agencies reviewed by AP reported getting 444,924 FOIA requests in fiscal 2009 , compared with 493,610 in fiscal 2008 . ”
The AP examined the 2008 and 2009 budget year FOIA reports from the departments of Agriculture , Commerce , Defense , Education , Energy , Health and Human Services , Homeland Security , Housing and Urban Development , Interior , Justice , Labor , State , Transportation , Treasury and Veterans Affairs ; the Environmental Protection Agency ; and the Federal Reserve Board .
Other FOIA exemptions cover information on national defense and foreign relations , internal agency rules and practices , trade secrets , personal privacy , law enforcement proceedings , supervision of financial institutions and geological information on wells .

One , known as Exemption 3 , covers dozens of types of information that Congress shielded from disclosure when passing other laws .

The Ynot Project
Ynot is a library for the Coq proof assistant which turns it into a full - fledged environment for writing and verifying imperative programs .
In the tradition of the Haskell IO monad , Ynot axiomatizes a parameterized monad of imperative computations , where the type of a computation tells you not only what type of data it returns , but also what Hoare - logic - style precondition and postcondition it satisfies .
On top of the simple axiomatic base , the library defines a separation logic .
Specialized automation tactics are able to discharge automatically most proof goals about separation - style formulas that describe heaps , meaning that building a certified Ynot program is often not much harder than writing that program in Haskell .
Ynot makes it easy to enhance its automation with support for new predicates describing new data structures , and , since all such enhancements must be proved from first principles , extensibility does not require users to trust more code .
All of Coq 's traditional theorem - proving tools are available by default as well .
Thus ,
Ynot enables effective proof - based software engineering , from simple memory safety of low - level imperative programs to deep correctness theorems about programs like compilers that may use imperative data structures for efficiency .
The Ynot project is supported in part by NSF Grant 0702345 , entitled Collaborative Research : Integrating Types and Verification , by NSF Grant 0910660 , entitled Combining Foundational and Lightweight Formal Methods to Build Certifiably Dependable Software , and by a gift from Microsoft Research .

The Marriage of Dependent Types and Effects ( Invited talk at TLCA '07 )
Next Generation Type Systems ( Invited talk at Microsoft Cambridge 's 10th Anniversary )
( CNN ) -- A Pennsylvania man attempted to resuscitate " a road - killed opossum , " state police say .
But this was one possum who was n't playing possum -- the ugly creature remained dead .
Troopers responding to the scene in Oliver Township on Thursday determined that Donald J. Wolfe , 55 , of Brookville , was drunk , according to the police report .
Several witnesses observed Wolfe 's failed resurrection of the flattened marsupial , police said .
It was not immediately clear how he endeavored to restore the possum 's life .
The arresting officer in the incident was unavailable for comment Friday .
Attempts to reach Wolfe were also unsuccessful .
Wolfe will be charged with one charge of public drunkenness , police said .
A little - noticed letter from Yahoo ! to the US Marshals Service offers troubling insight into the surveillance policies of one of the Internet ’s largest email providers .
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking details of Yahoo’s !
policies allowing the Justice Department to request wiretaps of its users and the amount they charge US taxpayers per wiretap — the search engine leviathan declared in a 12 - page letter that they could n’t provide information on their approach because their pricing scheme would “ shock ” customers .
The news was first reported by Kim Zetter at Wired .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It is reasonable to assume from these comments that the [ pricing ] information , if disclosed , would be used to “ shame ” Yahoo !
and other companies — and to “ shock ” their customers , ” a lawyer for the company writes .
“ Therefore , release of Yahoo ! ’s information is reasonably likely to lead to impairment of its reputation for protection of user privacy and security , which is a competitive disadvantage for technology companies . ”
Yahoo !
also argues that because their price sheet for wiretaps was “ voluntarily submitted ” to the US Marshals Service , it is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act law .
Verizon , meanwhile , says ( letter PDF ) they can’t provide details on how much they charge for wiretaps because it would be “ confusing . ”
“ Customers may see a listing of records , information or assistance that is available only to law enforcement , ” Verizon writes , “ but call in to Verizon and seek those same services .
Such calls would stretch limited resources , especially those that are reserved only for law enforcement emergencies . ”
Consumers might “ become unnecessarily afraid that their lines have been tapped or call Verizon to ask if their lines are tapped ( a question we cannot answer ) , ” the telecom giant adds .
ADVERTISEMENT
Verizon also revealed it “ receives tens of thousands of requests for customer records , or other customer information from law enforcement . ”
The Freedom of Information request was filed by muckraker Christopher Soghoian .
“ Assuming a conservative estimate of 20,000 requests per year , Verizon alone receives more requests from law enforcement per year than can be explained by any published surveillance statistics , ” Soghoian responds .
“ That does n’t mean the published stats are necessarily incorrect — merely that most types of surveillance are not reported .

“ In the summer of 2009 , I decided to try and follow the money trail in order to determine how often Internet firms were disclosing their customers ’ private information to the government , ” he adds later .
“ I theorized that if I could obtain the price lists of each ISP , detailing the price for each kind of service , and invoices paid by the various parts of the Federal government , then I might be able to reverse engineer some approximate statistics .
In order to obtain these documents , I filed Freedom of Information Act requests with every part of the Department of Justice that I could think of . ”
Cox Communications , meanwhile , says they charge “ $ 2,500 to fulfill a pen register / trap - and - trace order for 60 days , and $ 2,000 for each additional 60 - day - interval , ” Zetter notes .
“ It charges $ 3,500 for the first 30 days of a wiretap , and $ 2,500 for each additional 30 days .
Thirty days worth of a customer ’s call detail records costs $ 40 . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Comcast ’s pricing list , ” she adds , “ which was already leaked to the internet in 2007 , indicated that it charges at least $ 1,000 for the first month of a wiretap , and $ 750 per month thereafter . ”

The British developed title headed off strong competition from Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves that led the nomination field before the ceremony .
The game , which sees the superhero tackle a series of old foes in the asylum setting , also picked up the Bafta award for best gameplay .
Despite not winning the best game award , Uncharted 2 did take four other awards including best action and story .
Title race
The Bafta awards is one of the biggest nights in the UK gaming calendar .
The winners of 14 of the categories are chosen by industry figures .
One award , sponsored by high - street store Game , is chosen by gamers .
As widely expected Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 took that title .
The sales that Modern Warfare 2 racked up in 2009 made it the biggest selling game of all time .
Assassin's Creed II was nominated in a total of seven categories but managed to win none of them .
The video game Baftas also saw success for another British - developed title LittleBigPlanet .
Originally created by Surrey - based Media Molecule , it won the best award for best handheld game .
The portable version was produced by an in - house development team at Sony .

About This Game
Next generation co-op action gaming from the makers of Half - Life , Portal , Team Fortress and Counter - Strike .
Over 20 new weapons & items headlined by over 10 melee weapons – axe , chainsaw , frying pan , baseball bat – allow you to get up close with the zombies
New survivors .
New Story .
New dialogue .
Five expansive campaigns for co-operative , Versus and Survival game modes .
An all new multiplayer mode .
Uncommon common infected .
Each of the five new campaigns contains at least one new uncommon common zombies which are exclusive to that campaign .
AI Director 2.0 : Advanced technology dubbed  The AI Director drove L4D 's unique gameplay – customizing enemy population , effects , and music , based upon the players ’ performance .
L4D 2 features  The AI Director 2.0  which expands the Director ’s ability to customize level layout , world objects , weather , and lighting to reflect different times of day .
Stats , rankings , and awards system drives collaborative play
Set in the zombie apocalypse , Left 4 Dead 2 ( L4D2 ) is the highly anticipated sequel to the award - winning Left 4 Dead , the # 1 co-op game of 2008 .
This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities , swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South , from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns .
You 'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons .
In addition to firearms , you 'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage - creating melee weapons , from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan .
You 'll be putting these weapons to the test against ( or playing as in Versus ) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected .
You 'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected , including the terrifying Mudmen .
Helping to take L4D 's frantic , action - packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0 .
This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you 'll fight through and the pathways you 'll take , in addition to tailoring the enemy population , effects , and sounds to match your performance .
L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played , custom - fitted to your style of play .
Save the script as ' pyline ' somewhere on your path , e.g. /usr / local / bin/ pyline , and make it executable ( e.g. chmod +x /usr/local / bin/ pyline ) .
When working at the command line , it 's very useful to pipe multiple commands together .
Common tools used in pipes include ' head ' ( show the top lines of a file ) , ' tail ' ( show the bottom lines ) , ' grep ' ( search the text for a pattern ) , ' sed ' ( reformat the text ) , etc .
However , Python is found lacking in this regard , because it's hard to write the kind of one - liner that works well in an ad - hoc pipe statement .
Pyline tries to solve this problem .
Use pyline to apply a Python expression to every line of standard input , and return a value to be sent to standard output .
The expression can use any installed Python modules .
In the context of the expression , the variable " line " holds the string value of the line ; " words " is a list of all the non-empty , space - separated words ; and " num " is the line number ( starting with 1 ) .
Here are a couple examples :
Print out the first 20 characters of every line in the tail of my Apache access log :
tail access_log | pyline " line [ : 20 ] "
Print just the URLs in the access log ( the seventh " word " in the line ) :
tail access_log | pyline " words [ 6 ] "
Here 's a tricker one , showing how to do an import .
List the current directory , showing only files that are larger than 1 kilobyte :
ls | pyline -m os " os.path.isfile ( line ) and os.stat( line ) .st_size > 1024 and line "
I did n't say it was pretty . ;-)
The " - m a , b , c " option will import modules a , b and c for use in the subsequent expression .
The " isfile and stat and line " form shows how to do filtering : if an expression returns a False or None value , then no line is sent to stdout .
This last tricky example re-implements the ' md5sum ' command , to return the MD5 digest values of all the .py files in the current directory .
ls *.py | pyline -m md5 " ' %s %s ' % ( md5.new( file( line ) .read ( ) ) .hexdigest ( ) , line ) "
Hopefully you get the idea .
I 've found it to be an invaluable addition to my command - line toolkit .
Windows users : it works under Windows , but name it " pyline.py " instead of " pyline " , and call it via a batch file so that the piping works properly .

I liked this funny and recursive brain diagram from tech journalist Quinn Norton that makes fun of our tendency to be wowed by brain scans .
The diagram has a good evidence base .
A 2008 study found that adding a picture of a brain scan to a scientific argument about human nature made the general public more likely to be believe it even if brain activity was n’t relevant to the point being made .
Another study published in the same year found that simply adding an irrelevant sentence about the brain had a similar effect .
Thankfully , Norton has now located the brain area responsible for our problem with understanding bogus neuroscience explanations .

The opening lines of the satirical novel “ Max Havelaar ” are so well - known in Dutch that even a relatively new arrival to the Netherlands , with scant knowledge of the country ’s literary tradition , can recite them by memory : “ Ik ben makelaar in koffie , en woon op de Lauriergracht , no . 37 . ” Translation : “ I am a coffee broker , and live at No. 37 Lauriergracht . ”
A simple declarative statement to open up one of the first works in any language to bring an exploitative colonial system under moral scrutiny ; the novel has since become a cornerstone of the literary tradition of the Netherlands .
Eduard Douwes Dekker , or Multatuli as he is known , finished writing the book 150 years ago .
This year , a couple of events mark that anniversary .
Perhaps most importantly , a new Dutch translation of the work , by Gijsbert Van Es , is on bookshelves , intended to bridge the gap between the 19th - century language used in the original publishing and the Dutch youth of today .
More accessible to those of us without a grounding in Dutch literature is an exhibition devoted to the novel at the University of Amsterdam ’s Bijzondere Collecties special collection ( 129 Oude Turfmarkt ) .
It runs through May 16 .
The show places the book and its author in the context of the colonization process that had overtaken what is now Indonesia .
Some of the rooms feature artifacts from 19th - century Indonesia ( then called the Dutch East Indies ) , breathing life into the characters that inspired the writer .
Alongside those are explanations of the history of Indonesia ’s colonial period .
Some of the juxtapositions combine eras :
There is a profile of Prince Diponegoro , who led a bloody 19th - century rebellion , next to one devoted to Dekker ’s wife .
There are plenty of drawings and etchings based on the characters — the fictional coffee broker and narrator , Batavus Droogstoppel , who sports mutton chops , a bowler hat and a smug smile — and press dispatches marking the sensation “ Max Havelaar ” caused when first released .
Though the displays and accompanying text are all in Dutch , the exhibition is a fascinating one for visitors : an invitation into the conscience of a former colonial power , still sifting through a murky past , via the pen of one of its most acclaimed writers .
Die Geschichte von der Kellnerin , die 109 Euro weniger verdient als ein Hartz - IV - Empfänger , ist eine Geschichte voller Missverständnisse , die nicht nur von staunenden Medien , sondern auch von einem kommentarfreudigen Außenminister handelt :
Es war einmal am 6 .
Februar ein Artikel in der “ Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung ” , der besagte , im Niedriglohnbereich hätten bestimmte Arbeitnehmer am Monatsende weniger in der Tasche als ein vergleichbarer Hartz - IV - Empfänger .
Obwohl die “ FAZ ” bei diesen Berechnungen wichtige Faktoren außer Acht gelassen hatte ( BILDblog berichtete ) , wurden diese unvollständigen Zahlen von zahlreichen Medien unter grob vereinfachenden Schlagzeilen wie “ Diese Jobs bringen weniger Geld als Hartz IV ” ( “ Welt Online ” ) oder “ In diesen Branchen lohnt sich die Arbeit nicht mehr ! ” ( Bild.de ) weiterverbreitet .
Aus letztgenanntem “ Bild ” - Artikel wiederum bediente sich laut einem FDP - Sprecher Guido Westerwelle für seinen mittlerweile legendären Kommentar in der “ Welt ” .
Um die Gefahr des Abdriftens in “ spätrömische Dekadenz ” zu unterstreichen , nannte der FDP - Chef das Beispiel einer verheirateten Kellnerin mit zwei Kindern , die angeblich 109 Euro weniger verdient als ein Hartz - IV - Empfänger — denn genauso stand es in der Tabelle mit den unvollständig berechneten Zahlen , die “ Bild ” aus dem “ FAZ ” - Artikel übernommen hatte .
Es folgten ein großes Medienecho und eine hitzige Debatte über alles mögliche , nur nicht über den Wahrheitsgehalt der Westerwelle ’schen Beispielrechnung .
Als Anfang März der Paritätische Wohfahrtsverband eine Gegenstudie veröffentlichte , in der die Zahlen der “ FAZ ” widerlegt wurden , berichteten verschiedene Medien darüber — so auch “ Die Welt ” .
Dort stand unter anderem , dass Ulrich Schneider , der Hauptgeschäftsführer des Paritätischen Wohlfahrtsverbandes , beklagte , Guido Westerwelle berufe sich auf “ äußerst dubiose Rechenbeispiele ” ( BILDblog berichtete ) .
Für “ Welt ” und andere Medien ein Anlass , diese Vorwürfe zu überprüfen ?
Nein .
Erst als zu Beginn dieser
Woche – und damit über sechs
Wochen nach dem ersten “ FAZ ” - Bericht – eine kleine Anfrage der Partei “ Die Linke ” ergab , dass Westerwelles Rechenbeispiel nicht stimmig ist , berichtet “ Welt Online ” — wieder ohne selbst nachzuprüfen :
FDP - Chef Guido Westerwelle ist nach einem Zeitungsbericht zu Beginn seiner Hartz - IV - Debatte im Februar von falschen Voraussetzungen ausgegangen .
Und wenn die Journalisten noch nicht gemerkt haben , dass sie das alles erst möglich gemacht haben , dann tappen sie noch heute im Dunkeln .
Mit Dank an Gesine D .

Not wanting to rain on any parades , but I 'm trying to remember what Judge

One was the " bad faith " and specific performance .
This has been
mooted by the jury verdict I assume .

Does n't the issue of what copyrights are " required " as a matter of
contract , and specific performance , now go to the court though ie Judge
Stewart ?
Or did the jury also decide that no copyrights were " required " as a
matter of contract - specific performance was definitely for the court .
The
copyrights may not be worth very much of course if Novell have in the meantime
open - sourced them .
SCO also have the problem that specific performance would
probably be denied as they have failed on their side of the contract , namely
handing over the Sun money .

Ok , the jury has reached the decision which we know to be the correct one .
And I must admit , now I 'm a bit glad that Judge Stewart was so ( IMO unfairly ) kind to SCO in several of his decisions , because that obviously make it harder for SCO to win any appeal , or even to convince their chapter 11 Trustee that an appeal would be worthwhile to attempt .
But still , it is n't really over before the deadline for filing an appeal has passed , is it ? [ Reply to This | # ]

Is that all ?
What about the other questions the jury were

It seems fairly logical that they would also vote " not
guilty " on those , but how did it actually play out ?
Is it correct that SCO now got 20 days to come up with a
story to the judge ?
So final judgement can at earliest be in
a month or so .

There are still some loose ends to

If I were a SCO stockholder , I 'd be looking to make somebody pay for the way all
of the value had been stripped out of this company by the way that the
executives have pursued this particular folly -- particularly in light of some
of the things that they knew when they began taking this course .
For example , the lack of any real evidence of copied code , the lack of any
transferred copyrights , etc. etc .
SCO executives all seem to have personally done quite nicely thank you out of
this little scam .

Yes , Stewart has to make that ruling however I would be shocked if he found for
SCOX on specific performance .
He heard all the testimony , specifically from the
lawyers who were actually involved in writing & negotiating the APA and
Amendment 2 - those were Novell 's lawyers , SCOX apparently could n't ' find ' or
decided not to bring the action Santa Cruz lawyers .
Major hole to fill there ,

I 'd like to think this seemingly never - ending campaign has

But I 'm not so sure with SCO being SCO ,
they will probably try anything to soldier on .
What are the rules for appeals in federal cases ?
From the
apparent pro-SCO bias of the judge 's rulings and the jury
ruling 100 % against SCO in spite of that it seems their
prospects of having anything overturned are slim or
nonexisting , but can they actually do it ?

This is going to make SCO v's IBM interesting .
As Novell owned the copyrights when SCO sued IBM , the APA kicks back in and
Novell 's instruction that SCO can not pursue IBM as well .
So I guess all that 's left is IBM 's ICBM 's of a counter - claim . :-)

ones Caldera / SCO developed on their own .
There might be a viable legitimate business in there but it's hard to see how he
can start another litigation terror campaign .
Essentially he loaned SCO some of the money he took out of the company and it
might be viewed as a sort of recovery .
I 'd love to see the verdict form , with what the jury actually decided .

" What a waste of money this all has been , and if the only folks who get
paid in the end are Cahn 's lawyers and SCO 's lawyers , something is seriously
rotten in this picture . "
Darl McBride got paid .
Oh he might not have gotten the MILLIONS he dreamed of .
But he got his 6 digit salary plus bonuses .
Ralph Yarro got paid .
He sold stock when the stock price peaked .
He made millions .
Many of the other executives got paid who worked at SCO and Canopy group .
So , ok they did n't rake in what they were looking for .
But there were many many
involved that got paid more than I will make in my lifetime .
And most of them will move on to some other scam er job making even more money .
If everything ended today , this would in no way be justice .
It will not be
justice unless those that propigated this scam are made personally responsible
and restitution is required .
It wo n't happen , corporate protection and all that .
But although legally a
coporation is a " person " , it is an abstract entity .
It can die and go
away and the people who made the actual real decisions in the corporation simply
move on while real people get hurt .
So did justice prevail .
No .
But a large part of the injustice was finally
stopped .
What a bitter sweet victory .

SCO does not believe there should be any confusion as to ownership of the UNIX

It clearly purchased these from Novell in 1995 as is evidenced in
the Asset Purchase Agreement and Amendment 2 with Novell ( see

Former U.S. District Judge Edward Cahn , the trustee for SCO 's bankruptcy filed
in Delaware , said the company is " deeply disappointed " in the jury 's
verdict in the dispute over which company owned the copyrights to Unix , which is
widely used in business computing .
But Cahn said SCO intends to continue its lawsuit against IBM , in which the
computer giant is accused of using Unix code to make the Linux operating system
a viable competitor , causing a decline in SCO 's revenues .
" The copyright claims are gone , but we have other claims based on
contracts , " Cahn said .

Does this verdict impact the chances that the Supreme Court will review the
Appeals court ruling that a vague document can transfer copyrights ?
Will the SCOTUS now look at it and say " Well , the Jury said no transfer
anyway , so no point in making precedent "

Thank you for your long persistence in this matter .
I hope you will continue to abide by the terms of the Gnu Public Licence ( GPL ) upon which so much of your legal defense relied upon .
I wish you could continue to show such great fortitude in confronting current threats to the Linux / Open source / Free Software ecosystem ( see website ) .
Quote from website
< blockquote > The SCO Group has entered into a series of essentially inherently flawed lawsuits and fraudulent license claims against users of the Linux operating system .
Since 1994 , Caldera International and the Santa Cruz Operation have been accepting , profiting from and distributing software developed by hundreds of independent developers under the terms of the GPL and LGPL license .
The SCO Group has failed to put forward any sustainable legal theory why it should not abide by the terms of the GPL license .
Detailed investigation into other facts and evidence which regularly conflict with the SCO Group 's various legal claims , filing , press and public statements , raises serous questions which can no longer be explained away by a lack of competence in either the SCO Group 's CEOs or the SCO Group 's legal representation .
There is now increasing evidence that Microsoft has been indirectly financing -- to the point of sustaining -- the SCO Group 's campaign against Linux .
Disclosed internal email memos back up by recent filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that at least a third of SCO 's entire market capitalization , and their entire current cash reserve , is payoffs funnelled from Microsoft .
The relationship between Microsoft , the SCO Group and the SCO Group 's recent financial backers requires immediate investigation by all agencies entrusted with providing the consumer with protection from abusive business practices and monopolies .

This was the question on my mind when I first heard the news though this article
sheds some light .
It seems to me continuing the IBM litigation is very much a
suicide march .
If SCO has no demonstratable copyright " standing " , any
and all contract issues already fully goto Novell control per the existing
contracts , simple as that .
At most , all that SCO can accomplish is seeing how
many of IBM 's counterclaims get validated in court .
In a way it is a shame that Novell 's Slander of title claim died before the jury
got to decide , although clearly , given the limited time and the immensely tilted
field they were on , Novell choose the right things to focus on .

V .
SCOS ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
If the APA , as amended , somehow failed to transfer the UNIX and UnixWare
copyrights , SCO clearly would be entitled to compel the transfer of copyrights
required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX
and UnixWare technologies .
If SCO only received an implied license to the
copyrights , SCO would not be able to exercise the rights it indisputably
acquired under Items II and III of the Assets Schedule to bring claims under the
UNIX and UnixWare Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
SCO needed ownership of
the copyrights to bring such claims , as Novell itself acknowledged by asserting
ownership of the copyrights precisely to foreclose SCOs contract claims against
IBM .
The evidence will show that ( 1 ) SCOs capacity to bring claims to enforce the
UNIX and UnixWare copyrights is an integral and necessary component of operating
the UNIX and UnixWare licensing businesses , ( 2 ) SCOs copyright claims against
IBM were premised on UNIX and UnixWare copyrights existing as of the execution
of the APA , and ( 3 ) such copyrights covered all of the technology in UNIX and
the majority of the technology in UnixWare .
Contrary to Novells prior argument , moreover , Amendment No. 2 does not compel
SCO to show that it was unable to operate its business without suing IBM in
particular , but even if it did , SCO easily meets the standard .
If SCO were
unable to pursue or recover on those claims against IBM , SCO would be unable to
exercise the rights in the entire UNIX business , which includes the right to
pursue claims to protect misuse of the UNIX and UnixWare source code .

On the surface SCO seems to be plain crazy pursuing this litigation against
obvious odds .
But what if that isnt the objective .
What if microsoft is using
this to divert attention while it quietly pursues its more sinister plans :
bashing open source in europe .
hedging open source projects in with patents to
block their development options ( see sudo patent as an example ) , bullying
companies to sign patent protection agreements etc .
If that is microsofts plan
then they will want this litigation to go on and on until the last possible
moment .
Someone very big is underwriting this litigation .
For example , even the
way that the trustee has swung in line with the litigation speaks of big
personal rewards .
SCO isnt in a position to offer those rewards .
the elephant in
the drawing room is .
I think whether SCO loses is almost inconsequential to the
objectives behind the litigation ( an unexpected bonus if they did win ) .
i'm sure
the boies boys are being well remunerated by somebody for all their effort .

This inspired me to go back and look at a few items from Court Rules : Novell owns the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights !
Novell has right to waive !
I 'm savoring such gems from Judge Kimballs decision as ... the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights .
Therefore , SCO 's First Claim for Relief for slander of title and Third Claim for specific performance are dismissed , as are the copyright ownership portions of SCO 's Fifth Claim for Relief for unfair competition and Second Claim for Relief for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing .
The court denies SCO 's cross-motion for summary judgment on its own slander of title , breach of contract , and unfair competition claims , and on Novell 's slander of title claim .
And ... Novell is entitled to a declaration of rights under its Fourth Claim for Relief that it was and is entitled , at its sole discretion , to direct SCO to waive its claims against IBM and Sequent , and SCO is obligated to recognize Novell 's waiver of SCO 's claims against IBM and Sequent ...
And who could forget PJ 's pithy comment :
That 's Aaaaall , Folks !
The court also ruled that " SCO is obligated to recognize Novell 's waiver of SCO 's claims against IBM and Sequent " .
That 's the ball game .
There are a couple of loose ends , but the big picture is , SCO lost .
Oh , and it owes Novell a lot of money from the Microsoft and Sun licenses .
It does my heart good to have all that stuff re-affirmed .
Break out the chocolate and scotch , honey , I 'm comin ' home to celebrate .

Here 's one thing that remains , that will absolutely kill Cahn 's dreams of continuing the IBM case .
2 . The judge should decide SCO 's breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing , Novell 's claim for declaratory judgment regarding the waiver , and SCO 's claim for specific performance .
Footnote 1 indicates the parties dispute what is left to be tried by anybody on the good faith claim .
Remember , these issues are still before the judge .
When he rules that Novell has the rights as listed in the contract , regarding the waiver , SCO can no longer pursue the IBM case .
Novell is going to get the court to say so .
I do n't know why Cahn thinks he can , has he not followed this litigation ?
He 's an ex-judge .
How can he be so blind ?
The IBM case is going nowhere .

If you have n't actually taken the time to compare the Linux code base and Unix Sys V. Please be willing to consider spending the resources to do that .
With those results in hand , you can put forth an official press release as an owner of the copyrights clearing stating whether or not Linux infringes .
This would be a serious step in the direction of preventing a future would - be SCOG from ever attempting to use Unix in the same fashion again .
It would also be a significant step in clearing the FUD about Linux .
After all ... the copyright owner is in the most official position to be able to Legally analyze and clear someone else of copyright infringement :) RAS [ Reply to This | # ]

Question : How can SCO go after IBM ?
I mean sure they can plan to , or say a lot
of things but the fact is Novell has already told them to back off .
Novell has
now confirmed their right to tell SCO to back off IBM or anyone else over Unix .

Truth is as the Tide , as the Sea , as the great Oceans of this Earth .
Every
child , woman and man can escape the ebb and flow for some while , this is facile .
None can command the ebb and flow , this is impossible .
SCOG and the mysterious backers are as Canute .
They have averted the ebb and
flow , and so they delude themselves that they may command the ebb and flow , they
cannot .
SCOG will drown soon , before I suffer from most of the pains of old
age .
The mysterious backers will drown later , perhaps before my children will
suffer from most the pains of old age , I hope .
The struggle will be life long , it will have to pass through the generations , it
is worthwhile beyond mesaurement , it is the duty of all us who aspire to be free
women and men , who begin to understand what it means to be free , it is our duty
for our children , and our childrens ' children , ...

A wicked witch was brought in to run an ailing company that distributed a
version of GNU / Linux .
The company also had a UNIX business that it had purchased .
The wicked witch saw some similarities between Linux and UNIX and said that much
of Linux was copied from UNIX .
The wicked witch ignored everyone that tried to say that Linux code was either
original or copied legally from UNIX .
Despite being the head of a company specialising in both Linux and UNIX , the
wicked witch never revealed any significant details of the alleged infringment .
On the basis of the UNIX purchase agreement that said that all copyrights were
excluded from the sale , he demanded payment for the right to use Linux .
When told that the copyrights had not been transferred the wicked witch sued for
slander of title and lost .
Meanwhile the wicked witch had started lots of other court cases and bankrupted
the company .
The wicked witch lost the job of running the company ...
... and the penguin and the GNU lived happily ever after .

Stupid layman 's questions :
SCO stole Novell 's share of the MS and Sun licenses .
Given that ruling , which
the 10th Circuit upheld , why would n't Novell be entitled to withhold its end of
the bargain ( the copyrights ) until SCO upholds its end of the bargain ( the
license fees ) ?
Is n't the conversion a breach of contract ?

Either they can prove a jury misconduct ( e.g. a jury

error by the judge ( e.g. refusing to let them bring some
evidence / testimony ) .
I do n't think that either one will be

The SCO Group argues their demand for the alleged " UNIX copyrights "
under schedule 1.1 ( g ) of the amended APA :
" II .
All of Seller 's claims arising after the Closing Date against any
parties relating to any right , property or asset included in the
Business . "
This is a lost cause under the jury 's verdict , which has clearly stated that the
amended APA did not convey the alleged " UNIX copyrights " as a property
or asset in the Business acquired by the Santa Cruz Operation .
" III All of Seller 's rights pertaining to UNIX and UnixWare under any
software development contracts , licenses and any other contracts to which Seller
is a party or by which it is bound and which pertain to the Business ( to the
extent that such contracts are assignable ) , including without limitation :
A. Joint Development with third parties :
1 . In - process development agreements
2 . Past development agreements with on - going pricing discounts
3 . Past development agreements without ongoing pricing discounts
4. Joint development agreements in which Seller did n't get full rights to
the code developed .
B. Third Party Software license agreements --
Those agreements in which Seller
pays per copy fees for technology / products which are shipped with or to be used
with UNIX System and / or UnixWare .
C. Joint marketing agreements -- Marketing programs with customers .
D. End user MLA agreements -- Agreements to allow end users to copy binary
products for internal use only .
Associated with these agreements are support
requirements .
E. UNIX - only VAR agreements -- UNIX Master VARs
F. Support agreements - End user support agreements ( i.e. TMAC , NALCOMIS )
G. Microsoft agreement ( Xenix Agreement ) - Xenix compatibility and per copy fee
agreement .
Seller will agree to discuss with SCO Seller 's interpretation of this
agreement .
H. Microsoft Agreement ( Extra - Ordinary Discount ) - Microsoft 's additional
discount beyond 50 %
I. Strategic Relationship Agreements ( i.e. MTA , ECPA , MBA , etc. )
J. Out - sourced development ( i.e. India ) - Development agreements with third
parties Wipro and HCL ) and Infix Development Center .
IDC is a Seller
subsidiary .
K. Out - sourced Support Agreements
L. Software and Sublicensing Agreements -
This includes the source codes and
sublicensing agreements that Seller has with its OEM , End User and Educational
customers .
The total number of these agreements is approximately 30,000 .
M. OEM Binary Licensing Agreements - OEM distribution of UnixWare with Seller's
agreement to include some OEM added value into future releases of
UnixWare . "
The software and sublicensing agreements are included under this clause , but the
seller 's " rights " are assigned , and not any " claims " that
might arise under the the agreements .
The Santa Cruz Operation would be
empowered to rightfully receive payment of royalties and to audit the
performance of the licensee as would be expected of an agent , but the equitable
interest in the proceeds and any claims that might arise are not assigned to

Something about that reads like the hammer shutting this case closed .

Please .
Go ahead .
Pursue the IBM litigation , please .
Look at the comments , look into our ( metaphorical ) eyes , from the day this fiaSCO began seven long years ago until today -- have you ever seen any trace of fear ?
Please pursue the big question of Linux infringing on anything .
My big concern has been that SCO will drive themselves out of business before the conclusion of the IBM case and then get to claim " We had valid claims , but the big money ran us out of business before we could have our day in court " .
Have your day in court .
Present your " evidence " .

1 . Cahn keeps going because he fears a legal harassment from the " SCO "
side more than IBM , Novell , Red Hat , remaining SCO shareholders and creditors
side .
He also knows that the " SCO " side is so afraid that someone will
come up with more money .
2. Judge Stewart considers awarding specific performance just to return the
favor the CoA provided him , maybe even have them overturned in the Supreme
Court .
3 . If SCO can't win in Utah , with a jury , with fine lawyering , and with Stewart
giving them pert ' near anything that had a ghost 's chance of grounds for appeal ,
where are
they to draw inspiration for slogging on ?
4. Jurors that do n't have to worry about being sued by SCO , they can be a little
more decisive .

5. SCO 's best chance was jury tampering .

final vindication on the undoubted merits vastly outweighs the cost of
litigation to both IBM and Novell , not to mention Red Hat .
You will not get a dime in nuisance money from anyone .
The only settlement terms likely available to you amount to abject surrender on

SCO will ask U.S. District Judge Ted Stewart to award the copyrights to SCO " even if we did n't have them before , " he said .
" It 's a setback , but it 's not over . "
Here 's what he 's referring to , the issues the parties agreed would be decided by the judge , not the jury .
It 's the next step .
One of the issues is specific performance , meaning that SCO wants to argue that even if they did n't get the copyrights , they were entitled under the APA and Amendment 2 to ask for the copyrights if they needed .
Like now , I gather .
Here 's the judge 's order [ PDF ] on their various requests .
But here 's a question .
If it 's true , as Singer reportedly told the jury in his closing argument , that SCOsource is dead and can't be revived now , why do they need the copyrights ?
For what use ?
This has to be a last desperate plea to stay in the game surely ?
SCO need the copyrights to maintain its status to the IBM litigation .
Without the copyrights all SCO can hope for is not to be eaten too quickly by IBM 's counter - claims ...
Also , if Judge Stewart hands the copyrights over to SCO , they win on two fronts :
They keep the litigation lottery alive , and at worst they have something to sell to some other troll who might have better luck than them ... [ Reply to This | # ]

Comments here and even lawyers for both sides talked about Amendment 2 excluding
all copyrights except what SCO needed for their business .
That 's not what it
says .
It excludes all copyrights except those that are required for SCO to
exercise their rights with respect to the acquisition .
This gives Singer a powerful argument to use .
The jury decided that the APA plus
Amendment 2 did not transfer any copyrights .
Naive logic would conclude that the
jury interpreted Amendment 2 as saying that copyrights would have transferred if
any of them were necessary for anything that was being acquired by SCO via that
APA , but in their opinion there were no such copyrights so none were excluded
from the exclusion .
But that would not be SCO logic .
If Judge Stewart would only rule that Novell is
required to hand over all the copyrights , then that would make copyrights part
of the Acquisition .
Naturally in order to exercise their rights with respect to
the acquisition of the copyrights , SCO would require the copyrights .
Therefore
all the copyrights would be included in the set of copyrights included in the
exclusion phrase in the exclusion clause 1.1b .
This would not contradict the finding of the jury , because at the time the jury
found that copyrights were not transferred by the APA plus Amendment 2 , they
really had not transferred .
That will all change when Judge Stewart grants SCO's
request regarding specific performance , as that will change what is included in
" with respect to the acquisition " .
Since the APA and Amendment 2 were
written before the trial even began , Judge Stewart 's decision by changing the
meaning of the word Acquisition as defined in the APA will have a retroactive
effect , erasing the jury decision as if it never happened .
Slam dunk for SCO .
Do n't worry , though .
By making the jury decision as if it never happened , that
will open the door for Novell to take it back to the 10th Circuit on the grounds
that the appeals decision required the issue to be remanded to the District
Court to be decided by a jury .
The 10th Circuit will have to send everything
back to Judge Stewart for a jury trial .
Because everything will have been reset ,
they will have to repeat the same trial with the same arguments with the same
results .
As everyone knows , changing the past like this is liable to create a time loop .
Luckily before the start of the loop Novell was able to get their petition for
cert to the Supreme Court .
If it is granted , the Supreme Court will have the
power to break the loop .
Otherwise we are doomed to read Groklaw articles about
the trial over and over and over and ...

So SCO gets double dibbs .

Nice strategy .
I hope it
fails .
SCO should n't get 2 shots at the copyrights , acutally 3 because the lost
the first time , then lost to a jury and now are trying to get a 3rd shot by
willy nilly asking the judge to make Novell hand them over and void the very
powerful language in the contract .

I was one of those people who was critical of the way Judge Stewart was
conducting the trial .
It appears that he was smarter than all of us .
In
hindsight it would be surprising if he had n't read through all the previous
court deliberation .
He knew what he had to do .
Do n't give SCO the slightest hint
of an appeal - able decision on his part .
He had full confidence in the jury and
did n't mind if he appeared to be biased against Novell .
He was n't concerned
about a Novell appeal .
Of course , his follow - up decisions will be the yardstick but I fully expect that
they will now go Novell 's way .
Let 's see .
Other posters are talking about the IBM case .
It wo n't happen .

There are many previous comments that Stewart now has to decide a number of
issues .
But has n't Kimball already decided them ?
If the appellate court passed back only the items that needed a jury , and these
has now been decided as per how Kimball initially ruled , why does SCO have a
second pick at anything else ?
Surely Kimball 's rulings on all other matters should now simply be affirmed .
And there was n't anything else left , was there ?

Anyway , some time in February or March , 2004 I forecast that Novell would win the jury trial .
Unfortunately , I cannot find the text using the Groklaw search engine , but my next door neighbour says that 's what he remembers happening and the girl at the checkout says she can't believe it could be any other way .
So , just give me my props .
This has never been about the money .
It is about the principle .
BS&F owe it to the US court system to take this to appeal and to oppose the Supreme Court review .
SCOG have $ 2 MM which is more than enough to cover the expenses as long as they get rid of the staff not essential to the litigation and the financial reports .
BS&F must pay for the actual legal costs under the capped fee agreement with SCOG .
Of course , SCOG must stay in Chapter 11 until this is done .
It may be wise to sell off all their assets other than the litigation in order to make this possible .
The judge stayed certain issues for judicial efficiency while they were heard in the arbitration .
I think they all stem from this part of SCOG 's second amended claims ; the ones that triggered the arbitration in the first place .
45 . The " core products " and " core application server offerings " referenced in the APA and TLA , respectively , refer to the UNIX and UnixWare operating systems owned by Santa Cruz upon the closing date .
Even before acquiring the UNIX source code , Santa Cruz had been primarily involved in the business of distributing UNIX in binary form , so that with the acquisition of the UNIX and UnixWare source code and copyrights , the UNIX and UnixWare operating systems undoubtedly represented Santa Cruz 's " core products . "
In addition , as of the closing date , Santa Cruz had no " application server offering " other than UNIX and UnixWare operating systems .
46 . On November 4 , 2003 , Novell announced its acquisition of SuSE Linux , one of the world 's leading distributors of Linux .
Since that time , Novell began distributing Linux worldwide .
47 . On December 22 , 2005 , SCO filed with the Court in the SCO v. IBM case a compilation of 293 disclosures of technology which IBM has made to enhance Linux ( in violation of its agreements with SCO ) with the stated objective of making Linux a more enterprise - hardened operating system .
48 . Linux contains SCO 's UNIX technology , including unauthorized UNIX System V source code , derivatives and modifications , methods and concepts contributed to Linux by IBM in violation of its license agreements with SCO .
Thus , Linux contains the Licensed Technology which , pursuant to Section 1.6 of the APA and Section II .
A. ( 2 ) of the TLA , Novell covenanted not to distribute in an operating system .
49 .
As a general - purpose operating system , Linux is " directly competitive " with SCO 's core application server offerings .
50 .
Furthermore , the measure of UNIX technology in Linux far exceeds the trivial portions that the parties intended Novell was authorized to use , in Netware , pursuant to the TLA .
Whereas UNIX became enterprise - ready after decades of development , Linux matured into a powerful enterprise - ready operating system in a few years , due primarily to the UNIX technology wrongly contributed by IBM into Linux .
50 . Novell therefore breached Section 1.6 of the APA and Section II .
A. ( 2 ) of the TLA .
52 . Novell has also infringed and continues to infringe SCO 's copyrights in UNIX by copying , reproducing , modifying , sublicensing , and / or distributing UNIX intellectual property as part of its Linux business .
This all revolves around the copyrights and technologies held by Novell before the closing date .
It is in two parts ; the non-compete provisions allegedly violated by Novell distributing SVrX technology in Linux and the copyright violation for the same reason .
The jury trial finds that the copyrights are still held by Novell .
Thus , the copyright violation claim in para .
52 fails .
Judge Stewart can settle that now which leaves just the rest , which I think is part of the specific performance issue that will be heard by the judge .
If not , it has fallen through the cracks .
If it remains , it might have to be stayed until after the IBM trial .
On the other hand , if Judge Stewart decides that Novell is entitled to its waiver SCOG 's claims about IBM putting SVrX into Linux in contravention of their contract cannot be proven in court and the claim fails .
If IBM proceeds , as Cahn is saying it will , then the Novell case remains stayed by this issue .
In their amended claims against IBM , SCOG withdrew claims that IBM put SVrX copyrighted code into Linux .
The issue left in IBM is whether they are prohibited by the contract from putting code that IBM own into Linux .
Whatever the outcome , the IBM owned code is not part of the technologies owned by Santa Cruz at the APA closing date and is not subject to the non-compete clauses .
Please note that Novell is not liable for distributing Linux with ' derivatives and modifications , methods and concepts ' contributed by IBM since that is a contractual issue between IBM and SCOG .
They might , however , still be liable under the non-compete claim .
Just in passing , I note that SCOG lied in para .
45 .
At the time of closing Santa Cruz had the Open Server " application server offering " based , I think , on Microsoft 's Xenix .
I happen to know they were still paying royalties to Microsoft to use the technology .
If they did not have at least one " application server offering " then they would have breached the merged product part of the APA agreement .
I do hope that the expenses money holds out until all this is done !

SGOG wants Judge Stewart to transfer the copyrights now , based on APA+2 .
But the
copyrights at issue are " copyrights needed for the acquisition of the
business . "
* Did APA + 2 transfer any copyrights ?
No ( per the Jury . )
* Did oldSCO acquire the business ?
Yes .
* Was this acquisition completed before oldSCO sold the business to Caldera ?
Yes .
Conclusion : oldSCO did not need any of these copyrights to acquire the business .
But this is the acquisition that was referred to in APA+ 2 .
Therefore ,
There are
no copyrights that transfer at any later time .

As a Linux user and advocate since 2000 , I remember the chill that developed
when SCO first announced the infringement of " millions of lines of
code " .
Once it became clear that no such examples could be shown I was
sure
the lawsuit would quickly fade away .
Well , this is why I do n't gamble much .
But
It as been a frustrating seven years , but that only make this decision even
more
delicious .
And yet , they still want to sue some more .... though at this point this is more
entertainment value than anything else .
Anyway , thank you PJ for being the lone voice of reason in an otherwise murky
world of law .

It seems that the SCO lawyers are following this saying :
The bigger the lie the more believable .
Or , keep telling a lie long enough and
people will begin to believe it as though it were the truth ; only because it has
been so long that nobody can remember what the truth was .
If SCO is issued the copyrights now it proves the judge is not on the side of
justice and truth .
You do n't simply take something from one entity and give it
to another , this is considered theft in most jurisdictions .
But then again , the
federal government started doing that , out in the open , over the passed 2 weeks .
Ca n't expect the judge to act any different than the federal lawmakers .

Kimball said that SVRX copyrights were not needed for SCOsource therefore Novell
could n't claim any SCOsource revenue .
If SCO argue that specific performance should be made with regard to these
copyrights could that open the door for Kimball 's decision that the SVRX
copyrights are not a part of a SCOsource licence ( and therefore Novell 's claim
on SCOsource revenue ) to be overturned ?

If Novell wins in the non-jury component of this case it will presumably claim legal costs against SCO .
If they are granted where are they in the pecking order ?
We currently have Novell 's converted [ =stolen ] money , Yarro 's privileged repayments , ordinary creditors , SCO 's legal fees , and also Novell's .
What order do they come in ?
Does the amount of money owed to Novell in relation to other creditors change the influence they have on the bankrupcy ?

Okay , I 've donned my asbestos underwear ; I 'm ready for the flame war that this post may provoke .
First I will say that am glad , very glad , that Novell won .
I use Linux a lot and I do not want to see it 's development and use harmed in any way .
But this is n't the important case because there is more to the FLOSS software stack than just Linux !
This case has been about kernel code , and we have a drop in replacement for Linux .
Anyone of the BSDs could be used .
Most of the software that works on Linux already does run on , or could be easily ported to , a BSD API .
And let 's not to forget OpenSolaris , although I do n't like it 's T&Cs nearly as much .
So the important case is the IBM one .
In it 's counterclaims IBM site the GPL about six times ; it 's almost as if they wanted to prove the GPL a strong license in a court of law !
In fact that is what I think they do want .
At the beginning of all this I read on Eblen Moglen 's site that a license is stronger once it has been ratified in a court of law .
Given that IBM 's decision to fight make a lot of sense .
And a proven GPL is far more important because so much free software is licensed under it .
And if the GPL is ratified I think this will help the other FLOSS licenses as well as they all aim to do pretty much the same thing .
So lets not call this whole think over just yet .
If Judge Stewart awards the copyrights to SCO then wo n't that allow SCO to continue it 's fight against IBM ?
And as PJ has pointed out in the past , the IBM counterclaims are far more damaging to SCO than SCO 's claims against IBM .
So I for one hope that SCO do continue , as long as this means that IBM gets its day in court .
Because that , for me , is where the important stuff as far as the free software community is to be done .

I am really happy about the verdict .
And the limitations of frivolous lawsuits when SCOX no longer ( reasonably ) no
longer can claim copyrights to GNU / Linux .
However .
There was never any infringements on GNU / Linux shown .
Even if SCOX would have had the copyrights and sold it to another litigation
party they still would have no claims in GNU / Linux .
And if they by some fault
would have .
It could be removed .
The law need to be such that really unknowing copyright infringement does not
exist .
Somebody should show that there is a copyright infringement and / or the infringer
should be aware of some specific copyright being infringed .
Not just say ( There
is some code in there that is ours ) .
This whole circus is an abuse of resources better spent on doing something
productive for the society or for people .

I have n't been following the court case very closely but have been following the
story since the verdict but am confused by the request by SCO still in front of
the judge to award them the copyrights .
How , why , could , the judge award the
copyrights to SCO ?
I 'm not going to say that if the judge did this it would
overturn the jury verdict but I am left wondering that if that were to happen
then what was the purpose of having a jury rule ?

something basic here so ...

I think this is a Groklaw record .
I strongly suspect Edward Cahn mis-spoke when he said SCO was going to continue
the suit against IBM .
Novell had the right , and did waive the contract dispute against IBM .
That was
Judge Kimball 's decision , and was only in question if Copyrights transfered to
SCO .
The appeals court only said that the issue of copyrights transferring was
something for a jury to decide .
They did not reverse anything .
Edward Cahn has no basis for continuing the suit against IBM , unless he is
claiming IBM transfered Unixware code developed after SCO bought the Unix
business , and discovery was all about Unix code , not Unixware code , so the
evidence he has has got to be non-existant .
I suspect the smartest thing he can
do is to see if he can get the IBM case dropped without facing all those
counterclaims and legal fees .
He is woefully mis-informed .
Maybe he can sell the business to Darl for another thirty five thousand .

Questions :
* Will Novell ask the judge to make SCOG pay these fees ?
* Will the judge agree ?
* Are these considered pre-petition or post-petition debts to SCOG , or are
they allocated based on when Novell spent the money ?
* Where in the priority order of the creditor list do they go ?

In regard to the specific performance issues and SCO 's need for the copyright
transfers : Santa Cruz could not afford the copyrights in the first place .
This
is why the copyrights were never transferred .
Thus , if SCO wants the copyrights now they have to :
1 . Prove there is a UNIX Business need for them .
But Darl said in court that
there was no need for copyrights for running the UNIX Business - thus
stubbing SCO right in the foot .
2. SCO will have to pay Novell 's current PRICE for the copyrights if it can
afford them .
Since SCO wanted the copyrights thinking they were worth
billions , then obviouslly , Novell should charge SCO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for
the copyrights - PAYABLE UP FRONT .
This is only fair .
SCO PAYS NOVELL UP
FRONT FOR THE WORTH OF THE COPYRIGHTS - which are worth billions since
SCO wants other companies to pay it billions of dollars after suing them .
Tough luck for SCO 's lawyers on the cost issue .
Obviously , the copyrights
wo n't be given to them for free if they are worth billions .
These two conditions SCO can never meet .
Case closed .

The outlook was n't brilliant for Caldera and its crew ,
A Lindon , Utah , software firm that had n't got a clue .
A Unix on the Intel chip could generate some dough
But no one there could figure out a way to make it go .
Since Unix was historical and Linux was brand - new
To link them to each other was the best that they could do .
To build an honest business was not something they could master
And every shortcut to success led only to disaster .
Now which of those two said it first they never will reveal ,
But Yarrow and McBride together came up with this deal ,
Where a certain friendly party would supply the needed loot
For a lawsuit to kill Linux , and a pump - and - dump , to boot .
So they studied all their contracts , and they combed through all the laws ,
And they picked and chose the paragraphs that seemed to suit their cause .
They found an ambiguity on which their case could hinge
And announced that they were suing Linux users who infringe .
Then Yarrow said to Darl McBride , " Go sue a Linux user
" For you are a famous and mendacious civil law abuser .
" Whatever copyrights and patents that you think you 'll need ,
" Purchase them and file the registrations with all speed . "
So Darl attacked the problem with his customary zeal .
He sent out fifteen hundred letters ( printed , to look real ) ,
And most of those who got them tried to find out what they meant ,
And why the content was so vague , and why they had been sent .
That same friend who financed the case provided something more :
The threat of war is always more effective than a war .
Instead of telling people why he wanted cash from them ,
Darl publicly announced that he was suing IBM .
" Millions of lines in Linux are our property ! "
Darl crowed ,
And " Talk is cheap , " said Linus in reply , " Show me the
code . "
But though the court -- and IBM -- demanded , asked , and begged ,
Darl McBride would not disclose on what his claims were pegged .
" My daddy gave me good advice I never will forget :
" You do n't reveal your cards until the suckers have all bet . "
Judge Kimball issued deadlines with the patience of a saint ,
While Darl McBride reset the clock by changing his complaint .
The court remarked that it was like denouncing as a crook
A random bystander , without describing what he took .
Then Darl said , " Well , our case may be an unsupported mess ,
" But you do n't need evidence to sell your story to the press . "
Just then the chiefs of Novell noticed something smelling bad :
Their company was threatened , too , for Novell also had
Their own -- well , purchased -- distro , and a plan to make it pay .
This parasite was scaring all their customers away !
Ironically , McBride was pinning all his hopes for the big kill
On copyrights that Novell once had sold for fifty mill .
Except -- on close inspection of the contract , second pass ,
Apparently , they had n't .
Well , now , was n't that a gas .
Thus Novell wrote a letter to their rival , SCO ,
Instructing them , in re infringement lawsuit : let it go .
But Darl , instead of backing off , rose up in perfect dander
In public and the trade press , and then sued Novell for slander .
The first court ruled that witnesses do not need to be polled ;
The sales agreement clearly states no copyrights were sold .
Now , anyone would know , who has a lawyer for a brother ,
If one court rules against you , you can always find another .
And so a jury had to hear Novell being maligned
As they defended once again the contract that they signed ,
While SCO described their absurd view of the affair
With witness after witness , not a one of whom was there .
Today will see the ruling on Novell 's nefarious deeds ,
And how they tried to denigrate the evidence Darl needs .
Our pens are poised -- our breath is halt -- we 've camped out here for weeks --
And now the jury has returned ; and now , the Foreman speaks !
Oh somewhere in this glorious land inventors ply their trade ,
And somewhere men enjoy the fruits of what their minds have made ,
And golden are the shining days and joyous are the nights --
But there is no joy in Lindon : McBride never bought the rights .
- Wang - Lo .

1. According to the CoA , extrinsic evidence can be taken into account in
deciding whether copyright has transferred .
Surely then it can be taken into
account in deciding under what conditions it was envisaged that the copyrights
might be needed for the Unix business , perhaps by considering what folks then

This just makes me want to stab you in the eye when we finally meet .
For the guys :
Do n’t think I ’m amused when you flirt or offer to “ do me . ”
You ca n’t successfully rob a convenience store , forge a signature , pawn stolen merchandise , get through a day without drinking , control your temper , or talk your way out of a routine traffic stop .
I figure your performance in other areas is just as spectacular , and the thought of your shriveled unwashed body near me makes me want to kill you and then myself .
For the girls : I know your life is rougher than mine and you have no resources .
I ’m not going to insult you by suggesting you leave your abusive pimp / boyfriend , that you stop taking meth , or that your stop stealing shit .
I do wish you ’d stop beating the crap out of your kids and leaving your needles out for them to play with because you are n’t allowing them to have a life that is any better than yours .
For the morons :
Your second grade teacher was right – neatness counts .
Just clean up !
When you rob the store , do n’t leave your wallet .
When you drive into the front of the bank , do n’t leave the front license plate .
When you rape / assault / rob a woman on the street , do n’t leave behind your cell phone .
After you abuse your girlfriend , do n’t leave a note saying that you ’re sorry .
If you are being chased by the cops and you have dope in your pocket – dump it .
These cops are not geniuses .
They are out of shape and want to go to Krispy Kreme and most of all go home .
They will not scour the woods or the streets for your 2 grams of meth .
But they will check your pockets , idiot .
2 grams is not worth six months of jail .
Do n’t be offended and say you were harassed because the security was following you all over the store .
Girl , you were wearing an electronic ankle bracelet with your mini skirt .
And you were stealing .
That ’s not harassment , that ’s good store security .
And those kids you churn out : how is it possible ?
You ’re out there breeding like feral cats .
What exactly is the attraction of having sex with other meth addicts ?
You are lacking in the most basic aspects of hygiene , deathly pale , greasy , grey - toothed , twitchy and covered with open sores .
How can you be having sex ?
You make my baby - whoring crack head clients look positively radiant by comparison .
" I did n't put it all the way in . "
Not a defense .
" All the money is gone now . "
Not a defense
" The bitch deserved it . "
Not a defense .
" But that dope was so stepped on , I barely got high . "
Not a defense .
" She did n't look thirteen . "
Possibly a defense ; it depends .
" She did n't look six . "
Never a defense , you just need to die .
For those rare clients that say thank - you , leave a voice mail , send a card or flowers , you are very welcome .
I keep them all , and they keep me going more than my pitiful COLA increase .
For the idiots who ask me how I sleep at night : I sleep just fine , thank you .
There 's nothing wrong with any of my clients that could not have been fixed with money or the presence of at least one caring adult in their lives .
But that window has closed , and that loss diminishes us all .
