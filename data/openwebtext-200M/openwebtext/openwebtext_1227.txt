The digital age meets the stone age in these pictures “ painted ” with different coloured crops in Japanese rice fields .
Making giant pictures on the earth is an ancient art form … Japan ’s lovely new contribution to this ancient art is , however , unimaginable without modern technology .
I do n’t mean that the farmers of the village of Inakadate where the rice pictures started in 1993 – they are now spreading through Japan – have somehow cheated .
The images are created by laborious handicraft : kodaimai rice , which has purple and yellow leaves , is planted among green - leaved tsugaru roman rice to create the patterns .
This takes loving care and it ’s a real triumph of folk art , but computer imaging is used to work out how to plant such complex designs .
Simply irresistible .
The illusion of improving global imbalances
Richard Baldwin , Daria Taglioni
Global imbalances are shrinking at a fabulous rate .
This column argues that these improvements are mostly illusory – the transitory side - effect of the greatest trade collapse the world has ever seen .
A global recovery will almost surely return the US , Germany , China and others to their old paths .
They are blamed for the global crisis directly ( Paulson 2008 ) or indirectly ( Calvo 2009 ) , G20 leaders are committed to ending them , and commentators have generated an ocean of html painting them as one of the world ’s greatest banes .
“ They ” are global imbalances – large trade surpluses and large trade deficits .
Good news then – global imbalances have been shrinking at a fabulous rate ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 . Shrinking global imbalances , 2007 - 2008
Source : WTO Quarterly merchandise trade data
The figure – which includes China , Germany , the US and all the other usual suspects in the global - imbalances saga – shows that trade gaps have closed remarkably quickly since late 2008 .
The IMF and World Bank both forecast substantial improvements for 2009 and into 2010 ( IMF 2009 and World Bank 2009a ) .
The World Bank , for instance , predicts that China ’s surplus in 2010 will be half its 2008 value .
This rapid improvement seems odd given how little reform has occurred .
The renminbi has not appreciated against the dollar and Chinese consumption has not boomed ; the dollar has depreciated modestly against European currencies and the US savings rate has risen gently , but neither seems large enough to account for the massive shifts already observed , to say nothing of the World Bank predictions for future improvements .
We argue here that these global imbalance improvements are mostly illusory – the transitory side effect of the greatest trade collapse the world has ever seen .
Before making the argument , we lay out the basic facts .
The trade collapse
Since late 2008 , global trade flows collapsed in a historically unprecedented manner ( Figure 2 , see Eichengreen and O’Rourke 2009 for comparison with the 1930s ) .
As the figure shows , global trade has suffered large blows on three previous occasions in the post - war period but this one is substantially larger .
Figure 2 . Historical trade collapses in perspective , 1965 – 2009

Monthly real trade data
The old “ Quad ” ( EU , US , Japan , and Canada ) plus China account for over 60 % of world trade .
They all saw their exports and imports plummet dramatically , as did the other nations listed in Figure 3 .
( These 11 nations account for three - quarters of world trade . )
Each of these trade flows dropped by more than 20 % from 2008Q2 to 2009Q2 .
Figure 3 . Synchronised drop in all major nation ’s exports and exports , 2007Q1 - 2009Q2
Source : WTO Quarterly merchandise trade data
Causes
With the recession at hand , a trade drop is unsurprising ; what shocks is its magnitude .
Freund ( 2009 ) averaged the world GDP and trade drops for four large recessions ( 1975 , 1982 , 1991 , and 2001 ) and found that the trade drop was 4.8 times larger than the GDP drop .
This time , global quarter - on - quarter GDP growth was negative in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 , but over the period of the great trade collapse ( 2008Q2 to 2009 Q2 ) IMF data shows world GDP actually rising by 1.5 % while global trade dropped about 15 % .
Economists around the world have been working hard to understand the causes of this unusually large trade shut down .
The findings of over 20 studies will be summarised by the researchers in a VoxEU.org e-book The Great Trade Collapse : Causes , consequences and prospects to be released 27 November 2009 ( in time for the WTO Ministerial ) .
The emerging consensus is that this is mostly a demand - side phenomenon with two distinct but mutually reinforcing channels of transmission :
Commodity prices collapsed with world demand sending the value and volume of commodities trade diving by double digits ( food , fuels and raw materials make up a quarter of global trade ) .
The basic facts are clear from Figure 4 ; 2007 and 2008 saw a rapid rise in food and fuel prices that collapsed in the summer of 2008 – well before the Lehman ’s debacle .
Figure 4 . Commodity prices plummet
Source : World Bank ( 2009a )
Supply - chain manufacturing collapsed as the Lehman ’s - induced shock - and - awe caused consumers and firms to wait and see ; private demand for all manner of ‘ postpone - able ’ consumption crashed .
The manufactures trade drop was amplified many times over by “ compositional ” and “ synchronicity ” effects .
Compositional effect
The nature of the demand shock interacted with the composition of trade and GDP to greatly exaggerate the trade drop .
The basic point is best illustrated with a small numerical example .
Roughly speaking , world trade consists of about 80 % manufactures – most of which are related to the ‘ postpone - able ’ consumption items such as consumer and investment electronics , transport equipment , and other types of machinery .
World GDP , however , consists largely of non-trade - ables , especially services .
Say in rough numbers that the value - added involved in postpone - ables is about 10 % of world GDP .
In the pre-crisis situation , the exports to GDP ratio looks like this :
After the world catches a strong dose of Knightian uncertainty and reacts by freezing until things become clearer , purchases of the postpone - ables slumps – say by half – leading both trade and production to halve .
To keep the thought experiment clean , suppose nothing happens to “ others ” in trade or GDP .
The post - crisis situation is :
Due merely to the compositional effect , world exports have fallen 40 % while world GDP has fallen only 5 % .
( Specifically , the percent difference in the numerator ’s and denominator ’s change is the difference in the share of postpone - ables )
Synchronicity effect
The second simple fact that helps explain why the great trade collapse was so great concerns the fact that almost every nation ’s imports and exports fell in this episode .
In previous episodes , there was no Lehman - like event to synchronise the wait - and - see stance on a global scale .
Another aspect of this is the just - in - time nature of the global supply chain .
Even a decade ago , a drop in consumer sales in the US or Europe took months to be transmitted back to the factories and even longer to reach the suppliers of those factories .
Today , Factory Asia is online .
Hesitation by US and European consumers is transmitted almost instantly to the entire supply chain , which reacts almost instantly by producing and buying less ; trade drops in synch , both imports and exports .
For example , during the 2001 trade collapse , monthly data for 52 nations shows that 39 % of the month - nation pairs had negative growth for both imports and exports .
In the 2008 , crisis the figure is 83 % .
This makes a huge difference .
To see this , consider a simple thought experiment .
Suppose there are only two possible monthly trade growth numbers +5 % and - 20 % , and there are 10 equal sized nations in the world .
If only two - fifths of nations are experiencing the negative growth , the world growth would be - 5 % ; if 80 % are experiencing the negative growth rate , the world trade growth rate would be - 15 % .
As authors of the chapters in the forthcoming VoxEU.org e-book explain , there are indeed many other factors involved , ranging from supply - side causes ( like lack of trade credit and banking credit more generally to protectionist measures ) to quality shifts .
Looking forward
Taking as read that the great trade collapse was primarily driven by a sudden , synchronised and severe drop in demand , it is clear that trade will recover as demand recovers .
Indeed , trade is already bouncing back at a fairly spectacular rate .
While the bounce is impressive , it is not unexpected .
Indeed all the post - war trade collapses have been followed by very rapid recoveries in trade flows , as Figure 5 shows .
The chart plots the three major trade collapses highlighted above .
In the 1982 and 2001 episodes , trade returned to its pre-crisis level in two or three quarters after the nadir ; the 1975 crisis took four quarters .
Figure 5 . Historical trade collapses and recoveries
Source : Authors ’ calculations on OECD real monthly trade data
Using the mean of these historical adjustment paths , we can guess the future evolution of world trade in the next few quarters .
If 2009Q2 turns out to be the nadir – as the monthly data suggests – world trade should be back to its 2008Q2 level by 2010Q1 or Q2 .
This matters .
If exports and imports recover quickly – as they have in previous episodes – much of the improvement in global imbalances will vanish just as quickly .
To work out this point more concretely , we use the fitted trade collapse from the three post - war episodes to simulate the path of exports and imports for the world ’s main trading nations .
Figure 6 shows the results of the simulations for some big traders .
Figure 6 . Simulated recovery of exports and imports
Source : Authors ’ calculations based on WTO quarterly trade data and Figure 5
Simulated trade imbalances implied by these figures are shown in Figure 7 .
This shows the simulated evolution of trade imbalances if the general trade recovery occurs without major structural and real exchange rate adjustments in the main deficit and surplus nations .
The findings are in line with the simple intuition that the rapid improvement in global imbalances without major structural changes is likely to be transitory .
The point can be made a little more crisply with some accounting identities .
The trade balance is exports minus imports .
Pure logic tells us that if both exports and imports fall by , say , 15 % , then all nations ’ trade balances will improve , i.e. move towards zero , by 15 % .
Or more pedantically : X ( 1 - g ) - M ( 1 -g ) NX ( 1 - g ) .

Concluding remarks
Do global imbalances matter ?
Is their continued existence driving the world economy towards another global crisis ?
These are questions on which macroeconomists have not yet formed a consensus .
The IMF and World Bank have calmed the waters by projecting reductions in the imbalances of the world ’s largest trading nations – especially China and the US .
This column points out that these projections of improving imbalances are almost surely wrong .
The rapid collapse of trade between the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 improved most balances of trade .
It could not have done otherwise ; if both imports and exports drop rapidly , the gap between them drops equally rapidly .
In the same mechanistic manner , the recovery of trade flows – a recovery that seems to have started this summer – will almost surely return the US , Germany , China and others to their old paths .

Editor ’s note :
This article has been updated to reflect new data on total casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Veterans Day arrives tomorrow , and with it , the anticipated harvest of heartbreaking anecdotes driving the press coverage and our ever wandering attention back to less desirable realities : the disfigured but persevering hero , the homeless warrior , the unemployable sergeant , the father or son or daughter who came home a stranger and cannot be reached .
Usually , there is nothing more powerful than a personal story to pound home the cost of eight years of war overseas , but I think today there is something even more disturbing to bear .
It ’s the number 89,457 [ .doc ] .
As of Nov. 9 , that ’s how many American casualties there were in Iraq and Afghanistan since Oct. 7 , 2001 , when the Afghan war officially began .
That includes a tire - screeching 75,134 dead , wounded - in- action , and medically evacuated due to illness , disease , or injury in Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) , and 14,323 and counting in Afghanistan , or Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) .
That it may sound incredible – even unreal – is understandable .
Early attempts to effectively count casualties ( outside of battlefield fatalities ) had been in earnest , then erratic , but finally dead - ended , frustrated by the Department of Defense , which has always been loath to break down and publicize the data on a regular basis .
One stalwart has always been Veterans for Common Sense ( VCS ) , a nonprofit advocacy group dedicated to advancing the health and readjustment of returning soldiers and veterans .
They ’ve been diligently aggregating the statistics over time , and thanks to their diligent Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests , they can provide casualty reports at a level of detail not currently seen on the DOD ’s publicly accessible Web site , DefenseLink.mil .
If we could access the data more easily , more people would know that 196 servicemembers took their own lives while serving in Iraq between March 2003 and Oct. 31 , 2009 , and there were 35 such suicides in Afghanistan .
( These figures , of course , do not include the skyrocketing cases of suicides among all active - duty soldiers and veterans and cases of self - inflicted injury outside both war zones . )
More people would also know that 48,871 servicemembers had to be medically evacuated from the battlefield due to hostile and non-hostile injury , disease , and other medical issues since the beginning of the Iraq War [ .pdf ] .
As of Oct. 31 , 11,080 were evacuated for the same reasons from the war zone in Afghanistan [ .pdf ] .
What the DOD does say , is that as of Nov. 4 , there were 13,880 servicemembers wounded in action in Iraq who had not returned to duty , while 2,619 had left Afghanistan under the same conditions [ .pdf ] .
That number is climbing faster .
According to the Washington Post on Oct. 31 , more than 1,000 were wounded in Afghanistan in the last three months , accounting for one - third of the total American casualties in OEF overall .
Thus , the troops are coming home , but in drastically varied degrees of wholeness .
In Vietnam , there was one soldier killed for every 2.6 wounded .
The vast majority of soldiers are surviving their injuries today ( approximately one killed in action for every 11.5 wounded in action , according to current stats for Afghanistan and Iraq ) , thanks to advanced body armor , better medevac transport , and mine - resistant ambush - protected vehicles .
But in tens of thousands of cases , their journey has just begun .
No one should be surprised , then , to hear that some 454,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have already sought medical care from the Veterans Administration ( VA ) when they came home .
That ’s 40 percent of the total OIF / OEF veteran population , which is a number that is of course in flux , considering that the war has no end and veterans have five years to apply for care after the end of their service .
As of this summer , of those veterans who sought healthcare at the VA , 45 percent were diagnosed with a mental health condition , according to VA statistics .
Twenty - seven percent of these had post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
Based on available resources from the DOD and research by the RAND Corporation , VCS estimates that an estimated 370,000 ( or 19.5 percent of ) veterans have a traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) thanks to the high rate of accidents , roadside bombs , and other battlefield explosions and events – plus repeated deployments – in the war .
VCS also estimates that some 18.5 percent of veterans come home with PTSD .
" This is very , very serious .
The numbers are … bad , OK ? " said Paul Sullivan , the bulldog director of VCS .
" The good news is veterans are asking for care , and it ’s good care .
The bad news is there is 454,000 of them . "
That ’s tens of thousands of men and women and affected families and communities that are all but missing from the mainstream news any other time of the year .
Sullivan said this is partly the military ’s fault for obfuscating the statistics and working to keep the agony of sacrifice in the shadows .
" It ’s still the policy of the United States to minimize concerns about postwar health , " said Sullivan .
Take the issue of soldiers coming home with chronic health problems allegedly caused by the toxic open - air burn pits in theater .
One look at the online discussion boards and it ’s clear something over there went awry .
Vets are headed to VA facilities in droves with symptoms ranging from respiratory distress to sleep apnea and irregular heart conditions , but the Pentagon still refuses to admit a connection to their wartime exposures .
" They treat it as a public relations issue , not a health issue , " Sullivan said .
" In our view , we are tired of the government lying , and we ’re done with the PR . "
Larry Scott , who runs VAWatchdog.org , an invaluable daily monitor of ongoing issues affecting the 23.4 million living U.S veterans , said the 90,591 figure relating to OIF / OEF casualties is valid – and ultimately overwhelming .
" People just forget , they do n’t realize there is an ongoing cost of war .
Whether you agree with the war or not is not the issue .
We have to be ready to pay the price . "
Looking at it in monetary terms – more numbers – may seem cold , but again , it puts the taxpayers ’ burden into shocking perspective .
Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz have identified two scenarios in their book , The Three Trillion Dollar War ( 2008 ) .
One scenario estimates a long - term cost of $ 422 billion to the federal government for veterans ’ health care and disability compensation ( given 1.8 million men and women deployed and troop levels falling below 55,000 by 2012 ) .
In the other scenario , the U.S. stays in Iraq and Afghanistan another eight years and 2.1 million men and women are deployed , with a price tag of $ 717 billion
Sullivan estimates that there are about 450,000 disability claims already filed with the VA on behalf of Iraq and Afghanistan vets , based on the official 405,000 figure announced back in February .
He said there are approximately 80,000 new claims a month from veterans of all wars .
As of Sept. 26 , there were more than 951,217 pending claims by all veterans , including 200,679 claims pending appeal ( the Veterans Benefits Administration recently reduced that number to 176,000 , raising eyebrows at Sullivan ’s group ) .
Rarely do we hear these figures over the din calling for even greater numbers of troops on the ground in Afghanistan .
The generals want 40,000 or more , which would exceed the " surge " of 20,000 men and women into Iraq almost three years ago .
Soldiers are finally withdrawing from that front only to be shifted to the other one for seemingly more hazardous duty .
" Where is the discussion about making sure that before we send any more troops overseas that we can take care of the veterans we already have and whether we can take care of another flood of them ? " asked Sullivan .
Such discussions are indeed hard to come by .
As Veterans Day nears , veterans are strangely absent , and for many of us , out of mind .
Perhaps Sullivan ’s question is best answered by Macy ’s full - page Veterans Day sale advertisement in the Washington Post this week , featuring two well - dressed , shiny , happy , pretty people with a bugle and a drum .
There are lots of numbers – 30 % to 60 % off storewide !
– but not a veteran in sight .

Motorola DEXT - first look
First thing that I 'd like to mention is that the Motorola DEXT wo n't land on many markets outside the US and some European countries .
As you might have already guessed , it 'll be distributed exclusively by operators for 1 Euro with contract ( or 150 Euro without one ) .
In fact , that 's probably the most disappointing thing about the DEXT , with it being the cheapest Android - powered solution to date ( from a known brand at that ! ) , it could 've set the bar to a completely different level , but alas !
What do we need to know about the DEXT ( which is , by the way , its European codename , both American continents will know it as the CLIQ ) then ?
First , it compes pre-installed with Motorola 's very own MOTOBLUR user interface - an add - on to Android 's default interface that allows the user to gather all his or her favorite social networks in one place .
On first launch you 'll need to enter not your Google account details , but rather Motorola ID ; it seems there 'll be some section on their official site where all registered users will be able to input their login details for social networks .
All in all , it 's a great things for social networks aficionados and Google 's services ; although it 's a pity we have n't had a chance to take a close look at MOTOBLUR , and that 's not because we were that lazy , the reason is that we simply could n't register ( and it seems there is no place to register yet ) !
The DEXT was originally revealed to the web as " Morrison " , but its real codenames are , like we already said : DEXT for Europe and CLIQ ( CDMA ) for the US and Canada .
Design Now for the DEXT 's design .
Despite it being one of the most affordable Android - based devices to date , it least quite a favorable impression .
It has a distinctive youthful appeal and combines white with bluer colors ( indeed , a black - and - white color scheme would have killed the " spark " in it ) .
The build quality of the DEXT 's prototype seemed sturdy during our hands - on session with it .
The phone is on the heftier side , the backside of the slide is made of metal .
What I like about its design , though , are the captions of the side - mounted buttons - have n't seen anything like them before .
Housed on the top end is the 3.5 mm audio jack .
The battery cover slides down effortlessly , it 's made out of plastic and does n't look particularly durable .
Noticed the pattern ?
Pretty offbeat , if you ask me .
By and large , the DEXT 's design is n't what are used to see from Motorola - too much color , for one , and then a variety of materials , such as white glossy inserts .
I suppose there 'll be many more color schemes available when it hits the shelves .
While the DEXT is somewhat chubby , I would n't say it 's overly large at 114x58x15.6 mm ; there 's still no official data on its weight , but I 'd say it 's around 120 grams .
Motorola DEXT vs Nokia N97 , HTC Hero , Apple iPhone : Display
The phone sports a 3.1 inch display with capacitive technology inside and a 320x480 pixel resolution .
Since we did n't manage to delve into its interface , I can't say much about its picture quality , so I 'm going to reserve my final judgment .
One thing I noticed , though , was its sensitivity - the DEXT 's display was pretty good in this regard .
As soon as we get activate the phone , we 'll post screenshots of all core applications here , so stay tuned .
Controls and QWERTY keyboard Located beneath the display are three mechanical buttons , and I believe by now pretty much everyone knows what they mean .
There is the Mute switch on the left , further down is the volume rocker .
On the opposite side there are the Lock / Power button and dedicated camera key .
All in all , the DEXT boasts a very plain and user - friendly setup , unlike some of the latest Android - based phones - it does n't have any joysticks or fiddly trackballs , plus it allows to do some things without having to open the main menu ( silent mode and camera app activation ) .
I would n't say that the DEXT 's thumbboard is particularly comfortable .
It 's okay and is more or less in line with that of the Nokia N97 .
The thing I got bewildered by was the five - way joystick on the right that was n't very handy .
On the bright side , the keyboard slides open seamlessly and with a satisfying click .
While the metal slab on the back of the top part is definitely good news , I think they could 've made out of plastic just as well - the DEXT 's target audience could n't care less .
Camera
The phone comes equipped with a 5 MP camera , although I do n't know what model they 've carried it over from .
But it does have autofocus and if the DEXT really utilizes the ZINE 's camera module , then we can expect some top - quality imaging experience from it .
But for the time being , these are nothing , but my guesses - we 'll need to take a closer look at it to make sure .
Connectivity
The DEXT features a comprehensive selection of connectivity options , plus GPS : Bluetooth 2.1+EDR , Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g , USB 2.0 support .
Despite it being a phone for the younger audience , it offers quite a punch in this department .
On top of that there is the microUSB socket .
Platform
The handset is based on Qualcomm 7201a platform and runs on 528 Mhz CPU , which has been around in communicators for quite a while now , so no surprises here .
Even though this platform is n't the best choice for watching non-converted videos , it handles day - to - day tasks with ease .
Now for the bundled memory : 512 Mb of flash memory , 256 Mb of RAM and a microSD memory card slot onboard ( up to 32 Gb , located beneath the battery cover , but does n't require you to actually remove the battery to swap cards ) , coupled with 1 Gb of memory for user data .
As far as I 'm concerned , the DEXT packs in enough RAM to cope with any task .
Operating system
The DEXT makes use of Google Android 1.1 operating system with MOTOBLUR tacked on top of it - we 'll definitely see it in other Motorola - branded phones down the road , so we 'll post a separate review of it as soon as we manage to access the OS itself .
Conclusion
It 's obvious that one of Motorola 's highest priorities these days are operator - related activities , both in their native market , the US , and other regions too .
But if we get outside the framework of the DEXT being an operator - branded phone , is it really a likable phone ?
I think the answer is yes .
Below is a bullet point list of the good things about it .
Reasonable price - most Android - based phones from other top - notch manufacturers are overpriced , so very people venture to try out this new OS .
A likable design with a strong youthful appeal
3.5 mm audio jack
Decent display
MOTOBLUR - we have n't seen it yet , but sounds promising , plus any modification of Android 's default functionality is definitely a plus
Pretty comfortable QWERTY keyboard
5 MP camera with autofocus
A complete set of connectivity options
But naturally , the most crucial point is its price - you could find a lot of shortcomings in the DEXT , but all of them will be negated by its magic " 150 Euro " price tag .
All things considered , it looks like this phone will be great value for its money .

When you knowingly pay someone to lie to you , we call the deceiver an illusionist or a magician .
When you unwittingly pay someone to do the same thing , I call him a politician .
President Obama insists that health care " reform " not " add a dime " to the budget deficit , which daily grows to ever more frightening levels .
So the House - passed bill and the one the Senate now deliberates both claim to cost less than $ 900 billion .
Somehow " $ 900 billion over 10 years " has been decreed to be a magical figure that will not increase the deficit .
It 's amazing how precise government gets when estimating the cost of 10 years of subsidized medical care .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's bill was scored not at $ 850 billion , but $ 849 billion .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her bill would cost $ 871 billion .
How do they do that ?
The key to magic is misdirection , fooling the audience into looking in the wrong direction .
I happily suspend disbelief when a magician says he 'll saw a woman in half .
That 's entertainment .
But when Harry Reid says he 'll give 30 million additional people health coverage while cutting the deficit , improving health care and reducing its cost , it 's not entertaining .
It 's incredible .
The politicians have a hat full of tricks to make their schemes look cheaper than they are .
The new revenues will pour in during Year One , but health care spending wo n't begin until Year Three or Four .
To this the Cato Institute 's Michael Tanner asks , " Would n't it be great if you could count a whole month 's income , but only two weeks ' expenditures in your household budget ? "
To be deficit - reducers , the health care bills depend on a $ 200 billion cut in Medicare .
Current law requires cuts in payments to doctors , but let 's get real :
Those cuts will never happen .
The idea that Congress will " save $ 200 billion " by reducing payments for groups as influential as doctors and retirees is laughable .
Since 2003 , Congress has suspended those " required " cuts each year .
Our pandering congressmen rarely cut .
They just spend .
Even as the deficit grows , they vomit up our money onto new pet " green " projects , bailouts for irresponsible industries , gifts for special interests , and guarantees to everyone .
Originally , this year 's suspension , " the doc fix , " was included in the health care bills , but when it clearly pushed the cost of " reform " over Obama 's limit and threatened to hike the deficit , the politicians moved the " doc fix " to a separate bill and pretended it was unrelated to their health care work .
Megan McArdle of The Atlantic reports that Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin asked the Congressional Budget Office what the total price would be if the " doc fix " and House health care overhaul were passed together .
" The answer , according to the CBO , is that together they 'd increase the deficit by $ 89 billion over 10 years . "
McArdle explains why the " doc fix " should be included : " They 're passing a bill that increases the deficit by $ 200 billion in order to pass another bill that hopefully reduces it , but by substantially less than $ 200 billion .
That means that passage of this bill is going to increase the deficit . "
From the start , Obama has promised to pay for half the " reform " cost by cutting Medicare by half a trillion over 10 years .
But , Tanner asks , " how likely is it that those cuts will take place ?
After all , this is an administration that will pay seniors $ 250 to make up for the fact that they did n't get a Social Security cost - of - living increase this year ( because the cost of living did n't increase ) .
And Congress is in the process of repealing a scheduled increase in Medicare premiums . "
Older people vote in great numbers .
AARP is the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill .
Like the cut in doctor 's pay , the other cuts will never happen .
I will chew on razor blades when Congress cuts Medicare to keep the deficit from growing .
Medicare is already $ 37 trillion in the hole .
Yet the Democrats proudly cite Medicare when they demand support for the health care overhaul .
If a business pulled the accounting tricks the politicians get away with , the owners would be in prison .
John Stossel will soon host Stossel on the Fox Business Network .
He 's the author of Give Me a Break and of Myth , Lies , and Downright Stupidity .

Reproductive Strategies of Mangroves Mangroves have one of the most unique reproductive strategies in the plant world .
Mangroves are viviparous ( bringing forth live young ) , just like most mammals .
Rather than producing dormant resting seeds like most flowering plants , mangroves disperse propagules via water with varying degrees of vivipary or embryonic development while the propagule is attached to the parent tree .
The red mangrove flowers mostly during the summer months .
The long cigar shaped propagules are often found hanging on the tree all year long .
The black mangrove flowers all summer long with the lima bean shaped propagules produced during late summer and early fall .
The white mangrove flowers mid to late summer with small green pea shaped propagules produced a month later .
Once the propagule drops from the parent tree there is an obligate dispersal period which each species  propagule must remain in the water .
During this period embryonic development continues .
For the red mangrove this dispersal period is the longest at 40 days .
The black mangroves propagule must drift for at least 14 days .
The white mangroves dispersal period is the shortest at 5 days , which also includes germination .
If the propagule strands in a favorable  area , there is an obligate stranding period before the primary roots and cotyledons ( primary leaves ) emerge .
The red mangrove has the longest obligatory stranding period of 15 days .
However , the propagule may be lying horizontally on the sediment or vertically standing up  and may be covered by water during this time .

The Younger Dryas period was an era of extinctions and ecosystem change that occurred just prior to the end of the last ice age .
It 's also a hot area of research right now , with some researchers suggesting that a comet or meteor struck the earth over North America , killing off megafauna like mammoths and mastodons .
That prompted a response that suggested the evidence for an impact might just be a product of bad lab techniques .
Now , a new study is out that tracks the decline of these giant herbivores using what the researchers term a " dung fungus . "
It turns out they may have been dying off well in advance of the Younger Dryas .
The problem with figuring out cause and effect when it comes to the events of the Younger Dryas is that so many things happened in a geological blink of an eye .
The planet warmed rapidly about 15,000 years ago , bringing on the catchily named B�lling - Aller�d warm period .
But , instead of bringing the ice age to a close , the Younger Dryas arrived , returning glacial conditions to North America for over 1,000 years .
The ice age did n't truly end until about 12,000 years ago .
Somewhere during this climactic rollercoaster , humans arrived in North America in significant numbers , entire ecosystems that look nothing like the modern one came and vanished again , and every mammal that weighed more than 1,000kg went extinct — fully half of the mammals over 35kg died off , in fact .
There also may have been that meteor , although that 's looking less likely .
As the authors of the latest paper point out , the events of this time period might be a bit easier to sort out if we actually had a better sense of the timing of events .
Fossils of the megafauna are fairly abundant , but do n't necessarily provide a clear picture of their population levels , or indicate precisely when the last ones died out .
It 's also challenging to link fossils to a general picture of the prevailing ecosystem .
So , the authors do n't bother with mammoth and mastodon fossils at all , instead focusing on their poop .
Or , more specifically , the fungus Sporormiella .
This fungus creates spores that do n't mature unless they 've been through the digestive track of a herbivore , and they 've already been found in the remains of mammoths .
Although there were clearly other herbivores in North America , there have been past studies that indicate the general levels of the spores track the decline of the megafauna that used to dominate the ecology .
Conveniently , these spores are very tough , and they tend to get washed into the local bodies of water , where they get preserved along with the pollen and other debris that can be used to track the progression of different ecosystems .
Add some carbon dating to get temporal information , and it's possible to track the changes in herbivores and the ecosystems they once lived in .
The authors also include an analysis of carbon deposits associated with fires , which became more common as the Younger Dryas drew to a close .
At an Indiana site near Lake Michigan , the dung fungus started its decline over 14,000 years ago .
That predates the Younger Dryas by a significant margin , and actually seems to correspond with the start of the B�lling - Aller�d warm period .
The decline seems to correspond with a rise in the pollen from ash and ironwood in the same samples , and the start of a gradual decline in spruce .
Spruce does n't seem to move off the scene entirely until the end of the Younger Dryas , though ; by that time , it appears that mammoths and mastodons had already been gone from the ecosystem for over 1,000 years .
After about 700 years of pine dominance , something approaching the modern ecosystem began to appear .
It was only at this point that evidence of regular fires becomes common in these samples .
A single site is obviously not going to satisfy anyone , so the authors perform a similar analysis at three lakes in New York .
Two of them show a similar pattern of declining fungal spores in advance of significant ecosystem changes , and one of those shows a clear association between fires and the end of the Younger Dryas ; the third seems to have a very sparse record of the time span under study .
The authors say that a broader sampling of sites will be necessary to get a better sense of how well this pattern holds up .
Still , they say that their data can rule out at least two ideas that have been circulating about the Younger Dryas changes .
For one , ecosystem changes did n't drive the megafauna decline , since that decline started before changes in the foliage took place .
It also was nearly complete before the unique ecosystems of the Younger Dryas appeared , indicating that the megaherbivores could n't have contributed to the distinct characters of this plant life .
The data is consistent , however , with the onset of fire arising because of the different plant coverage that appeared after the herbivores vanished .
It 's also possible that humans enhanced this process .
The slow decline of megafauna also seems to rule out two of the more dramatic scenarios proposed about the Younger Dryas : the extraterrestrial impact , and humans hunting the animals to extinction .
Hunting undoubtedly would n't have helped a population in the midst of slow decline , but it does n't appear to have set off the decline .

The former evangelical rightwing leader explains how the GOP became a ' paranoid cult ' aiming to ' burn down our national home '
And how they still are in NY 's 23rd Congressional District election ...

What a weird life !
In the 1970s and 80s I helped my late Evangelical - leader , Religious Right founder father as his nepotistic sidekick .
We helped establish the Religious Right and send it on its merry way to doom .
Now I --- a backslider former Evangelical , former Republican --- watch in amazed fascination as once again the Right I helped launch like a nasty little torpedo into the guts of the Republican Party once again explodes .
Frank Rich explains ...
The battle for upstate New York confirms just how swiftly the right has devolved into a wacky , paranoid cult that is as eager to eat its own as it is to destroy Obama .
The movement 's undisputed leaders , Palin and Beck , neither of whom has what Palin once called the " actual responsibilities " of public office , would gladly see the Republican Party die on the cross of right - wing ideological purity .
Over the short term , at least , their wish could come true .
The New York fracas was ignited by the routine decision of 11 local Republican county chairmen to anoint an assemblywoman , Dede Scozzafava , as their party 's nominee for the vacant seat .
The 23rd is in safe Republican territory that has n't sent a Democrat to Congress in decades .
And Scozzafava is a mainstream conservative by New York standards ; one statistical measure found her voting record slightly to the right of her fellow Republicans in the Assembly .
But she has occasionally strayed from orthodoxy on social issues ( abortion , same - sex marriage ) and endorsed the Obama stimulus package .
To the right 's Jacobins , that 's cause to send her to the guillotine .
( " The G.O.P. Stalinists Invade Upstate New York " New York Times , Oct 31 , 09 )
But how did the GOP become a " paranoid cult " ?
The Republicans are arsonists who burned down our national home .
They combined the failed ideologies of the Religious Right , so - called free market deregulation and the Neoconservative love of war to light a fire that has consumed America .
I used to be one of them .
As recently as 2000 I worked to get Senator McCain elected in that year 's primary .
I have a file of handwritten thank you notes from Presidents Ford , Reagan , Bush I and II .
In the 1970s and early 80s I hung out with Jack Kemp and bought into his " supply side " myth and even wrote a book he endorsed pushing his ideas . )
There 's more , but take it from me ; my parents and I were about as tight with --- and useful to --- the Republican Party as anyone .
We played a big part creating the Religious Right .
In the mid 1980s I left the Religious Right , after I realized just how very anti-American they are , ( the theme I explore in my book Patience with God : Faith for People Who Don't Like Religion or Atheism ) .
They wanted America to fail in order to prove they were right about America 's " moral decline . "
They 're still at it .
Why are the ultra - conservatives , the loony " deather " , " birther " , " Obama - is - the - Antichrist " right killing their own party ?
Because they are into purity .
Problem is life is full of paradox !
Since the right wo n't accept colors other than black and white on their palette they are condemned to live in an alternative universe of absolutes in a world that demands nuance .
How can anyone who loves our country support the Republicans now ?
Barry church - and - state - must - be- separate Goldwater , William F. civility - is - next - to - godliness Buckley defined the modern conservatism that used to be what the Republican Party I belonged to was about .
No longer !
Today no actual conservative can be a Republican .
Reagan would despise today 's wholly negative Republican Party .
And
can you picture the gentlemanly and always polite Ronald I - legalized - abortion - in - California Reagan , endorsing a radio hate - jock slob who crudely mocked a man with Parkinson 's and who now says he wants an American president to fail ?!
With people like Palin , Limbaugh and Beck as the loudmouth image of the Republican Party --- Republicans need no enemies .
But something far more serious has happened than an image problem : the Republican Party has become the party of obstruction at just the time when all Americans should be pulling together for the good of our country .
Instead , Republicans are today 's fifth column sabotaging American renewal .
These are not just the " Party Of No " , these are the traitors who would rather legalize torture than medical care for all .
For the party that created our crises of misbegotten war , mismanaged economy , the lack of regulation of our banking industry , handing our country to rich crooks ... to obstruct the one person who is trying to repair the damage is obscene .
And now they are eating their own , since once you embrace purity no one is ever pure enough .
This is the result of replacing planet earth with planet ideology , politics with religion .
Unless you have n't been paying attention to the recent history of the Republican Party you will know that today Republican ideology and energy is derived from three sources : the Religious Right , the Neoconservative Movement and corporate business interests .
The Republican problem was and is a systemic disparagement of government , community , faith in our institutions , family , God 's creation and the mitigating institutions that put a check on something any party aligned with a religious movement should know all about : sin .
Greed is not the only problem .
The genius of the American system is supposedly that we have a system of checks and balances .
The Republicans destroyed those checks and balances by deregulation and by trying to turn America into a defacto theocracy .
Bush felt no guilt about promoting completely unqualified people to high posts merely on the basis of social , ideological or political connections .
I 'll take that a step further : I do n't think Bush ever wanted the government to work .
The Republicans have been trying to deconstruct our government for 40 years .
Now the national Republican leadership --- yes , that 's Beck , Limbaugh , Palin --- would rather have a completely unqualified goof run than a qualified person , in other words " do " governance the way Bush did , as long as ideology is served .
As Rich writes :
Who exactly is the third - party maverick arousing such ardor ?
Doug Hoffman does n't even live in the district .
When he appeared before the editorial board of The Watertown Daily Times 10 days ago , he " showed no grasp " of local issues , as the subsequent editorial put it .
Hoffman complained that he should have received the questions in advance --- blissfully unaware that they had been asked by the paper in an editorial on the morning of his visit .
If Republicans could feel shame there would have been a series of contrite public apologies by now for the fiasco of non-governing that typified the Bush administration .
My pension , other people 's pensions , our homes , jobs and economy are in chaos because of Republicans .
Young Americans are dying in Iraq because of Republicans .
They blew our chance in Afghanistan too .
The world is a more dangerous place because of Republicans .
Until President Obama was sworn in America was hated because of Republicans .
Far from saying they are sorry for the state our country is in the Republicans are now indulging in belligerent anti-Obama posturing on the one hand and a Stalinist purge of their own ranks on the other hand and a Church Lady - style sniffing out of anyone not purely crazy enough for them and sending them off to face the Palin / Beck / Limbaugh firing squad .
Why ?
Because the Republicans have become the party of perpetual fear of facts , fear of paradoxical dilemma and fear of truth .
Fear eats her young .

Go ahead .
Break the chains .
Stop paying on your mortgage if you owe more than the house is worth .
And most important :
Do n’t feel guilty about it .
Do n’t think you ’re doing something morally wrong .
That ’s the incendiary core message of a new academic paper by Brent T. White , a University of Arizona law school professor , titled “ Underwater and Not Walking Away : Shame , Fear and the Social Management of the Housing Crisis . ”
White contends that far more of the estimated 15 million U.S. homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages should stiff their lenders and take a hike .
Doing so , he suggests , could save some of them hundreds of thousands of dollars that they “ have no reasonable prospect of recouping ” in the years ahead .
Plus the penalties are nowhere near as painful or long - lasting as they might assume , he says .
“ Homeowners should be walking away in droves , ” White said .
“ But they are n’t .
And it ’s not because the financial costs of foreclosure outweigh the benefits . ”
Sure , credit scores get whacked when you walk away , he acknowledges .
But as long as you stay current with other creditors , “ one can have a good credit rating again -- meaning above 660 -- within two years after a foreclosure . ”
Better yet , homeowners can default “ strategically ” :
Buy all the major items they ’ll need for the next couple of years -- a new car , even a new house -- just before they pull the plug on their current mortgage lender .
“ Most individuals should be able to plan in advance for a few years of limited credit , ” White said , with minimal disruptions to their lifestyles .
What kind of law school professorial advice is this ?
Are n’t mortgages legal contracts ?
In so - called anti-deficiency states such as California and Arizona , mortgage lenders have limited or no legal rights to pursue defaulting homeowners ’ assets beyond the house itself , White said .
In other states , lenders may decide that it is not worth the legal expense to pursue walkaways , or consumers may be able to find flaws in the mortgage documents , disclosures or underwriting to challenge the original contract .
The main point , he said , is that too often people ’s emotions get in the way of clear financial thinking about mortgages , turning them into what he calls “ woodheads ” -- “ individuals who choose not to act in their own self - interest . ”
Most owners are too worried about feelings of shame and embarrassment after a foreclosure , and ignore the powerful financial reasons for doing so .
Buttressing these emotions is a system that White labels “ the social control of the housing crisis ” -- pressures and messages continually sent to consumers by the “ social control agents , ” namely banks , government and the media .
The mantra that these agents -- all the way up to President Obama -- pound into owners ’ heads ,
White said , is that “ voluntarily defaulting on a mortgage is immoral . ”
Yet there is an inherent imbalance in the borrower - lender relationship that makes this morality message unfair to consumers ,
White says : Banks set the rules during the housing boom , handing out home loans with no down payments , no income checks and inflated appraisals .
Now that property values have dropped 20 % to 50 % in many areas , banks have been slow to modify troubled mortgages and reluctant to reduce principal debts .
Only when homeowners cut through the emotional fog and default strategically in large numbers ,
White argues , will this inequitable situation be seriously addressed .
How does White ’s 52 - page manifesto go over with mortgage lenders ?
Predictably , not well .
Officials at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- investors who fund the bulk of all new mortgages in the country -- disputed White ’s characterization of how quickly after foreclosure a walkaway borrower can obtain a new loan .
It ’s not three years , they said , it ’s a minimum of five years , absent extenuating circumstances such as medical or employment problems that caused the foreclosure .
“ Borrowers who walk away from their mortgage obligations face serious consequences , ” including severely depressed credit scores for extended periods , said Brian Faith of Fannie Mae .
In addition , he said , “ there ’s a moral dimension to this as homeowners who simply abandon their homes contribute to the destabilization of their neighborhood and community . ”

A shocking new report has identified hundreds of victims of child sex abuse by Irish Catholic priests , officials and clerics say , two months after a landmark study found " endemic " mistreatment .
A government - appointed commission of investigation headed by a judge has been probing allegations of abuse by priests in the archdiocese of Dublin - the country 's biggest - since March 2006 .
Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin has warned that the report - being presented to Justice Minister Dermot Ahern on Tuesday - would " shock us all " .
It is the first time the state has investigated how the once - powerful Church in mainly Catholic Ireland has run its affairs .
It probed whether the Church reported abuse allegations or attempted to " obstruct , prevent or interfere with the proper investigation " of complaints .

Iggy Pop said his band recently returned to the studio for rehearsals Iggy Pop has revealed he will make a comeback with The Stooges in 2010 despite the recent death of guitarist Ron Asheton .
The singer said the 60 - year - old 's " spirit still lives on " within the group and the band will return next year for a full tour .
" The band have been rehearsing more without me than with me because I 've been doing other things this year .
" But we have been rehearsing all together more recently , " he said .
Pop continued : " We 're going to be doing a one - off show in Brazil in a few weeks but the real touring starts next year . "
Spiritual presence
The singer said Asheton 's " spirit still lives on " within the group and original guitarist James Williamson will rejoin the band after nearly 30 years .
" We 're all very sorry about Ron , " Pop told 6 Music presenter Shaun Keaveny .
" His spirit within the group remains with the rest of us and he is still a presence within the group without being on the physical plain .
I have no idea whether Elijah will be playing me , I doubt it
Iggy Pop , The Stooges " With the exception of ( Mike ) Watt we all played in the same bands during the same two or three years in the Detroit area and knew each other in various ways and did extra curricular things together besides playing music .
" Everybody went to the same bars and coffee shops and we swapped girls and did all the things you do . "
Asheton was found dead in his bed by police at his home in Ann Arbor , Michigan , in January this year .
It is believed he died of a heart attack .
He was an original member of the band fronted by Pop in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
His riffs featured on hits including I Wanna Be Your Dog , No Fun and Down On The Street .
Living legend Pop , who is due to receive the living legend award at the Marshall Classic Rock Roll of Honour awards , said right from the recording of early single 1969 , he was in it for the long haul .
" Once I set out not to go to school and go into music instead I always thought this is what I 'm doing with my life now .
" I never thought , ' Hey this is a youth market so by the time I 'm 24 I 'd better have my first $ 3 m ' .
Iggy Pop and The Stooges in their early days " It was never a career thing it was a life thing so it 's kind of worked out that way .
It seemed difficult and far fetched and I knew it was going to be tough . "
It has been reported Elijah Wood will be playing Pop in the forthcoming film biopic The Passenger .
But the singer said it was unlikely the Lord Of The Rings star would be taking up the role .
" I have no idea whether that is the case , I doubt it , " he added .
" I have n't had any contact with those people for a queen 's age , a long time .

( CNN ) --
An Oakland , California - area transit police officer was captured on video forcing an unruly man into a heavy - duty glass window , which shattered , during an arrest at a passenger station .
The video , posted on YouTube , shows an unidentified Bay Area Rapid Transit officer in a scuffle with a man whom authorities identified as Michael Joseph Gibson , 37 , of San Leandro , California .
Gibson , who appears disgruntled and gesturing while on a train at the West Oakland Station , is pulled off the train by an officer , who has the man in an arm grip .
The officer forcibly walks the man toward the station wall , which is topped by large windows , and one window shatters as the officer appears to force the man against it .
It was unclear exactly what caused the glass to break .
The incident happened about 5:40 p.m. PT Saturday ( 8:40 p.m. ET ) , according to a statement from BART police Sunday .
The officer sustained facial lacerations and a concussion , while Gibson suffered cuts to his hand , forearm , palm and a cut to his head .
Both were treated at a hospital .
" This is a use - of - force case that we will thoroughly investigate , " BART Police Patrol Commander Daniel O. Hartwig said in a statement .
" We will review all available information and video and are requesting anybody with any other video or information to please come forward . "
Once released , Gibson was booked into the Santa Rita County Jail .
He faces charges of battery on a police officer with injury and resisting arrest -- both felonies -- and public intoxication , a misdemeanor .
The officer was placed on leave due to his injuries , authorities said .
The suspect 's sister , Lisa Gibson , of Antioch , California , said Sunday that her brother was diagnosed with bipolar / schizophrenic disorder and is under a doctor 's care .
She said he was released from hospitalization earlier this month .
She said her brother appears to have been intoxicated in the video .
Still , she blasted the officer who made the arrest , saying , " Whoever this officer is should n't have a job .
He has no integrity and a combative mind - set . "
Saturday 's scuffle is the latest incident to draw attention to BART .
Johannes Mehserle , a former BART officer charged with murder in the January shooting death of an unarmed man at a transit station , faces trial in Los Angeles County .
The circumstances of the shooting -- also caught on video -- prompted widespread media coverage and protests .
In an October order moving the case , a judge cited those as factors affecting the likelihood of a fair trial in Alameda County , where the shooting happened .
Matt Wuerker ' Change has come ' ... or has it ?
In the year since he was elected president , Barack Obama has revealed himself as one of the boldest leaders to occupy the Oval Office in the modern era .
In that same year , Obama also has revealed himself to be an innately self - protective , constantly calibrating and , in some surprising ways , supremely conventional politician .

So who is Barack Obama ?
The drama of this presidency — in sharp relief with Wednesday ’s one - year anniversary of his 2008 triumph — revolves around how Obama navigates his own contradictions .
Obama turns out not to be a Bill Clinton - style centrist or a Paul Wellstone - style liberal .
His plans for health care and his trillion - plus dollars in new spending have earned the ire of Rush Limbaugh for being too grandiose and of Arianna Huffington for not being grandiose enough .
Obama is the president as grand improvisationalist : a leader of epic ambitions who — when faced with a difficult choice — almost always pursues his aims with a pedestrian strategy and style .
This may be a shrewd approach to governing .
But it manages almost by definition to defy and disappoint the huge — and wildly divergent — expectations Obama encouraged supporters to harbor for his presidency .
As the election anniversary approached , Obama several times in public remarks acknowledged the sense of letdown and pleaded for patience .
“ ‘ Well , why have n’t you solved world hunger yet ? ’ ” Obama said in New Orleans the other day , mimicking the cries of critics .
“ ‘ Why — it ’s been nine months .
Why ?’
You know ?
I never said it was going to be easy .
What did I say during the campaign ?
I said change is hard .
And big change is harder .
And after the last nine months , you know I was n’t kidding . ”
Obama may not have promised change would be easy .
But he did convey what now looks like a too - glib impression that he could unite opposites and reconcile contradictions by the power of personality — hard to do when his own personality has competing strands .
Obama has the soul of an ideologue .
He wants to be a transformational president — unconfined by the limitations of conventional politics and determined to put a lasting mark on his era .
In his first year , he has presided over more new domestic spending than Bill Clinton , the last Democratic president , did in eight years .
The “ big bang ” agenda he laid out earlier this year on health care , energy and financial regulation unmistakably signaled his ambition to vastly expand the role of government in American life .
But Obama also has the soul of an operative .
He and his West Wing team — dominated at the top by people whose expertise is in the world of campaigns and Washington maneuvers — have proved to be far more familiar political types than they admit to themselves or than was forecast by his insurgent campaign and the expansive , at times almost messianic , rhetoric that powered it .
“ What surprises me most is the loss of Barack Obama as movement leader , ” Malika Saada Saar , a human rights organizer , said on POLITICO ’s Arena forum .
As Obama ’s campaign reached its climax , in Saar ’s memory , it conjured up echoes of Martin Luther King Jr. and Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Now that he has entered office , she finds that spirit missing : “ During this time of economic decline , two raging wars and an uncertain future for so many Americans , we need a movement - leader president who can call forward our courage and relentlessly move us toward making the difficult policy changes that we need . ”
When it comes to policy , Obama is more willing than any Democratic president since Lyndon B. Johnson to propose expansive goals — but is insistent always on preserving flexibility in the name of realism or political self - protection .
On health care , it is clear that Obama ’s team is more concerned with a victory — one his team expects by the end of the year — than with the programmatic details .
On national security , he so far has offered far more continuity with George W. Bush on Iraq , Afghanistan and anti-terror policies than many of his most ardent supporters were expecting .
When it comes to politics , Obama and his team have proved more comfortable navigating within the Washington system that greeted them than with changing the culture of the capital .
A West Wing that features skilled operatives like Rahm Emanuel , David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs is no less politically obsessed than when Karl Rove roamed the same halls .
“ I suppose what has surprised me most is how quickly the promises of comity , outreach and post - partisanship were abandoned , ” James G. Gimpel , a professor of political science at the University of Maryland , said on the Arena forum .
“ But maybe that ’s because I was starting to believe the hype , and I should have maintained an appropriately skeptical stance all along .
In this last year , we have again been reminded that governing is not campaigning . ”
As it happens , the Obama team is never happier — as in its frequent public disputes with Fox News , Rush Limbaugh or the insurance industry — than when it can adopt campaign - style tactics to frame an adversary for public advantage .
The logic of this approach is clear but also plainly at odds with Obama ’s stated desire to unify Americans and drain politics of its anger and addiction to unproductive conflict .
In the year since Election Day , there is scant evidence that Obama remains a movement politician .
The legions of activists and volunteers — the people whose e-mail lists and social - networking skills were supposed to be a potent weapon in Obama ’s arsenal during legislative battles — have not made themselves felt in meaningful ways since last year .
And what looked like a transformative result -- an electoral map redrawn by Obama ’s ability to mobilize both the Democratic base and post - partisan independents -- now seems more tentative .
In 2008 , Obama became the first Democrat to win Virginia in 44 years , based on massive turnout from African - Americans and big support from independents .
In 2009 , the Democratic gubernatorial candidate was routed in Virginia , largely because of lower African - American turnout and a flight of independents toward the Republican .
If these trends are repeated nationally in 2010 and Democrats lose significant ground , Obama ’s ambitions to be a transformational president most likely will be put on pause .
Instead , he ’ll be forced to practice a more defensive brand of politics , much like Bill Clinton was after his party was routed in 1994 .
In terms of the culture of Washington , he has made it a bit harder for lobbyists to land government jobs ( though there have been plenty of exceptions granted to lobbyists Obama happened to especially want ) .
Yet few people in Washington still regard Obama — clearly at ease with establishment values and personalities — as a dangerous boat rocker .
The capital remains a bull market for special - interest deal making .
The pharmaceutical lobby , for instance , found Obama eager to do business in which drug makers ’ interests were protected in exchange for backing health care reform .
This let ’s - make - a - deal impulse is n’t pretty to watch sometimes , especially for Obama ’s more idealistic followers , but that does n’t mean it wo n’t pay off in the end .
Obama stands a good chance of passing a health reform bill in coming months , a significant win for the president even if Congress passes only a watered - down version of the bill .
But as the year wears on , there ’s a danger for Obama that all that improvisation could start to look feckless , not strategic but simply indecisive or lacking in principles .
He has so far avoided falling into the same trap as Clinton , for whom “ triangulation ” became a defining character trait , an all - purpose explanation for every compromise or centrist impulse or second helping at the dinner table .
Obama ’s backtracks are too fresh , and too discreet , to fully define him or become the narrative of his presidency , at least not yet .
But he ’s edging toward dangerous ground .
Nowhere is that clearer than Afghanistan .
He has carried out his deliberations in public view — either an impressive display of confidence by a young president willing to question his commanders ’ call for more troops or a slightly unnerving process of recalibration and second - guessing by a leader who set his Afghan strategy just seven months ago .
Obama made finishing the war in Afghanistan central to his campaign claims of a muscular foreign policy , but that was before a war - weary public soured so completely on the conflict ; and , now , even Obama is showing signs of doubt .
Other Obama lines in the sand are also getting blurred .
A one - year deadline to close Guantanamo ?
It wo n’t happen .
Pass health care before the August recess ?
Did n’t work out .
Crack down on Israeli settlements to restart the Mideast peace process ?
Not anymore .
The tension between transformational ambitions and conventional instincts even carries over to Obama ’s personal style .
What happened to the new Camelot that was to dawn over the Potomac ?
“ I think that was writers planting their hopes on the first couple .
I think that was fantasy , ” said Carol Joynt , who writes on the Washington scene for the New York Social Diary .
“ They ’re behaving like parents who travel a lot and live in a big house .
... I have n’t seen what some other people got all wound up about .
I have n’t seen radical change in fashion .
I have n’t seen radical change in the social scene . ”
This sense of disappointment , of letdown — how can a campaign that shattered so many expectations have produced a presidency that already feels quite ordinary ?
— extends from the nearly cosmic to the nearly comical .
What could be more conventional — more downright old - fashioned — than a president who likes to golf every Sunday , whose idea of sweeping change extends to lowering his own handicap ?
“ We thought we were getting a man of action .
Instead , we got someone who ’ll spend six hours chasing a white ball around a park , ” Joe Mathews , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation , said , with tongue planted only partly in cheek .
“ If voters had known about the golf , they would have been less surprised by his lack of urgency on many issues . ”

A federal judge today sentenced a Portland man to 50 years in prison for sexually abusing his two young daughters in a live Internet broadcast to other pedophiles .
The 35 - year - old man pleaded guilty in April to two charges of producing child pornography .
Investigators determined he abused his daughters on camera .
At the time , one of the girls was 2 years old and the other , who has special needs , was 10 .
He was one of five pedophiles arrested in a national investigation of parents and guardians who sexually abused children in their care on camera .
The government 's account of this investigation , documented in court papers , offers a glimpse at an online underworld in which arrested pedophiles are quick to inform on others .
The Oregonian is not naming the men in an effort to prevent identification of their children , who are sex - abuse victims .
The investigation began in 2006 as undercover investigators in North Carolina monitored Internet chat rooms visited by pedophiles .
They opened an online conversation with a Florida man , who broadcast live video clips of himself abusing his daughter .
Agents arrested that man , who told them he had watched a Texas man molest a young child as he watched and directed the abuse from Miami .
Both men pleaded guilty to producing child pornography and were sentenced to long prison terms .
Investigators took the Texas man 's screen name and chatted with a Pennsylvania man who had broadcast live video of him receiving oral sex from his 5 - year - old daughter .
The little girl told investigators that the man had abused her for at least a year , including a night in a New York hotel room in March 2007 .
The Pennsylvania man , who eventually drew a long prison sentence , helped agents identify two other pedophiles with whom he had shared lives images of child sexual abuse .
One of the men he identified was a registered sex offender in Virginia .
He was charged in March 2008 with producing child pornography .
While in jail and facing a potential life sentence , the man hanged himself .
The Pennsylvania pedophile told investigators that he had watched the Portland man receive oral sex from his daughters and have intercourse with the 10 - year - old .
U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones , who sentenced the Portland man , said it was one of the worst cases he had ever seen .

The push to prevent skin cancer may have come with unintended consequences — impaired brain function because of a deficiency of vitamin D . The “ sunshine vitamin ” is synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to direct sunlight , but sunblock impedes this process .
And although vitamin D is well known for promoting bone health and regulating vital calcium levels — hence its addition to milk — it does more than that .
Scientists have now linked this fat - soluble nutrient ’s hormonelike activity to a number of functions throughout the body , including the workings of the brain .
“ We know there are receptors for vitamin D throughout the central nervous system and in the hippocampus , ” said Robert J. Przybelski , a doctor and research scientist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health .
“ We also know vitamin D activates and deactivates enzymes in the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid that are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and nerve growth . ”
In addition , animal and laboratory studies suggest vitamin D protects neurons and reduces inflammation .
Two new European studies looking at vitamin D and cognitive function have taken us one step further .
The first study , led by neuroscientist David Llewellyn of the University of Cambridge , assessed vitamin D levels in more than 1,700 men and women from England , aged 65 or older .
Subjects were divided into four groups based on vitamin D blood levels : severely deficient , deficient , insufficient ( borderline ) and optimum , then tested for cognitive function .
The scientists found that the lower the subjects ’ vitamin D levels , the more negatively impacted was their perform­ance on a battery of mental tests .
Compared with people with optimum vitamin D levels , those in the lowest quartile were more than twice as likely to be cognitively impaired .
A second study , led by scientists at the University of Manchester in England and published online this past May , looked at vitamin D levels and cognitive performance in more than 3,100 men aged 40 to 79 in eight different countries across Europe .
The data show that those people with lower vitamin D levels exhibited slower information - processing speed .
This correlation was particularly strong among men older than 60 years .
“ The fact that this relationship was established in a large - scale , clinical human study is very important , ” Przybelski says , “ but there ’s still a lot we do n’t know . ”
Although we now know that low levels of vitamin D are associated with cognitive impairment , we do not know if high or optimum levels will lessen cognitive losses .
It is also unclear if giving vitamin D to those who lack it will help them regain some of these high - level functions .
Because cognitive impairment is often a precursor for dementia and Alzheimer ’s disease , vitamin D is a hot topic among Alzheimer ’s scientists , who are racing to answer these questions .
Przybelski , for example , is planning a study of vitamin D supplements in healthy , normal elderly adults living in an assisted - living community to see if it will affect their incidence of Alzheimer ’s in the long term .
So how much is enough vitamin D? Experts say 1,000 to 2,000 IU daily — about the amount your body will synthesize from 15 to 30 minutes of sun exposure two to three times a week — is the ideal range for almost all healthy adults .
Keep in mind , however , that skin color , where you live and how much skin you have exposed all affect how much vitamin D you can produce .
THE $ 29 second coming of the city ’s best $ 38 crab cake .
Fabled scallop ravioli that ’s just like the same dish at Paris ’ Lucas Carton — only for $ 12 .
In what alternative culinary universe can this be true ?
At the odd but compelling collaboration that is Ed’s Chowder House .
This is one of those new restaurants that certain pompous critics wo n’t get .
Its menu breaks no new ground .
There ’s no “ concept ” other than that it “ brings East Coast - style seafood to the Big Apple , ” as the publicity material states .
But it makes the work of seafood wizard Ed Brown available at prices more reasonable than ever before .
It brings all - American flair to Lincoln Square ’s ethnic gumbo of Bar Boulud , Cafe Fiorello and Shun Lee West .
It fills what was for most of eight years a dark hole in the Empire Hotel — and it gives owner Jeffrey Chodorow , who ’d become something of a punch line , a new lease on life .
In recent years , China Grill creator Chodorow has had more flops than Steve Phillips had floozies .
There were doomed collaborations with Alain Ducasse and Rocco DiSpirito , laugh - riot duds like Kobe Club — and CenterCut , the short - lived steakhouse that preceded Ed ’s Chowder House at the Empire .
Ed ’s breaks the losing streak .
It has more customers some nights than CenterCut saw in a week .
Whether it has legs depends on whether Chodorow and Brown — who runs the pricier , Michelin - starred Eighty - One on West 81st Street — continue to click .
The menu describes Brown not as “ executive ” or “ consulting ” chef but as “ collaborator , ” a role somewhere in between .
He devised the menu , set executive chef Jamie Knott ’s kitchen on its way and helps keep the ship on course despite his limited management role .
Chodorow smartly lightened up the L - shaped dining room .
A long wall mirror reflects street lamps outside .
Pale green banquettes replaced dark red ones , and fishing boat photos cast out steakhouse ghosts .
For Brown ’s most creative work , head to Eighty - One .
But Ed’s Chowder House delivers on its promise of “ serious local seafood in a casual setting ” — a commodity long missing in the neighborhood .
Its unpretentious pleasures go far beyond grilled Maine lobster for a remarkably modest $ 18 a pound .
Brown ran Rock Center ’s Sea Grill for 12 years .
That place ’s best dish was ( and still is ) the crab cake he created — nearly 100 percent , lump crab meat bound under a sprinkle of corn- flake crumbs by smoke , mirrors and a touch of egg yolk .
Ed ’s uses a tartar - like sauce in place of mustard sauce , but the recipe is otherwise the same and the result every bit as winning .
On the other hand , potato chip - crusted Chatham cod ( $ 24 ) is new .
Broken Cape Cod Kettle chips cracklingly complement the delicate fish .
Other fine entrees are “ simple mains ” ( $ 18 - $ 25 ) grilled a la plancha in olive oil , especially “ tuna frittes , ” a filet mignon - proportioned cut miraculously moist throughout with seasoned fries ; buttery - textured blackfish without butter ; and sea scallops rich with mineral flavor .
Not to miss is a generous sample of three chowders for just $ 12 .
One , sweet corn chowder , is so rich , it ’s hard to believe it ’s made entirely from blender - puréed corn .
A number called “ Ed ’s loaded shellfish ” is a meal in a cast - iron cauldron for $ 15 — New England chowder crammed with shrimp , crabmeat , scallops and lobster .
I did n’t have a single clinker .
But some dishes were in the “ are what they are ” class — including ordinary smoked cod cakes , cured / smoked salmon and disappointingly dull striped bass .
Desserts are unspectacular .
Many fish joints are expensive ( Oceana and Le Bernardin ) , too esoteric for some ( Esca and Milos ) , or cramped and noisy ( Pearl Oyster Bar ) .
Ed ’s Chowder House avoids their liabilities without sacrificing enough imagination to be interesting .
Keep it up , Jeffrey and Ed — and pay no attention to the whiners .

While domestic insurgencies chip away at the control of Yemen 's central government and an Al Qaeda branch gains strength in regions beyond the government 's reach , another crisis — one that affects Yemen 's entire population — has the potential to contribute to the country 's instability and potential trajectory toward failure .
Yemen is running out of water – fast .
But the water crisis and the rise of militancy are not unrelated perils said Abdulrahman Al Eryani , Yemen 's minister of Water and Environment , in an interview .
Much of the country 's rising militancy , he argues , is a conflict over resources .
" They manifest themselves in very different ways : tribal conflicts , sectarian conflicts , political conflicts .
Really they are all about sharing and participating in the resources of the country , either oil , or water and land , " said Minister Eryani .
" Some researchers from Sanaa University had very alarming figures .
They said that between 70 - 80 percent of all rural conflicts in Yemen are related to water . "
Khalid Al - Thour , a geology professor at Sanaa University , adds that recent reports have indicated that Sanaa 's wells will run dry by 2015 at current water - usage rates .
In their 2009 Failed States Index , Foreign Policy magazine topped their analysis with a sobering assessment of Yemen as " a perfect storm of state failure , " including disappearing oil and water reserves .
The World Bank considers Yemen " one of the most water - scarce countries in the world " where only 125 cubic meters of water are available yearly per capita compared to the world average of 2,500 cubic meters .
Just 46 percent of Yemen 's rural population has direct access to an adequate water supply and the number is only slighter better in cities , according to the German Development Service ( GDS ) , which is working with the Yemeni government to improve water management .
Public access to water is particularly sparse in Taiz , Yemen 's third - largest city , where access to public water tanks is allowed only once every 45 days .
When households run out of their personal water supply they have the option to buy water from private companies but in Yemen , where 42 percent of the population lives beneath the poverty line , many rely on charity from mosques to meet their needs , says Dierk Schlutter , coordinator for water and environment for GDS .
Soaring population , illegal wells , qat
Yemen 's population of 23 million has almost tripled since 1975 , according to UN statistics , and available water resources simply cannot cope .
The soaring population paired with poor management of water resources has led to what Dr. Thour calls a " disastrous situation . "
He says that the illegal drilling of wells into natural groundwater aquifers is increasing at an alarming rate and leaky pipes that waste up to 60 percent of water in urban areas are major culprits .
Although water usage regulations are in place to tackle these issues , the government lacks the ability to enforce them .
" We have a war and we have all these troubles so the government does n't want to think about water , " says Thour .
Furthermore the production of qat – a mild narcotic that as a staple of Yemeni social gatherings is a driving force in Yemen 's economy – uses up to 40 percent of available water in the capital Sanaa 's water basin , according to the Ministry of Water and Environment .
Qat farming has only increased in recent years .
" There is enough water for provision of a city of 2 million like Sanaa , if the people do n't drill illegally in the outskirts and take the water for irrigation of a cash crop like qat , " says Dr. Schlutter .
" It 's a very complicated social issue because of the social value of qat chewing in this society . "
Yemenis reluctant to accept solutions
Experts say potential solutions to Yemen 's water crisis include increasing the implementation of rainwater harvesting in rural areas and modern irrigation techniques that waste less water than current methods .
However , the challenge is convincing Yemenis that these changes to the status quo will bring economic benefits as well .
" You do n't need to tell people who are fighting everyday to get water that there is a crisis .
What is lacking is providing them with alternatives and options about what they should do , " said Eryani .
" The main problem is that you have to create incentives , even if people understand what they should do if there is no incentive they wont do it ... and the best incentive of course is economic . "
In a recent article entitled Whither NikonI looked at Nikon ’s introduction of its new DX lens line , designed for reduced frame digital cameras .
I questioned the wisdom of this move , beyond providing true wide - angle capability to existing DSLRs .
In this commentary Nikon photographer Jim Norris explores the current state of Nikon lens mount based digital cameras .

A Wide Variety of Cameras — Three Different Manufacturers
Many of us have used Nikon cameras for years and have accumulated a collection of Nikon or Nikon - compatible lenses and accessories .
We should consider ourselves lucky since it looks like only Canon , Contax , Pentax and Nikon lenses will be useable with the new generation of digital single lens reflex cameras .
Pity those who have extensive Leica , Olympus or Minolta lens collections .
Their migration path to the world of digital is much more problematic , not to mention expensive .
The revolution in digital imaging has reached the point that every “ serious ” photographer has to consider going digital .
Luckily , with Nikon , you have several choices .
In fact this is one of the great strengths of the Nikon lens system .
There are three different manufacturers currently making digital SLRs that use the classic Nikon lens mount — Nikon , Fuji and Kodak .
Currently , the cameras to choose from are :
Each camera is aimed at a different audience :
• TheNikon D1Hif you ’re a sports photographer , or work for a newspaper or magazine ( print or electronic ) .
• The Fuji S2 , Nikon D1X , Kodak DCS 760 if you ’re a photographer who rarely has to make enlargements larger than 16×20 .
• The Nikon D100 if you ’re a photographer who needs a lightweight camera with high resolution .
• The Kodak DCS
Pro 14 nif you ’re a photographer who routinely makes enlargements larger than 16 × 20 , or you crop your images substantially .
But wait ; how can I recommend that anyone buy anything other than a “ full frame ” DSLR ?
Is n’t the only way to go right now the Kodak 14n ?
Should n’t I move to the Kodak or at least wait until Nikon introduces its full frame model ?
Frankly , no …
For example , I use a D1X for wildlife photography ( using primarily the Nikon 80 - 400 VR lens ) and find that the 1.5 magnification ( actually cropping ) factor is a great help in getting close to the wildlife subjects that I shoot .
And , with this lens as well as several other Nikon lenses I am able to make 24×30 ” enlargements using an Epson 7600 printer .
Now , of course , not every image will be suitable for that degree of enlargement .
The main reasons I have found for unsuitability are poor photographic technique — not quite in focus , camera shake , etc .
Of course , the magnification factor of this camera , and all of the others except the Kodak DCS14n , takes it toll when it comes to wide - angle photography .
That ’s why I ’m actually looking forward to the new DX series of lenses .
Once my wide angle needs are met the 1.5X cropping factor simply wo n’t be an issue for me .
Ensuring Success
Because successful digital photography is a “ process ” , Nikon shooters have to be aware of a few issues that will insure your images are of the highest quality possible :
• Shoot in uncompressed RAW • UseBibbleto convert to TIFFs in 4018 x 2624 mode . •
When making very large prints enlarge your images using Photoshop bicubic sampling , but enlarge only 110 % at a time .
( Fred Mirandahas an action on his web site that will do this automatically . ) •
Do n’t sharpen until you are ready to print , and then spend some time with the parameters .
Start at about ( 400 , 0.8 , 3 ) and experiment until you get the degree of sharpening you want .
•
If you ’re using a flash , remember that unless the Nikon flash unit ’s name ends in DX , with wo n’t work in TTL mode with the D series cameras .
•
If you like to do macro photography , as I do , realize that the SB29 ring flash will not work with the D series .
The SB 29s will work , but not in TTL mode .
I now use an SB 80 DX on a sync cord for macro work ; it works quite well .
I have shot pictures with all the cameras listed above ( other than the DCS 14n ) and they ’re all excellent for their intended use .
The biggest drawback right now is price .
In that regard the imminent introduction of the DCS 14n at $ 4,999 may work to the advantage of someone who understands his or her real needs .
I would suspect that the prices for all these cameras , other than possibly the D100 , will drop as the “ full frame ” models come to market .

Announcing Kong : A server description and deployment testing tool ¶
At work we have to manage a ton of Django based sites .
Just for our World Company sites , we have over 50 different settings files , and this does n’t take into account the sites that we host for other clients .
At this size it becomes basically impossible to test each site in a browser when you push things to production .
To solve this problem I have written a very basic server description tool .
This allows you to describe sites ( settings file , python path , url , etc. ) and servers .
You can see a basic version running for my personal site .
It is super barebones , but it should give you an idea of what exactly is possible .
The source is available on Github .
A 0.1 release will be uploaded to Pypi soon , after a few of the blemishes have been worked out .
I would like to thank Nathan Borror for the design parts that are pretty :)
What does it do ?¶
On top of this base , I have written a way to run tests against these sites .
You can categorize the sites by the type of site they are ( We have Marketplace , ported Ellington , and old Ellington sites ) .
This allows you to run tests against different types of sites .
You may also have custom applications that run on only one or two certain domains .
You can specify specific sites for tests to be run against as well .
The tests are written in Twill , which is a simple Python DSL for testing .
Twill was chosen because it is really simple , and does functional testing well .
The twill tests are actually rendered as Django templates , so you get the site that you are testing against in the context .
A simple example that tests the front page of a site is as follows : go {{ site .
url }} code 200 find " Latest News "
This simply loads the Site ’s front page , checks that the status code was 200 , and checks that the string Latest News is on that page .
The arguments to find are actually a regex , allowing for lots of power in checking for content .
This then gives you the ability to view all of the results for your tests in a web interface .
Below is an example of the live view that I see when looking at our servers .
We have only just started using Kong , but the tests it provides are really useful to make sure that functionality works after a deployment .
You can also see the history of a test on a site .
Currently it shows the last 15 results , but paginating this page will be easy .
It allows you to see if your test has been running well over time .
Another nice thing is that it measures the Duration of the test , so that you can see if it is going slow or fast .
As you can see , the data display is really basic .
It will be improved , but currently its basically the “ simplest thing that could possibly work ” .
Application security vendor Cenzic today released its security trends report for the first half of 2009 application .
In it , Cenzic claims that the Mozilla 's Firefox browser led the field of Web browsers in terms of total vulnerabilities .
According to Cenzic , Firefox accounted for 44 percent of all browser vulnerabilities reported in the first half of 2009 .
In contrast , Apple 's Safari had 35 percent of all reported browser vulnerability , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer was third at 15 percent and Opera had just six percent share .
The 2009 figures stand in contrast to Cenzic 's Q3 / Q4 2008 report , where IE accounted for 43 percent of all reported Web browser vulnerabilities and Firefox followed closely at 39 percent .
As to why Firefox 's numbers were so high , Cenzic has a few ideas .
" It 's a combination of different things , " Lars Ewe , CTO of Cenzic , told InternetNews.com .
" They 've gotten more traction as a browser , which is good for them and the more you get used the more exposure you have .
As well a fair amount of the vulnerabilities have come by way of plug-ins . "
One key area that Ewe said was responsible for a number of reported Firefox vulnerabilities is with how the browser handles plug-ins .
" The plug - in architecture that they have is a selling fact for the browser and one of the reasons why I love using it , " Ewe said .
" They can't control security aspects of all the plug-ins and the vulnerabilities are a side effect of that . "
Mozilla has made numerous efforts this year to bolster its plug - in security .
Recently they launched a plug - in checker service to ensure that users are running up - to - date versions .
The Firefox 3.0.9 update , which came out in April , specifically addressed several key plug - in vulnerabilities .
Though Firefox had the highest number of vulnerabilities , that does n't necessarily mean that Firefox users were more vulnerable .
Ewe said that Cenzic looked at all reported vulnerabilities .
There is no specific differentiation for zero day bugs in the browser vulnerability count either .
All that raises the question of how Cenzic actually came up with their vulnerability counts in the first place .
" The process that we follow is looking at a number of different vulnerability databases and sources that we have and trying to come up with a fair percentage based on the deviations we see between the databases , " Ewe said .
" You could make the argument , that 's its 40 percent or 42 percent and there might be some variation on how you analyze it , but certainly it 's not off by 20 percent . "
While the Cenzic report shows Firefox at the top of the browser vulnerability pile , Ewe was quick to note that Cenzic uses Mozilla technology within its own solutions .
" Full disclosure here , Mozilla plays an important role in Cenzic 's solution , " Ewe said .
" We are actually sitting on top of Mozilla as our agent of preference for scanning sites . "
Cenzic develops an application scanning solution that uses the underlying Mozilla browser technology to test out security on Web site insides of a real browser context .
" We have a technology that we refer to as stateful assessment technology , " Ewe said .
" The idea behind it is to have as faithful an interaction with a Web site as possible and to determine vulnerabilities not on simple signatures but on behavioral basis of the application . "
Ewe explained that when you do a cross - site scripting attack with a signature - based approach you 'd just look for a server response that would indicate that the script tag has been injected .
He added that the problem with that approach is that it's not faithful and the security researcher does n't know if there is any additional logic on the client side that takes care of the script tag .
" If you want to be really faithful in the process you need to have full rendering capabilities and have all the JavaScript event handling , " Ewe said .
" So we leverage the entire Firefox architecture in order for us to actually have as faithful an interaction with a server as possible and maintain the client state .
That results in low false - positives . "
This project is not part of the GNU Project .
This is a small utility to redirect file descriptors of running processes and more generally tweak them .
It works by attaching with ptrace to an existing process and forcing it to execute some syscall .
This way you can force a process to drop privileges , to redirect a file descriptor to a file or a tcp / ip connection , to connect a descriptor to the descriptor of another running process with a unix socket , or to set a file descriptor equal to the descriptor of another running process ( unix file descriptor passing is used ) .
Since the code hooks are architecture - dependent , at the moment only the linux - x86 and linux - x86_64 architectures are supported .
Patches for other architectures are welcome .

Here 's a quick 3 minute TED video by Mathemagician Arthur Benjamin .
The topic : Benjamin's idea about how to change Math education .
He makes the point that Math education is like a pyramid with all classes ( e.g. algebra , geometry , trigonometry ) building up to calculus .
But , he argues , calculus is not very useful to many of us in our ordinary lives .
So , what should the pinnacle of the Math pyramid be ?

Despite a 30 - year lifespan that gives ample time for cells to grow cancerous , a small rodent species called a naked mole rat has never been found with tumors of any kind -- and now biologists at the University of Rochester think they know why .
The findings , presented in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , show that the mole rat 's cells express a gene called p16 that makes the cells " claustrophobic , " stopping the cells ' proliferation when too many of them crowd together , cutting off runaway growth before it can start .
The effect of p16 is so pronounced that when researchers mutated the cells to induce a tumor , the cells ' growth barely changed , whereas regular mouse cells became fully cancerous .
" We think we 've found the reason these mole rats do n't get cancer , and it 's a bit of a surprise , " says Vera Gorbunova , associate professor of biology at the University of Rochester and lead investigator on the discovery .
" It 's very early to speculate about the implications , but if the effect of p16 can be simulated in humans we might have a way to halt cancer before it starts . "
Naked mole rats are strange , ugly , nearly hairless mouse - like creatures that live in underground communities .
Unlike any other mammal , these communities consist of queens and workers more reminiscent of bees than rodents .
Naked mole rats can live up to 30 years , which is exceptionally long for a small rodent .
Despite large numbers of naked mole - rats under observation , there has never been a single recorded case of a mole rat contracting cancer , says Gorbunova .
Adding to their mystery is the fact that mole rats appear to age very little until the very end of their lives .
Over the last three years , Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov , research professor of biology at the University of Rochester , have worked an unusual angle on the quest to understand cancer :
Investigating rodents from across the globe to get an idea of the similarities and differences of how varied but closely related species deal with cancer .
In 2006 , Gorbunova discovered that telomerase -- an enzyme that can lengthen the lives of cells , but can also increase the rate of cancer -- is highly active in small rodents , but not in large ones .

Until Gorbunova and Seluanov 's research , the prevailing wisdom had assumed that an animal that lived as long as we humans do needed to suppress telomerase activity to guard against cancer .
Telomerase helps cells reproduce , and cancer is essentially runaway cellular reproduction , so an animal living for 70 years has a lot of chances for its cells to mutate into cancer , says Gorbunova .
A mouse 's life expectancy is shortened by other factors in nature , such as predation , so it was thought the mouse could afford the slim cancer risk to benefit from telomerase 's ability to speed healing .
While the findings were a surprise , they revealed another question :
What about small animals like the common grey squirrel that live for 24 years or more ?
With telomerase fully active over such a long period , why is n't cancer rampant in these creatures ?
Gorbunova sought to answer that question , and in 2008 confirmed that small - bodied rodents with long lifespans had evolved a previously unknown anti-cancer mechanism that appears to be different from any anticancer mechanisms employed by humans or other large mammals .
At the time she was not able to identify just what the mechanism might be , saying : " We have n't come across this anticancer mechanism before because it does n't exist in the two species most often used for cancer research : mice and humans .
Mice are short - lived and humans are large - bodied .
But this mechanism appears to exist only in small , long - lived animals . "
Now , Gorbunova believes she has found the primary reason these small animals are staying cancer - free , and it appears to be a kind of overcrowding early - warning gene that the naked mole rat expresses in its cells .

When Gorbunova and her team began specifically investigating mole rat cells , they were surprised at how difficult it was to grow the cells in the lab for study .
The cells simply refused to replicate once a certain number of them occupied a space .
Other cells , such as human cells , also cease replication when their populations become too dense , but the mole rat cells were reaching their limit much earlier than other animals ' cells .
" Since cancer is basically runaway cell replication , we realized that whatever was doing this was probably the same thing that prevented cancer from ever getting started in the mole rats , " says Gorbunova .
Like many animals , including humans , the mole rats have a gene called p27 that prevents cellular overcrowding , but the mole rats use another , earlier defense in gene p16 .
Cancer cells tend to find ways around p27 , but mole rats have a double barrier that a cell must overcome before it can grow uncontrollably .
" We believe the additional layer of protection conferred by this two - tiered contact inhibition contributes to the remarkable tumor resistance of the naked mole rat , " says Gorbunova in the PNAS paper .
Gorbunova and Seluanov are now planning to delve deeper into the mole rat 's genetics to see if their cancer resistance might be applicable to humans .
This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Ellison Medical Foundation .
A slim new Xbox 360 2010 model is not completely likely , but Xbox Slim 360 idea is beneficial for MS .
With the hardware launches of 2009 out of the way and the PS3 slim off to a decent start , attention switches to what we might expect in 2010 .
At first glance , predictions of a slimmed down version of the Xbox 360 seem reasonable .
As a betting man however , ( and thanks to a beach ball on the pitch , I ’ve some cash to spare ) I ’m banking on that not happening , at least not next year .
Before we delve into why , I should clarify that I ’m not suggesting it wo n’t happen eventually .
The economics of the console business dictate that vendors actively work to reduce production costs over their platform ’s lifetime culminating in the ability to produce a smaller , cooler unit much more cheaply .
Asides from the logistics of shipping smaller boxes around the world the uplift in sales a new hardware release brings is undeniable , just ask Sony .
The latter however , had a far greater imperative to get the PS3 slim out the door .
Microsoft ’s needs are a lot more different than the by - the - numbers analysts are perhaps giving them credit for .
It ’s arguable whether they need a 360 slim at all , even more so that they need one soon .
Microsoft are a software company at heart , not a hardware one .
This fundamental truth underpins almost everything else .
Sony have been in the business of producing consumer electronics for years and have vast resources dedicated to it .
The same is not true of Microsoft .
They are only in the hardware business in the first place purely out of necessity .
As considerable as the war chest of cash held by the Redmond giant might be , it is still inversely proportional to the in house manufacturing expertise in it ’s possession and likely at least one order of magnitude smaller in size compared to Sony .
As both Xbox Live and the NXE shows , Microsoft prefers to tackle things in software terms where possible .
The hardware is usually only a last resort and left to a smaller team who must pick and choose their battles .
Three red lights
Which mean problems like the infamous RRoD can set a smaller team back years .
A staggering $ 1 billion was written off to deal with this issue and even for a company as cash rich as Microsoft , that ’s a huge amount of money which likely ate into budgets allocated for hardware R&D .
Moreover , once the true enormity of the problem became apparent it immediately became a priority above everything and everyone else , unless you got lucky and had already been shifted over to working on the Zune project .
Eventually , not one but two new hardware developments were designed to tackle the problem .
The new heatsink design which initially appeared on the Zephyr unit and the Opus board designed to be installed in units sent back for repair .
All in all a big distraction , potentially leaving little time for much else in the first couple of years of the Xbox 360 ’s lifecycle .
Codename leaks
Speaking of codenames , leaks of the motherboard designs Microsoft have been working on for the Xbox 360 have been prevalent over it ’s life - time .
In addition to RRoD , excessive fan / disc noise , power usage & the ability to crack the device ’s security have caused enthusiasts to actively seek out and document later Xbox 360 revisions , a trend with roots which go back to the original Xbox which spawned a dedicated community picking up every snippet of information like a hawk .
In recent times however , the small but constant drip of new information has gone quiet .
Only the feintest of chatter about the rumoured “ Valhalla ” board did the rounds towards the beginning of last year and has n’t been recycled or expanded much upon since .
Supposedly a board combining the Xbox 360 ’s CPU and GPU onto one smaller manufacturing process chip , it would be tailor made for a 360 Slim or at the very least a big cost saving .
Significant news in itself so the question is , where is it ?
It ’s difficult to believe Microsoft suddenly got a lot better at keeping these things quiet .
What happened ?
Project Natal
It might not be quite accurate to say Project Natal ‘ happened ’ .
After all , Peter Moore hinted at controller experimentation as early as 2006 .
The catalyst however might just have been the Wii ’s roaring success .
It would n’t be the most outrageous statement to suggest that Microsoft considers their battle with Sony this generation as a job already well done .
At times , they certainly talk like it .
If the focus has switched to the Wii , Microsoft surely realised that competing on cost reduction and making a smaller box would not only be a fruitless endeavor ( Nintendo would always be way ahead in these areas having made the Wii on older technology and profitable from the start ) , but also a side issue .
The priority needed to be on responding to the Wii remote .
Natal is a massive project for Microsoft getting launch level emphasis and investment .
It effectively is the next generation .
For it to be a success , it not only needs to work as advertised but also be as cheap as possible for Microsoft to reach the intended audience .
There is n’t a bigger priority right now than Natal .
Are they throwing resource at a slim model at the same time to go with it or focusing 100 % on Natal ?
My money , is on the latter .
Money where your mouth is
Like all idle speculation , almost everything above can be met with a counter argument .
Microsoft would be daft not to make a 360 Slim , they ’ve a track record of following Sony ’s business model very closely .
Having planned for a hardware iteration every year , it ’s likely a slim version was at least in the plan .
Valhalla might not be dead , even Steve Balmer has made throwaway remarks to a “ new ” Xbox in 2010 .
To put too much emphasis on the latter however is to misunderstand what the Xbox platform is .
Philosophically , the platform is LIVE , not the physical box it lives on .
Before a piece of hardware even saw the light of day , the original idea was to simply provide an operating system for the PlayStation .
Live
Anywhere , might have gone AWOL but the emphasis on LIVE being the real platform was very , very clear .
Only time will tell , but if the bookies would open up such a market , I know where my money would be .
* Images are of an awesome Xbox 360 laptop mod by Ben Heck whose site you should definitely check out .
Update 25th October 2009 : We ’ve added a Hubdub prediction market below to get a better handle on what everyone thinks .
Thanks for the feedback so far !
Will there be an Xbox 360 Slim released in 2010 ?

Remarks by Chris Powell , Secretary / Treasurer
Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc .
International Precious Metals and Commodities Show
Olympia Park , Munich , Germany
Saturday , November 7 , 2009
Thank you for coming to listen to me today .
Please forgive my inability to speak German .
I 'll be discussing many documents , some of them fairly complicated , but do n't worry if you miss something about them .
They 'll be posted at GATA 's Internet site with these remarks .
On Friday , September 25 , Jim Rickards , director of market intelligence for the Omnis consulting firm in McLean , Virginia . , was interviewed on the cable television network CNBC in the United States .
Talking about the currency markets , Rickards remarked : " When you own gold you 're fighting every central bank in the world . "
That 's because gold is a currency that competes with government currencies and has a powerful influence on interest rates and the price of government bonds .
And that 's why central banks long have tried to suppress the price of gold .
Gold is the ticket out of the central banking system , the escape from coercive central bank and government power .
As an independent currency , a currency to which investors can resort when they are dissatisfied with government currencies , gold carries the enormous power to discipline governments , to call them to account for their inflation of the money supply and to warn the world against it .
Because gold is the vehicle of escape from the central bank system , the manipulation of the gold market is the manipulation that makes possible all other market manipulation by government .
Of course what Jim Rickards said about gold was no surprise to my organization , the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee .
To the contrary , what Rickards said has been our premise for most of our 10 years , and we have documented it extensively .
Rickards ' assertion was spectacular simply because he was allowed to make it in the mainstream financial news media and was allowed to keep talking .
While the gold price suppression scheme is a hard fact of history , it is seldom mentioned in polite company in the financial world .
I have been asked to talk about it here .
I am grateful for this invitation and I will try to be polite .
How have central banks tried to suppress the price of gold ?
The gold price suppression scheme was undertaken openly by governments for a long time prior to 1971 .
That 's what the gold standard was about -- governments fixing the price of gold to a precise value in their currencies , a price at which governments would exchange their currencies for gold , currencies that were backed by gold .
Though the gold standard was abandoned during World War I , restored briefly in the 1920s , and then abandoned again during the Great Depression , that was not the end of government efforts to control the gold price .
Throughout the 1960s the United States and Great Britain attempted to hold the price at $ 35 in a public arrangement of the dishoarding of U.S. gold reserves .
This arrangement came to be known as the London Gold Pool .
As monetary inflation rose sharply , the London Gold Pool was overwhelmed by demand and was shut down abruptly in April 1968 .
Three years later , in 1971 , the United States repudiated the remaining convertibility of the dollar into gold -- convertibility for government treasuries that wanted to exchange dollars for gold .
At that moment currencies began to float against each other and against gold -- or so the world was told .
For since 1971 the gold price suppression scheme has been undertaken largely surreptitiously , seldom acknowledged officially .
But sometimes it has been acknowledged officially , and with a little detective work , more about it can be discovered .
You may have heard GATA derided as a " conspiracy theory " organization .
We are not that at all .
To the contrary , we examine the public record , produce documentation , question public officials , and publicize their most interesting answers , or their most interesting refusals to answer .
I 'd like to review some of the public record with you .
The gold price suppression scheme became a matter of public record in January 1995 , when the general counsel of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board , J. Virgil Mattingly , told the Federal Open Market Committee , according to the committee 's minutes , that the U.S. Treasury Department 's Exchange Stabilization Fund had undertaken gold swaps .
Gold swaps are exchanges of gold allowing one central bank to intervene in the gold market on behalf of another central bank , potentially giving anonymity to the central bank that wants to undertake the intervention .
The 1995 Federal Open Market Committee minutes in which Mattingly acknowledges gold swaps are still posted at the Fed 's Internet site :
http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19950201meeting.p...
The gold price suppression scheme was a matter of public record in July 1998 , six months before GATA was formed , when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress : " Central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise . "
That is , Greenspan himself , supposedly the greatest among the central bankers , contradicted the usual central bank explanation for leasing gold -- which was supposedly to earn a little interest on a dead asset -- and admitted that gold leasing is all about suppressing the price .
Greenspan 's admission is still posted at the Fed 's Internet site :
http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/1998/19980724.htm
Incidentally , while we gold bugs love to cite Greenspan 's testimony from 1998 because of its reference to gold leasing , that testimony was mainly about something else , for which it is far more important today .
For with that testimony Greenspan persuaded Congress not to regulate the sort of financial derivatives that lately have devastated the world financial system .
The Washington Agreement on Gold , made by the European central banks in 1999 , was another admission -- no , a proclamation that central banks were working together to control the gold price .
The central banks making the Washington Agreement claimed that , by restricting their gold sales and leasing , they meant to prevent the gold price from falling too hard .
But even if you believed that explanation , it was still collusive intervention in the gold market .
You can find the Washington Agreement at the World Gold Council 's Internet site :
http://www.reserveasset.gold.org/central_bank_agreements/cbga1/
Barrick Gold , then the largest gold - mining company in the world , confessed to the gold price suppression scheme in U.S. District Court in New Orleans on February 28 , 2003 .
That is when Barrick filed a motion to dismiss Blanchard & Co. 's anti-trust lawsuit against Barrick and its bullion banker , JPMorganChase , for rigging the gold market .
Barrick 's motion claimed that in borrowing gold from central banks and selling it , the mining company had become the agent of the central banks in the gold market , and , as the agent of the central banks , Barrick should share their sovereign immunity and be exempt from suit .
Barrick 's confession to the gold price suppression scheme is posted at GATA 's Internet site :
http://www.gata.org/files/BarrickConfessionMotionToDismiss.pdf
The Reserve Bank of Australia confessed to the gold price suppression scheme in its annual report for 2003 .
" Foreign currency reserve assets and gold , " the Reserve Bank 's report said , " are held primarily to support intervention in the foreign exchange market . "
The bank 's report is still posted at its Internet site :
http://www.rba.gov.au/PublicationsAndResearch/RBAAnnualReports/2003/Pdf/...
Maybe the most brazen admission of the Western central bank scheme to suppress the gold price was made by the head of the monetary and economic department of the Bank for International Settlements , William S. White , in a speech to a BIS conference in Basel , Switzerland , in June 2005 .
There are five main purposes of central bank cooperation , White announced , and one of them is " the provision of international credits and joint efforts to influence asset prices ( especially gold and foreign exchange ) in circumstances where this might be thought useful . "
White 's speech is posted at GATA 's Internet site :

In January this year a remarkable 16 - page memorandum was discovered in the archive of the late Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin .
The memorandum is dated April 5 , 1961 , and is titled " U.S. Foreign Exchange Operations : Needs and Methods . "
It is a detailed plan of surreptitious intervention to rig the currency and gold markets to support the dollar and to conceal , obscure , or falsify U.S. government records and reports so that the rigging might not be discovered .
This document remains on the Internet site of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis :
http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/historical/martin/23_06_19610405.pdf
In August this year the international journalist Max Keiser reported an interview he had with the Bundesbank , Germany 's central bank , in which he was told that all of Germany 's gold reserves were held in New York .
That interview is posted at the YouTube Internet site :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzVhzoAqMhU
Some people saw the Bundesbank 's admission as a suggestion that Germany 's gold had become the tool of the U.S. government .
GATA consultant Rob Kirby of Kirby Analytics in Toronto then pressed the Bundesbank for clarification .
On August 24 the Bundesbank replied to Kirby by e-mail with a denial of Keiser 's report , but the denial was actually pretty much a confirmation :
http://www.gata.org/node/7713
" The Deutsche Bundesbank , " the reply said , " keeps a large part of its gold holdings in its own vaults in Germany , while some of its gold is also stored with the central banks located at major gold trading centers .
This , " the Bundesbank continued , " has historical and market - related reasons , the gold having been transferred to the Bundesbank at these trading centers .
Moreover , the Bundesbank needs to hold gold at the various trading centers in order to conduct its gold activities . "
The Bundesbank did not specify those " gold activities " and those " trading centers . "
But those " activities " can mean only that the Bundesbank is or recently has been surreptitiously active in the gold market , perhaps at the behest of others -- like the United States , the custodian of German gold .
In September this year a New York financial market professional and student of history named Geoffrey Batt posted at the Zero Hedge Internet site three declassified U.S. government documents involving the gold market .
The first was a long cable dated March 6 , 1968 , from someone named Deming at the U.S. Embassy in Paris to the State Department in Washington .
It is posted at the Zero Hedge Internet site :
http://www.zerohedge.com/article/declassified-state-dept-data-highlights...
The cable described the strains on the London Gold Pool , the
gold - dishoarding mechanism established by the U.S. Treasury and the Bank of England to hold the gold price to the official price of $ 35 per ounce .
The London Gold Pool was to last only six months longer .
The cable is a detailed speculation on what would have to be done to control the gold price and particularly to convince investors " that there is no point any more in speculating on an increase in the price of gold " and " to establish beyond doubt " that the world financial system " is immune to gold losses " by central banks .
The cable recommends creation of a " new reserve asset " with " gold - like qualities " to replace gold and prevent gold from gaining value .
To accomplish this , the cable proposes " monthly or quarterly reshuffles " of gold reserves among central banks -- what the cable calls a " reshuffle club " that would apply gold where market intervention seemed most necessary .
These " reshuffles " sound like the central bank gold swaps of recent years .
The idea , the cable says , is for the central banks " to remain the masters of gold . "
Also in September this year Zero Hedge 's Geoffrey Batt disclosed a memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency dated December 4 , 1968 , several months after the collapse of the London Gold Pool .
This too is posted at the Zero Hedge Internet site :
http://www.zerohedge.com/article/cia-chimes-gold-control-highlights-hist...
The CIA memo said that to keep the dollar strong and prevent " a major outflow of gold , " U.S. strategy would be :
" --
To isolate official from private gold markets by obtaining a pledge from central banks that they will neither buy nor sell gold except to each other . "
And :
"-- To bring South Africa to sell its current production of gold in the private market , and thus keep the private price down . "
The third declassified U.S. government document published by Geoffrey Batt at Zero Hedge , also in September this year , may be the most interesting , because it was written on June 3 , 1975 , four years after the last bit of official fixed convertibility of the dollar and gold had been eliminated and the world had been told that currencies henceforth would float against each other and gold and gold would be free trading .
The document is a seven - page memorandum from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns to President Gerald Ford .
It is all about controlling the gold price through foreign policy and defeating any free market for gold .
It is posted at the Zero Hedge Internet site as well :
http://www.zerohedge.com/article/smoking-gun-fed-controlling-gold
Burns tells the president : " I have a secret understanding in writing with the Bundesbank , concurred in by Mr. Schmidt " -- that 's Helmut Schmidt , West Germany 's chancellor at the time -- " that Germany will not buy gold , either from the market or from another government , at a price above the official price of $ 42.22 per ounce . "
Burns adds , " I am convinced that by far the best position for us to take at this time is to resist arrangements that provide wide latitude for central banks and governments to purchase gold at a market - related price . "
While the Burns memo is consistent with the long - established interest of central banks in controlling the gold price , it was still 34 years ago .
But now at last there has been a contemporaneous admission of U.S. government intervention in the gold market .
It has come out of GATA 's long Freedom of Information Act struggle with the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve for information about the U.S. gold reserves and gold swaps , information that has been denied to GATA on the grounds that it would compromise certain private proprietary interests .
( Of course such a
denial , a denial based on proprietary interests , is in itself a suggestion that the U.S. gold reserve has been placed , at least partly , in private hands . )
Responding to President Obama 's declaration , soon after his inauguration , that the federal government would be more open , GATA renewed its informational requests to the Fed and the Treasury .
These requests concentrated on gold swaps .
Of course both requests were denied again .
But through its Washington lawyer , William J. Olson --
http://www.lawandfreedom.com -- GATA brought an appeal of the Fed 's denial , and this appeal was directed to a full member of the Fed 's Board of Governors , Kevin M. Warsh , formerly a member of the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets , nicknamed the Plunge Protection Team .
Warsh denied GATA 's appeal but in his letter to our lawyer he let slip some stunning information :
http://www.gata.org/files/GATAFedResponse-09-17-2009.pdf
Warsh wrote : " In connection with your appeal , I have confirmed that the information withheld under Exemption 4 " -- that 's Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act -- " consists of confidential commercial or financial information relating to the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks that was obtained within the meaning of Exemption 4 .
This includes information relating to swap arrangements with foreign banks on behalf of the Federal Reserve System and is not the type of information that is customarily disclosed to the public .
This information was properly withheld from you . "
So there it is : The Federal Reserve today -- right now -- has gold swap arrangements with " foreign banks . "
Eight years ago Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and the general counsel of the Federal Open Market Committee , Virgil Mattingly , vigorously denied to GATA , through two U.S. senators who had inquired of the Fed on our behalf , that the Fed had gold swap arrangements , even though FOMC minutes from 1995 quote Mattingly as saying the U.S. has engaged in gold swaps :
http://www.gata.org/node/1181
But now the Fed admits such arrangements .
Of course Fed Governor Warsh did not say that the Fed has actually swapped any gold lately , only that it has arrangements to do so -- and , just as important , that the Fed does not want the public and the markets to know about those arrangements , does not want the public and the markets to know about the disposition of United States gold reserves .
GATA is preparing to sue the Fed in federal court to compel disclosure of these gold swap arrangements .
There is a reason for the Fed 's insistence that the public and the markets must not know what the Fed is doing in the gold market .
It is because , as the documents compiled and publicized by GATA suggest , suppressing the gold price is part of the general surreptitious rigging of the currency , bond , and commodity markets by the U.S. and allied governments , because this market rigging is the foremost objective of U.S. foreign and economic policy , and because this rigging cannot work if it is exposed and the markets realize that they are not really markets at all .
And the rigging increasingly is being exposed and understood .
In complaining about the manipulation of the gold market , GATA has not been called " conspiracy nuts " by everyone .
We have gained a good deal of institutional support over the years .
First came Sprott Asset Management in Toronto , which in 2004 issued a
comprehensive report supporting GATA .
The report was written by Sprott 's chief investment strategist , John Embry , and his assistant , Andrew Hepburn , and was titled " Not Free , Not Fair -- the Long - Term Manipulation of the Gold Price . "
It remains available at the Sprott Internet site :
http://www.sprott.com/docs/PressReleases/20_not_free_not_fair.pdf
Then in 2006 the Cheuvreux brokerage house of Credit Agricole , the major French bank , issued its own report confirming GATA 's findings of manipulation in the gold market .
The Cheuvreux report was titled " Remonetization of Gold : Start Hoarding , " and you can find it at GATA 's Internet site :
http://www.gata.org/files/CheuvreuxGoldReport.pdf
And in 2007 Citigroup -- yes , Citigroup , a pillar of the American financial establishment -- joined the supposed conspiracy nuts .
It published a report titled " Gold : Riding the Reflationary Rescue , " written by its analysts John H. Hill and Graham Wark , declaring : " Gold undoubtedly faced headwinds this year from resurgent central bank selling , which was clearly timed to cap the gold price . "
You can find the Citigroup report at GATA 's Internet site :
http://www.gata.org/files/CitigroupGoldReport092107.pdf
Even those authorities who do not want to run afoul of government institutions that with a few computer keystrokes can create virtually infinite amounts of money may have to admit the opportunity for central banks to manipulate the gold market .
For it is widely acknowledged that annual world gold production is about 2,400 tonnes , that annual net world gold demand is about 3,400 tonnes , that gold production has been falling as demand has been rising , and that the thousand - tonne gap between production and net demand has been filled mainly by central bank dishoarding and leasing .
What do you suppose the gold price would be if central banks were not supplying more than a quarter of annual demand ?
That dishoarding was not all innocent management of a foreign exchange reserve portfolio .
Much of it was meant as market intervention -- and after all , market intervention is exactly why central banking was invented .
Intervening in markets is what central banks do .
They have no other purpose .
Central banks admit intervening often in the currency markets , buying and selling their own currencies and those of other governments to maintain exchange rates at what they consider politically desirable levels .
Central banks admit doing the same in the government bond markets .
There is even evidence that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department have been intervening frequently in the U.S. stock markets since the crash of 1987 .
You do not have to settle for rumors about the " Plunge Protection Team , " also known as the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets .
Again you can just look at the public record .
The Federal Reserve injects billions of dollars into the stock and bond markets every week , on the public record , through the major New York financial houses , its so - called primary dealers in federal government bonds , using what are called repurchase agreements and the Fed 's Primary Dealer Credit Facility .
The financial houses thus have become the Fed 's agents in directing that money into the markets .
The recent rise in the U.S. stock market matches almost exactly the money funneled by the Fed to the New York financial houses through repurchase agreements and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility .
Meanwhile , for years the International Monetary Fund , the central bank of the central banks , has been openly intervening in the gold market by threatening to sell gold .
The IMF said its intent in selling gold was to raise money to lend to poor nations .
This explanation was ridiculous on its face , though the IMF has never been challenged about it in the financial press .
No , the financial press has been happy to tell the world that central banks that lately have effortlessly conjured into existence fantastic amounts of money in many currencies could find a little money to help poor countries only by selling gold .
Of course the intent of the IMF and its member central banks was not to help poor countries but to intimidate the gold market and control the gold price .
That the IMF intimidated the gold market so long with this threat of gold sales was all the more remarkable because the IMF probably has never had any gold to sell in the first place .
In April 2008 I wrote to the managing director of the IMF , Dominque Strauss - Kahn , with five questions about the IMF 's gold .
I copied the letter to the IMF 's press office by e-mail , and quickly began to get some answers from one of its press officers , Conny Lotze .
My first question to the IMF was : " Your Internet site says the IMF holds 3,217 metric tons of gold 'at designated depositories . '
Which depositories are these ? "
Conny Lotze of the IMF replied , but not specifically .
She wrote : " The fund 's gold is distributed across a number of official depositories . "
She noted that the IMF 's rules designate the United States , Britain , France , and India as IMF depositories .
My second question was : " If you would prefer not to identify the depositories for security reasons , could you at least identify the national and private custodians of the IMF 's gold and the amounts of IMF gold held by each ? "
Conny Lotze replied , again not very specifically : " All of the designated depositories are official . "
My third question was : " Is the IMF 's gold at these depositories allocated -- that is , specifically identified as belonging to the IMF -- or is it merged with other gold in storage at these depositories ? "
Conny Lotze replied , still not very specifically : " The fund 's gold is properly accounted for at all its depositories . "
My fourth question was : " Do the IMF 's member countries count the IMF 's gold as part of their own national reserves , or do they count and identify the IMF 's gold separately ? "
Conny Lotze replied a bit ambiguously : " Members do not include IMF gold within their reserves because it is an asset of the IMF .
Members include their reserve position in the fund in their international reserves . "
This sounded to me as if the IMF members were still counting as their own the gold that supposedly belongs to the IMF -- that the IMF members were just listing the gold assets in another column on their own books .
My fifth question to the IMF was : " Does the IMF have assurances from the depositories that its gold is not leased or swapped or otherwise encumbered ?
If so , what are these assurances ? "
Conny Lotze replied : " Under the fund 's Articles of Agreement it is not authorized to engage in these transactions in gold . "
But I had not asked if the IMF itself was swapping or leasing gold .
I had asked whether the custodians of the IMF 's gold were swapping or leasing it .
This prompted me to raise one more question for Conny Lotze .
I wrote her : " Is there any audit of the IMF 's gold that is available to the public ?
I ask because , if the amount of IMF gold held by each depository nation is not public information , there does not seem to be much documentation for the IMF 's gold , nor any documentation for the assurance that its custody is just fine .
Without any details or documentation , the IMF 's answer seems to be simply that it should be trusted -- that it has the gold it says it has , somewhere . "
And that was the last I heard from Conny Lotze .
She did n't answer me again .
I had spoken a word that is increasingly unspeakable in the gold section of central banking : audit .
This week the IMF at last announced the disposal of some of the 400 tonnes of gold it long had been threatening to sell .
Two hundred tonnes have been purchased by the Reserve Bank of India .
This may or may not be a real transaction , a real transfer of gold from an IMF vault to a vault of the Reserve Bank of India .
More likely this transaction is only a bookkeeping entry among IMF member central banks .
But in any case it seems likely that the gold with which the IMF has been threatening the market for years is never going to hit the market , if it even exists .
Rather , this gold will remain in the mysterious possession of central banks .
Lately central bankers often have complained about what they call " imbalances " in the world financial system .
That is , certain countries , particularly in Asia , run big trade surpluses , while other countries , especially the United States , run big trade deficits and consume far more than they produce , living off the rest of the world .
These complaints by the central bankers about " imbalances " are brazenly hypocritical , since these imbalances have been caused by the central banks themselves , caused by their constant interventions in the currency , bond , and commodity markets to prevent those markets from coming into balance through ordinary market action lest certain political interests be disturbed .
Yes , when markets balance themselves they often do it brutally , causing great damage to many of their participants .
The United States enacted a central banking system in 1913 because for the almost 150 years before then the country went through a catastrophic deflation every decade or so .
Central banking was created in the name of preventing those catastrophic deflations .
The problem with central banking has been mainly the old problem of power --- it corrupts .
Central bankers are supposed to be more capable of restraint than ordinary politicians , and maybe some are , but they are not always or even often capable of the necessary restraint .
One market intervention encourages another and another and increases the political pressure to keep intervening to benefit special interests rather than the general interest -- to benefit especially the financial interests , the banking and investment banking industries .
These interventions , subsidies to special interests , increasingly are needed to prevent the previous imbalances from imploding .
And so we have come to an era of daily market interventions by central banks -- so much so that the main purpose of central banking now is to prevent ordinary markets from happening at all .
By manipulating the value of money , central banking controls the value of all labor , services , and real goods , and yet it is conducted almost entirely in secret -- because , in choosing winners and losers in the economy , advancing infinite amounts of money to some participants in the markets but not to others , administering the ultimate patronage , central banking cannot survive scrutiny .
Yet the secrecy of central banking now is taken for granted even in nominally democratic countries .
Maybe the Federal Reserve 's intervention to rescue Bear Stearns through the Fed 's de-facto subsidiary , JPMorganChase , will cause some devastating public inquiries by Congress and the news media .
But what a hundred years ago in the United States was called the Money Power is so ascendant today that it sometimes even boasts of its privilege .
What other agency of a democratic government could get away with the principle that was articulated on national television in the United States in 1994 by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve , Alan Blinder ?
Blinder declared : " The last duty of a central banker is to tell the public the truth . "
The truth as GATA sees it is this :
First , gold is the secret knowledge of the financial universe , but it is becoming an open secret .
That is GATA 's work -- to break the secret open , to show how the gold price has been suppressed by central bank creation of imaginary gold in amounts to match and thus help conceal the vast inflation of the world 's money supply .
We will continue to use freedom - of - information law against the Fed and the Treasury Department about their policies toward gold and the disposition of the U.S. gold reserve .
Of course central banks can no more afford to account fully for their gold reserves than the Fed and JPMorganChase can afford to disclose details of their negotiations for the rescue of Bear Stearns .
Indeed , as my correspondence with the IMF suggests , the disposition of Western central bank gold reserves is a secret more closely guarded than the blueprints for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .
Why can't the public and the markets be permitted to know exactly where central bank gold reserves are ?
Because in the hands of governments gold is a deadly weapon -- as the Reserve Bank of Australia acknowledges , the main weapon of currency market intervention .
Second , all technical analysis of markets now is faulty if it fails to account for pervasive government intervention .
And third , the intervention against gold is failing because of overuse , exposure , exhaustion of Western central bank gold reserves -- we estimate that the Western central banks have in their vaults only about half the 32,000 tonnes they claim to have -- and the resentment of the developing world , which is starting to figure out how it has been expropriated by the dollar system , a system in which people do real work and create real goods and send them to the United States in exchange for mere colored paper and electrons .
For years now the Western central banks have been attempting a controlled retreat with gold , bleeding out their reserves with sales , leases , and derivatives so that gold 's ascent and the dollar 's inevitable decline may be less shocking .
Central bankers often convey part of this strategy in code ; they warn against what they call a " disorderly decline " in the dollar , as if an " orderly " decline is all right .
The rise in the gold price over the last decade is just the other side of that coin -- an " orderly " rise , 15 percent or so per year , a rise carefully modulated by surreptitious central bank intervention .
But GATA believes that the central banks may have to retreat farther with gold than anyone dreams , and far more abruptly than they have retreated so far .
We believe that when the central banks are overrun in the gold market , as they were overrun in 1968 , and the market begins to reflect the ratio between , on one hand , the supply of real gold , actual metal , not the voluminous paper promises of metal , and , on the other hand , the explosion of the world money supply of the last few decades -- as the market begins to perceive the difference between the real and the unreal -- there may not be enough zeroes to put behind the gold price .
A century ago Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem that foresaw the decline of the empire of his country , Great Britain .
Kipling 's poem attributed this decline to the loss of the old virtues , the virtues that were listed at the top of the pages in the special notebooks , called " copybooks , " that were given to British schoolchildren at that time -- virtues like honesty , fair dealing , Ten Commandments stuff .
The title of Kipling 's poem is " The Gods of the Copybook Headings , " and its conclusion is a warning to the empire that succeeded the one he was living in :
Then the Gods of the Market tumbled ,
And their smooth - tongued wizards withdrew
And the hearts of the meanest were humbled
And began to believe it was true
That All is not Gold that Glitters ,
And Two and Two make Four ,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings
Limped up to explain it once more .
As it will be in the future ,
It was at the birth of Man .
There are only four things certain
Since Social Progress began :
That the Dog returns to his Vomit
And the Sow returns to her Mire ,
And the burnt Fool 's bandaged finger
Goes wabbling back to the Fire ;
And that after this is accomplished ,
And the brave new world begins ,
When all men are paid for existing
And no man must pay for his sins ,
As surely as Water will wet us ,
As surely as Fire will burn ,
The Gods of the Copybook Headings
With terror and slaughter return .
The gold price suppression story is important despite this week 's dramatic rise in the gold price .
For even as the price of gold has been rising , we really do n't yet know what a fair price , a free - market price , for gold is , since gold has not traded in a free market for many years and is not trading in a free market now .
Indeed , since central bank intervention in the currency , bond , equities , and commodity markets has exploded over the last year , we do n't really know what the market price of anything is anymore .
Thus the gold price suppression story is a story about the valuation of all capital and labor in the world -- and whether those values will be set openly in free markets , the democratic way , or secretly by governments , the totalitarian way .
The specifics of the gold price suppression operation are complicated , but you do n't have to remember them all if you know what they mean .
They mean that there is a currency war going on between countries and their central banks .
There has been such a war for many years , only the victims were not really fighting back .
Now some of them are .
Signs of this war are now everywhere -- like the story published a month ago by the British newspaper
The Independent that described an international plan to replace the dollar in oil trading :
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-demise-of-the-dollar...
Gold and silver have been and remain currencies and will be remonetized by markets eventually if not by central banks as well , because gold and silver are the only neutral currencies , the only currencies that are not the liabilities of any particular country .
But when you invest in currencies like gold and silver , you risk getting caught in the crossfire of the currency war .
As in any war , truth is the first casualty in the currency war , even as secrecy is always the first principle of central banking .
Meanwhile , not asking the right questions of the right people seems to be the first principle of most mainstream financial journalists and even the first principle of some gold and silver market analysts .
These journalists and analysts take government secrecy in central banking for granted , even as the evidence of market intervention and manipulation explodes all around them .
This acceptance of secrecy reminds me of the bumbling police detective played by Leslie Nielsen in the " Naked Gun " movies , particularly his performance in this scene :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSjK2Oqrgic
Well , there is something to see here .
The precious metals promise great rewards to investors , but to get the necessary information you have to do a lot more work than other investors .
And you have to remember the remarkable properties of gold and silver .
It 's not just that gold is the most malleable and lustrous of metals , or that silver is the most conductive and reflective , but also that , once they get into the hands of central banks , bullion banks , and exchange - traded funds , gold and silver can become invisible .

FIFA 10 becomes fastest - selling sports game ever 1.7 m units sold in first week ; EA 's biggest launch to date in Europe

Companies in this article Electronic Arts
Electronic
Arts has said that FIFA 10 has become the fastest - selling sports game of all time , with 1.7 million units sold in its first week .
The game is EA 's biggest European launch to date , with over 10 million online matches played and over 155,000 users online simultaneously during peak periods .
" We were confident that FIFA 10 would be a hit , and this week fans across Europe have shown just how much they love this game , " offered Peter Moore , president of EA Sports .
" We are incredibly proud of FIFA 10 and this kick - off for great , authentic football competition . "
The game has been receiving very high review scores , with the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game boasting Metacritic numbers of over 90 per cent .
Earlier report : Joe Hockey will become the new leader of the federal Liberal Party , according to early predictions .
A motion to spill the leadership was carried this morning .
As Liberal MPs entered the party room meeting to vote , Liberal MP number crunchers said Malcolm Turnbull would be knocked out early in the race .
Mr Hockey will also face off against Tony Abbott but is expected to win in the final round .
However , Mr Turnbull is confident he will survive the leadership challenge .
He says he believes he will hold his position because he has a " clear consistent position on taking action on climate change " .
" For us to be a credible political party ... we have to have a credible position on climate change , " he told the Seven Network .
" I have been quite consistent about that . "
Mr Turnbull told ABC Radio : " I 'm not even contemplating losing .
I 'm going to win today .
My goal is to win .
I intend to win . "
He said the amended emissions trading scheme legislation should be passed .
" The Government agreed with most of what we asked for , we went back to our party room , our party room said fine , let 's do the deal , let 's agree on it , let 's work together and go forward , and that bill should be passed , '' he told the Seven Network .
Mr Turnbull denied the majority of the Liberal Party disagreed with him over emissions trading .
" The numbers have all been published , '' he said .
" There was a majority in the joint party room , a slender one to be fair , but in the Liberal party room ... there was a very solid majority against it [ opposing the emissions trading legislation ] .
" But remember , a number of people did n't like the decision of the majority on the Tuesday and so called for a spill against my leadership ... and that spill was defeated by 48 to 35 .
" The party room has dealt with this twice and it has supported me and we are now going to deal with it a third time today . ''
Mr Turnbull promised to unite the party if he remains as leader , saying he was not a hater .
" There has been some tough things said in this debate , '' he told ABC Radio .
" After this is over - if I 'm reconfirmed as the leader of the Liberal Party ... I give this undertaking that we will bring the party together .
" I am not a hater .
I do n't bear grudges . ''
Mr Turnbull said he was prepared to " wipe the slate ' ' clean of all the animosities .

He dismissed as " science fiction ' ' speculation he would start his own political party if dumped from the Liberal leadership .

In Philadelphia , researchers at the University of Pennsylvania find , possessing a gun is strongly associated with getting shot .
Since " guns did not protect those who possessed them , " they conclude , " people should rethink their possession of guns . "
This is like noting that possessing a parachute is strongly associated with being injured while jumping from a plane , then concluding that skydivers would be better off unencumbered by safety equipment designed to slow their descent .
" Can this study possibly be as stupid as it sounds ? " asks Stewart Baker at Skating on Stilts .
Having shelled out $ 30 for the privilege of reading the entire article , which appears in the November American Journal of Public Health , I can confirm that the answer is yes .
The authors , led by epidemiologist Charles C. Branas , paired 677 randomly chosen gun assault cases with " population - based control participants " who were contacted by phone shortly after the attacks and matched for age group , gender , and race .
They found that " people with a gun were 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not possessing a gun . "
Branas et al. suggest several possible explanations for this association :
A gun may falsely empower its possessor to overreact , instigating and losing otherwise tractable conflicts with similarly armed persons .
Along the same lines , individuals who are in possession of a gun may increase their risk of gun assault by entering dangerous environments that they would have normally avoided .
Alternatively , an individual may bring a gun to an otherwise gun- free conflict only to have that gun wrested away and turned on them .
The one explanation the researchers do n't mention is the one that will occur first to defenders of the right to armed self - defense : Maybe people who anticipate violent confrontations — such as drug dealers , frequently robbed bodega owners , and women with angry ex-boyfriends — are especially likely to possess guns , just as people who jump out of airplanes are especially likely to possess parachutes .
The closest Branas et al. come to acknowledging that tendency is their admission , toward the end of the article , that they " did not account for the potential of reverse causation between gun possession and gun assault " — that is , the possibility that a high risk of being shot " causes " gun ownership , as opposed to the other way around .
While the reseachers took into account a few confounding variables related to this tendency ( including having an arrest record , living in a rough neighborhood , and having a high - risk occupation ) , they cannot possibly have considered all the factors that might make people more prone to violent attack and therefore more likely to have a gun as a defense against that hazard .
To take just one example , not every criminal has an arrest record .
Yet it seems fair to assume that criminals in Philadelphia are a ) more likely than noncriminals to be armed and b ) more likely than noncriminals to be shot .
That does not mean having a gun increases their chance of being shot .
Certainly they believe ( as police officers do ) that having a gun makes them safer than they otherwise would be .
Nothing in this study contradicts that belief .
Mr. Bernanke repeated , as he has many times before , that while some of the measures in response to the financial crisis were “ distasteful and unfair , ” they were necessary .
Image Ben Bernanke , the chief of the Fed , aims to preserve its powers and independence .
Credit ... Daniel Acker / Bloomberg News
The White House and senior Democratic lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have proposed eliminating the Fed ’s current role of setting the rules for products like mortgages and credit cards .
Instead , officials have proposed a new federal consumer financial protection agency to both set and enforce rules over such products .
The op - ed article was part of Mr. Bernanke ’s running campaign to preserve the Fed ’s powers and independence as the system of financial regulation is overhauled .
In the past , it would have been unusual for a Fed chairman to make such pointed remarks in a public forum , but Mr. Bernanke has been more outspoken than most .
“ Now more than ever , America needs a strong , nonpolitical and independent central bank with the tools to promote financial stability and to help steer our economy to recovery without inflation , ” he said .
And when it comes to monetary policy , he said , “ independent does not mean unaccountable . ”
He said the actions of the Fed were already thoroughly reviewed and needed to be protected from Congressional influence , “ which would undermine the confidence the public and the markets have in the Fed . ”
Before reading the list , keep these facts in mind .
This is my personal list , so there will be things you disagree about .
I tried to have a combination of mytharc , standalone , funny , and serious episodes .
It ’s completely subjective , so the order or even the episodes on the list may not make sense for you .
25 . Trust No 1 ( Season 9 )
I am hesitant to add any season 9 episodes to the list since the last two season were terrible .
Instead of trying to tie up the various threads the previous seven seasons started , the writers created the super soldier arc which muddled the situation even more .
‘ Trust No 1 ” was an episode focusing on Scully which meant lots of great acting by Gillian Anderson – always a plus – and the story was decent , so I think it deserves a spot on the list .
24 . Requiem ( Season 7 )
The X - Files went all the way back to the beginning with Mulder and Scully returning to Bellefleur , Oregon where they first investigated a case .
Many characters were brought back which was nice .
In some ways , it was as if The X - Files finally found its way back after wandering through the wilderness for 40 years .
I thought this episode set up great potential for season 8 which did n’t work out in the end .
Either ways , “ Requeim ” had fantastic acting and a decent story .
This also marks the last time David Duchovny was a regular on the show which forces me to put it on the list .
23 . Paper Hearts ( Season 4 )
When Samantha is involved , Mulder immediately changes .
He can be easy going all the time , but once Samantha ’s abduction comes into play , he is reckless and loses perspective .
That ’s exactly what happens in “ Paper Hearts . ”
Mulder is manipulated into believing that a serial killer had abducted her instead of aliens .
In the end , it was n’t true and no new information was discovered , but it ’s all about the process of getting to that conclusion , and the episode hit it out of the park .
22 . Triangle ( Season 6 )
Mulder goes off to the Bermuda Triangle looking for a ship , and instead travels back to 1939 where Nazis have taken over .
The catch is that some of the people he meets look exactly like people he knows back home .
Maybe it was a hallucination and never really happened , but that ’s not the point ; the episode was a blast .
21 . The Erlenmeyer Flask ( Season 1 )
“ Trust No One . ”
This simple phrase became the mantra of our heroes with the death of Deep Throat .
The episode marks a transition where many parts of the government conspiracy become known with the alien blood , fetuses , and of course the Purity Control .
Maybe one could argue that this is the start of the confusing stuff , but self - contained , the episode added a lot to the show , and gave us plenty of great stories later on .
20 . Humbug ( Season 2 )
Sideshow freaks , underdeveloped fetus , and a general humorous tone to the episode .
There was plenty of horror with the Fiji Mermaid , and yet the whole situation was funny .
The weird combination made the episode lots of fun .
19 . Monday ( Season 6 )
The concept for this episode is n’t original as it has been done multiple times in various mediums ; however , that does not mean the various incarnations of the concept are bad .
The concept of timeloops itself allow for great creative freedom which usually ends up with a good episode .
The X - Files did it very well with several ongoing gags such as the waterbed leaking .
18 . Pusher ( Season 3 )
The idea behind the episode was so good that Fringe copied the concept , having someone be able to control the mind of others .
What was unique about Modell was that he was able to affect human physiology .
He plays a cat and mouse game with Mulder , eventually baiting him into a sick game of Russian roulette with he , Mulder , and Scully .
17 . How the Ghosts Stole Christmas ( Season 6 )
Everyone always say they like the episode for Lily Tomlin , but there are so many other reasons to like the episode .
There ’s Ed Asner , and a clever script .
An endearing part of the episode was the mere fact that on Christmas Eve , Mulder would go ghost hunting , and trick Scully into coming .
The first act is delightful to watch , and probably one of my favorite interaction between Mulder and Scully .
16 . Deep Throat ( Season 1 )
I find this episode vastly underrated which I suspect is because it comes right after the pilot , and the pilot gets a lot more attention .
“ Deep Throat ” further pushed the concept of Scully the Skeptic and Mulder the Believer , introduced their season one ally , and of course featured Seth Green as a pothead .
15 . Squeeze / Tooms ( Season 1 )
Eugene Victor Tooms is one of the best monsters in The X - Files with his special ability to stretch and appetite for human liver .
The story went away from the alien storyline , focusing on a totally separate issue .
Surprisingly , it was the first monster - of - the - week episode , and it was very good .
Usually shows may take a while to gain a footing , but Squeeze and later on Tooms set the standard for MOTWs to come .
14 . Nisei/ 731 ( Season 3 )
Out of the earlier mytharc episodes , I think these are the most underrated .
I felt that they conveyed tension perhaps better than any other episode with the stuff on the train and the events leading up to it .
X showed another side , risking his life to save Mulder which only made his death feel worse .
Like most X - Files episodes , we did n’t really no what was real or not it the end .
There was the alien autopsy , lepers , Japanese , and it did n’t all fit together nicely .
Eventually this made the show hard to digest , but in the beginning , it created intrigue and mystery .
13 . Clyde Bruckman 's Final Repose ( Season 3 )
When
The X - Files does comedy , it ’s never overt jokes with rich punch lines .
It was a terrific episode with the hilariously fraudulent Stupendous Yappi , and Clyde Bruckman , played by Peter Boyle .
It was dark episode -- talking of death can never be considered light -- but there was a fun off - beat tone that made the episode really great .
12 . The Post - Modern Prometheus ( Season 5 )
I do n’t know where Chris Carter came up with this idea , but those that call him a hack should watch this episode many times .
Featuring The Great Mutato , a play on Frankenstein , the episode is black and white , and is heartwarming in the end .
I guess in a way the episode is nonsensical with a couple ridiculous stories , but that is part of what makes
The X - Files fun .
11 . Memento Mori ( Season 4 )
The diary entries read by Scully are so chilling .
David Duchovny is the one who gets the recognition for The X - Files , but when I think of the emotional scenes , I always think of Gillian Anderson , and the writers gave her a great role to play in the cancer arc .
In a very emotionally charged episode , Mulder also had many great moments .
There was more infiltration of private institutions with the doctor and random clones .
10 . Bad Blood ( Season 5 )
Like “ Jose Chung ’s From Outer Space , ” this episode showed differing perspectives from different people .
This time , it was Mulder and Scully and their experiences after killing a “ vampire . ”
They actually remember quite similar events , but the subtle differences in their behavior and appearances make the episode one of the most fun .
9 . The Host ( Season 1 )
In terms of weirdness , the Flukeman certainly ranks up there .
The science in science fiction amounted to making the connection to Chernobyl which while ludicrous , actually brought up an interesting idea .
The episode had an unclean feeling with Mulder crawling around the New Jersey sewer system that made it disturbing and fun to watch .
8. Pilot ( Season 1 )
No list would be complete without the episode that started it all .
It introduced the greatest team in television history ( I ’m looking at you Moonlighting fans ! ) , alien abductions , and the government conspiracy .
It ’s a wonderful , wonderful initiation to the paranormal aura that is key to the show .
7. Duane Barry / Ascension / One Breath ( Season 2 )
These three episodes did n’t air in order , but the forgettable episode “ 3 ” I think can be cast aside .
These episodes raised the stakes of the series , getting Scully permanently involved in the conspiracy .
Steve Railsback as Duane Barry was great , but out of those three , “ One Breath ” is the most memorable episode , and I believe on a totally different level than the other two .
There is no alien activity or the usual X - Files fare .
Instead it is a very personal and human episode , focusing on Scully and her inner struggle .
6. X - Cops ( Season 7 )
I love this episode so much .
It combines the Fox shows , Cops and The X - Files to create an odd mix .
We got to see the usual nightly hijinks you ’d see on Cops , and a paranormal story .
It felt authentically Cops , but there was Mulder , Scully , and a mystery .
It was fun to see how the characters would react to being on national television .
I still remember the scene where Mulder is talking to the an officer , explaining all about werewolves .
The camera pans over to Scully who promptly hides behind the ambulance door .
How great is that ?
5. Home ( Season 4 )
This episode has to be one of the scariest episodes on television ever .
Not only was it visually disturbing , but also it had the most horrendous , disgusting story .
There were inbred things ( they ’re definitely not human ) that impregnate their mother and go around killing people .
Did I mention that the mother actually wanted to be impregnated ?
Glen Morgan and James
Wong truly gave us a script riddled with everything wrong , and Kim Manners directed it perfectly .
If there is one memorable X - Files episode that comes to the mind of everyone , it is always “ Home . ”
4. Gethsemane / Redux / Redux II ( Season 5 )
It ’s interesting that the writers shaped the character of Mulder to be so dedicated to the pursuit of the truth of alien existence , that it is plausible that Mulder would kill himself over it .
While that never happened , it makes you wonder if he would kill himself if that was 100 % definitive proof that there was n’t aliens .
There was great acting by Gillian Anderson once again .
I know it may seem redundant , but she ’s amazing .
3. Beyond the Sea ( Season 1 )
Luther Lee Boggs is my personal favorite “ monster . ”
He ’s just a normal human who may or may not have psychic abilities , but his general creepiness and ability to mess with people ’s minds without anything overtly supernatural makes him unique .
Brad Dourif did a really terrific job in this episode , and his character is as memorable as any that have shown up on the show .
2. Anasazi / The Blessing Way / Paper Clip ( Season 2,3 )
These episodes are probably my favorite set of mytharc episodes .
Before the mythology got too complicated , we could actual understand something of what was going on .
The breath and scope of the episode really impressed me .
It had hacked classified information , Navajo code - talkers , a black helicopter incursion , Mulder almost dying and coming back , a standoff with Skinner , weird midget aliens , Krycek , and a great ending that characterizes all X - Files episodes .
1. Jose Chung 's From Outer Space ( Season 3 )
This is my all - time favorite episode .
From beginning to end , it is a laugh out loud episode , cleverly written with no real distinct stories .
We know Mulder and something alien related is in the episode , but the rest is all out to the imagination of the viewer , or the various characters ’
Jose Chung interviews .
Charles Nelson Reilly who plays
Chung was simply brilliant , and the idea behind the episode that he was brought back for an episode of Millennium , Chris Carter ’s short lived show , in an equally good episode .
There was also Jesse Ventura and Alex Trebek which added to the surreal tone of the episode .
Locally - grown organic fruits and vegetables are usually harvested within 24 hours of being purchased by the consumer .
Produce from California can't be that fresh .
2) Taste .
Produce picked and eaten at the height of freshness tastes better .
3 ) Nutrition .
Nutritional value declines , often dramatically , as time passes after harvest .
Because locally - grown produce is freshest , it is more nutritionally complete .
4 ) Purity .
Eighty percent of American adults say they are concerned about the safety of the food they eat .
They worry about residues of pesticides and fungicides .
These materials are not permitted in an organic production system either before or after harvest .
5 ) Regional Economic Health .
Buying locally grown food keeps money within the community .
This contributes to the health of all sectors of the local economy , increasing the local quality of life .
6 ) Variety .
Organic farmers selling locally are not limited to the few varieties that are bred for long distance shipping , high yields , and shelf life .
Often they raise and sell wonderful unusual varieties you will never find on supermarket shelves .
7 ) Soil Stewardship .
Soil health is essential for the survival of our species .
Conventional farming practices are rapidly depleting topsoil fertility .
Creating and sustaining soil fertility is the major objective for organic growers .
8 ) Energy Conservation .
Buying locally grown organic foods decreases dependence on petroleum , a non- renewable energy source .
One fifth of all petroleum now used in the United States is used in Agriculture .
Organic production systems do not rely upon the input of petroleum derived fertilizers and pesticides and thus save energy at the farm .
Buying from local producers conserves additional energy at the distribution level .
9 ) Environmental Protection .
Soil erosion ; pesticide contamination of soil , air , and water ; nitrate loading of waterways and wells ; and elimination of planetary biodiversity are some of the problems associated with todayís predominate farming methods .
Organic growers use practices that protect soil , air , and water resources ; and that promote biodiversity .
10 ) Cost .
Conventional food processes do n't reflect the hidden costs of the environmental , health and social consequences of predominate production practices - of , for instance , correcting a water supply polluted by agricultural runoff , or obtaining medical treatment for pesticide induced illness suffered by farmers or consumers .
When these and other hidden costs are taken into account , as they should be , locally grown organic foods are seen clearly for the value they are , even if they cost a few pennies more .
11 ) A Step Toward Regional Food Self Reliance
.
Dependency on far away food sources leaves a region vulnerable to supply disruptions , and removes any real accountability of producer to consumer .
It also tends to promote larger , less diversified farms that hurt both the environment and local economies / communities .
Regional food production systems , on the other hand , keep the food supply in the hands of many , providing interesting job and self - employment opportunities , and enabling people to influence how their food is grown .
12 ) Passing on the Stewardship Ethic .
When you buy locally produced organic food you cannot help but raise the consciousness of your friends and family about how food buying decisions can make a difference in your life and the life of your community ; and about how this basic act is connected to planetary issues .

A Brazilian university student has become a national cause célèbre after footage demonstrating just why it's a bad idea to wear a miniskirt to lectures surfaced online .
Geisy Arruda , 20 , was subjected to a torrent of abuse from a baying mob of fellow students last month at Sao Paulo 's Bandeirante University , aka Uniban .
So bad did things get that police finally had to escort her from the premises , wrapped in a modesty - preserving white coat , to chants of " whore " :
Images of the incident promptly hit the internet , and the university decided to expel her for a " flagrant lack of respect for ethical principles , academic dignity and morality " .
Cue general disbelief - unsurprising in a country where bikinis are fabricated from dental floss - and a round of chat - show appearances , including this one in which Ms Arruda gives her version of events while wearing the offending dress for the benefit of the viewing public .
The polemic today prompted Maria Paula Dallari , higher education secretary at the Ministry of Education , to ask Uniban if any of the students responsible for the abuse would also be punished .
Former tourism student Arruda , meanwhile , is reportedly considering an appeal against her expulsion . ®
Ever since National Geographic invented showing tits to children , I 've wanted to learn how different cultures deal with sex .
And while I 've done my best to explore all the world 's cultures and religions without their pants on , it seems most of my research on the subject has been limited to the insane community .
In your face , ladies .
Besides , I need to approach the topic scientifically , and no good has ever come from a scientist putting his dick into his own research .
That 's how Benjamin Franklin died , and why kites no longer come with vaginas .
So instead , I collected books about sex .
You can learn a lot about sex in a used book store .
For example , and since I can't resist , you get fewer paper cuts when you fuck non-fiction .
Back to what I was saying , and I apologize for the last sentence , I 've collected five books that each represent a different culture or religion 's sex life .
These five books will be read by me and then entered into the Great 2009 Literary Sex Off , an academic sex contest held every 2009 years .
Represented by the book : Human Sexuality : A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning , 1991 This book contains all the erotic secrets of the Catholic Church .
Like you , I thought this would be things like how to dissolve roofies into a sno - cone when an altar boy is too fast to grab and too smart to take the pills you throw at him .
But it 's actually much stranger than that .
It 's an exhaustive list of the thousands of circumstances that need to be met before God will allow sex .
This line summed it up pretty well : " As we have stated several times in this document , we believe that it is only within a heterosexual marital relationship that genital sexual activity is morally acceptable . "
Genital sexual activity ?
That 's so unnecessarily specific that it 's almost challenging horny followers to find a loophole .
It 's like giving readers a puzzle they can only solve with their fingers , mouths , and assholes .
Fact : tennis elbow , indian burns , propulsive gait , and the figure - four - leglock were all discovered by two unmarried Catholics trying to stay religiously legal during their intimacy .

There is n't a single drawing in this entire book .
I guess with chapter titles like , " Human Sexuality : A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning Chapter 4 : Special Groups and Sexual Issues , Moral Discernment and Pastoral Care , " there is n't a whole lot of room for pictures .
Plus , I think Catholics have to be married to a pencil for seven years before they 're allowed to draw a nipple .

Here 's an excerpt : " In keeping with our abiding respect for the inherent procreative meaning of sexual intercourse , it is a teaching of the Catholic Church that one ought to space it " naturally , " that is , taking into account the biological ebb and flow of the woman 's fertility cycle . "
This book makes it clear that if you 're using a contraceptive , you might as well be doing so from inside a warlock .
Condoms are like putting a plastic bag over the head of God 's love and birth control pills are so evil that if you give one to a goat , the beast will curse in the tongue of man .
So in order to prevent babies , Catholics use the Rhythm Method .
It 's where you fill a woman 's reproductive system with sperm and hope that millions of years of evolution are n't watching .
Step one in being a good Catholic is making sure your ovaries can beat God in a battle of wits .
Represented by the book : The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women , 1998 Due to my love of comedy , I never read a book about regular people having sex .
The closest I could come was The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women .
To say it 's exactly what it sounds like is n't doing its ultimateness justice .
Everything you 've ever wanted to know is in this book , which is why I wrote this short but ultimate one - sentence guide to reading it :
You do n't want to know 125 % of the details involving anal sex .
Here , I can sum it up with this understatement from Anal Fisting : How To's : " There is going to be some mess , so you should have lots of paper towels on hand . "
Cherish that -- a carpet cleaner and two garbage men died bringing you that knowledge .
This book is so gross you wo n't even want things coming out of your ass .
Illustration Rating : Negative Used Butt Towel .
If there was a rating I could give the book worse than a 0 , I would .
And since I 'm making the rules , I can .
It gets the rating of Negative Used Butt Towel , the lowest number in the world .
You want a drawing of a fat woman getting an amateur colonoscopy from a caveman ?
Check .
How about a beatnik wearing only combat boots and anal beads ?
Yes .
I can't tell if it's a magic book showing the reader personalized images of his or her own hell , or if someone was playing MADLibs at the same time they were drawing butt sex .
All I know is that you 'll have an easier time getting aroused by the interior view of the anorectal anatomy , thankfully included .

After reading this guide , I feel vaguely qualified to perform any medical or sexual procedure on a human butt .
That is if my patients or lovers can look past the solid , steady scream I 've been letting out since I first opened this book .
Represented by the book : Growth and Intimacy for Gay Men : A Workbook , 1997 I knew I wanted to represent the homosexual community in this battle of the books , but the used bookstore was suspiciously out of gay pornography .
I was about to give up and just represent them with a Maxim magazine , but this book suddenly caught my eye .
It 's a workbook that damaged gay people can use to put their lives back together .
And as fate would have it , it 's been used .
I know so much about this book 's previous owner .
As you can see from his highlights above , he took a special interest in the " Merging " stage of relationships , and could n't give a damn about " Learning to live in harmony . "
He does this for the whole book .
If there 's a line about sex , he highlights it .
If there 's a section on different techniques to get your lover to shut the fuck up , it 's lit up like a Cher gown under stage lights .
I do n't want to sound gay , but I really like this guy .
Illustration Rating : Twenty five question marks .
The only illustrations in the book are complicated flow charts so the gay reader can create genealogy trees .
However , since these are homosexual trees , they 're mostly about gossip instead of genetics .
I 'm not making that up .
The author has filled in all the boxes with things like " Alcoholic " and " Probably Gay . "
And get this , Julie and Rick 's daughter Sarah has " Abortion 1981 Depressed On Medication In Therapy " by her name .
And under that : " Sexually provocative . "
Roowr !
The claws are out , girlfriend !

If a man with this book ever chooses to have relations with another man , there are 25 questionaires to help him prepare for it , and 35 worksheets to deal with the emotional aftermath .
You literally could not have a safer sex life unless you were humping a pillow with a Ph.D in psychology .
It was a welcome change from the Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women which spent five chapters dispelling the myth that it 's unsafe to jump ass - first onto a juicer .
Represented by the book : Dating and Other Frightening Experiences , 1979
This book is mainly about resisting temptations .
Unfortunately , it seems like the author has been doing that for too long and every page is heaving with desperate sexually charged analogies .
This guy is so backed up that he has to sleep in an oil rig to catch his night discharge .
The following is a passage that will change the way you look at flowers forever : " Girls , you will never walk into any garden and see any self - respecting flower chasing the bees .
Picture that .
They wo n't do it .
They know enough to stay right where they 're planted , and they blossom , and have a sweet fragrance that comes from within .
The bees will come to them .
Oh my , how they 'll come . "
Yikes .
Sounds like someone chased that bee metaphor all the way to orgasm .
Illustration Rating : 9 Mormons seem to resist a lot of their temptations on The Porch .
At first I thought this meant that Mormons like to make out on the front porch so passing motorists can celebrate their journey to second base together .
But as you can see from this illustration , The Porch is an actual monster that sneaks up on you while you do it .
As I hinted at earlier , Mormons have sex through a hole in a complicated series of metaphors , so I 'm not sure how to interpret this picture .
Is that evil door simply where The Porch Monster keeps its mouth and eyes , or is that the girl 's father pressing his face up against the screen door ?
Either way , it makes no sense why I 'm masturbating .
Oh god , I 'm a bee !
I 'M A BEEEEE !!!!

Let 's strip away all the flowery language for a second and get real : Mormons copulate publicly on the body of a fanged monster .

This book is 334 pages of sexual tips for every type of affliction known to man .
If you have arthritis , they 'll tell you where to buy some vibrating mittens .

The problem is , they spread themselves so thin that no single affliction really gets much attention .
Just look at these tips on Sex With Ourselves .
There 's not one piece of usable advice in that !
If I really was a guy with no arms or legs , I want only one answer from the chapter on masturbation -- will a masturbation robot try to kill a masturbation monkey ?
Instead I get this philosophical redefinition of the term .
How does this semantic fruit looping help anyone ?

The one thing this book has going for it is safety procedures .
Before giving any instructions , the authors carefully assume the worst about you .
You 're a morbidly obese torso , but they can't show you how to build a tension - powered dildo rigging because they 're sensitive to your crippling fear of pulleys .
And since your skin is made out of dog food , swinging you around would just waft your scent into the hound - filled night .
And that would be insane .
So after reading all of these manuals on how to turn sex into a disgusting and unsafe battle against porches and God , I 'd have to say the winner is ...

Here ’s a morality tale in extremis that was first broadcast on NPR by reporter Cory Turner a few weeks back :
One industry has long been considered recession - proof : Hollywood .
Well , no more .
It ’s true Americans are still buying movie tickets .
But the trouble is n’t getting people to see movies , necessarily .
It ’s persuading an ever - shrinking pool of financial companies and individuals to pay for them — particularly for independent films .
Case in point : The Maiden Heist .
The feature - length comedy stars three of the best — and best - known — actors working today : Morgan Freeman , Christopher Walken and William H. Macy .
That ’s two Oscar winners and one nominee , not to mention a third Oscar winner , Marcia Gay Harden , in a supporting role .
The movie ’s wrapped and ready for theaters .
There ’s just one problem :
You ca n’t see it .
Let ’s go through that again .
A movie .
Starring Morgan Freeman .
Christopher Walken .
William H. Macy .
And Marcia Gay Harden .
Straight to DVD .
How the hell did that happen ?
Patrick Goldstein of the LA Times “ Big Picture ” fills in the details :
The real rub , as indie filmmakers have discovered in recent years , is that it costs nearly as much to market a film as it does to make it .
“ Maiden Heist , ” for example , was made for $ 20 million but clearly needed nearly another $ 20 million to be properly marketed in a theatrical release .
Needless to say , there are n’t many distributors willing to plunk down that kind of money for a film that — despite its classy lineup of top actors — has relatively limited commercial potential .
And what ’s the lesson of this morality tale ?
Per Goldstein :
But the lesson here is pretty simple :
It ’s no longer enough to simply round up the financing for a film .
In today ’s brutal , bottom - line environment , you need to have a plausible marketing strategy — and plenty of moolah behind it — before you start dreaming about your big opening weekend .
Marketing has become such a critical component to a movie ’s success .
As we ’ve discussed before , movies are n’t just competing against other movies :
They ’re battling against every form of entertainment and communication including TV , the Web , mobile content , text messaging , social networks , Twitter , online gaming and on and on and on .
The entertainment marketplace just keeps getting ‘ noisier ’ and ‘ noisier ’ — and to cut through that noise , a movie has to have a strong marketing push .
This is — again — one big reason why I emphasize so much the importance of a strong story concept .
Take “ The Maiden Heist ” for example .
Here ’s that story concept per the NPR piece :
In the film , Freeman , Walken and Macy play security guards who ’ve worked at the same art museum for so long that they ’ve fallen in love — with the art .
When the museum announces that it ’s suddenly shipping much of its permanent exhibit to Denmark , the three men conspire to steal their favorite pieces .
High concept ?
Yes .
Strong story concept ?
Well , it ’s clever .
But here ’s a couple of things it has going against it : ( A ) It ’s about art which is not a head - turning subject .
( B ) Art and the cast suggests an adult audience , but does the humor match that target demo ?
It may play a bit too broad for the adult crowd .
For example :
At one point early in the film , the three men practice — awkwardly — their rappelling skills for the big break - in .
Walken ’s character has particular trouble , and he finds himself dangling off the side of Freeman ’s apartment building — stuck .
That ’s pretty slapstick , reminiscent of a scene — promoted in the trailer — of last year ’s broad comedy Get Smart , which targeted a much younger audience .
So a not so gripping subject matter …
Combined with what may be a misfit tonally …
For the presumed target demo .
Ergo :
Not a strong story concept .
Now let ’s take this lesson one step further : Imagine you work in a studio ’s marketing department :
How do you market “ The Maiden Heist ” ?
Play up the comedy ?
Or go smarter for the heist angle ?
More action ?
I ’m not convinced that even if the producers managed to get a big - time distribution deal they could have marketed the movie successfully .
Witness the trailer :
Do you find this trailer funny ?
Does it seem fresh and new , or something straight out of the 80s , including the soundtrack music ?
A smart screenwriter comes up with a strong story concept with a clear vision of the target audience , then writes a script that is consistent tonally throughout , all in service to a great story .
That makes a marketing department ’s job that much easier .
And that makes a studio exec ’s job to say “ yes ” to acquiring your script that much easier , too .

This interview was done by Carlos Henrique Cantu , with Alex Peshkov ( from the Firebird Core Development Team ) , specially for FirebirdNews .
1 ) Please let us know a bit about you : where do you live , hobbies , married , sons , style of music , preferred drink , etc .
I live in Yarsolavl ( Russia ) , it ’s 250 km to the north from Moscow , on the bank of Volga river .
Married , have two children .
And two dogs – this is first hobby : )
Another one is my garden where I like to spend summer time .
What about style of music … 20 years ago I could answer definitely – hard rock , currently I almost do not listen to any music .
Even my computer has no speakers at all .
Preferred drink – I like almost any drinks , provided it ’s high enough quality .
But if I need to choose one – OK , it ’s beer .
I ’m 46 years old .
2 ) How did you find Firebird , and how did you become a FB Core Team member ?
Infosystems ltd. , the company , where I ’ve used to work in year 2 K was choosing SQL server to use .
InterBase looked OK from most POVs , but it did not have dynamic SQL statements in triggers / procedures , which was a strong requirement .
When IB6 sources were published , I ’ve added that support – minimal , only EXECUTE VARCHAR ‘ some SQL statement ’ , without ability to return values and pass parameters , but even it was enough that time .
This form ( instead of current EXECUTE STATEMENT ) was chosen to avoid adding new tokens in DSQL parser .
I ’ve sent changes to some site in InterBase ring , and after a month or two of silence decided that it was ignored .
But approximately one year after that I ’ve received a letter from Dmitry Emanov with suggestion to join firebird project .
Next ( it was last 1.5 release time ) I ’ve got a suggestion to perform security review of firebird .
Certainly there were also a lot of generic bug fixes .
When 2.0 was started , I was one core FB developers .
3 ) You are known as being the person responsive for the security improvements and fixes in Firebird .
If you would start a new and fresh Firebird ( i.e. : no worries about backward compatibility ) , what would you change in terms of the currently security model ?
Remove security2.fdb and related authentication tools at all , and use OS native authentication instead .
Avoid sending passwords over the wire ( use a kind of CHAP instead ) .
Optionally encrypt all data , transferred over the wire .
BTW , almost all of this , but with optional backward compatibility support , is planned for FB3 .
4 ) A recurrent question in discussion lists is how to protect your database from being accessed by SYSDBA .
What is your answer for this question ?
Can we expect any improvement in this area with FB 3.0 ?
This is a kind of wrong question .
This is almost as asking to protect some file in unix from root access :-)
But , taking into an account , that too many badly administered servers with firebird installed exist in the world , there will be one answer to this question in FB3 – per database configurable security database .
One will be able to even setup database itself to store logins to it .
This is supposed to be done in aliases .
conf file in this way :
SomeAlias = / path/to/database/file.fdb { SecurityDatabase=$ ( self ) }
Side note – you will be able to add a lot of ( but not all ) parameters from firebird .
conf here , making them have different values for different databases .
Interviewer :
But this would n’t solve the problem of having a “ stolen ” database being accessed by SYSDBA of another Firebird server , since he would have full control of the aliases .
conf in his own server .
Yes , certainly – it will not work .
Moreover – even if you add ANY other protection ( except serious data encrypting ) , database can anyway be stolen .
Suppose we add a flag to database header – it can be accessed only using internal users table , i.e. no control from aliases .
conf .
But a person who has stolen that database has a variety of choices :
– Remove that flag with any hex editor
– Build engine which ignores such flag
Do not forget , this is open source !
Well – imagine we have the ability to crypt database data using some crypt plug -in .
Old InterBase even has some code to handle database page level encryption . ]
It has serious disadvantage – crypt key is passed via DPB , making it necessary ( in case of direct use ) store it on all workstations , which is definitely not secure .
On the other hand , one can write plug - in which will ignore that key , and do the job itself .
But main problem remains – if database can be stolen , what prevents crypt plug - in itself to be stolen ?
Therefore on my mind ( and that ’s mind of all developers ) the only way to protect your database from being stolen is to have correctly administered OS on your server .
5 ) What was the most difficult task you have done for Firebird up to now , and what one made you more proud ?
Very hard to answer …
There were too many various bug fixes , and which one is the most hard – do not know .
Some happen to be trivial , some – complex .
May be the most hard to fix are bugs that are not easy to reproduce , specially if they show themselves on some rare type of CPU , not available to me except remote connection ( like HPPA / PARISC for example ) .
When famous Russian poet and singer Vladimir Vysotsky was asked “ What is your favorite song ? ” he used to answer – one that I ’m writing currently .
In the same way I hope that the most interesting tasks with firebird will be in the future versions 🙂
6 ) What are the major challenges for FB in the near future ?
The major one is common pages cache for multiple connection ( also called SMP - friendly superserver ) .
At the same time we plan to have COM - like plugins ’ interface and reanimate OSRI architecture , all of this in FB3.0 .
On this basis it will be possible to talk about making something like 3.5 version as SQL standard compatible as possible .
7 ) Working with security is something that you enjoy , or it is kind of “ ok , if nobody wants to do this , I ’ll take care of it ” ?
It ’s interesting to work in some area ( here I understand it more wide than firebird only related question ) , when you need to solve some problems , that did not have a solution before you .
From this POV security in firebird is still interesting area – there are still remaining problems to be solved before it becomes not interesting .
And I have plans to make it not interesting in FB3 development cycle 🙂
8 ) What do you think is missing to Firebird become more visible in the global media ?
Seems that some people still thinks FB is a RDBMS just for small volume of data or connections .
How to change this ( wrong ) perception ?
Sorry , I ca n’t answer this question .
Technically even firebird 2.1 classic is capable to handle about one thousand of connections or even slightly more .
Superserver can handle much more , but even in 2.5 it does not have good SMP support .
In FB3 we plan to have superserver ’s abilities to handle connections and classic ’s to support SMP to be present together in the single engine .
Database size limitations were removed in FB2.0 , therefore talking currently about ‘ small volume of data ’ is totally incorrect .
Firebird is also ideally scalable system – from ARM and Renessas SH with x86/x64 in the middle up to UltraSparc , IA64 and S390X .
Have a look such companies use firebird : I will mention only SAS institute in the USA ( they compared performance of firebird with a lot of other database engines and chosen firebird ) and MICEX in Russia ( they ’ve primarily started to use InterBase due to its unique events delivery feature and currently successfully use firebird ) .
Could ‘ small volumes ’ be firebird ’s reality , such companies would never - never use it .
Therefore why do some people think that firebird is ‘ f or small volume of data or connections ’
I really do not know …
May be because it works in such cases also very well ?
9 ) Based on past discussions , it seems that , being FB an Open Source project , the major problem in implementing extended data security is about handling the crypto “ key ” , in a effective and not too difficult way for the user .
What are your considerations about this , any solution ?
This is almost like a question about untrusted sysdba 🙂
There are a lot of tools , keeping data encrypted in database file , starting with TrueCrypt – free open source on - the - fly disk encryption .
I absolutely seriously suggest all of you to build layered systems , and disk encryption layer is definitely not one which should be mixed with RDBMS .
Layering is a way how unix was always designed / implemented – on contrary with windows , where a way of creating single all - purposes monsters is traditional .
Please , do not go wrong ways .
10 ) What features you would like to develop for Firebird , but for some reason were n’t able to do so yet ( and what is holding you ) ?
That I very much wish to see in firebird is derived tables – an ability to ( sorry , DDL syntax is invited on the run , and I prefer this sample to long description ) :
CREATE TABLE BASE_TABLE ( X BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , Y VARCHAR ( 255 ) ) ; CREATE TABLE DERIVED_TABLE BASED ON BASE_TABLE ( Z TIMESTAMP ) ; COMMIT ;
INSERT INTO BASE_TABLE VALUES ( 1 , 'abc ' ) ; INSERT INTO BASE_TABLE VALUES ( 2 , ' def ' ) ; INSERT INTO DERIVED_TABLE VALUES ( 3 , 'xyz ' , CURRENT_DATE ) ; COMMIT ;
After this DERIVED_TABLE contains 1 record and BASE_TABLE – 3 records .
This can be a great improvement to handle a lot of real word information .
What ’s holding me – a lot of everyday work with firebird : posix ports , security , bug fixes , etc .
Note :
The feature that Alex called as “ derived table ” is more known as “ Table Inheritance ” .
Do n’t confuse it with the Derived Tables feature already introduced in Firebird 2.1 .
I wish to thanks Alex for taking the time to answer all the questions in this interview .
We know our developers are always very busy working for FB 😉
Economics of Contempt has an almost undescribably good post up on the problem of " To Big to Fail " resolution proposals .
I was having dinner with a friend from business school last night , and we talked about this quite a bit -- and the more we talked , the more complications we found .
The problem is that " too big to fail " is n't about the size of a bank 's balance sheet ; it 's about how tightly coupled that balance sheet is with other institutions .
The FDIC can resolve even a huge conventional commercial bank , because as long as the loans are sold and the depositors paid off , that failure does n't suddenly and massively impair other peoples ' balance sheets .
( It may , down the road , if for example a huge portfolio of real estate loans is written down , which casts doubt on the value of the collateral securing the loan books of other banks .
But that 's different from triggering a bank run . )
It is pretty clear to me that the Fed and Treasury decided to let Lehman ( or whatever bank tottered next , rather ) fail , pour encourager les autres -- and that despite months of preparation , they did n't foresee the meltdown in the money markets that this failure touched off .
Hence all the subsequent bailouts : no one could be quite sure what the fallout from further failures might be .

COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - Sri Lanka said on Monday it had demanded Washington drop an attempt to question its top military official over possible human rights violations in the last phase of the country ’s 25 - year civil war .

Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said he had been told General Sarath Fonseka , the chief of Defense Staff , had been asked by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to attend an interview aimed at gathering information against Sri Lanka ’s defense secretary .
Fonseka , who led the army to victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in May , is visiting the United States where his daughters attend university .
The foreign minister said an attorney at the Department of Homeland Security told Fonseka the aim of the interview was to pull together information against Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa , a brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and a naturalized U.S. citizen .
The department ’s Immigrations and Customs Enforcement division would normally have authority only to probe a matter related to Fonseka ’s prospective U.S. citizenship as a green card holder and not any possible human rights violations .
Bogollagama said Fonseka , army chief at the time of the final offensive against the Tigers , had received a letter followed by a phone call to attend an interview on Wednesday .
Fonseka is now in Oklahoma .
“ The Department of Homeland Security should forthwith desist from any endeavor to interview General Fonseka , ” Bogollagama told reporters , adding he had called in the U.S. ambassador to Colombo , Patricia Butenis , to give her that message .
“ Whatever information General Fonseka may have acquired in the exercise of his official duties is privileged by nature .
Therefore , it cannot legally be shared with third parties without the prior approval and consent of the Sri Lanka authorities . ”
Asked for details of the interview request and the reasons behind it , Jeff Anderson , a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Colombo , said : “ We are looking into it . ”
Sri Lanka faces heavy Western pressure over its human rights record .
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on October 22 suggested an external inquiry in Sri Lanka similar to Gaza on war crimes [ ID : nLN294865 ] , while the European Union is considering whether to withdraw a trade concession that helps Sri Lanka ’s top export , garments .

Sri Lanka said last week that it would appoint a panel to probe a report by the U.S. State Department detailing possible atrocities by both warring parties in the final battle of the 25 - year war .
The government defeated the Tamil Tigers in May in a bitter final phase led by Fonseka with both Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa giving all the necessary support .
Fonseka ’s name has now surfaced as a potential presidential contender to President Rajapaksa , speculation opposition parties have been happy to fan against the incumbent ’s enormous post - war popularity .
But the government has said there was no rift between Fonseka and Rajapaksa , who promoted the army commander to the Chief of Defense Staff in July , which many analysts saw as neutralizing the wide powers Fonseka had in wartime .
The dress was unveiled at a football stadium in the West Bank
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron have sewn what they believe is the world 's largest embroidered dress .
About 150 women helped make the dress , which is 32.6 m ( 107ft ) long and 18.1 m ( 59.4ft ) wide , organisers said .
It is hoped that the dress will secure a place in the Guinness Book of World records and promote local handicrafts .
Many women in the West Bank have turned to handicrafts for income since Israeli restrictions imposed after the second intifada caused the economy to decline .
The Palestinian economy lost ground for the ninth year in a row in 2008 , with a 1.2 % decline in per capita GDP and a rise in the unemployment rate to 32 % , according to a recent UN report .
The economic decline was rooted in Israel 's restrictions on the movement of people and goods , the erosion of the Palestinian productive base , the loss of some of the territory 's most fertile land and natural resources to the Israeli barrier in the West Bank , and expanding settlement activities there , the report said .
The Israeli government says the restrictions are essential to prevent Palestinian militants from entering Israel and attacking Israeli civilians .
The US Department of Agriculture highlights how the United States in the last decade , despite increased aggregate wealth , slid back significantly in terms of food insecurity as measure of poverty .
With everyone now focused on the unemployment situation , it bears noting that even before the downturn in the economy there had been a large surge in food insecurity nationwide .
The Guardian says :
Food insecurity – defined by the USDA as when " food intake … was reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year because the household lacked money and other resources for food " – afflicted 14.6 % of Americans in 2008 .
ie , some 50 million people were too poor to guarantee being able to put food on the table .
The table below , also from the Guardian , shows where food insecurity is highest .
While much of the distress is concentrated in the South , there are plenty of states in the Southwest and West as well .
Maine has the highest food insecurity in the Northeast .
My interpretation of the data goes to income inequality .
I see this as evidence that the last decade of growth in the U.S. has not been beneficial for poorer Americans .
However , I would go further in saying that the downturn in the U.S. and rising unemployment , bankruptcy and foreclosure in the middle class has made plain that the middle class has also been left behind .
While distress amongst poorer Americans is plain from these numbers , the diminished position in the middle class was masked by a surge in debt .
This was made plain only as a result of a drop in asset prices .
At present , U.S. policy makers are trying to make this problem go away by reflating an asset bubble , but continued high unemployment is the elephant in the room which higher asset prices can not make disappear .
As for the poor , a related Guardian article gets to the heart of things :
The report said 6.7 million people were defined as having " very low food security " because they regularly lacked sufficient to eat .
Among them , 96 % reported that the food they bought did not last until they had money to buy more .
Nearly all said they could not afford to eat balanced meals .
Although few reported that this was a permanent situation throughout the year , 88 % said it had occurred in three or more months .
Nearly half reported losing weight because they did not have enough money to buy food .
The number of children living in households where there were shortages of food at times rose by nearly one - third to 17 million .
The report says that most parents who did not get enough to eat ensured their offspring received sufficient food but that more than 1 million children still suffered outright hunger .
The worst affected states are in the south with Mississippi having the largest proportion of its population enduring shortages of food followed by Texas and Arkansas .
More than half of those affected are minorities , principally black people and Hispanics .
Millions more Americans do not go hungry only because they are so poor they receive government food stamps or rely on handouts from food banks such as Feeding America .
In some states , such as West Virginia , one in six of the population is on food stamps .
This is certainly the stuff of depressions more than V - shaped recoveries .

WASHINGTON  Seven former directors of the Central Intelligence Agency asked President Obama on Friday to shut down the new Justice Department inquiry into past abuses during interrogations of terrorism suspects , arguing that it “ will seriously damage ” the nation ’s ability to protect itself .
In a letter to Mr. Obama , the former C.I.A. chiefs said the cases under study had already been examined by career prosecutors who found that no criminal charges were warranted .
To reopen cases based on a change in which political party controls the government , they wrote , will make it harder for intelligence officers to take risks without worrying that some future attorney general might investigate them .
“ Those men and women who undertake difficult intelligence assignments in the aftermath of an attack such as September 11 must believe there is permanence in the legal rules that govern their actions , ” the men said in their letter .
They argued that the new inquiry would result in the disclosure of information about past operations that “ can only help Al Qaeda ” elude capture , and would convince foreign intelligence agencies that they could not trust the United States to protect secrets .

UN inspectors got their first look today inside a once - secret uranium enrichment facility that has raised western suspicions about the extent of Iran 's nuclear programme .
The semi-official Mehr news agency reported that the four - member team visited the heavily protected facility , carved into a mountainside south of Tehran .
The tour marked the first independent examination of the site , but no results were expected until after the inspectors leave Iran later this week .
The review also coincides with the countdown to Iran 's expected decision on whether to accept a UN - brokered deal to process its nuclear fuel abroad – a plan designed to ease western fears about Iran 's potential ability to produce weapons - grade material .
The disclosure last month of Iran 's second enrichment facility – known as Fordo after a village believed to have the largest percentage of fighters killed in the 1980 - 88 war with Iraq – raised international suspicion over the extent and aim of Tehran 's nuclear programme .
But Iran says that by reporting the existence of the site voluntarily to the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog , it " pre-empted a conspiracy " against Tehran by the US and its allies who were hoping to present the site as evidence that Iran was developing its nuclear programme in secret .
Iran also has promised to respond later this week on a UN - drafted proposal to have its nuclear fuel processed outside the country .
Iran claims it only seeks peaceful reactors for research and energy .
Although Iran has not given its official answer on the proposed nuclear deal – discussed last week after talks in Vienna with the US , France and Russia – there are increasing doubts that Iran 's leadership will come on board .
Yesterday , parliament speaker Ali Larijani claimed the west was trying to " cheat " Iran under the deal that would ship most of Iran 's uranium to Russia for reactor - ready enrichment .
Larijani , the country 's former nuclear negotiator , said Iran prefers to buy the nuclear fuel it needs for a reactor under construction that makes medical isotopes .
He did not specifically address the fuel needs for Iran 's planned Russian - built full - scale reactor , but Russia is required to provide fuel as part of agreement to build it for Iran in the southern city of Bushehr .
The reactor is nearly operational .
Rejection of the UN deal would force the US and its allies to either return to talks or step up demands for greater economic sanctions .
The four - member delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency is led by Herman Nackaerts , director of the IAEA 's division of operations department of safeguards .
The inspectors are expected to stay three days in Iran .
The inspectors are expected to compare Iran 's engineering plans with the actual layout of the plant , interview employees and take environmental samples to check for the presence of nuclear materials .
Iranian lawmakers said the visit was evidence that Iran is open about its nuclear activities .
" IAEA inspectors ' visit to Fordo shows that Iran 's nuclear activities are transparent and peaceful , " the official IRNA news agency quoted lawmaker Hasan Ebrahimi as saying .
The Fordo uranium enrichment site , about 20 miles north of Qom , is protected by military installations including missile silos and anti-aircraft batteries , Iranian officials said last month .
Iran says the facility will not be operational for another 18 months .
The small - scale site is meant to house no more than 3,000 centrifuges – much less than the estimated 8,000 machines at Natanz , Iran 's known industrial - scale enrichment facility .
Still , the enriching machines in Qom facility will produce nuclear fuel , which could possibly be further enriched into material for atomic warheads .
Iran says it has built the facility inside a mountain next to a military site to protect its nuclear activities in case of an attack by the US or Israel .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A rich - nations recovery from the deepest recession since the 1930s is taking hold , although the latest Reuters economic outlook also shows tame inflation expectations and no rush by policymakers to hike interest rates .
Monthly surveys of around 200 economists across the United States and Europe show upward revisions to growth forecasts for the current quarter and an overall better outlook for the euro area and Britain than thought last month .
But the Reuters consensus for U.S. recovery , already relatively strong compared with Europe given that the U.S. was the first to lead the downturn and always expected to be the first to come out , has not strengthened much running into 2010 .
What has changed is confidence in the recovery ’s durability .
The median probability of a double - dip recession in the U.S. , with the economy slipping back into the red after a move higher , has narrowed to just one in five from one in four last month .
This coincides with yet more stock market gains since the last poll and the clearest pronouncement yet from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on recovery prospects , saying on Tuesday that the U.S. recession “ is very likely over . ”
But economists are reluctant yet to pencil in anything aggressive in the way of interest rate hikes even as debate rages over when central banks will shut off some of the incredibly accommodative policies currently in place .
“ Despite growing conviction among investors and analysts that one of the worst recessions in modern times is ending , questions about the strength and durability of economic recovery loom large , ” noted Robert DiClemente at Citi in New York .
That remains a big concern in Japan , where a new government faces the prospect of the recent rebound in quarterly growth tapering off while the economy experiences deflation this fiscal year and next .
INFLATION THREAT
Many in financial markets are worried that the trillions of dollars worth of central bank and government stimulus pumped into the system -- some of which has found its way into stock markets , sending them up 50 percent or more since March -- will eventually trigger an upward spiral in consumer prices .
Ten - year euro zone breakeven rates have risen to their highest in a year , which coincided with gold hitting an 18 - month high above $ 1,000 an ounce .
Storm clouds are gathering over the U.S. dollar and government bond yield curves are steepening .
Yet economists as a group do n’t seem so convinced about the inflation threat .
Apart from the UK , where inflation remains surprisingly sticky compared with other rich nations , there have been few signs of inflation picking up .
Forecasts for inflation this year and next remain remarkably tame , particularly for Japan , which is seen deflating .
There was little change overall compared with last month ’s poll .

Consumer spending , which makes up the largest part of gross domestic product , is likely to remain subdued in the coming months , particularly given that unemployment is still rising .
“ Against this backdrop , the near - term inflation outlook remains very well grounded and there are greater risks that disinflation tendencies could still surprise , ” said DiClemente .
The Reuters consensus for where U.S. unemployment will peak rose slightly to 10.1 percent , from 10.0 percent , in the first half of next year .
It ’s currently at 9.7 percent , the highest in more than a quarter century .
But that compares with a peak of 8.8 percent forecast in Q2 2010 predicted in a poll at the start of this year .
Since then the rate of non -farm payroll job losses has slowed but nearly 4 million jobs have gone since the start of the year .
In the euro area , joblessness is expected to peak at 10.8 percent , the same level predicted last month .
Interest rates , which central banks tend not to raise while unemployment is still climbing , look set to remain steady well into the second half of next year .
Tame inflation , at least for the moment , will allow policymakers to remain cautious .
“ The degree of uncertainty is still high .
Withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary stimulus in the euro zone and worldwide could significantly postpone a strong recovery , ” said Paulo Carvalho at Banco BPI .
The State as Drug Lord
I think one of the more telling points against the drug war is just how hypocritical the states involved in the Drug War are .
The key government players are under absolutely no illusion that they ’re helping to combat drug use .
Rather , the state — especially the U.S. national security state operating abroad — has exactly the same interest as any other organized crime lord in keeping the stuff illegal : it keeps the price up .
The higher the price , the more money outfits like the CIA can make selling the shit to fund their favored thugs .
Of course there are some useful idiots in Congress , the White House Office of Drug Control Policy , etc. , who actually take this shit at face value .
The more naïve Drug War supporters in Congress and the state legislatures play the role of Baptists in this classic Baptist / Bootlegger scenario .
But the real players in the Drug War , the people inside the loop , the people who really matter , want drugs kept illegal for the same reason Al Capone supported Prohibition .
From the Golden Triangle of Indochina , to crack cocaine funding for the Contras , to the latest revelations about the CIA ’s ties to Walid Karzai ’s opium operation , the story repeats itself like the leitmotif in a Wagnerian opera .
When Rothbard said governments were mafias , it was n’t just a figure of speech .
Keeping it in mind is a useful antidote to the whole pink - ass “ Policeman Dan is always your friend ” culture that too many suburban white folks have absorbed .
Along the same lines , if you find yourself continually shocked by every new revelation ( like recent news of Karzai ) that yet another loathsome international gangster is on the CIA payroll , you might want to reevaluate your view of the world .
Any time the American state and its pet media ( see Noam Chomsky ’s and Edward Herman ’s propaganda model of the media ) attempt to manufacture a pretext for war by whipping up a moral panic about the latest Hitler - of - the - Week , be prepared to discover that he ’s actually been on the CIA payroll for decades .
Regarding the propaganda model , by the way , think back to cable news coverage of the Russia - Georgia thing last year .
In all that talk about “ Russian aggression , ” how many times do you recall anyone reminding the audience that Georgia actually started the whole thing by invading a province whose independence was guaranteed by treaty , even firing on Russian peacekeeping troops ?
Did anyone mention the role of the International Republican Institute , National Endowment for Democracy , or Soros Foundation in engineering color coded revolutions like that of Georgia ?
Or put those color - coded revolutions in context as an attempt by Oceania to encircle Eurasia ?
Uh huh — I did n’t think so .
The U.S. national security community helped engineer the coup that put Saddam in power .
You know how they ’re always bleating that he “ used weapons of mass destruction against his neighbors ” ?
Um , yeah , sure — he used them against neighbors like Iran back in the 1980s ; and guess who the U.S. was backing in that war ?
Like the joke goes , the U.S. government knew Saddam had WMDs because it saved the receipts .
If Satan were a CIA client and either outlived his usefulness or stopped taking orders from Washington , you can be dead sure the next day you ’d see a presidential spokesman at the podium , or Gen .
Powell briefing the Security Council , breathlessly announcing all the terrible , terrible stuff they ’d “ just discovered ” was going on in Hell .
And then a photo would resurface of Don Rumsfeld shaking hands with the Devil twenty years before .
Virtually everything you see about the world in the mainstream press is as scripted as the Five - Minutes Hate in 1984 .
Once again : Free your minds !
Policeman Dan is not your friend .
And what the U.S. government does overseas has nothing to do with “ freedom ” and “ democracy . ”
It ’s all about propping up a system of power — and in doing so , the American state has installed or defended some of the worst monsters in history .

Oil tankers are the floating goldmines of the ocean and it is of little wonder that pirates see them as attractive , if not imposing , targets .
But with oil supplies supposedly running low , the last thing we need is for our precious barrels of liquid gold to fall into the wrong hands .
Yesterday , Somali pirates seized a tanker carrying crude oil from Saudi Arabia to the United States in the increasingly dangerous waters off East Africa , in an attack that could pose a huge environmental and security threat to the region .
The Greek - owned Maran Centaurus was about 1,300 km off Somalia when it was hijacked on Sunday , said the EU Naval task force ( Navfor ) .
The ship , with its 28 crew members , was full of oil and is believed to be one of the largest yet seized by Somali pirates .
Pirates use guns and rocket - propelled grenades
In November 2008 , pirates hijacked the Saudi supertanker Sirius Star , which held 2 million barrels of oil valued at about $ 100 million .
The tanker was released last January for a reported $ 3 million ransom after a two - month drama that helped galvanize international efforts to fight piracy off Africa ’s coast .
There are many dangers involved when an oil tanker is commandeered by pirates , most notably being run aground or getting involved in a fire - fight .
Pirates typically use guns and rocket - propelled grenades in their attacks , and some vessels now carry private security guards , but oil tankers do not .
As Roger Middleton , a piracy expert at London - based think - tank Chatham House , says , “ You ’re sitting on a huge ship filled with flammable liquid .
You do n’t want somebody with a gun on top of that .
“ Financially it ’s a very costly exercise because the value of oil is so volatile .
If it is held for a long time and the price of oil drops , they could lose millions of dollars . ”
Responding with evasive maneuvers
But what steps can an oil tanker take to defend itself from a pirate attack ?
Earlier this month the US - flagged container ship Maersk Alabama repelled an attack by suspected pirates off the northeast coast of Somalia .
According to a statement from the US 5th Fleet , when a pirate skiff approached the ship , the security team on board responded with evasive maneuvers , and blasted them with Long Range Acoustic Devices ( LRADs ) and small - arms fire .
The pirates then broke off the attack .
The LRAD is just one of a number of ways in which vessels can protect themselves , and the technology can easily be applied to any oil tankers at risk from attack .
Fire hoses , robot boats and dazzle guns are other forms of anti-piracy devices that are more commonly used by other large vessels such as container ships , but oil tankers have cargo well worth protecting , and the above infographic takes a closer look at how .
Get ready , wine collectors : Bordeaux looks like it 's having a historically great vintage in 2009 .
The weather has been warm and dry all summer , and most of the Merlot is already harvested .
On the Right Bank , where Merlot is the dominant grape , vintners are comparing '09 to the great years of the last century .
" The '09 vintage has been the perfect vintage , " said Christian Moueix , president of the family company that makes some of the most expensive wines in Pomerol , including Petrus .
" We had the summer of '89 and the picking of ' 90 .
I compare it to ' 47 .
We will have that kind of extraordinary character . "
There 's always some hype with vintage reports , because nobody wants to tell customers that next year 's product is n't worthy .
But weather records do n't lie .
About an inch of rain fell over three days in mid-September ; then the skies stayed dry for the next three weeks .
A storm was expected last week , encouraging some wineries to pick beforehand .
But the clouds stayed away days longer than expected and eventually dropped just a few millimeters in some areas , a sprinkling that the Medoc 's famous Cabernet Sauvignon vines probably welcomed .
Moreover , technology has advanced tremendously since great vintages like 1982 , meaning quality should be more consistent .
The one worry is alcohol level :
All that warm weather means some of this year 's wines will be pushing 15 % .
That , and the fear that the world economy may not be ready for the prices Bordeaux negociants might demand when word starts to get out -- which it will very soon .
" The word for the vintage is fruit , " Moueix said .
" Unbelievable -- you enter the tank rooms and you smell so much more fruit than I have smelled in years . "

Research by the University of Warwick and the University of Manchester finds that psychological therapy could be 32 times more cost effective at making you happy than simply obtaining more money .
The research has obvious implications for large compensation awards in law courts but also has wider implications for general public health .
Chris Boyce of the University of Warwick and Alex Wood of the University of Manchester compared large data sets where 1000s of people had reported on their well - being .
They then looked at how well - being changed due to therapy compared to getting sudden increases in income , such as through lottery wins or pay rises .
They found that a 4 month course of psychological therapy had a large effect on well - being .
They then showed that the increase in well - being from an £ 800 course of therapy was so large that it would take a pay rise of over £ 25,000 to achieve an equivalent increase in well - being .
The research therefore demonstrates that psychological therapy could be 32 times more cost effective at making you happy than simply obtaining more money .
Governments pursue economic growth in the belief that it will raise the well - being of its citizens .
However , the research suggests that more money only leads to tiny increases in happiness and is an inefficient way to increase the happiness of a population .
This research suggests that if policy makers were concerned about improving well - being they would be better off increasing the access and availability of mental health care as opposed to increasing economic growth .
The new research paper , entitled " Money or Mental Health : The Cost of Alleviating Psychological Distress with Monetary Compensation versus Psychological Therapy " is published online this week at : Health Economics , Policy and Law .
This research helps to highlight how relatively ineffective extra income is at raising well - being .
The researchers further draw on two striking pieces of independent evidence to illustrate their point - over the last 50 years developed countries have not seen any increases to national happiness in spite of huge economic gains .
Mental health on the other hand appears to be deteriorating worldwide .
The researchers argue that resources should be directed towards the things that have the best chance of improving the health and happiness of our nations - investment in mental health care by increasing the access and availability of psychological therapy could be a more effective way of improving national well - being than the pursuit of income growth .
The research also has important implications for the way in which " pain and suffering " is compensated in courts of law .
Currently the default way in which individuals are compensated is with financial compensation .
The research suggests that this is an inefficient way at repairing psychological harm following traumatic life events and that a more effective remedy would be to offer psychological therapy .
University of Warwick researcher Chris Boyce said :
" We have shown that psychological therapy could be much more cost effective than financial compensation at alleviating psychological distress .
This is not only important in courts of law , where huge financial awards are the default way in which pain and suffering are compensated , but has wider implications for public health and well - being . "
" Often the importance of money for improving our well - being and bringing greater happiness is vastly over - valued in our societies .
The benefits of having good mental health , on the other hand , are often not fully appreciated and people do not realise the powerful effect that psychological therapy , such as non-directive counselling , can have on improving our well - being . "

Godwin ’s Law — which says that in any sufficiently long online discussion , someone will compare his opponent to Hitler — is often interpreted to mean that if you do , in fact , start making Nazi comparisons , you ’ve lost the argument and can no longer be taken seriously .
I ’m all for that .
( Does this mean that we should no longer take any significant figure in the Republican Party seriously ?
Yes , it does . )
But there are a lot of moral equivalents of Nazi comparisons , and they should receive the same treatment .
I propose that we officially declare that anyone who
1. Responds to calls for more government action in some area — employment creation , health care , whatever — by invoking the example of the Soviet Union
or
2. Responds to suggestions that moderate inflation and / or dollar depreciation is acceptable by invoking the example of Zimbabwe
or
3 . Responds to any demonstration that projected debt levels , while high , are within the range advanced countries have successfully dealt with in the past by invoking the example of Argentina
be summarily consigned to the outer darkness .
Make it so .
The number of those who have died from flu or acute respiratory infections in Ukraine increased to 239 as of late on Thursday , Nov. 12 , the Health Ministry has reported .
The ministry said that 26 people , including three children , had died in the last 24 hours .
It was reported late on Wednesday that 213 people had died of flu and acute respiratory infections .

From the late 1980s to the turn of the new century their unbelievable purchasing power and rabid fandom put America at large through the torture of boy bands , and their droves returned in 2008 to elevate the first Twilight to box office returns far above its lackluster production values and horrid script .
Twilight ’s smaltzy take on ancient Romanian mythical creatures ramps up the cheese factor in the film ’s sequel : New Moon .
This time , its melodramatic aesthetics boils over into the werewolf mythos as well .
Twilight Saga : New Moon is a film that can bring out the cinema snob in literally anyone .
Its flaccid story and abuse of slow - motion pan shots fill any intelligent person so full of sap they ’ll have to detox with Mexican soap operas .
Bella Swan ( Kristen Stewart ) again proves herself the most powerful being in the film .
Her ability to trap metrosexual creatures of the night in un-erotic gazes of inexplicable passion going unbeaten throughout the film ’s 130 minutes .
Recovering from her near fatal vampire attack by celebrating her birthday with a group of vampires , Bella gets a paper - cut that sends one of the undead into a blood lust , causing Bella ’s beau Edward Cullen ( Robert Pattinson ) to finally realize how much danger he puts her in with his presence and ditches her .
After a brief period of lukewarm moroseness , Bella reunites with her old friend Jacob Black ( Taylor Lautner ) , their burgeoning relationship slowly revealing his guise as a werewolf .
As Black ’s clan later collides with Cullen ’s family , Bella may be forced to choose between the two “ men ; ” unpredictable futures lying in wait on either side .
The film ’s plot is disbursed evenly between drawn - out scenes of pseudo - romantic moments between Bella and her supernatural boy toys , which try to emphasize the torturous passions between them , although because of the quality of acting it comes off more as minute long examinations of each other ’s faces .
Despite an immortal supporting cast , Kristen ’s Bella is the deadest faced , with each of the two competing males mustering only their sentence - long character traits : Edward is sullen and mysterious , Jack is tan and sporting adorable muscles .
These muscles are surprisingly integral to the storyline , as werewolves apparently have the ability to remain shirtless in human form during the rainy season .
Michel
Sheen ’s pitiable appearance towards the climax as Vampire family - head Aro almost gives the film a moment of passable performance , but he ’s quickly drowned in the sadistically histrionic storyline .
If praise must be laden upon the original film , the helicopter landscape shots definitely captured the Pacific Northwest in a gorgeous light , giving the woods an appropriate mystical quality .
But with Catherine Hardwicke – the first film ’s director – thrown out the picture , the Hollywood mainstay theory of “ more is better ” takes full effect .
While the scenery may occasionally be captured correctly , the camera takes the pan and tracking shot motif miles beyond its limit , the camera trying it ’s best to make two groups of soon - to - be Abercrombie and Fitch models epic .
Most likely realizing their mistake in post - production , the film attempts to compensate with slow - motion shots , to the degree that any inherent beauty or complexity a fight / battle scene could hold is stretched so thin it nearly tears the film in the projection reel .
The producers also took unfortunate note of the Cult of Edward , giving the vampire the ability to slow down the film ’s speed with every walking shot he takes .
Every .
Single .
One .
Computer effects are decent and without noticeable flaw , but again , when slowed down they become more tepid than the novel the film is based on .
Makeup is used hilariously , with the Vampires looking like the antagonist of “ Blade Trinity ” when he covered his vampiric face in sunscreen .
Costumes occasionally breach mediocrity and deliver a truly lived - in looking piece , sometimes being the only respite in the eye - sexing scenes between the couples .
The soundtrack comes complete with a handful of flavorless pop songs , their punctuation into the film ’s routine orchestral track creating a real “ lesser of two evils ” sensation .
Simply put , if you can find something positive in the design of New Moon , a career in forensic criminology might just be the career for you .
The most frustrating aspect of The Twilight Saga : New Moon is that its mountain of faults will be ignored by the box office .
Its mobs of fans will be sedated by shots of boy - torso and abstinence - approved love scenes and eagerly gobble up their required ten pounds of merchandise .
What had slowly been developing in the 1990s with Bram Stoker ’s Dracula and Interview with the Vampire has been set back decades by a demographic whose only music expertise exists within the Disney pop library .

Delinda Epstein , 51 , was living in a townhouse in the swanky Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin , a few years ago .
She owned a brand new truck , worked as an administrator for a Henderson construction company .
But she lost her job in the recession .
She lost her truck and had to move into a smaller apartment in a less fancy neighborhood .
Hunting around for income , she placed an Online ad on Craigslist in August : “ Are you looking to spend less time cleaning , shopping and running errands or any of the small minute things that interrupt your busy schedule / life ?
I can help ! ” Transportation was one of the services offered .
She received a call from Richie , a businessman who said he needed to arrange a ride from McCarran International Airport to Rhodes Ranch .
The two agreed on a $ 30 fee .
On Sept. 3 , she pulled up to the curb at passenger pick - up , driving her 2006 Hyundai Elantra , which she had bought through a second - chance financing business .
But “ Richie ” was n’t interested in a ride .
He was an undercover agent with the county Transportation Authority , which sees its job in part as protecting licensed taxi and limousine operators from unlicensed competition .
As “ Richie ” settled in the passenger seat , a badge - bearing colleague knocked on Epstein ’s window .
“ I ’m thinking , ‘ Oh my God , do I have a terrorist in my car ? ’ ” Epstein said in a recent letter - to - the - editor .
No , so far as the two TSA agents were concerned it was Ms. Epstein , wearing jeans and flip - flops , who was the criminal .
Ms. Epstein was initially fined $ 3,800 , though that may get knocked down to $ 250 .
Her car was impounded .
She could n’t pay the processing fee of $ 250 plus $ 40 for each day it was in the lot , so she lost the Elantra and now rides the bus .
To top it all off , the Transportation Authority is forcing her to get rid of the cell phone number she ’s had for a decade because it was used in an illegal scheme .
So much for the contact number she ’d left on hundreds of job applications around town .
“ We ’re not heartless , but we do feel a lot of passion for protecting the public and that ’s what we ’re charged to do , ” Marilyn Skibinski , deputy commissioner for the authority , told Review - Journal columnist Adrienne Packer .
Oh , please .
Imagine someone rising in the galleries when this ordinance was proposed to object , “ Wait a minute ; if my friend from out of town calls and asks me to pick him up at the airport , and when I pick him up he hands me twenty bucks and says , ‘ Here , this is for gas , ’ under this ordinance I will have just committed a crime that could see me fined thousands of dollars , and I might even have to give up my phone number and my car ? ! ”
What do you suppose that person would have been told ?
County Commissioners and staff would have rolled their eyes at such a ridiculous hypothetical , insisting , ‘ No , no , we wo n’t use this ordinance THAT way .
The ordinance will be enforced REASONABLY .
We ’re just after big , organized outfits that make their livings providing taxi or limousine services without proper permits . ”
Would n’t they ?
Mind you , such rackets are still more about protecting existing operators from unwanted competition which would drive down costs to tourists — leaving them more money to spend in our restaurants , hotels , and casinos — than about “ public safety . ”
A lawyer tells me Ms. Epstein ’s final mistake — though her lack of resources doubtless contributed — was in pleading guilty before consulting a good attorney .
“ Entrapment ” is often defined as an action by a policing agency that creates a crime where a crime might otherwise never have occurred .
Since Ms. Epstein ’s freebie Internet ad did n’t specify “ will pick you up at the airport , ” had the county agents not reached out and invited her to break the law , who ’s to say she ever would have gone near the airport , at all ?
Government at all levels claims it can find “ no place to cut ” its bloated budgets , despite the current great recession .
Really ?
How
about laying off the airport “ sting ” operators who went after Delinda Epstein ?
“ I ’ve been hanging on by a thread , ” since losing her job , she says .
Not to worry , Ms. Epstein .
They ’re from the government ; they ’re here to help .
SAN FRANCISCO 
In many ways , MySQL embodies the ideals of the populist software movement known as open source , in which a program ’s creator releases it to the world free of charge , and legions of volunteers contribute improvements that are also freely shared .
The start - up company came out of nowhere , building a database application beloved by vibrant , young Internet companies .
Logging in from homes scattered around the globe , its workers seemed more a part of a virtual commune than a corporate monolith , and they relished taking on proprietary software giants like Microsoft .
But like most open - source companies , MySQL ’s sales , tied to support deals , never matched the astronomical number of downloads for its product , about 60,000 a day .
In January 2008 , the founders decided to sell the company for $ 1 billion to Sun Microsystems .
And this year , Sun agreed to sell itself to Oracle , which makes database software aimed at larger companies and tougher jobs , for $ 7.4 billion .
Now , disagreement over the value of MySQL  both as a stand - alone entity and as part of a big company  lies at the heart of a bitter public battle between Oracle and the European Union over the Sun acquisition .
The fight illuminates a larger truth about open - source companies : their societal and strategic importance far exceeds their financial value as operating businesses .
At last , there 's some good news for taxpayers in the Countrywide Financial loan scandal .

TrueXinjiang.com is a Web site that appeals instantly to the western eye .
The site , designed specifically to disseminate a Han-Chinese version of life in the remote autonomous region of Xinjiang , China , is free of many of the displeasing characteristics , such as clutter and endless pop-up ads , found on Chinese Web sites .
This English - only site , a subsidiary of Global Times , which is in turn a subsidiary of the Communist Party - sponsored People ’s daily , lacks even a Chinese Language version , leading Western viewers to the conclusion that the site is exclusively maintained for them .
TrueXinjiang.com , launched Jul. 13 , 2009 , less than a week after unrest left 197 dead in the region ’s capital Urumqi , features articles about the recent unrest and ensuing judicial aftermath , as well as opinion pieces by unnamed Han residents , glorifying their homeland .
Creators of the Web site describe it in the “ about us ” feature on the True Xinjiang homepage :
The site is the largest portal on Xinjiang in English language and aims to present everyone a true picture of this autonomous region in Northwest China .
Through this portal , aspects of Xinjiang rarely known to the outside world have a chance to highlight their charms .
It covers culture , religion , travel and latest developments in Xinjiang with voices from both authorities and individuals .
Information on the “ July 5th incident ” , in which Xinjiang ’s most populace minority , the Uighur , killed 197 Urumqi residents , is in abundance .
A column dedicated to news on the unrest sits at the top of the homepage .
There ’s no lack of information on Rebiya Kadeer either .
Kadeer , chairwoman of both the World Uighur Congress and the Uighur American Association , is accused by the Chinese government of orchestrating the violence on Jul. 5 via her home in the Washington , D.C. area .
Kadeer denies the charges .
Keeping in line with all other Chinese media , debate as to the nature of Kadeer ’s intentions is non-existent in articles at True Xinjiang :
[ Kadeer ] was colluding with leaders of terrorist , secessionist , extremist , and criminal organizations .
She was organizing and plotting activities that aim to split China .
In response to Kadeer ’s claim that the Uighur ’s situation resembled that of African - Americans before 1955 , an article titled “ Piercing Through Rabiya ’s Veil ” seeks to paint a picture of harmony among ethnic minorities :
… in no way have the Uygurs experienced these kinds of things , or any similar discrimination .
Anyone who does not believe this can just go around China and will see the Hans and the Uygurs rubbing shoulders with each other , especially in Xinjiang .
Many of the articles at truexinjiang.com , all of which give no credit of authorship , give the reader the sense that Xinjiang is not the region of ethnic tension that Western media have made it out to be .
The term ‘ Han ’ refers to Chinese largest ethnic group .
The Han , who make up 92 % of the population , dominate most aspects of Chinese society .
Often compared to the situation in Tibet , ethnic tension in Xinjiang is commonly attributed to the influx of Han into the region since its formal incorporation into the People ’s Republic of China in 1955 .
Han now compose 40 % of the population in Xinjiang , up from less than 10 % before 1949 .
A shuffling photo display on the True Xinjiang homepage shows China premier Wen Jiabao embracing an elderly Uighur farmer who lost family in an earthquake in 2003 .
Another photo demonstrates the leisurely demeanor of weekends in Urumqi : two Uighur women pedal a buggy down a park lane .
One columns featured on the site sheds the formal drape of newsworthy information and gives readers a sense of what life in Xinjiang is really like — for Han Chinese , that is .
Xinjiang : My Hometown provides a few quick opinion pieces about Han residents ’ sense of home in the region — again lacking authorship :
I come from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region .
But when I told it to my new friends , most of them was very surprising , ‘ what ?
You are from Xinjiang .
But you did n't look like a girl who comes from Xinjiang . ’
Yes , it is true .
Of course , I 'm a Han nationality .
However , I cannot understand why I must look like a Xinjiang 's girl ?
Another column , Xinjiang in My Eyes , depicts the region as a safe destination for travel and business in the eyes of foreigners .
In this article titled “ Japanese Bar Owner : Bar example of Ethnic Unity ” , a Japanese bar owners explains how his kitchen is a kettle of inter-ethnic harmony :
‘ Our kitchen is a good example of unity .
Our Han chefs are learning from Uygur colleagues how to make Uygur dishes while the Han chef is teaching our Uygur staff how to cook Sichuan food .
We call that very beneficial , ’ said [ the bar owner ] , who said he was attracted by the mixed culture in Urumqi and he is learning the Uygur language .
One feature not to be taken as blatant propaganda is the addressing some hot issues on the minds of Xinjiang residents .
The Internet blackout , enacted by the government since the unrest in July , has taken heavy tolls on business in the region .
Truexinjiang.com gives voice to the issue , and not necessarily at the behest of the government .
Two businessmen describe the inconveniences of running a business without internet access in an article titled “ Missing Link ” :
‘ To carry on my business , I had no choice but to set up a new office in Dunhuang , which is the closest town to Urumqi in Gansu province and has added to my costs .
No Internet means no income for me , ’ said Li Nan , who sells dried fruit online .
‘ Dunhuang has become a holy place for businessmen like me , although it takes 14 hours to get here from Urumqi by train . ’
“ ‘ Xinjiang needs the Internet .
The region is already less developed ( than other parts of the country ) and cutting off the Net only make things worse .
Imagine how many businesses could be lost because of the ban , ’ said Jurat Hamiti , a 30 - year - old businessman .
‘ The region 's economic development is just as important as stopping terrorists . ’
An interview with Jiang Zhaoyong , a current affairs commentator based in Beijing , sheds some light on Han - Uighur ethnic tensions :
Undoubtedly , tensions and grudges exist between the two ethnic groups .
Each has its own internal identity , and there is an division between the two ethnic groups …
In recent decades , the sense of frustration , deprivation and hatred among Uygur is actually caused by China ’s development mode , characterized by an overly rapid modernization process and pace of social change .
Yet for a site that claims to represent the reality of the autonomous region , one would expect some editorializing from the native ethnicities ’ perspective .
Unfortunately truexinjiang.com has n’t given a voice to the Uighur population , or any other of the 13 native ethnic groups who call the province home .
These voices are inseparable from a clear representation of the region .

On Fox News Sunday today , Howard Dean went head to head with Mike Huckabee on the public option .
When Huckabee said that the public option would put the private sector out of business , Dean said , “ There ’s not going to , nobody ’s going to put the private sector out of business .
That does n’t happen even in places like Germany or France or Britain . ”
Here is a transcript of their exchange :
HUCKABEE : I ’m not here to defendant private insurance companies , but to make it as if Medicare is wonderful and never makes a mistake , and the private insurance companies are demons — the facts just do n’t always bear that out .
Advertisements
WALLACE : Let me …
DEAN : Well , Medicare can …
WALLACE : Well , go ahead .
DEAN : … make mistakes , but let us have our choice .
We can leave Medicare if we want to under the system that ’s in the House …
HUCKABEE : But not if there ’s not …
DEAN : … and go back to the private sector .
HUCKABEE : … a system to go to .
If the private …
DEAN : Sure there is , in the private sector .
HUCKABEE : … system goes out of business , there wo n’t be any .
DEAN : There ’s not going to — nobody ’s going to put the private sector out of business .
That does n’t happen even in places like Germany or France or Britain .
Fifteen percent of all the dollars are private dollars , even in Britain , which is the most socialized system in the west .
Huckabee could not make his argument against the public option without resorting to fear mongering because opposition the public plan has nothing to do with facts , and everything to do with ideology .
If Republicans had any facts to support their opposition then they might be able to make a persuasive case , but the facts support the public option .
Dean is correct .
No one is talking about a complete government takeover of healthcare , but the only way Republicans can drum up opposition to reform is to illogically jump from point A to point D in their argument .
There will be plenty of room in the market for the private sector because the public option is only designed to cover 6 million people .
Dean leveled Huckabee ’s claims simply by pointing out that a public option does not equal government run healthcare , but some people will keep drinking the GOP Favor - Aid , and they wo n’t believe facts even when they are laid out in front of them .
Something tells me that the only thing the Fox News audience heard was government takeover of healthcare .

Arrogant Bastard Ale
Stone Brewing Company , Escondido , San Diego Co. , CA
Beer Info ( From the bottle ) “ This is an aggressive beer .
You probably wo n’t like it .
It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth .
We would suggest that you stick t something safer and more familiar territory — maybe something with a multi-million dollar ad campaign aimed at convincing you it ’s made in a little brewery , r one that implies that their tasteless fizzy yellow beer will give you more sex appeal .
Perhaps you think that multi-million dollar ad campaigns make a beer taste better .
Perhaps you ’re mouthing your words as you read this . ”
Boy is that perfect label verbiage .
At this point I could n’t care less if this was a bottle of walrus drool , just so long as I get to laugh again at that amazing wording .
Priceless .
Anyway , another of my new favorite 750 ml bottles in front of me here .
On the front is featured a really nicely illustrated demon with a smug look on his face as he hoists a brew to you , the drinker , basically saying , “ you do n’t even have the cajones to get some of this ! ”
Yeah , well , let ’s just see …
Wow .
And another wow .
Such a delicious pour with its deep amber hue and rich , creamy head .
The scents right out of the gate are ripe with bitterness from the singing hops and positively alive with malts .
If the description is any indication of what I ’m in for - and then the smells coupling that – this is going to be a hard hitting ale .
And there it is : smoky , oaky , peppery … absolutely alive with woody notes and its IPA characteristics .
It is stunning .
Nutty undertones , wicked bitterness that is beautifully smooth and crisp , and something of a hidden floral note that only comes out after its completely coated your mouth .
It ’s vibrant , taught , and full of flavor .
There is little denying that this is a superior ale in all its glory meant for sipping and enjoying for a lengthy piece of time .
If I were to pair this with some food , I ’d have to go with wood - plank fish , especially salmon or a nut - crusted walleye .
And then , match it with some fried shrimp and chips .
Oh yes .
This is a knock out .

Rating : * * * * 1/2
An ale that bites , for certain , but that does nothing to detract from its greatness … it only adds to it .

In a town already known for meteoric rises in status and fortune , a group of Los Angeles teenagers are said to have found a fast way to enjoy the glitz and glamour of the stars - by burgling their houses .
Los Angeles police say four teenage girls and a boy pored over fashion magazines , websites and gossip television shows and selected jewellery and clothing they wanted , then determined where the targeted stars lived , cased their houses , and struck , in some cases more than once at the same house .
The crude burglaries , which police say netted millions of dollars , were captured on surveillance cameras , and detectives have linked the teens to break - ins at the Hollywood homes of Lindsey Lohan , Paris Hilton , Orlando Bloom , reality television star Audrina Patridge , and others , US news media reported .
In some instances the victims remained unaware their homes had been burgled .
" This is a no - brains caper .
There 's not a lot of self - awareness , " Los Angeles detective Brett Goodkin told the Los Angeles Times .
" They saw it , they wanted it , they took it and continued taking it . "
The suspects , who include a girl who was hoping to star in a reality television show of her own , have earned instant notoriety in a culture in which the bar for media stardom seems to drop weekly .
In a twist seemingly written by a jobbing Hollywood screenwriter , the suspects now find themselves featured alongside the celebrities they are accused of burgling on TMZ.com , a celebrity news website that has followed the case since the thefts were first reported .
Police say the group 's ringleader was 19 - year - old Rachel Lee , arrested on Friday in Las Vegas .
TMZ reported that authorities seized from Lee 's father 's home in Las Vegas a hat linked to Lohan and partially nude photos linked to Hilton .
Lee , Diana Tamayo , 19 , Courtney Ames , 18 , Nicholas Prugo , 18 , and Alexis Neiers , 18 , are accused of a burglary spree that began in October 2008 and ran until September .
Prugo was the first arrested , after turning up alongside others in surveillance footage .
He was accused of stealing $ 170,000 in designer jewellery and clothing from the homes of Lohan and Patridge .
The girls were classmates at Indian Hills High School , a school for troubled teens .
The suspects were allegedly aided by 27 - year - old bartender Roy Lopez , accused of fencing the stolen goods .
Goodkin said the suspects focused on one star at a time , tracking their movements using ubiquitous celebrity photograph and media sites on the internet and learning when they were scheduled to be out of town .
Police seized from Prugo a laptop containing images of one of the suspects flashing a stack of cash , and showing a history of internet searches for close - up photographs of the victims ' jewellery , TMZ reported .
A lawyer for some of the victims has said Los Angeles paparazzi photographers are at fault for prying into stars ' private lives , revealing details about their houses and encouraging the theft .

This past year or two I 've been revisiting what you might call my cultural roots .
Because I was distracted almost daily by treatment for a wounded foot and unable to work much , I began re-reading the PG Wodehouse , Edgar Rice Burroughs and Sexton Blake stories I enjoyed as a kid .
From these I went on to movie and TV favourites , some of which proved to be pretty dreadful .
Among them were Hopalong Cassidy , The Prisoner – and Doctor Who .
I have to admit that , while I watched most of his episodes as the Doctor , I disliked William Hartnell , the first occupant of the Tardis , who barked with the authority of his sergeant from The Army Game .
Patrick Troughton , the second Doctor , brought an absent - minded quirkiness to the character which stayed with him at his best .
Jon Pertwee took him back to his more authoritarian mode and then came the glory years of Tom Baker – reasonable complexity , wit and an aptitude for ad libbing which was wonderful to watch but must have been murder for the other actors .
Every Saturday was organised around the Doctor 's adventures in Time and Space , with plenty of hiding behind available furniture ( you could n't actually get behind our sofa ) and there was even a visit to White City to meet Tom Baker and the Daleks in real life .
I remained unimpressed by 2001 , A Space Odyssey , but I 'd go to considerable lengths not to miss an episode of The Brain of Morbius .
I think I like the character mostly because he remains largely unrationalised and ambiguous .
Russell T Davies understood this and made it the Doctor 's most attractive quality .
All lasting characters , from Richard III on , have at least a duality which makes them appeal to new generations .
Like Arthur , Guinevere , Lancelot and Becky Sharp , the Doctor is infinitely interpretable .
About the only real science fiction I 've written since the 1960s was The Dancers at the End of Time stories , all done in the 70s .
They 're comedies set in the distant future with a nod to the fin - de - siècle of Oscar Wilde , HG Wells , Ernest Dowson and The Yellow Book .
Both comedy and SF depend on compression and exaggeration and are very often entertaining when combined .
There 's a long tradition of it : even Wodehouse wrote a funny , futuristic story early in his career ( The Swoop ! or How Clarence Saved England ) .
In the SF magazines , writers such as Henry Kuttner , Robert Sheckley and L Sprague de Camp were best loved for their comedy .
Douglas Adams , of course , hit the jackpot in the 1970s with The Hitch - Hiker 's Guide to the Galaxy .
Davies and his writers realised this when the Doctor made his comeback some five years ago with Christopher Eccleston and then David Tennant in the role .
Both actors have a talent for comedy and melodrama .
The plots became increasingly complex , playing with ideas of time and space , and I became an addict again .
Eventually , my well - springs replenished and my foot on the way to healing , Doctor Who became almost the only escapism I allowed myself .
Though I have written little SF recently , I have begun a series of autobiographical novellas and novels in which I examine my taste for romance and fantasy : my characters are thinly disguised versions of writers and others associated with New Worlds magazine in the days when we tried to find new approaches to literary novels by using the methods and ideas of science fiction .
This trilogy of books , featuring a version of myself in a somewhat re-invented London , is intended to examine the appeal of fantastic adventure stories of the kind inhabited by my most popular character , the albino sorcerer - prince Elric of Melniboné .
Elric is my Sherlock Holmes – a protagonist better remembered than most of my others , but in my case not the burden Conan Doyle felt Holmes to be .
I 'm very grateful that Elric continues to keep me in my old age , together with other stories I 've written set in my " multiverse " , a term I invented ( or reinvented , since I was n't originally aware that William James coined it to describe the many worlds our minds inhabit ) in 1962 , for a near - infinite system of parallel worlds in which subtly different versions of our own universe exist simultaneously .
The term caught on well enough to be used for a variety of purposes in popular fiction and theoretical physics and was incorporated into the lexicon of Doctor Who .
There 's nothing unusual in this .
Terry Pratchett said generic fiction is a big pot from which one takes a bit and adds a bit .
I 'm flattered that some of my ingredients became staples , but it 's always a pleasure to use what was once a private vocabulary in another medium .
When I was first offered the chance to write an original Doctor Who novel I hesitated .
I felt I 'd had enough fun and should settle down to the autobiographical stuff I 'd mapped out for the next year or two .
Then I realised that not only might I enjoy writing an original adventure , I could also take a look at what a character who has become part of our national folklore has come to mean .
I could do , in fact , what SF does best for an intelligent , knowing audience .
So I told my agent to go ahead and draw up the contract .
Now the vast potential of what I can write is beginning to dawn on me .
Far from thinking in terms of fun I 've become a little scared .
All time and space is open to me .
I have to mix comedy and melodrama while telling an epic adventure story featuring a complex protagonist capable of ranging across the entire multiverse .
I 'm increasingly overawed as I consider what I must live up to .
Hardcore fans are already questioning my qualifications .
I can only hope I 'm equal to the job .
The body of a missing four - year - old boy was found in the clothes dryer of a neighbour 's home , US police have said .
A 14 - year - old boy from the house in Mendota , California , has been arrested on suspicion of killing the child .
Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims told The Fresno Bee that Alex Mercado 's body was found on Saturday .
Sheriff Mims said the boy had been put in the dryer after he was killed .
Sheriff 's spokesman Chris Curtice said Alex 's parents reported him missing on Friday afternoon .
Deputies joined by dozens of volunteers combed the area through the night and the boy was found in the dryer about 24 hours after he disappeared .
The suspect - whose name was not released - was arrested later that day .
Belfast Telegraph
Children were cut off from families and some falsely told they were orphans in programme that sent 150,000 abroad between 1920 and 1967
Gordon Brown is to offer a formal apology to tens of thousands of British children forcibly sent to Commonwealth countries during the last century , many of whom faced abuse and a regime of unpaid labour rather than the better life they were promised .
The prime minister plans to make the apology in the new year after discussions with charities representing former child migrants and their families , a Downing Street spokeswoman said today .
In a letter to a Labour MP who has campaigned on the issue , Brown said that the " time is now right " for an apology , adding : " It is important that we take the time to listen to the voices of the survivors and victims of these misguided policies . "
Government records show that at least 150,000 children aged between three and 14 were taken abroad , mainly to Australia and Canada , in a programme that began in the 1920s and did not stop until 1967 .
The children , almost invariably from deprived backgrounds and already in some form of social or charitable care , were cut off from their families or even falsely informed that they were orphans .
While their parents were told the child migrants had gone to a better life , in many cases they remained in institutions or were sent to farming families and treated as unpaid labour , and many faced abuse .
A key subtext to the programme , particularly in relation to Australia , was the aim of supplying Commonwealth countries with sufficient " white stock " .
Brown 's apology follows other recent government expressions of regret for past policies now seen as inhumane .
Soon after Tony Blair took power in 1997 , Blair apologised to Irish people for the country 's potato famine 150 years before .
Ten years later he expressed sorrow for the UK 's role in the slave trade , although his words fell short of the unconditional apology demanded by campaigners .
While some critics dismissed these as meaningless stunts given the passage of time involved , many of those sent away as part of the Child Migrants Programme are still alive , with about 7,000 living in Australia alone .
Sandra Anker , who was sent there from Britain in 1950 , aged six , told the BBC she remained deeply angry at what had happened .
" Why I was sent out is beyond me .
I do n't understand it .
I was deprived of my rights as a British citizen and I feel the British government have a lot to answer for , " she said .
" We 've suffered all our lives .
For the government of England to say sorry to us , it makes it right .
Even if it 's late , it 's better than not at all . "
News of Brown 's move came as Australia 's prime minister , Kevin Rudd , this morning made a wider apology to the estimated 500,000 children , many from overseas , who were held in orphanages and other institutions around that country between 1930 and 1970 .
Rudd – who in 2008 made a landmark apology to the so - called " stolen generations " of aboriginal children forcibly removed from their parents – addressed about 900 former child migrants at the parliament building in Canberra .
He apologised to thousands of British children who suffered abuse and neglect after being shipped to Australia .
" We are sorry , " Rudd said .
" Sorry that as children you were taken from your families and placed in institutions where so often you were abused .
Sorry for the physical suffering , the emotional starvation and the cold absence of love , of tenderness , of care .
Sorry for the tragedy the absolute tragedy of childhoods lost . "
The British high commissioner in Australia , the former Labour minister Lady Amos , said the next stage would be for the government to work with the Child Migrants Trust , which campaigns on the issue , on a wording for the apology .
The trust 's founder , Margaret Humphreys , is in Canberra to hear Rudd 's apology .
She said : " This is a significant moment in the history of child migration .
The recognition is vital if people are to recover . "
The issue of the UK child migrants was investigated in 1998 by the Commons health select committee , a process which led to the Department of Health drawing up guidance for families to trace those sent away .
Kevin Barron , the Labour MP who chairs the committee , said he had received a letter from Brown outlining the planned apology and was " very pleased " .
Ed Balls , the children 's secretary , said yesterday the child migrant programme was " a stain on our society " .
" I think it is important that we say to the children who are now adults and older people , and to their offspring , that this is something that we look back on in shame , " he said .
A health department document drawn up for migrants ' families describes how a number of organisations , including Barnardo's , the Salvation Army , the Children 's Society and some Catholic groups , were involved in sending children abroad .
As a senior police official , Edmundo Mendes ’ job is to arrest the South American cocaine traffickers who use his troubled West African country , with its starry array of remote islands , as a transit point for drug shipments bound for Europe .
It has n’t been easy .
To demonstrate , Mendes walked a few steps from his office into the gritty mix of smoke and car exhaust in downtown Bissau .
He fished a ring of keys from his pocket and made quick work of a rusty padlock .
The metal door groaned open to a small courtyard .
Across the way was a room , about 10 by 15 feet , where four men looked out drowsily from behind a barred , glass - less window .
This holding cell is the only jail in a country of nearly 2 million .
“ We live in paradise and hell at the same time , ” said Mendes , a baby - faced 35 - year - old with master ’s and doctoral degrees from France and Portugal .
“ In paradise , there are no prisons .
In hell , there are no prisons .
Without a prison , all the work we do is for nothing .
At the moment , this is a paradise for criminals . ”
That ’s just one reason Guinea - Bissau has been an easy mark for the world ’s drug cartels .
The country ’s navy has a single aging ship to search for smugglers , and the head of the navy fled the country amid accusations that he was involved in the drug trade .
When a Gulfstream jet from Venezuela landed last year at the Bissau international airport , its $ 250 - million cargo of cocaine was whisked away in army trucks before police arrived .
A judge freed the three Venezuelan pilots , including one wanted on an arrest warrant from Mexico .
Then , in one 12 - hour period this year , the army chief of staff was killed by a bomb in his office and his soldiers retaliated by hacking the president to death in his kitchen .
Three months later , soldiers killed a presidential candidate and two former government ministers whom they accused of plotting a coup .
Disputes over the drug trade are believed to have played a role in the mayhem .
But the investigation has stalled because the soldiers refuse to be questioned .
$ 70 - billion market
West Africa is among the world ’s poorest , least developed and most politically unstable regions .
This patchwork of coastal nation - states has long been exploited by international profiteers , from the slave traders who fed off it for centuries to the European colonizers who later tried to sculpt tropical replicas of France , England and Portugal .
Today it is buffeted by another outside force : the $ 70 - billion global cocaine market .
As much as a third of the cocaine that moves from South America to Europe every year goes through West Africa .
Since 2005 , cocaine with a wholesale value of more than $ 7 billion has passed through this region , according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime .
This new route reflects a shift in consumption .
Cocaine exports to the United States have declined , but they have doubled and tripled to European countries , where the strength of the euro against the dollar has brought more revenue for traffickers .
Law enforcement efforts have made the direct route from South America to Europe riskier for traffickers , causing them to detour through this part of the world .
Cocaine arrives here in large shipments , sometimes by air but more often by sea .
It is broken into smaller parcels that come ashore -- where officials are paid off in cash or in kind -- or continue north by boat , truck or plane toward Europe .
“ West Africa has everything criminals need : resources , a strategic location , weak governance , and an endless source of foot soldiers who see few viable alternatives to a life of crime , ” a recent U.N. report concluded .
A day after the Gulfstream arrived in Guinea - Bissau in July 2008 , a twin -engine Cessna landed about 300 miles south , at the international airport near Freetown , Sierra Leone .
This one was met by local and international authorities , who seized $ 350 million worth of cocaine and arrested seven men from Colombia , Venezuela and the United States .
In Guinea , a nation on the coast between Guinea - Bissau and Sierra Leone , the death of a president and a military coup led to bloody confrontations with protesters in September -- and revelations that the late president ’s family was deeply involved in cocaine trafficking .
The president ’s son , an army officer , has admitted clearing cocaine shipments that arrived in planes marked with the symbol of the Red Cross .
That same month , authorities in Ghana seized 350 pounds of cocaine , valued at $ 8 million , on a ship arriving from South America , the second major seizure there since May .
“ Drug trafficking here evolves at a much faster rate than in places like Afghanistan and South America , ” said Alexandre Schmidt , the U.N. drug office ’s representative for West and Central Africa .
“ When we become aware of trafficking routes in West Africa , the drug traffickers are already one step ahead . ”
The U.N. launched a $ 50 - million effort this year to train and outfit West African police , beginning with Sierra Leone .
“ You ’re never going to stop the drug flow through West Africa , ” said Rudolfo Landeros , a former assistant police chief in Austin , Texas , who is senior police advisor to the U.N. in Sierra Leone .
“ But we have to take a stand somewhere and it might as well be here , so Sierra Leone does n’t become like Guinea - Bissau . ”
Stability first
Guinea - Bissau has been called Africa ’s only narco - state , a nation controlled and corrupted by drug cartels .
In many ways , it is an ideal host for the parasitic drug trade .
Since independence in 1974 , the onetime Portuguese colony has suffered coups d’etat , dictatorships and civil wars .
The elegant facade of the presidential palace , on a traffic circle honoring the independence struggle , is a ghostly monument to that past :
Its gutted interior is blackened by the bombs of civil war a decade ago .
An American aid organization has unearthed 3,000 anti-personnel mines in the capital and is still digging up unexploded ordnance in the countryside .
“ I ’m taking on a sick state in all aspects , ” said Guinea - Bissau ’s president , Malam Bacai Sanha , who took office in September .
“ We have serious problems , and drugs is just one of them , ” Sanha said .
He cited increasing deaths from malaria , a flood of counterfeit medicines , poor roads , rickety schools , and a lack of reliable electricity and clean water .
“ The first medicine the country needs is stability , ” he said .
Stability is a lofty goal .
If the 62 - year - old leader survives the next five years , he will be the first head of state to complete a term of office in 35 years of independence .
“ I will pray to God every single day of those five years , ” he said with a chuckle .
Like other politicians in West Africa , Sanha does n’t put a high priority on drug interdiction .
“ It ’s not just Guinea - Bissau ’s problem , ” he said .
“ These drugs do n’t come here to stay .
Our people cannot afford drugs . ”
Allegations that government officials and military officers are involved in the drug trade “ is just talk without proof , ” Sanha said .
But he recognizes that foreign aid is linked to progress on the drug front .
“ We cannot ask the international community to help us if we allow drugs to be sent to their countries from here , ” he said .
One sign pointing to an influx of drug money is the flurry of activity in a seaside suburb known as the “ ministers ’ quarter . ”
Bissau has few wealthy businessmen , no industry and no foreign exports other than peanuts .
The average income is less than $ 2 a day .
Yet construction crews in that neighborhood are building pastel - colored two - story homes with ocean views .
Workers at the sites declined to identify the owners .
Guinea - Bissau was an inviting target for traffickers primarily because of the Bijagos Archipelago , 70 beautiful islands that were once a stopping point for seafaring traders .
Only about 20 of the islands are inhabited , but many have natural ports and abandoned airstrips built by Portugal during the war for independence .
“ Our concern now is that the traffickers are changing their modus operandi , ” said Mendes , deputy director of the judicial police .
“ They used to bring drugs in by plane , but now it ’s ships at sea .
This is a big problem for us .
We do n’t have the means to control our coast . ”
Mendes leads a staff of three dozen officers , about a tenth of what he figures he needs to do his job .
The judicial police , the only one of nine government police forces in the country responsible for drug interdiction , do make arrests , mostly of locals with small amounts of cocaine who are foot soldiers for the cartels .
Some are freed by corrupt judges , Mendes says , and the others get off with fines because there ’s no prison to hold them .
International governments recently agreed to build a high - security prison in Bissau , but it wo n’t be completed before the end of next year .
On the outskirts of the capital is the Municipal Cemetery , where the late president , Joao Bernardo Vieira , and the army chief of staff , Batista Tagme na Waie , are buried about 100 yards apart , beneath the shade of mango and acacia trees in a setting overgrown with stiff grass and weeds .
The motives for those assassinations remain a mystery .
Tagme had reportedly told his officers that if anything happened to him , they should assume the president did it .
Tagme ’s troops listened ; they went to Vieira ’s home after the bombing and killed the president .
But Mendes says his commission has concluded that the president was not behind the general ’s killing .
Some believe it was a battle over power in a country where the defense force -- 4,500 troops , with three officers to every private -- has long held sway .
Others suspect that the cause was either a dispute over the missing cocaine from the Gulfstream or a battle for control of the drug trade .
What is clear is that moving cocaine through a small country like Guinea - Bissau requires help from the government or the military , or both .
“ You must have the approval of someone in authority , ” the U.N. 's Schmidt said .
An empty plane
The private Gulfstream jet from Venezuela swooped low over a sodden landscape marbled with chocolate - colored rivers and muddy roads , and landed at the forlorn little airport in Bissau .
No customs officers or immigration agents appeared because no flights were expected .
The plane ’s contents were unloaded into a convoy of Guinea - Bissau army vehicles as it was refueled .
It took off again , but a problem with the landing gear forced the pilot to turn back .
Three days later , a plane arrived with parts and a mechanic from Senegal .
But the plane could n’t be fixed .
Five days passed before the judicial police learned of the plane ’s existence .
By then , the plane was empty ; even the flight recorder was gone .
The army contended it had been carrying medicine for troops .
International drug investigators , using dogs , concluded otherwise :
The missing cargo was cocaine , 1,300 pounds , by the U.N. 's estimate .
The Gulfstream remains at the airport , parked next to the control tower .
Its owner is listed as a holding company in Delaware , and a few months before it landed in Bissau it was photographed in Florida .
The government may put it on the auction block .
As for the cocaine , it long ago disappeared into the countryside .

We thank the Three Rivers Post and Standard for Allowing this reprint of their material on our site .
Above is a worthy discussion about the anti-consumer / pro big and connected business fraud that is anti-monopoly legislation with Ron Paul .
While the video is some 25 years old , the content is perfectly valid today ( if not also a testament to the consistency of Ron Paul since then ) .
A great myth perpetuated by those in government and many in academia is that absent regulation , the free market will do its utmost to increase profits via anti-consumer actions , with one of the biggest crimes being the formation of monopolies .
As such , we endure day after day , year after year , ever more corrective reactions from Congress in the form of regulations that we are told will curtail the natural exploitative faults of the free market , thus improving the economy as a result .
Yet , when you dig just a little beneath the surface , you ’ll find that ’s an assumption built on a faulty premise .
What you ’ll see is that these many legislated regulatory actions are actually fixing the economic / market reaction to a previous legislated intrusion , and in many cases serve not to be pro consumer , but rather pro-big business and very much anti free market competition .
These laws not only often fix prices artificially high ( either outright or via anti-trade legislation ) , they flat out create massive hurdles — bureaucratic or otherwise — that serve as barriers to entry for legitimate free market competition .
A great example today is all the cries for further regulating the credit , banking , housing , and mortgage systems to “ prevent further abuse and recklessness . ”
In reality , the bubble that is bursting was created by a money monopoly granted to the Federal Reserve and its many member banks , who are quite literally entitled to legally counterfeit .
They call it fractional reserve banking , but in no uncertain terms the entire banking system engages in the constant and ongoing printing of money and credit out of thin air , which they in turn use to create loans and mega finance deals .
It was the artificial price fixing of credit and money well below the natural market rate that enabled and fueled the housing , mortgage , and credit bubbles into the stratosphere .
Had the rate of money instead been free market controlled by a more honest currency , as demand for hot money loans increased , rates would have risen , nipping each of those bubbles in the bud .
Instead , the printing presses of the banking system kicked into high gear and the bubble was off to the races .
Now that said bubble is in its corrective phase ( yes , painful but natural and necessary to correct the massive clustering of errors it permitted ) , the Banking system wants to print more money and credit to bail - out the very problems their created thanks to their monopoly on money and credit .
Meanwhile , our trusty servants in Congress are getting in the act by engineering stimulus packages while promoting even more legislation that will “ fix the banking system . ”
Others want to regulate ratings agencies who failed to properly measure risk , failing to understand that prior regulation prevented competition from entering the market and restructured / bastardized the system into its current highly corrupted form .
Yet the illiterate among us shout loudly from the rooftops , the Capital ’s steps , or their media perches blaming “ the free market ” for creating this folly .
Bunk !
Absolute Bunk !
Alas , save for one or two in Congress — Ron Paul being the only politician getting any press , and now barely any at all — NOBODY bothers to address the real manufacturers and profiteers of the crisis :
The massive banking cartel led by the privately owned Federal Reserve and its many member banks .
Their highly lucrative monopoly is preserved , and so too are their highly important contributions and lobbying efforts that keep most of Congress firmly in power .
In other cases “ pro competition ” legislation creates a ramshackle set of rules that hamstring the particular sector of the economy so badly that the consequent market place is the consumer equivalent of some hodge - podge Frankenstein creature .
The health care system in the U.S. is a prime example , where the heavily regulated byproduct — which is nothing but what ’s left of the free market attempting to create something usable given the draconian rules governing it — ends up being a real disaster for consumers .
Prices keep getting more expensive rather than cheaper , and the consumer continues to feel ever more compromised — which is the exact opposite of the norm in a truly free market .
Meanwhile , those major players that are most politically connected and capable of lobbying are the ones who dominate the industry , while the environment is so hostile to new entries that few bother to attempt to compete .
The result ?
A defacto , legislatively - created monopoly for major hospital conglomerates , pharmaceutical companies , and regional health insurers .
All levels of government get into the act , each exacting a toll to gain access , and each limiting the free market from doing what it otherwise might .
And , yet , these same politicians who soak up dolling out favors at the trough have the gal to blame the free market for being inadequate at providing good consumer products when what we ’re all stuck with is a Frankenstein of their own making !
Meanwhile , the uninformed and socially motivated consumers and voters see the system only on the surface , and they demand change .
The politicians are quick to blame free enterprise , and they propose more solutions to solve the problems created by decades of prior meddling .
Meanwhile , steering the new legislation are the same ones benefiting from the old .
They ’ll have the economies of scale to deal with the new rules , while smaller players will invariably be knocked from the playing field .
It ’s always the same story .
This is a mess .
Remember , if government forcing us into one of their solutions is the answer , you ’re asking the wrong question !
A true free market ( one where businesses , industry trade groups , and other special interests are prohibited from hijacking freedom and economic resources in their favor ) is naturally competing with itself to deliver ever more affordable quality to consumers .
The natural tendency always is a better product for a lower price as entrepreneurs continually attempt to redefine efficiencies and opportunity in the search for profits .
If you want consumer driven solutions that please the most people , do n’t force them into shoe - box solutions created by compromised politicians who are themselves experts only at politics and government .
Let the market compete freely and openly , and then — and only then — will order start to be restored to an economy that increasingly is being exposed as systematically rotten to the core , having been slowly eaten from within by special interest parasites steering legislation in their favor .
Take a look at the innovative robots created in Japan for the country 's growing elderly community .
HOW THE HAL SYSTEM WORKS HOW THE HAL SYSTEM WORKS Enlarge By Calum MacLeod , USA TODAY Tomoaki Kasuga , CEO of robot developer Speecys Corp. in Tokyo , shows off his " walking PC " , an Internet robot that can read e-mails and surf the Web out loud , as well as dance .
He hopes to launch it in 2010 for under $ 1,000 .
CHANGING WITH AGE CHANGING WITH AGE A glimpse of the future : Robots aid Japan 's elderly residents TOKYO 
It looks like a scene from Robocop or one of the Terminator movies : A human steps into a sleek robot suit and is miraculously transformed , suddenly capable of astonishing feats of strength .
But this is no sci- fi film — it 's a promotional video by Cyberdyne , a Japanese electronics company .
It shows an elderly male patient with Parkinson 's disease being strapped into a robotic skeleton that , using sensors attached to the wearer 's skin , reacts to nerve impulses and moves its " arms " and " legs " accordingly .
The robotic suit , known as the Hybrid Assisted Limb ( or HAL ) , is designed to boost its wearer 's strength by a multiple of 10 .
In July , it allowed the patient at the Seiko En nursing home in Tsurugashima , Japan , to walk for the first time in two years , Cyberdyne CEO Yoshiyuki Sankai says .
" I was surprised , " Sankai admits .
" I expected him to stand up , but not to walk . "
From lifelike robots to other devices that will feed you or simply share a chat , Japan 's government and gadget - makers are pioneering a wave of products aimed at improving the lives of senior citizens around the world .
Japan is a global leader in electronics and robotics , and its population is aging even faster than the USA's .
So much of the technology being unveiled here is likely a preview of what 's ahead for American Baby Boomers as they move into their twilight years , says Majd Alwan , director of the Center for Aging Services Technologies , a Washington - based consortium of U.S. technology companies and researchers .
SCIENCE SNAPSHOT : Film explores robot - dominated world SPORTS : Japanese professor creates baseball - playing robot RESEARCH : Robots act as scientists without assistants " The aging crisis drove ( Japan's ) government and scientific community to invest significantly in technologies for the elderly , and robotics in particular , " Alwan says .
He says some similar projects are in development in the USA , including research on home assistant robots at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst , but nationwide the amount of money and manpower involved is " significantly lower " than in Japan .
Among the products in development in Japan : A robotic bed from Panasonic that transforms into a joystick - controlled wheelchair on the user 's spoken command .
There 's also Riba , a robot nurse disguised as a giant teddy bear , which can lift patients weighing up to 134 pounds .
Those who merely are seeking companionship can turn to the robotic , seal - like pet known as Paro , which will hit U.S. stores before Christmas .
HAL will make its debut in the United States on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging ( AAHSA ) in Chicago .
The robotic suit has yet to find broad appeal in Japan — it 's expensive , at $ 2,400 for a month 's rental , and some users say they find it uncomfortable to wear .
Still , Alwan is among those who think HAL 's production costs will come down , and that it has potential for broad commercial use in the U.S. and elsewhere .
" If this technology had been available , probably my mother would not have had to spend the last four years of her life bed - ridden , " Alwan says .
Other products hold similar promise , he says , calling Japan " the world leader in this field . "
Machines as caregivers Japan 's competitive advantage in robotics began in the 1970s , when industrial robots were first developed to cut personnel costs , says Shoichi Hamada of the Japan Robot Association , an industry group .
He counts at least 20 companies working in the elderly - care robot field now , and says the Japanese government elected in August has promised to help researchers get their products into the marketplace more quickly .
The idea of relying on inanimate caregivers has caused some misgivings in Japan , where 22.5 % of the population is older than 65 , compared with about 9 % in the USA .
The Health and Welfare Ministry in the nation of 127 million people announced in September that the number of those older than 100 had reached a record — 40,399 .
" We have to ask whether it 's good to let machines be caregivers , and many say that people should be looking after other people , " Hamada says .
" But the fact is that there will be more people who need care , and less people to provide it . "
That argument is echoed by Sankai , HAL 's creator .
A science fiction aficionado with long hair and tinted glasses , he named HAL after the sinister supercomputer in 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
The name of his company , Cyberdyne , is itself an homage to the fictional firm behind the killer machines in the Terminator series .
Yet Sankai says one of his biggest challenges is to help potential customers overcome a distrust of gadgets engendered by images such as that of a robotic Arnold Schwarzenegger gunning down police .
" Unfortunately , most science fiction shows technology attacking humans , " Sankai says .
He hopes to push both technology and popular attitudes toward the more " peaceful " image of AstroBoy , the Japanese robot hero whose Hollywood version is now showing in U.S. movie theaters .
The search for a user - friendly image led Japanese robot scientist Takanori Shibata all the way to Newfoundland , Canada , where he spent time filming and recording harp seals .
The final result , after 15 years of development and $ 15 million of mostly government funding , is Paro — a fuzzy , seal - like robot .
The device , which is about the size of a large cat , is intended for seniors who are unable to care for real pets because they 're either too frail or they 're in a place such as a nursing home that forbids animals .
If you hold and pet Paro , tactile sensors under its fur make it interact — by moving its tail , or closing its eyes .
Audio sensors allow Paro to respond to its name , greetings and praise .
If it feels ignored , you 'll hear a life - like cry .
The key , Shibata says , is to persuade the owner to " accept Paro as a living thing . "
At a minimum price of $ 3,800 , the device is still out of reach for many .
But it has won converts at the Vinson Hall Retirement Community in McLean , Va. , where four Paros have been in trials for therapeutic use since 2007 .
Paros have helped calm anxious residents , coax smiles and communication from the depressed , and provide company for the lonely , says CEO and retired rear admiral Kathleen Martin .
" You forget it 's a robot , " Martin says .
" Some people think it 's almost a baby , and that 's a good thing , as it elicits a few little memories " from residents ' younger days .
The desire for a servant Robots are commonplace in Japanese popular culture , from relatively low - tech Hello Kitty and Ifbot dolls to Sony 's AIBO , a robot dog so beloved by some owners that they make birthday cakes for their metallic pooches .
The biggest challenge now facing Japanese technology companies is to produce more practical devices , says Tim Hornyak , the Canadian author of Loving the Machine , a book about Japan 's robot world .
He says the " Holy Grail " of Japanese developers has long been " to produce AstroBoy — a humanoid , companion robot . "
Hornyak says such a robot is likely possible in the long run , but he worries that pursuit of a Jetsons - style " servant robot in the household .
.. has blinded ( Japanese companies ) to more common , useful possibilities . "
That 's partially because it's what many Japanese consumers seem to want .
At Tokyo's National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation , science guide Masami Terada says she wants a housemaid robot to cook for and watch over her 94 - year - old grandmother .
" She 's forgetting how to cook , and is alone when I am at work , " Terada says .
" I wish the government could increase funding into robots . "
Tomoaki Kasuga , CEO of the robotics firm Speecys Corp. in central Tokyo , is among those exploring more viable products .
Since helping design AIBO several years ago , he has moved on to a product he calls the " walking PC . "
Speecys describes the two - legged SPC101C , in development for four years , as the world 's first Internet robot .
Responding to verbal commands , the device can read aloud e-mail , surf the Web , broadcast news channels and even dance on a desktop , Kasuga says .
" Elderly people do n't want to type on a PC , so voice communication is more important .
Think of it like a new PC , but with arms and legs , not a keyboard , " he says .
Speecys plans to launch the device next year at a retail cost of $ 500 to $ 1,000 .
There are still a few kinks to be worked out with the design .
" People like humanoid - type robots but , functionally , walking is unstable , " Kasuga explains , so the final product may boast wheels instead of legs .
Not everyone 's onboard
There are similar reservations about HAL , the robotic suit .
At the Momiyamakai Elderly Care Facility , a two - hour train ride from Tokyo , HAL has been in trial use since September — with mixed results .
" I do n't want to use it again , " complains Takebuta Yunko , 77 , a wheelchair user .
Strapping on HAL 's limbs took her about 30 minutes .
" It was hard to walk because of all the stuff around my legs .
I felt I was about to fall , " she says .
Her therapist , Motohiro Fukui , says the device restricts motion , thus affecting balance .
At first , " I feared my job would be taken away , " Fukui says .
" Having seen HAL , I feel confident there will still be jobs for me . "
Mitsuhiro Sakamoto , Cyberdyne 's chief operating officer , compares using HAL to riding a bicycle and says most users eventually catch on .
A dozen HAL suits have been leased in Japan since January , and another 30 have been ordered , he says .
The company plans to begin selling it in the USA within 18 months .
HAL has received $ 5.5 million in research funding from Japan 's government , which sees robotics as a growth industry in Japan , Western Europe , the United States and other countries that are aging quickly .
" We are following the government 's objective to create and develop this technology that might help create jobs and be exported abroad , " Sakamoto says .
The device certainly has its fans .
Tomonori Kaneko , a caregiver at the nursing home where Cyberdyne filmed the promotional video , says he watched in awe on July 1 as HAL enabled not only the Parkinson 's patient , but another man with a spinal cord injury to walk again .
" I was really surprised , " Kaneko says .
" But I think that he was more surprised than we were . "

( New York ) - HIV prevention efforts - and the promise of antiretroviral therapy as prevention - are being undermined by punitive laws targeting those infected with and at risk of HIV , Human Rights Watch said today on the eve of World AIDS Day .
This year 's World AIDS Day theme is " universal access and human rights , " tying together goals for universal access to HIV prevention , treatment , and care with recognition that respect for human rights is critical in the global response to AIDS .
Achieving universal access to treatment has also been a key theme in debates over the past year around the use of antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) as a part of comprehensive HIV prevention strategies .
Mathematical models have proposed that early initiation of universal antiretroviral treatment combined with HIV prevention programs could lead to the eventual elimination of HIV infection .
" There is increasing evidence that antiretroviral treatment can be an important part of comprehensive prevention strategies , " said Joe Amon , Health and Human Rights director at Human Rights Watch .
" But if human rights abuses are unaddressed and punitive laws target people vulnerable to or living with HIV , the potential of treatment as prevention is n't going to be realized . "
In many parts of the world , legislation effectively criminalizes populations living with HIV or vulnerable to HIV infection , such as sex workers , drug users , and men who have sex with men .
These laws fuel stigma and discrimination , increase barriers to HIV information and treatment , and contribute to the spread of disease , Human Rights Watch said .
Elsewhere , laws criminalizing HIV transmission discourage HIV testing , potentially subjecting those who know their HIV status to criminal penalties while exempting those who are unaware of their infection .
In early November , Human Rights Watch released a 10 - page critique of a proposed Ugandan HIV / AIDS law , which includes mandatory HIV testing , forced disclosure , and criminal penalties for the " attempted transmission " of HIV to another person .
The Ugandan Parliament is also considering a bill that allows for a seven year prison term for any person or organization who supports or promotes lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender people 's rights .
It would jail for up to three years anyone who fails to report a person they suspect of being lesbian or gay .
A person living with HIV who has consensual homosexual sex would face the death penalty , regardless of risk of HIV transmission and even if their partner is also HIV - positive .
Since 2005 , 14 countries in Africa have passed HIV - specific laws that potentially criminalize all sexual behavior among HIV - positive individuals , including those who use condoms , regardless of disclosure and actual risk of transmission .
In a number of countries , maternal - to - child HIV transmission is a criminal offense , even where antiretroviral treatment may not be available .
In Uganda , the draft legislation exempts HIV transmission before or during birth but allows for the prosecution of women whose infants acquire HIV from breast milk .
" HIV prevention has failed in many countries not because we do n't know how to design effective prevention programs , but because governments have been unwilling to implement these programs and ensure that they reach everyone , " Amon said .
" The potential of HIV treatment in comprehensive prevention programs will be similarly sabotaged if governments continue to pass punitive laws and trample upon human rights . "
For three years now I ’ve been running a small software business in my spare time .
It has been a very educational experience , especially in showing me that many things we think we know about software , programming , business , and the like are wrong .
This is a bit of a shock , especially for well - worn chestnuts which have intuitive appeal , which we have come to invest with moral significance , and ( most importantly , because we all think we ’re smart ) we ’ve believe so self - evidently true as to make investigation a waste of time .
For example : I have come to the conclusion , over the last three years , that working hard is overrated .
This is an idea I have been kicking around for a while , but it was thrown into sharp relief by a blog post entitled The Only Alternative Is To Work Harder , by a gentleman named Paras Chapra over at Wingify .
Paras and I have corresponded over email a few times , so I say as one analytics junkie to another : the notion that working longer hours is correlated to better business results is a pernicious social pathology .
Working Longer Hours Is Not A Competitively Defensible Advantage
For the last five years , I ’ve been a Japanese salaryman , and have often worked 70 hour weeks out of a sense of social obligation .
I understand , very well , the social pressures which could lead someone to write “ If your nearest competitor or neighbour works X hours , you must work for X+1 hours . ”
It is just a terrible strategy .
Your competitor can adopt it as easily as you can , and then you ’re playing a game of multiplayer endurance chicken against everyone else in your market .
You ca n’t win but you can certainly all lose , by ending up with an entire community where soul - crushing hours are normative .
( There are certain tendencies to this among Silicon Valley startups .
Take it from a Japanese salaryman , guys : it is a disease so vicious that in addition to hobbling businesses it damages society itself .
We ’re barely beginning to recover from it decades later . )
Why ca n’t you win ?
Well , suppose that longer hours are indeed the key to success and that Paras is willing to work longer hours than 99.9 % of the population of India .
I do n’t know how many hours that is at the 99.9 % level , but call it 82 a week .
He ’ll work 82 hours and then find , oh shoot , over a million people are willing to work more .
Working harder is a particularly bad idea for startups because you are likely competing with people with resources which , relative to yours , are infinite .
I compete with several educational publishers who employ tens of thousands .
Paras competes with Google .
Our competitors have more man-hours in a week than we ’ll have in the next decade .
Engaging them on those terms is madness .
Why Smart People Keep Falling For This
Working long hours is near the perfect storm of meme spreadability .
It flatters the sensibilities of many religions — Max Weber was putting the Industrial Revolution down to the Protestant Work Ethic a hundred years ago .
It sometimes confuses me that it is so popular with atheist Japanese salaryman and agnostic Silicon Valley founders .
Then again , programmers at most companies work on a schedule designed to maximize the productivity of illiterate 18th century water loom operators , so expecting rationality might be excessively optimistic .
There is also a sense that working less is somehow , you know , cheating or immoral .
Take the reactions to 4 Hour Workweek ( which is , incidentally , a tonne of self - promotion and self - help book hucksterism concealing an ounce of solid productivity gold ) : a lot of people are emotionally invested in the way that they have always done things being the correct , proper , morally acceptable way of doing things .
A lot of my fellow software developers feel the need to work long days because otherwise their customers will see them as lazy , despite the fact that their customers can only perceive the external indicia of the labor rather than the labor itself .
My customers do n’t know that I average four hours a week on my business any more than they know I average 70 hours a week on my day job : all they see is the web site .
It is easy to fall into this trap of productivity being defined in terms of observed effort exerted because in the typical face to face organization it is easy to see who is “ working hard ” and very difficult to measure actual productivity .
The manager ( and peer employees ) always knows who was putting in heroic efforts at 10:00 PM last night .
However , your organization almost certainly does n’t track productivity in any rational , systematic fashion .
This is a pity , because you ca n’t improve what you do n’t measure .
Web analytics has taught us that our cherished beliefs about web design do n’t matter an iota in the face of actual customer behavior .
Customer development has shown us that most of the time we ’re spending enormous amounts of resources ( including time ) on products which will fail for lack of demand .
What is the use in one - upping the competition and spending 83 hours to their 82 when you ’re both producing something that no one even wants ?
Poor Metrics For Productivity
Of course , if you pick a poor metric and try to optimize for it , bad things happen .
For example , many large Internet publishers put auto - refresh code into their pages to inflate page views .
That adds no lasting business value ( although it might succeed in getting a few more scraps from CPM advertisers prior to them abandoning the campaign in favor of models that actually work ) .
Similarly , my day job used to measure engineering productivity in , essentially , hours .
If I worked 20 % more hours in August than I did in July , I was 20 % more productive in August .
I remember one of my “ very productive ” weeks : after sleeping in a hotel because I was not physically capable of commuting home , I got to work and started pulling tickets , then opened the appropriate file and started coding .
I then continued for 90 minutes chasing rabbits before I realized that a ) I had started working on a file totally different than the feature being discussed and b ) the problem I thought I was fixing was not written in the ticket , anywhere .
I had literally hallucinated the entire request .
I then proceeded to spend the rest of the day committing crash bugs into the trunk , confusing our contractors with instructions that might as well have come from someone abusing drugs , and generally spinning my wheels .
Under the productivity tracking system we had at the time , that was my most productive day ever .
You do n’t want to emulate that example .
For more examples of things not to emulate , see the Mythical Man Month .
Good Metrics For Productivity
I sell software online in my business .
It is very , very easy to identify the direct driver of business value : selling software .
One conversion is worth $ 30 .
It is even pretty easy to identify contributors to that : working up the funnel , trial signups are n’t worth as much as sales , but given their observed conversion rate 70 cents is a decent estimate .
“ Casting to currency ” lets you compare the worth of two different things , easily .
An intervention which generates 10 sales is less worthwhile than one which generates 4,000 trial signups ( all else equal ) .
In practice , this works well for tracking productivity , too .
Just assign an arbitrary value to tasks , based on your best guess of how much value they add for the business .
Then , track how long it takes to complete the tasks , and figure out where you ’re adding disproportionate amounts of value and where you are spinning your wheels .
Do more of the former , less of the latter .
When in genuine doubt about the value , guess what it would cost to have somebody else do it for you .
The Pseudo - Wage
When I started my business I thought it would be amazing if I eventually earned $ 100 per hour working on it .
( This is a princely sum for 20 - something programmers in Japan . )
Its funny , people generally get very good with practical experiences of the mathematical properties of averages in school and then totally forget about that experience in business .
If you want a 92 average , you ’d better not routinely get 60s on your homework .
If you want to earn $ 100 an hour , you ’d better not busy yourself with $ 5 an hour tasks .
Examples :
How much is mailing a CD worth ?
Like many software developers , I offer CDs of my software .
The primary purpose is to get the sale from people who would not buy if it were purely virtual .
Thus , my labor in generating CDs is worth however many marginal sales the CD option nets me , plus the marginal revenue from actually paying more for the CD .
If I had A/B tested the option , I ’d have a very rigorous notion of how much CDs are worth , but we ’ll go with a guess : 25 % of sales of the CDs would not have happened but for the CD option , thus a single CD is worth $ 5 ( what I charge ) +
$ 7.50 ( a marginal $ 30 sale every 4 CDs ) = $ 12.50 .
When you consider that I ’d have to do all the burning , enveloping , addressing , licking , and mailing myself ( in very small batch sizes ) , its reasonable to assume that doing CD fulfillment myself would be worth on the order of $ 50~60 an hour .

How much is A /B testing worth ?
I generally try for about 5 new A/B tests a month .
If the successful ones combine to a 5 % improvement ( not infrequent ) and you generously assume that takes 10 hours , then over the course of a year I ’ll earn over $ 1,500 from them , for over $ 150 an hour .
You ’re Measuring Productivity .
Now , Improve It
Clearly , this means that instead of licking more stamps I should be writing more A/B tests , right ?
Sure , I can lick one stamp and write one A/B test , but my time is my most important and limited business asset , so I have to be sparing with it at the margin .
“ But Patrick , that is all well and good , but you still have to mail those CDs ! ” , I hear you say .
No , I have to make sure the CDs get mailed , which is a distinction with a difference .
No middle American schoolmarm perceives additional value over having my saliva the envelope her software came in .
I have long - since outsourced the actual production and mailing of the CDs to SwiftCD .
They cost me about $ 6 each and , when I was still typing orders in manually , increased the amount of orders I could fill in an hour from about 4~ 5 to about 10 ( note , again , small batch sizes mean this was dominated by setup - and - teardown time as I lost productivity to friction turning on my computer , opening email , copy / pasting over details , checking them , then turning off the computer and running to work ) .
That results in a significant increase in my psuedo - wage : after deducting the extra cost of outsourcing versus insourcing , I still make ~ $ 100 an hour versus ~ $ 50 doing everything myself .
Productivity Technique # 1 : Outsource .
This is the first of three major tactics for improving productivity : outsource anything that your personal presence does not add value to .
Equivalently , outsource anything where the replacement price is less than your desired pseudo - wage .
Remember that outsourcing imposes an overhead cost , and payment is due in your time rather than dollars .
Often , this overhead swamps the actual monetary cost of the project .
This kills many outsourcing development projects , because communicating ( detailed , constantly changing ) customer requirements consumes an enormous amount of time on the part of both sides .
In my own business , I very rarely outsource development , for this reason .
I also do n’t outsource direct interaction with customers , because I feel that as a small business knowing what my customers want is an important differentiator .
Everything else , though , is on the table .
My most important use of outsourcing is getting content written for my website .
My software creates bingo cards , and offering bingo cards in the exact niche a searcher is looking for helps convince them to sign up for the free trial .
For example , if you ’re looking for a Halloween bingo activity to play with class , the fact I have one ready to go increases your likelihood of sourcing your immediate and future bingo card needs with me rather than making them yourself or going to a competitor .
I used to write my bingo cards myself , and I ’m fairly good at it , but eventually I figured that while it was a worthwhile activity it did n’t really get all that much more worthwhile as a result of me doing it .
Instead , I put out a call on my blog for freelancers , and eventually worked out a mutually rewarding relationship with a highly - educated American teacher .
She bangs out the cards on her own schedule , and once a month I click “ Post ” on my backend interface and then mail her a check .
The economics of this arrangement are so staggeringly efficient that people tell me I have to be lying about it .
The pages my freelancer writes for me were visited 65,000 times in September , producing roughly $ 1,300 worth of sales for me through getting people into my various conversion funnels .
I did less than five minutes of work to maintain the freelancing relationship in September .
Do you want to do the math ?
There is no possible way for me to achieve results like that merely by lengthening the number of hours I work in a day .
Additionally , because I ’m capable of producing like that ( via , e.g. , leveraging freelancers intelligently in a business process which uses software to make them efficient and then extracts business value out of their labor ) , there is no need to spend excessively long hours working for the sake of working .
Productivity Technique # 2 : Automate Your Processes .
Software developers should really spend more of their time creating tools for themselves , but we ’re hardly the only vertical this applies to .
One of the best points of an awesome lecture on lean startups is that a startup ’s most important product is the process the startup uses to create products .
This idea is so powerful that I say , without a hint of exaggeration , it has changed history .
A huge portion of Japan ’s rise to global prominence was a result not of working harder , morning radio exercise routines , of the superiority of wet rice cultivation for creating productive societies ( all of these , and more , were explanations advanced by authors on the syllabi for the courses I took in the process of completing my East Asian Studies degree — which will teach you to trust academia ) .
It was by having a few decades of head - start on process improvement as a science .
( I ’d be remiss if I did n’t point out that folks have also identified process improvement as a cause of Japan ’s economic boom .
However , “ Toyota considers it a worthwhile use of time to shave 15 seconds off the construction of an automobile ” is so counter - intuitive and unsexy that people reach for the much more obvious , morally correct , visible explanation that Toyota workers work so much harder than GM workers .
This is despite inconvenient facts such as the fact that Toyota can reproduce their productivity advantage in American factories using American workers , and has , repeatedly .
Journalists and management consultants never let facts get in the way of a good narrative . )
Process improvement works for small companies , too !
For example , my use of freelancers rather than myself to write bingo cards is one example of a process improvement , but when I started the process was horrific .
They ’d create the word lists ( as text files ) , then have to manually run them through Bingo Card Creator , take screenshots , do manually cropping , etc etc .
This is a lot more efficient than having me do the same steps ( their time is cheaper than mine , and I can always find another freelancer but finding a 25th hour in a day is sort of tricky ) , but there was clearly room for improvement .
I actually outsourced creation of the first improvement : it was a script which , given specially named text files as input , would open up Bingo Card Creator , emulate a user on the keyboard clicking on the particular buttons , and then open up PDF viewer , emulate hitting Print Screen , open up MSPaint , etc etc .
It was a system held together entirely by duct tape , but it worked .
It took me an hour every month to supervise the script and correct unhandled exceptions but it worked .
The productivity of my freelancers immediately increase .
This let them get more work done in less time .
I then bumped up their wages and the resulting more - money , less - busywork combination has kept them sufficiently happy with the arrangement that it has continued without a serious hitch for more than a year now .
( Incidentally , I eventually spent some time and replaced the duct tape .
Remember , it was still taking me an hour a month and I still had access to a computer : clearly , there was room for improvement .
I eventually tightened up the automation , decreasing it from 60 minutes to 40 minutes , then refactored some of the automation and got it down to 30 minutes , then leveraged an unrelated technology change I made and got it down to the current five minutes .
Five minutes is n’t zero minutes , either , so I still have work to do . )
Process improvement takes time .
Consider it an investment in your business ’ future , and charge yourself for it .
I outsourced the first draft of that automation and got valuable results for $ 100 .
( Why did n’t I write it myself ?
Automating interfaces is Not My Bag , Baby and it would have taken me far more than an hour to do . )
As it is , all the development I ’ve ever done on every draft of that system , plus all the handling of freelancers , adds up to less than twenty hours .
Productivity Technique # 3 : Eliminate Unproductive Uses of Time .
The final technique for maximizing your productivity is eliminating uses of time which do not add business value .
We ’ve all got them , most of them probably unknown to us because we do n’t track our uses of time well .
( I use RescueTime .
If you do n’t , install it today and spend some time aggressively categorizing what websites are worthwhile for you to be on .
Consider this a very , very effective process improvement . )
For example , as I mentioned earlier , I ’m a bit of an analytics junkie .
RescueTime reported to me that I was spending upwards of 1 hour a day on Google Analytics .
I had an honest conversation with myself on whether I was getting $ 100 worth of insights every single freaking day out of Google Analytics .
The answer was , no , not really — I was essentially engaged in a nervous habit , opening Analytics and drilling down through a million reports to feel productive when I was n’t mentally ready to actually be productive .
In particular , I had a few favorite screens I ’d check too often — trial downloads per day , for example .
I eventually killed that habit by surfacing that number on my admin dashboard for my website ( where I have to go to resolve routine customer service inquiries ) .
That way , the number flashes by the corner of my eye once every morning as I do productive work .
It is also set so that it gets cached for 24 hours , so that the monkey - brain WoW playing scrolling - numbers - are - dopamine - cast - into - integers side of me ca n’t get fascinated into sitting on the page and hitting refresh all day .
That sure is n’t going cold turkey , though .
A better example : I used to spend much , much more time on blogging than I do currently .
This is my 447th post to this blog , and I consider the blog one of the main contributors to my business doing as well as it has .
However , over the last three years , I ’ve learned something : 90 % of the value from the blog is in far less than 10 % of the posts .
I ’ve always written a mix of long - form , packed essays ( you have now suffered through at least one — congratulations ! ) and shorter articles about more minor topics .
The shorter articles typically take me about an hour to write , whereas this article took me about four .
However , my long essays produce more traffic , more discussion , more links , and better writing ( this last one subjective , the others less so ) than the shorter articles — and vastly out of proportion to the time invested .
On a links - per - hour scale its better than a hundred to one in favor of the articles , I kid you not .
This has lead me to gradually curtail most of the minor posting to my blog .
You probably have something which could stand elimination in your business .
If you ’re using Lean Startup - style processes , you should find out which of your development efforts are being 100 % wasted because your customers do n’t want what you ’re making .
The solution to this is simple : stop that development .
You may spend time on social media when you could be working .
Work more , play when you get home .
( Says the guy who has racked up in excess of 200 hours on Hacker News — I never said I was particularly good at this . )
Maybe you spend time developing social media sites when you could be developing something people would pay for .
( Just kidding , Twitter . )
Well , OK , mostly just kidding .
Worker Smarter , Not Harder .
Then Go Home .
“ Working harder ” is a poor strategy which your competitors can trivially replicate .
Instead , spend some time measuring what tasks add value to your business and at what imputed wages .
Outsource those tasks which are below your desired imputed wage , automate any task where appropriate , and simply do n’t do things which do n’t add value .
I generally resist the urge to put a call to action in my blog posts , but just this once : working for the sake of work is a waste of time , resources , and human potential .
Try some of the suggestions from this post and see if you ca n’t cut a sliver of time off your work week — 15 minutes , an hour , whatever you can do .
If it works out , spend that time doing something which matters to you : read your kid a bedtime story , volunteer for your church , play WoW , whatever .
We should work to live , not live to work , and maximizing what the economists call “ leisure ” and what I ’d rather rebrand as “ stuff of lasting importance ” should be a major goal for our careers and businesses .
“ Hide the decline ” refers to the decline in the Briffa MXD temperature reconstruction in the last half of the 20th century , a decline that called into question the validity of the tree ring reconstructions .
( I ’m going to analyze the letters on another occasion . )
In the IPCC Third and Fourth Assessment Reports , IPCC “ hid the decline ” by simply deleting the post - 1960 values of the troublesome Briffa reconstruction – an artifice that Gavin Schmidt characterizes as an “ a good way to deal with a problem ” and tells us that there is “ nothing problematic ” about such an artifice ( see here .
Not only were the post - 1960 values of the Briffa reconstruction not shown in the IPCC 2001 report – an artifice that Gavin describes as being “ hidden in plain sight ” , they were deleted from the archived version of the reconstruction at NOAA here ( note : the earlier Briffa 2000 data here does contain a related series through to 1994 . )
Interestingly , the values from 1402 - 1994 were sent from Tim Osborn to Michael Mann on a couple of occasions , including here .
Here ’s a comparison showing the portion that was deleted from the NOAA archive in red .

Ensiferum ( Latin : ēnsiferum , meaning " sword bearing " ) is a Finnish extreme power metal folk metal band from Helsinki .
Ensiferum was founded in 1995 by Markus Toivonen ( guitar ) , Sauli Savolainen ( bass ) and Kimmo Miettinen ( drums ) .
In the next year , Jari Mäenpää was taken into the band as singer and second guitar - player .
In 1997 , the first demo was released , containing three songs .
In 1998 , Sauli and Kimmo left the band and were replaced by Jukka - Pekka Miettinen ( Kimmo's little brother , then 14 years old ) and Oliver Fokin .
In January 1999 , a second demo was recorded , … read more
Stocks have rallied -- but corporate officers and directors are now selling after buying the dip .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Can hundreds of stock - selling insiders be wrong ?
The stock market has mounted an historic rally since it hit a low in March .
The S&P 500 is up 55 % , as U.S. job losses have slowed and credit markets have stabilized .
But against that improving backdrop , one indicator has turned distinctly bearish : Corporate officers and directors have been selling shares at a pace last seen just before the onset of the subprime malaise two years ago .
While a wave of insider selling does n't necessarily foretell a stock market downturn , it suggests that those with the first read on business trends do n't believe current stock prices are justified by economic fundamentals .
" It 's not a very complicated story , " said Charles Biderman , who runs market research firm Trim Tabs .
" Insiders know better than you and me .
If prices are too high , they sell . "
Biderman , who says there were $ 31 worth of insider stock sales in August for every $ 1 of insider buys , is n't the only one who has taken note .
Ben Silverman , director of research at the InsiderScore.com web site that tracks trading action , said insiders are selling at their most aggressive clip since the summer of 2007 .
Silverman said the " orgy of selling " is noteworthy because corporate insiders were aggressive buyers of the market 's spring dip .
The S&P 500 dropped as low as 666 in early March before the recent rally took it back above 1,000 .
" That was a great call , " Silverman said .
" They were buying when prices were low , so it makes sense to look at what they 're doing now that prices are higher . "
Straightforward trading
In the case of firms such as discount broker TD Ameritrade ( AMTD ) , they are selling with abandon .
Chairman Joe Moglia has netted more than $ 10 million in profits from stock sales since April , by selling shares on each of the last 106 business days , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
A TD Ameritrade spokeswoman said Moglia 's sales are being made under a pre-arranged selling plan he filed with the SEC last August .
Under that plan , his brokers exercise some options he got eight years ago and sell the underlying shares every day the company 's stock price is above a certain level .
Moglia 's not the only insider selling at TD Ameritrade .
The company 's founder and former chairman , Joe Ricketts , and his wife Marlene last month sold 5.7 million shares to help fund the family 's purchase of the Chicago Cubs baseball team .
They owned 16 % of the company 's stock at last count .
Silverman said the TD Ameritrade insider sales do n't particularly raise concerns about the company 's health , because " special circumstances " -- the Cubs deal and the pending expiration of Moglia 's options -- are evident .
He said it 's potentially more worrisome when insiders suddenly make big sales without obvious motivating factors .
Fossil ( FOSL ) CEO
Tom Kartsotis has sold $ 25 million of the watchmaker 's stock over the past month .
Shares of Fossil have more than doubled since early March .
Fossil did n't immediately return a call seeking comment .
At video game maker Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ) , CEO Robert Kotick and director Brian Kelly each made more than $ 10 million last month by selling shares after exercising stock options .
While some of Kotick 's options were due to expire next year , others were n't due to expire until 2014 in his case and 2012 in Kelly's .
The stock sales took place at prices that were about 50 % above their 52 - week low .
Activision did n't respond to a request for comment .
Adding to the flurry of stock sales , companies are selling stock to the public at a brisk clip while buybacks have tailed off .
All told , U.S. corporations have been net sellers of $ 105 billion of stock over the past four months , Biderman said .
Insiders have managed to cash in on some of those offerings .
Healthcare payment administrator Emdeon ( EM ) , for instance , last month raised $ 155 million in an initial public offering .
At the same time , selling shareholders led by private equity investor General Atlantic Partners raised $ 188 million .
Though the wave of selling by insiders does n't necessarily predict a pullback in their stocks or the market as a whole , it 's hard to put a happy spin on the recent trends .
" The disparity between buyers and sellers right now is vast , " said Silverman .
" That 's the beauty of following insider trading -- these guys are talking with their checkbooks . "
It started as an observation in a Seattle cancer ward , where oncologist Marc Chamberlain noticed that his male patients were often receiving steadfast support from their wives , while his female patients often did n't have husbands hovering at their bedsides .
Based on this anecdotal evidence , Chamberlain decided to investigate divorce rates among couples where one person had recently been diagnosed with a serious illness .
His findings raise troubling questions about the loyalty of the male sex .
The study included diagnoses of both cancer and multiple sclerosis and found an overall divorce rate of nearly 12 percent , which is similar to that found in the normal population .
But when the researchers looked at gender differences , they found the rate was nearly 21 percent when women were the patients compared with about 3 percent when men got the life - threatening diagnosis .
The researchers suggest men are less able to commit , on the spot , to being caregivers to a sick partner , while women are better at assuming such home and family responsibilities [ LiveScience ] .
However , the study did find that the divorce rate was lower in longer marriages .
Chamberlain notes that the study , which will be published in the journal Cancer , did n't have any information about how happy the marriages were to begin with .
“ All these patients were couples when we met them , but we do n’t know about pre-diagnosis marital conflicts that had been festering , ” Dr. Chamberlain said .
“ But the striking part is with life threatening illness , how often women are abandoned compared to men .
That does not speak very well of my gender ” [ The New York Times ] .
The researchers say that doctors may want to advise couples to seek family therapy after the woman receives a serious diagnoses , and note that the medical benefits of having a committed spouse are real and measurable .
Researchers also looked at the quality of life among the patients who separated or divorced .
They found these patients used more anti-depressants , took part less in clinical trials , had more frequent hospitalizations , were less likely to complete radiation therapy and more likely not to die at home [ Reuters ] .

Copenhagen – An Exercise In Futility
PERHAPS AN ALTERNATE TITLE MIGHT READ – COPENHAGEN – DON’T FORGET TO BRING YOUR MONEY .
In seven days from now , this United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) will get under way in Copenhagen .
We are told that this is the most important meeting in recent history , and is needed to address the Climate Disaster .
( Their words , shown at this link )
I have posted earlier posts on this Conference , where I mention that there is now every chance that it may not produce any binding and definitive result .
In those posts I mentioned that it has little to do with the environment in fact , and is really just about the money .
In fact , the environment may actually have been shuffled back into third place , as now politics has joined the money at the top of the list of things discussed at Copenhagen .
( There ’s nothing surprising about that either . )
The main focus that those in positions of power will be trying to get across is the cutback in emissions of Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) , and you will hear a plethora of ( mis ) information regarding this .
This is an intentional thing , because the real intent of the meeting is to shore up the immense amounts of money that the UN will be seeking from the member Countries .
There are 192 of these member Countries , and the UN has divided those Countries into two groups , and added a further third group , culled from one of those other two .
The Countries are divided into Developed Countries and Developing Countries .
In the first bloc are 40 Countries listed as already developed , leaving the other 152 Countries in that other list .
Now , from that list of 40 Countries in that first list , 23 Countries have been placed onto a third list .
Now I ’m not making this up , but the UN has stated that those 23 Countries must pay ALL the costs for those other Countries so that they can move towards a ‘ carbon free ’ future .
That ’s ALL the costs .
At the same time , those 23 Countries are then required to introduce measures in their own Countries to cut back their own emissions , move to renewable power , impose a charge in the form of an Emissions tax trading scheme , as well as finding the technology for reducing emissions and then giving these technologies to those remaining 152 Countries .
So , when it comes to the question of that funding , you do n’t need a crystal ball to deduce how the vote on that question will go .
Those 23 Countries will then have to give that money to the UN so they can distribute it among those remaining 152 Countries .
The amounts bandied around are expressed as a percentage of GDP , and some figures put that even as high as 1 % .
This will effectively amount to hundreds of Billions of dollars , and that ’s not just a one off payment , but for each and every year .
Now , when percentages of cutbacks in emissions are discussed , those same 40 Countries from that first list will again be the only ones who are bound by that decision .
Those other 152 will have to do nothing significant , because this will mean a cutback in their further development .
Again , no crystal ball is required to tell you how that vote will go .
So , while all the talk will be on saving the World by cutting back those emissions , the really meaningful discussions will be only about the funding , and you wo n’t be hearing much about that , the perception being that this is just grubby , when for a pristine ‘ green ’ wholesome look will be that preservation of the environment for the future generations .
The politics will also be important , as those really important Countries look for any decision that will make them look good at home , and talk of how much money they promise to give to the UN wo n’t go down well at home , so again , that will be shuffled away .
Politicians from those big Countries will also seek to find a way to come to a resolution positive enough so that their legislation in their own Country that they are trying to ram through will still look like it is desperately needed .
So the Environment will be the loudest thing you ’ll hear .
The politics will be the next loudest , and you ’ll hear next to nothing at all about the grubby money , when the truth is that of those three subjects , the order will actually be the reverse .
So !
Why will it be an exercise in futility ?
Now , the upshot of it all is that nothing at all in respect of those emissions will change .
In fact emissions will keep steadily increasing , and there is absolutely nothing whatsoever this Conference can do to change that , and I ’m absolutely certain that those in positions of influence at this conference know exactly that .
I ’ve been contributing posts at this blog now for 21 months , and I have literally hundreds of posts on this subject .
From day one , I have sought to shine a bright light on every aspect about this subject .
What I have attempted to do is to slightly lift the shroud of misinformation regarding this whole matter , so people can see that this actually has nothing whatsoever to do with the environment .
The main thrust of the whole argument is aimed squarely at those largest emitters of CO2 , those coal fired power plants , which produce around one third of all man made CO2 emissions .
Think about it for a minute .
If they tell us we are facing what they call a man made Climate Disaster , then surely , if it was that bad , then desperate efforts would be taken to immediately close down those coal fired power plants .
Not one person in any position of power anywhere has even canvassed doing just that .
Despite what might come out of Copenhagen , not one of those coal fired plants will be immediately closed down .
In fact , in those 152 Countries in that second UN bloc are furiously constructing coal fired power plants .
They ’re not doing that to thumb their nose at the environment .
They are doing that out of necessity , so that the electrical power ( that we in the Developed World take as a staple of life ) can be brought to those Countries , ( a ) so that they can actually start to develop their economies , and ( b ) so that the electrical power can be brought to the people in those Countries that have no access whatsoever to any electrical power , let alone the reliable access to it that we have .
To that end , China alone is bringing on line one new coal fired power plant each week .
That ’s not just starting construction , but opening it for business and supplying power to the grids of China .
To emphasise that point , let ’s have a look at those figures for China , and for the purpose of comparison , I ’ll use the U.S. statistics .
For readers in other Countries , ( Australia included ) , these U.S. statistics where I have used percentage breakdowns are similar .
In the U.S. the power breakdown for consumer sectors is Residential ( 37 % ) Commercial ( 35 % ) and Industrial ( 27 % )
As I ’m specifically using access to residential power , I ’ll just highlight that sector .
In China , the total power being used in all three sectors is 2.963 Trillion KWH .
( the fifth point at this link )
In the U.S. the total power being used in all three sectors is 3.972 Trillion KWH .
( Bottom right at this link )
The residential component of that ( 37 % ) is 1.47 Trillion KWH , and the population of the US is 305 Million people .
In China however , the vast bulk of that power goes to the Industrial sector , in fact 75 % of all that power .
The Residential sector only gets 12 % of all power being produced .
( Page 6 of this link , and it ’s a pdf document )
So , that now means that only 0.36 Trillion KWH goes to the residential sector , and China ’s population is 1.33 Billion .
So comparing them , China directs less than one quarter of the power that the US does to 4.4 times as many people , a factor of 18 times the power per population in the U.S. and in those other already developed economies where that electrical power is always there at a Residential level .
What it really means is that vast sectors of the Chinese population have no power whatsoever at a Residential level , and in fact that figure is close to 1 Billion people in China who have no electrical power at all .
The same applies on the same scale in India , and also in those other developing Countries .
Incidentally while electrical power generation for distribution to all consumers in China is increasing at around 3 % per year , electrical power generation in the US is decreasing , mainly because those old technology coal fired plants are reaching the end of their useful life , and the power actually coming on stream cannot replace the amounts of power delivered by those coal fired plants .
Also , Coal fired power generation in the US is down around 45 % of the total .
In China , that amount of power from coal fired sources is around 62 % .
In the whole of the World , the average power generation from Coal fired sources is up at around 85 % , so in effect , with the U.S. and China well below that percentage , those two Countries in fact are artificially LOWERING that average to the current 85 % , proving that coal fired power production is in fact widespread , and with nothing to replace it , then it will continually stay that way , emitting what it always has , further showing up the UN ’s wish to lower those emissions as just that , a wish that can never be realised .
So now it becomes patently obvious why China is desperately constructing coal fired power plants , so it can develop further and also to bring that electrical power to its peoples .
THAT is something you most definitely will not hear coming out of Copenhagen .
That is why China and India and those other developing Countries will in now way , ever , agree to any binding cutbacks in their emissions .
That is why those coal fired power plants are being constructed like there is no tomorrow , because there will be no tomorrow for them if they are FORCED to cut back on their emissions .
In fact The World Bank is actually giving Billions of dollars to those developing Countries to construct the very coal fired power plants that the UN rails against so loudly .
You wo n’t hear this reasoning coming out of Copenhagen .
President Obama will not be mentioning it , nor any of the people he sends to Copenhagen .
Australian Prime Minister Mr Rudd wo n’t be mentioning it either , nor his people .
You wo n’t hear this at all .
It will be something political so they can shore up their positions at home , as both desperately seek to try and introduce Carbon Cap and Trade legislation .
This would be totally inconvenient for them , and show them as the heartless , uncaring , unfeeling political opportunists that they are .
Do n’t talk to me that we need to find ways to introduce renewable power to replace those coal fired plants .
Again , in those hundreds of posts I have made , I go into that in intricate detail explaining how they cannot EVER take the place of coal fired power .

It will have minor decisions made that will be announced to shore up political decisions that again suit the UN .
You wo n’t hear what really goes on , the important stuff .
Why ?
Because that important stuff is the most important of all , the whole crux of this whole thing .
It ’s just about the money .

There have been lots of rumours in recent weeks that the USF1 team was not going to make it .
This has prompted the team to give a few more details of what is going on at its base at Charlotte , North Carolina .
Team boss Ken Anderson explains what has been happening .
Ken , what is going on at US F1 Team ?
“ It has been quite a ride since we started the team last year , and has become far more intense since the signing of the Concorde Agreement .
Our world headquarters is now complete and fully functional , and the 2010 racecar is in the construction phase . ”
So the car is finally being built ?
Is n’t it a little late to get something like that started ?
“ Funny that you ask that question – we get that one a lot .
Thanks to our in - house design and engineering staff and the aid of our technical partners , for the last 10 to 12 months , the car has gone through thousands of iterations in a virtual environment .
With this virtual design , we can test and be sure that it ’s right from structural , design and engineering standpoints , so we do n’t have to make a part , test it , break it and start again .
Instead , we ’ve taken out a lot of the guesswork and can get close to a race - ready piece right off of the machines , which is happening now .
Our timing is according to plan , with an early November “ roller ” and a finished car in time for January 2010 testing . ”
So who ’s building the car ?
Americans ?
Europeans ?
Are you building the car in Charlotte ?
“ I ’ll answer the last part of the question first .
Yes , we ’re building the car in our shop here in Charlotte .
America is known as a “ melting pot ” and our team is a reflection of just that .
Americans , Europeans , New Zealanders , Welshmen and more are responsible for the racecar , including many who have high - level experience in the current Formula One environment .
Many of our new hires we connected with back in June and July , and they will be joining the team formally at the end of the month .
We are very grateful to the current Formula
One teams for releasing some of our “ newest ” team members early – that has been a huge help as we continue to prepare for the 2010 Formula One season . ”
Let ’s talk about what we ’re seeing in some of these pictures … what are we looking at here ?
“ In two words , we ’re “ fully equipped . ”
Our machine shop features three - and five - axis CNC machines ; we have a composite shop with autoclaves and a 24 - foot CNC cutting table ; a complete fab shop ; assembly and sub-assembly ; electronics ; research and development ; design and engineering ; CFD and aerodynamics ; marketing and communications ; and a full in - house HD production facility , just to name a few departments .
Building a team and a world class manufacturing facility are a work - in - progress but we ’re ahead of schedule and are excited about going racing next year . ”
Can you talk a little about the cost efficiency of manufacturing a Formula One car in the U.S.
How can the operation be cheaper than what we ’ve seen out there ?
“ The major cost savings will be that the engineering and production of the cars will be done in the United States .
Our technical partners located within a 30 - mile radius of our shop contribute to this savings , as there are some departments we do n’t have to have in - house , such as a wind tunnel , shaker rig , K&C machine , additional CFD support and a center of gravity machine .
What most people see – the transporters , motorcoaches and the “ lifestyle ” side of Formula
One – are a much smaller part of the overall budget and will be located at our European facility , which we ’ll tell you about soon ! ”
Heavy.com was able to dig down into the Shane McMahon / UFC talks and exactly what his role would be for the promotion .
Some of what they were able to gather from their sources was very interesting :
But five years after the initial explosion of popularity built by The Ultimate Fighter reality show , you do n’t see a strong UFC brand in the marketplace .
While you might expect a thriving brand of UFC t- shirts and hats to be sold in Wal - Marts nationwide , instead you find - almost nothing .
Here , more than anywhere else , is where the UFC can use McMahon ’s help .
Not only has he witnessed firsthand the WWE ’s slow march to wrestling ubiquity , he has personally secured much of the company ’s foreign business deals .
McMahon has successfully made millions in the United Kingdom and German markets , even successfully taking the WWE into the heart of Western Europe , and can likely replicate that success for the UFC .
It does remain amazing to me that the UFC has yet to really crack the consumer market effectively .
" UFC " is a household word ( household acronym ? ) at this point and yet as my wife and I were out doing Christmas shopping this past weekend the only time I saw any strong MMA presence in any store was walking past a Spencer 's Gifts and seeing a gigantic Tapout display .
If Shane McMahon can help get the UFC a bigger presense in stores such as Wal - Mart it would have to be considered a huge win .
His potential to get such deals done far outweighs the cries we 're going to hear from some MMA fans that his involvement would " ruin the legitimacy " of the sport .
Of course , money does remain a bit of an obstacle as it appears Shane wants to buy into the promotion rather than simply be an employee .
We will have to continue to monitor the situation to see if this is a dealbreaker or if something can be worked out that is in the best interest of all involved .
Juanita Castro says she was given the codename " Donna " by the CIA A sister of Cuba 's former long - time leader , Fidel Castro , has admitted spying for the CIA in the 1960s .
Juanita Castro , who now lives in Miami , said she had gathered sensitive information for the US for three years .
In her memoirs , she said she had fallen out with Fidel and her other brother Raul - Cuba 's current president - over the killing of their opponents .
Ms Castro , 76 , said she had helped to warn and hide Cuban dissidents before finally fleeing the island in 1964 .
There has been no immediate reaction from the US or Cuban governments .
' Donna '
In her memoirs - Fidel and Raul , My Brothers , the Secret History - Ms Castro says she was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency in Havana two years after the 1959 revolution brought Fidel Castro to power .
I did n't betray him .
He betrayed me
Juanita Castro
She agreed to help because she had become disenchanted when Fidel abandoned the nationalist democratic revolution he promised and instead imposed a one - party Marxist state " simply out of the need to hold power " , she said .
" Did I feel remorse about betraying Fidel by agreeing to meet with his enemies ?
No , for one simple reason : I did n't betray him .
He betrayed me , " she wrote .
" He betrayed the thousands of us who suffered and fought for the revolution that he had offered , one that was generous and just and would bring peace and democracy to Cuba , and which , as he himself had promised , would be as ' Cuban as palm trees ' , " she wrote .
Ms Castro said that at a meeting with a CIA officer called " Enrique " at a hotel in Mexico City in 1961 , she was given the codename " Donna " and codebooks so she could receive instructions .
She agreed on the condition that she received no money and was not asked to participate in any violent acts against the Cuban government .
She would help people persecuted by the Cuban secret police escape capture , imprisonment and possible execution , often by sheltering them at the home of her mother , Lina Ruz Gonzalez , she added .
Ms Castro fled Cuba a year after her mother died , believing she would no longer be protected from the attention of the secret police , and settled in Miami , where she ran a pharmacy until 2007 .
Raul helped her get a visa to leave .
Fidel relinquished power to Raul in February 2008 .
He has not been seen in public since falling ill in July 2006 .

New data from U.S. polling firm Gallup shows nearly half of Americans — a record number — are in support of legalizing and taxing marijuana for recreational use by adults .
RELATED : Two California airports have policy allowing passengers to fly with pot
The poll clearly illustrates a generational and political divide on the issue , with 78 percent of self - described liberals saying they would like to see the drug legalized and 72 percent of self - described conservatives being opposed .
Gallup also found that 50 percent of Americans under 50 - years - old are in favor of legalization , but just 28 percent of seniors agree .
ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps the most important demographic to advocates of legalization are the moderate voters , among whom 51 percent now support ending prohibition .
“ The new findings come as the U.S. Justice Department has reportedly decided to loosen its enforcement of federal anti-marijuana laws by not pursuing individuals who buy or sell small amounts of the drug in conformity with their own states ’ medical marijuana laws , ” Gallup noted .
“ This seems likely to meet with U.S. public approval , as previous Gallup polling has found Americans generally sympathetic to legalizing marijuana for medical purposes .
In 2003 , 75 % of Americans favored allowing doctors to legally prescribe marijuana to patients in order to reduce pain and suffering .
“ Fourteen states allow some use of marijuana for medical purposes : Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , ” the Associated Press reported on Monday .
Another of the poll ’s revelations is that among self - described Democrats , a majority in favor of legalization has emerged , with 54 percent supporting such a move and 45 percent opposed .
Among self - described Republicans , the question is not even a contest : 28 percent are in favor , while 70 percent are opposed .
Gallup tracking data also showed that from 2006 - 2009 , support for legalization grew more than at almost any time since the drug was banned , trending upward from 36 percent to 44 percent in just three years .
Support for legalization grew most among women , up 12 percent since 2005 ; Democrats , up 13 percent since 2005 ; Liberals , up 15 percent since 2005 ; and throughout the western states , up 13 percent since 2005 .

To compile the statistics , Gallup talked to 1,013 Americans nation - wide and assessed a margin of error at ±4 percent .

A quick update as it has been pointed out in the comments that Zombieland Rule # 5 would appear to be No Attachments .
Unfortunately it seems to be a rule that was made up on Horror - Movies.ca and they never explained it was made - up ( it ’s in italics to signify it was ‘ official ’ ) , but I could be wrong .
Can anybody find any proof that No Attachments appears in the film ?

Police are arresting people just to get their details on the DNA database , a senior officer claimed yesterday .
The police superintendent told an investigation into the database that the tradition of arresting only when dealing with serious offences had collapsed .
The officer told watchdogs : " It is now the norm to arrest offenders for everything if there is a power to do so .
" It is apparently understood by serving police officers that one of the reasons , if not the reason , for the change in practice is so the DNA of the offender can be obtained .
" It matters not , of course , whether the arrest leads to no action , a caution or charge , because the DNA is kept on the database anyway . "
The anonymous allegation was made in a report by the Government 's genetics advisers , the Human Genetics Commission .
Civil liberties groups seized on it .
Liberty 's Isabella Sankey said : " This highlights the dangers of our current DNA retention scheme .
" We are creating a perverse incentive to arrest people solely to get their details . "
Shadow home office minister James Brokenshire said : " For too long the Government has had a policy of growing the DNA database for the sake of it , regardless of guilt or innocence . "
More than half a million DNA samples are taken from suspects every year and the database holds more than 5.5 million profiles .
Even numbers are numbers that can be divided evenly by 2 .
Even numbers can be shown as a set like this :
{ … - 4 , - 2 , 0 , 2 , 4 , … }
Odd numbers are numbers that cannot be divided evenly by 2 .
Odd numbers can be shown as a set like this :
{ … - 5 , - 3 , - 1 , 1 , 3 , 5 , … }
Zero is considered an even number .
Is It Even or Odd ?
To tell whether a number is even or odd , look at the number in the ones place .
That single number will tell you whether the entire number is odd or even .
An even number ends in 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 .
An odd number ends in 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 9 .
Consider the number 3,842,917 .
It ends in 7 , an odd number .
Therefore , 3,842,917 is an odd number .
Likewise , 8,322 is an even number because it ends in 2 .
Adding Even and Odd Numbers
even + even = even 4 + 2 = 6
even + odd = odd 4 + 3 = 7
odd + odd = even 5 + 3 = 8
Subtracting Even and Odd Numbers
even - even = even 4 - 2 = 2
even - odd = odd 4 - 3 = 1
odd - odd = even 5 - 3 = 2
Multiplying Even and Odd Numbers
even x even = even 4 x 2 = 8
even x odd = even 4 x 3 = 12
odd x odd = odd 5 x 3 = 15
Division , or The Fraction Problem
As you can see , there are rules that tell what happens when you add , subtract , or multiply even and odd numbers .
In any of these operations , you will always get a particular kind of whole number .
But when you divide numbers , something tricky can happen — you might be left with a fraction .
Fractions are not even numbers or odd numbers , because they are not whole numbers .
They are only parts of numbers , and can be written in different ways .
For example , you can't say that the fraction 1/3 is odd because the denominator is an odd number .
You could just as well write that same fraction as 2/6 , in which the denominator is an even number .
The terms “ even number ” and “ odd number ” are only used for whole numbers and their opposites ( additive inverses ) .
Presumably the rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi are currently locked in negotiations regarding the exact terms that will be attached to a “ bailout ” for Dubai World .
We ’ll never know the details but if , as seems likely , the final deal involves creditors taking some sort of hit ( perhaps getting 75 cents in the dollar , at the end of the day ) , does that matter ?
Dubai probably has around $ 100bn in total liabilities , if we include off - balance sheet transactions , so total credit losses of $ 30 - 50 bn need to be assigned .
The direct effects so far seem small .
HSBC leads the pack , in terms of exposure , but our baseline estimate is a 3 percent loss relative to its equity – not good , but manageable ( and the stock already fell 5 percent on the news ) .
The impact among other financial institutions that lent to Dubai seems fairly spread out and mostly within continental Europe .
Korean construction companies and Ukrainian / Russian steelmakers are also affected by the likely fall off in construction activity , but the broader boom in emerging markets is unlikely to be disrupted .
The repricing of risk so far does not apply significantly to East Asia or Latin America .
However , there is a worrying impact on Ireland .
The credit default swap spreads for Irish banks have widened signficantly — even relative to HSBC , with its direct Dubai involvement .
In part , this is hedge funds betting that others will want to insure against the rising risk of an Irish default , but what ’s the connection ?
The thinking is that a partial bailout – with creditor losses – for Dubai from Abu Dhabi implies something about how Ireland will be treated within the European Union ( and the same reasoning is also more vaguely in the air for Greece ) .
This may make sense for three reasons .
If Dubai can effectively default or reschedule its debts without disrupting the global economy , then others can do the same .
If Abu Dhabi takes a tough line and does n’t destabilize markets , others ( e.g. , the EU ) will be tempted to do the same ( i.e. , for Ireland and Greece ) .
“ No more unconditional bailouts ” is an appealing refrain in many capitals .
If the US supports some creditor losses for Dubai ( e.g. , because of its connections with Iran ) , this makes it easier to impose losses on creditors elsewhere ( even perhaps where IMF programs are in place , such as Eastern Europe ) .
The main effect will be to strengthen the hand of Ben Bernanke in Fed policymaking discussions – so US interest rates will stay low for a long while .
If financial intermediaries draw the appropriate lessons from Dubai , Ireland , and Greece ( and Iceland , the Baltics , Hungary , etc ) , they will be more careful about extending credit to places that are becoming overexuberant – even when it is cheap to increase debt levels .
But an outbreak of caution and care on the part of our biggest banks ( and other investment managers ) does not seem likely .

Why We Need A New Road Rash
The Road Rash series is about motorcycle racing .
It 's also about fighting other racers and police with clubs , chains , brass knuckles , tire irons , and when the occasion calls for it , well placed kicks .
It 's a series that started on the Sega Genesis , and only improved when it moved to 3DO in 1994 .
The series reached its technical peak with Road Rash 64 on the Nintendo 64 .
Unfortunately that 's also where the series ended .
Developer Bottlerocket was working on a prototype for a modern Road Rash when the studio closed a few months ago .
A new Road Rash is n't just a cool idea ; it 's something we need .
And here 's why :
1... Because there 's no racing game like Road Rash
A lot of people would put Road Rash in the racing genre because the goal is to be the first to cross the finish line .
But Road Rash is actually more of an action game that it is a racing game .
For one thing , each course consists of a single lap rather than multiple laps .
Also the player can get thrown from his cycle ( in some of the versions ) and be forced to traverse on foot until he regains his ride .
At this point you might be thinking that it sounds pretty similar to the Grand Theft Auto series .
Afterall , in multiple Grand Theft Auto's you race a single lap on a motorcycle , and you can get thrown off your bike .
But Road Rash is different because it does n't test your driving ability .
The majority of the challenge in other racing games , even those with combat elements such as Burnout and Grand Theft Auto , is traversing the track at maximum speed without crashing into the walls .
The competing drivers are an ancillary threat .
But in Road Rash the combat with the other drivers is the focus .
The tracks barely curve at all .
This differentiates it from every racing game on the market .
The game is about hand - to - hand combat .
The speed of the race and the occasional object in the road are there to make the combat more interesting .
This brings me to my next point ...
2... Because Road Rash makes the environment relevant again
So if Road Rash is really an action game and not a racing game , what makes it stand out as an action game ?
The answer is that in Road Rash , the environment is fundamental to the combat .
This is an element that modern action games lack , but that 2d action games are based on .
If you take a look at your average boss fight in a game like Megaman or Castlevania , positioning your character in the right place relative to the environment is a huge part of your success .
Being on the right platform can mean the difference between life and death .
Compare this to modern action games such as God of War , Prince of Persia , Ninja Gaiden , or Zelda Twilight Princess .
The combat arena in those games is basically a giant cube .
Positioning your character is important relative to the locations of your enemies , but not relative to the physical environment itself .
You can use the same strategy on an enemy type over and over because the playspace never changes .
You 're always fighting on a flat surface .
But in Road Rash , the environment is integral to the combat .
A typical tactic in Road Rash is to force your opponent to one side of the road and then kick his bike as you approach a telephone pole .
Kick him too late and the pole will pass by .
Kick him too early and he 'll have time to avoid it .
Kick him just right and you 'll have one less opponenant to worry about .
But you can only rely on this tactic when there 's a telephone pole in the road .
The constant changes in the landscape require you to constantly modify your tactics .
A good player will take advantage of the buildings , cars , mailboxes , street fixtures , and the changes in the road itself as they present themselves .
And when they do the results are often spectacular .
This brings me to my next point .
3... Because the " Wow " moments happen naturally
Road Rash 's spectacular moments all occur through the natural course of the game .
They are n't scripted setpiece moments like when a giant monster blows through a wall in Gears of War or when a helicopter gets shot down in Call of Duty .
They are n't quick - time events like when you decapitate an Ogre by pressing triangle , circle , triangle , square in God of War .
All of Road Rash 's incredible moments are the result of a physics engine combined with unpredictable AI , and an even less predictable player .
This gives the game a sense of life and infinite possibilities that make you feel like you 're experiencing something new rather than just viewing the same identical moments as every other player .
There are few things that can compare with the cool factor of putting a tire iron in the spokes of an opponent 's motorcycle .
In Road Rash 64 this would result the motorcycle and its rider flipping through the air , end over end , and then careening into the ground .
Hand to hand combat often ends when someone kicks his opponent 's cycle into a parked car hurtling the rider into the air and toward a devasting bounce off the pavement .
It 's true that racing games like Burnout and Motorstorm have these same types of dynamically - generated " wow " moments , but modern action games tend to rely on canned moments instead .
And , as I 've said , Road Rash is more of an action game than a racing game .
But why do we need a NEW Road Rash ?
I 'm generally not a fan of remaking a game for the sake of remaking it .
Some games have had their day and really do n't need to be modernized ( Golden Axe and Splatterhouse I 'm looking at you two ) .
But Road Rash 's gameplay has n't been taken to its full potential , and so a modern update is needed .
Remember , the most recent Road Rash was on the N64 ( pictured above ) , so there is a lot of room for improvement .
Obviously a new Road Rash would have better graphics , online play , and a modern physics engine to make the " wow " moments even more spectacular .
I 'd also like to see more racers on - screen and more obstacles on the roads ( pedestrians maybe ) .
The melee combat system could also be upgraded to allow for advanced moves such as blocks , combos and counters .
Gunplay would be a welcome addition .
The last Road Rash came out long before Halo popularized the use of the right analog stick for aiming .
There 's no reason to think it could n't have that function in a modern Road Rash .
Imagine tearing down the street on your hog , single - barreled shotgun in hand Arnold Swarzenneger - style !
I 'm sure that 's just scratching the surface of what a modern Road Rash could be .
If done right , a new Road Rash would give the videogaming world a shot in the arm .
So let 's get moving .
MELBOURNE'S elite men-only clubs have been given the green light to keep women out .
The so - called gentlemen 's retreats , including the Melbourne and Athenaeum clubs on Collins Street and the Savage Club in Bank Place , have scored a big win over state Attorney - General Rob Hulls , with a Labor - dominated parliamentary committee saying they have the right to continue as single - sex institutions .
No women ... the Collins Street entrance to Melbourne 's Athenaeum Club .
The committee , headed by Government MP Carlo Carli , has rebuffed Mr Hulls ' aggressive campaign to end the protections that allow private clubs - including the elite women - only clubs the Lyceum and Alexandra - to be excluded from Victoria 's anti-discrimination laws .
In its report , tabled yesterday , the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee said freedom of association was a ' ' fundamental human right ' ' that was protected under Victorian law , and it needed to be balanced against the right to non-discrimination .
Melinda Messenger proved she still has the curves that propelled her to fame , as she showcased the new Ultimo lingerie designs for bigger busted women .
The 38 - year - old became famous back in the 90s when an advert showing her in her underwear was banned .
The controversy helped Melinda launch a successful career as a page three girl .
Melinda has been the face of Ultimo's D to G collection for more than a year .
And she is currently hosting Five 's Live From Studio Five show .
But her svelte figure does n't come with out work .
Melinda says it is thanks to the help of a natural diet pill - LIPObind , which she took after she put on 21lbs following the birth of her youngest child .
‘ I was going to pose in my underwear for the first time in eight years !
I suddenly thought ' Oh my God - I 've got three kids and now I 've got to take my clothes off ! ’ , ' she said .
The mother - of - three also says she would support her daughter Evie if she chose to follow in her footsteps .
' There are plenty of people who will pull you down and attack you – but that ’s not what life ’s about .
It ’s about following your heart , ' she told the Metro .
' If she feels compelled to be a model , then I ’m behind her , but she ’s only five .
She said she wanted to work in a library , then the next day she wanted to be like Madonna .
' Melinda 's own mother denounced her when she launched her glamour model career .
The two were only reconciled after the birth of Melinda 's first child .
WASHINGTON  Now it is Senator Harry Reid ’s health care bill .
The majority leader ’s deep personal involvement in assembling the overhaul of the health care system  now on the brink of a historic Senate debate  has , for better or worse , conferred ownership of the legislation on Mr. Reid , Democrat of Nevada .
Should Mr. Reid shepherd the measure successfully through the Senate and meld it with the House version into final legislation that President Obama can sign , it would be the biggest accomplishment of his career .
Should the bill fall victim to the complex political , procedural and substantive fights raging around health care , it would be a stinging defeat for him , his president and his party  all while he faces a tough re-election fight at home .
Colleagues say Mr. Reid ’s extensive knowledge of Senate tactics and well - honed understanding of what drives and divides his Democratic colleagues leave him well positioned to pull off a legislative coup that has eluded seasoned and determined lawmakers for decades .
“ I do n’t think there are many people in the whole world other than Harry Reid who could do this , ” said Senator Mary L. Landrieu , Democrat of Louisiana , one of the lawmakers who have been a thorn in Mr. Reid ’s side with their reluctance to commit to supporting a preliminary vote to open debate .
That vote is set for Saturday evening .

The first Internet addresses containing non-Latin characters from start to finish will soon be online thanks to today 's approval of the new Internationalized Domain Name Fast Track Process by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers board .
" The coming introduction of non-Latin characters represents the biggest technical change to the Internet since it was created four decades ago , " said ICANN chairman Peter Dengate Thrush .
" Right now Internet address endings are limited to Latin characters – A to Z .
But the Fast Track Process is the first step in bringing the 100,000 characters of the languages of the world online for domain names . "
ICANN 's Fast Track Process launches on 16 November 2009 .
It will allow nations and territories to apply for Internet extensions reflecting their name – and made up of characters from their national language .
If the applications meet criteria that includes government and community support and a stability evaluation , the applicants will be approved to start accepting registrations .
" This is only the first step , but it is an incredibly big one and an historic move toward the internationalization of the Internet , " said Rod Beckstrom , ICANN 's President and CEO .
" The first countries that participate will not only be providing valuable information of the operation of IDNs in the domain name system , they are also going to help to bring the first of billions more people online – people who never use Roman characters in their daily lives . "
IDNs have been a topic of discussion since before ICANN 's inception .
It 's taken years of intense technical testing , policy development , and global co-operation to prepare the Fast Track process for its coming launch .
" Our work on IDNs has gone through numerous drafts , dozens of tests , and an incredible amount of development by volunteers since we started this project .
Today is the first step in moving from planning and implementation to the real launch , " said Tina Dam , ICANN 's Senior Director for IDNs .
" The launch of the Fast Track Process will be an amazing change to make the Internet an even more valuable tool , and for even more people around the globe . "
More information of the Fast Track program is available online at : http://www.icann.org/en/topics/idn/fast-track/
About ICANN :
ICANN is responsible for the global coordination of the Internet 's system of unique identifiers like domain names ( like .org , . museum and country codes like .uk ) and the addresses used in a variety of Internet protocols that help computers reach each other over the Internet .
Careful management of these resources is vital to the Internet 's operation , so ICANN 's global stakeholders meet regularly to develop policies that ensure the Internet 's ongoing security and stability .
ICANN is an internationally organized , public benefit non-profit company .

Last week , I talked about a few of the “ rules ” of improv , and discussed the concepts of “ Yes , and … ” , Agreement , and Asking Open Questions .
This week , I ’d like to get into specifics a little more and suggest some really concrete things you can do when in the heat of a session to set yourself up for success later .
I ’m going to pull the curtain back a little on improvisation in this series , but hopefully it will only add to your enjoyment of improv as you ’ll know how much work and effort goes into the art .
Behind the scenes , the big thing that both improv scenes and D&D sessions have in common is that they are both messy , chaotic experiences that are made up as a group .
While it is always good to have a plan , you ’ll need to be flexible .
Unfortunately , both improv performers and Dungeon Masters can suffer from the need to overplan and overthink a story .
When ( not if ) your players attempt to go “ off the map ” and head away from your carefully - crafted script , you ’re going to have to think on your feet a little bit .
Dungeon Masters will try to come up with every possible contingency , every possible outcome , and every possible direction a party of adventurers could go – and then try to prepare for them all .
This is , of course , impossible … but that does n’t stop a few individuals from trying any way .
If this describes your personal style , I am not judging you , but I am willing to bet that you ’ve spent countless hours preparing stories and have pages upon pages of stuff that no one has ever seen .
In addition to eliminating paperwork , this will also eliminate the frustration you feel when your players do n’t open every single door in your hand - crafted dungeon .
If you ’ve never experienced this freedom in your game before , I ’m about to blow your mind .
Honestly , you ’re in for a treat .
“ Making stuff up ” is an art form , and one that can radically decrease prep time and exponentially increase fun .
When I run a game , just as when I perform improv , I firmly believe that it is not my job to write the entire story .
Let me repeat that .
My job as the Dungeon Master is not to determine the entire story ahead of time .
I ’ve spent my time trying to corral the players into the plotlines detailed in an adventure module , and can tell you that you will have better luck trying to herd cats .
The players in my games are the heroes , and their job is not just to play the game by rolling the dice when I tell them to , but to make up the story along with me .
My job as a performer or Dungeon Master is not to write a script that the players must follow , either .
I ’ve tried that , and likewise found it to be a lot of work for me and extremely frustrating for the players .
I ’ve discovered that as a Dungeon Master , my job consists of two main roles : to have a basic story outline , and to be the referee .
The DM is the final arbiter of decisions — not so I can have an ego trip — but so that the group can come to a quick decision and get back to playing .
According to that prepared outline , I ’ll throw challenges at the players for them to overcome ( in a specific order and at specific times ) as they work towards the completion of certain goals .
If they can think up a creative way to overcome that challenge , whether that challenge is a puzzle or a monster , I let them use it – and then claim it as my own .
Some of my best gaming sessions happened when players believed that their own ideas were “ The Solution ” I had planned all along .
ESTABLISH WHO , WHAT , AND WHERE
Alright , but what does all this have to do with improv ?
An improv scene begins the moments the light come up , and it is the performers ’ first point of order to set the scene for the audience .
You see , the players in an improv scene already know where they are before they say a word .
They automatically know the moment they step on stage .
Not because they plan it out ahead of time , but because whoever speaks first sets the scene , and the other performer agrees .
Remember ?
“ Yes , and … ” with an agreement .
That ’s the reality of the scene and then the performers can tell a story based in that reality .
As the Dungeon Master , you need to let the players know where they are , what the room looks like and who else might be in there – but do n’t overdo it !
When describing a location , a room , or a scene , your players just need key information : who is there ( Monsters ? Allies ? ) , what they ’re doing ( Attacking ?
Sleeping ? ) , and where they are ( Standing by the door ?
Huddled in the corner ? ) .
Even if you ’re using a pre-made adventure , the text boxes are NOT there so you can read them aloud verbatim .
They are there to give you an idea of exactly what critical information you need to provide to the players .
Aside from those three things , give the players a little bit of detail , like how badly the sewer smells , or if the room is dusty , or if it ’s dark , or if there are rotting corpses strewn across the floor .
Something descriptive , but again , do n’t go overboard .
DON’T DICTATE ACTION
While your partner sets the scene , it is your job to listen .
I cannot emphasize this enough in improv .
A good improviser will give you all kinds of gifts if you ’re listening for them .
Alternately , while you set the scene , your partner ’s job is to listen as intensely as they can to you .
Many improv performers are so busy making sure their partner is doing the “ right thing ” that they forget that they ’re supposed to making this up as they go .
This is a major component in improv scenes , as your job is not to direct , but to listen .
I know .
It sounds basic , but it is an easy trap to fall in to .
There are some exceptions to this , but for the most part , a Dungeon Master does n’t tell the players what to do .
I know this sounds contradictory to everything a DM knows to be true , but again , your job is not to write the story , it is to set up challenges and obstacles , and it ’s your players ’ job to find the solution – whatever that solution may be .
If the players want to negotiate with the giant instead of attacking , is that really so bad ?
Why would it not work ?
It ’s pretty simple to swap out a skill challenge for a combat encounter , and make the negotiations seem part of your carefully planned adventure .
As a DM , your job is never to tell the party what they ’re doing .
You can suggest .
You can recommend .
Just do n’t command .
As soon as you start telling the party what to do , it ceases to be interactive and becomes a passive experience for them .
So just ask , “ What are you guys doing ?
You want to investigate or move on ? ”
DON ’T TALK ABOUT PAST ( OR FUTURE ) EVENTS
Be in the now .
This is absolutely vital in improv scenes .
When two performers start talking about how cool some future event is going to be , it only serves to highlight how boring the present situation really is .
“ Oh man , I ca n’t wait for that really exciting thing to happen later . ”
“ Yeah , it ’ll be great . ”
Likewise with the past – no one wants to hear about how exciting something was that they did n’t get to see .
“ Remember that time we were really funny and that really entertaining thing happened ? ” “ Yeah , that was great . ” “ Sigh . ” This is how you disconnect with an audience .
As a Dungeon Master , I try not to talk about future events – this means ( as a general rule ) that I shy away from augury , prophecy , fortune tellers , and the like , because it locks you in to a specific course of action .
Prophecies and predictions tend to limit both player and DM choices , and even though I am currently breaking my own rule by including several pieces of a Dragonmark Prophecy in my Eberron game , this was a conscious decision and not the norm .
The past is a little more flexible , but at the same time , I try not to “ invent ” things from a character ’s past unless the player has mentioned it previously in games or in their pre-written back stories .
If you must deal with the future ( as in time - travel or prophecy plot lines ) , take the advice of an expert and do what Nostradamus did : be vague .
Do n’t get into specifics , but use descriptions and phrases that could be interpreted multiple ways – then , whichever one happens was the “ correct ” one .
A good Dungeon Master , like a good improviser , can set themselves up for success by doing a lot of easy , little things .
Listen .
Agree .
Add details .
Be in the now .
Your players are there to help you write the story , and they will appreciate you letting them have a say in the way their game unfolds .
Set the scene , ask what the party wants to do , and then be in the present .
Relax , you do n’t have to make it all up by yourself , and no one expects you to do it all ahead of time .
You should have an idea , or a general concept , and then start the ball rolling .
I ’m not saying that a Dungeon Master should n’t prepare for the game , but would n’t it be fantastic if that preparation took a lot less time ?

When ABC
News needed some samples of the same hair care products purchased by accused al Qaeda terror plotter Najibullah Zazi , I was dispatched in a taxi to a beauty supply store in New Jersey .
My uneventful assignment would lead to a brush with FBI bomb squad agents and reveal just how broadly the authorities have cast their counter - terrorism net .
CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE NEW YORK TERROR PLOT AND OTHER TERRORISM STORIES .
Zazi is accused of purchasing the hair products because they contain the chemicals necessary for the homemade bomb recipe the FBI says it found in his computer .
At the time of his arrest , officials were convinced Zazi was prepared to set off bombs in several crowded areas throughout the United States .
Government prosecutors believed he was " creating weapons of mass destruction . "
We wanted to show the actual products on a report being filed by ABC News correspondent Brian Ross , so I set out to North Bergen , NJ to visit Sally Beauty Supply and Lowes Home Improvement stores .
My taxi driver waited for an hour in nearly deserted parking lots while I questioned store employees to make sure I was getting exactly what was on my list , down to the color , shape of the bottle and volume of each item .
With the help of a very attentive employee at Sally Beauty Supply I was able to purchase everything we needed .
I paid with an ABC News corporate credit card .
The next evening , after a long week at work , I trudged up to the top floor of my Brooklyn brownstone ready to relax .
As I fumbled for my keys I noticed a business card tucked between my door and the frame with a hand written note that read , " Please give me a call .
You may have witnessed a crime .
We need 10 minutes of your time .
Thank you . ( over ) --> " .
When I flipped the card over , I was shocked by the information : U.S. Department of Justice , Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Bomb Technician .
Sally Beauty Supply
I immediately started retracing my steps over the past couple of days , searching for anything that I could have possibly witnessed .
I called my downstairs neighbor to ask if there had been any incidents in our neighborhood and if he had also been visited by the FBI .
He told me nothing unusual had occurred in the neighborhood and that the agent had come about an hour before I arrived but was " only looking for you " .
My hands were shaking as I dialed the agent 's number .
He thanked me for calling back and proceeded to ask me if I had been to a Sally Beauty Supply in the last couple of days .
When I told him yes , he informed me that there was a large investigation going on that I may have been aware of and said I might be able to help .
" Are you a stylist , or do you have a job that requires you to purchase such large quantities of chemical hair products ? " he asked .
" No , " I answered .
He then asked if they could speak with me as soon as possible , in person .
I told him that I needed to speak with my job about when I could get time off to meet him and then phoned the Assignment Editor on duty at the ABC News desk .
After a long talk with Rhonda Schwartz , the senior investigative producer , we decided to let the correspondent , Ross , call the agent back and let him know precisely who we were and why we bought so many bottles of scalp conditioner , hair dye and highlight enhancers .
The FBI said I had triggered suspicions at the hair supply store for a number of reasons .
Why was I in a Yellow Cab ?
Why did I spend so much money to purchase the items ?
Why did I come back for a few more bottles after the initial visit ?
The agents were apparently also suspicious of me because the FBI was looking for a young , African - American woman that could fit the description of a Somali woman believed to be connected to Zazi .
I am of Nigerian descent , in my mid-twenties , and am often still mistaken for a college student .
Apparently I fit the profile perfectly .
Two hours later Rhonda called to tell me I was no longer being sought by the FBI for questioning .
I let out the most relieved sigh I ever have .
Despite the fear of knowing that the " Feds " were after me and had been able to track me down through my credit card in less than 24 hours , I was able to reflect and actually marveled at the efficiency of the FBI .
It is , in a way , comforting to know that they are on top of their responsibilities and makes me confident that they will continue to come closer to solving this investigation .

New stuff from the Processing - community .
Karsten Schmidt , better known as Toxi has released an respectable collection of libraries for the processing - scripting - facilities .
It ’s a collection of classes and tools , he developed over the last years of Processing - practise .
Nevertheless , the Toxiclibs are not constrained to work only with Processing itself .
Even Java - heads will have pleasure :
Even though these libraries have been mainly developed for use in Processing related projects ( see examples below ) , there is no explicit dependency on the monolithic PApplet or any other classes of the Processing toolkit .
This is intentional & should be considered as a feature .
Also , please note that all code in this project is now using Java 5 syntax and so will not work with older versions ( before 0140 ) of Processing .
Personally , I ’ve been mainly using Eclipse for my larger projects and the “ new ” syntax just speeds up development time ( if not execution time too ) .
The showreel is a chance for you to see the toxiclibs in action .
Unfortunately there is no way , to get toxiclibs get running on the iPhone .
But if you want to buy an iPhone , you are unlikely to buy an iPhone without looking at an Iphone 4 review or two .
There are other libaries , like makes grafic - coding fun on this devices , like Cocos2D .
I especially like to see the Processing - community really growing into serious and professional things .
Look for example at the HYPE - framework , that was developed for Flash / Actionscript 3 and released some weeks ago .
It seems , that sophisticated high - level stuff is about to come !

A rich and surprisingly diverse array of marine animals has been discovered living in total darkness in the deepest parts of the Atlantic where no sunlight ever penetrates .
They range from a giant octopus - like creature with eight legs and fins that flap like an elephant 's ears to tiny crustaceans that shine like gold - encrusted jewels .
Marine biologists have been astonished by the range of animals they have found during an underwater expedition that that took them down 5,000 m ( three miles ) , where they have now identified 17,650 deep - sea species .
One of the most surprising animals was a rare specimen of a primitive creature called a cirrate , or finned octopod , commonly called a " Dumbo " because they swim by flapping a pair of ear - like fins , rather like the Disney cartoon character .
But the particular species the biologists found is now called " Jumbo Dumbo " , because it grows up to 2 m long and weighs about 6 kg , the largest specimen of the type ever discovered , records the Census of Marine Life , the umbrella organisation overseeing the global survey of the oceans .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Dumbos collected by the scientists were found between 1,000 m to 3,000 m ( 0.6 to 1.9 miles ) down on the mid-Atlantic ridge , a vast chain of underwater mountains that stretch north - south along the seabed .
The scientists also took samples of mud from the seabed and found that it contained a surprisingly rich collection of fauna .
Most of these animals are only a few millimetres in size , and they live on the sediments that fall from above , ranging in size from dead plankton to the residue of the carcasses of massive whales .
" To survive in the deep , animals must find and exploit meagre or novel resources , and their great diversity in the deep reflects how many ways they are to adapt , " said Robert Carney of Louisiana State University , a co-leader of the deep - sea project .
" Some scientists have likened the deep mud 's biodiversity to that of tropical forests .
In college , I was taught that high biodiversity is a function of habitat diversity , many nooks and crannies .
But it is hard to imagine anything as monotonous , nook - less and cranny - less as deep - sea mud , " Dr Carney said .
" There is both a great lack of information about the ' abyss ' and substantial misinformation .
Many species live there .
But the abyss has long been viewed as a desert .
Worse , it was viewed as a wasteland where few to no environmental impacts could be of any concern .
The abyss is vast and best yet , hidden from sight . "
The scientists used autonomous , unmanned submarines to explore the deepest reaches of the ocean floor , extending down several miles .
At between 1.25 and 1.5 miles , the scientists found a bizarre , elongated orange fish - like animal called Neocyema , only the fifth specimen of the species to be caught .
Another slow - growing fish living in complete darkness , called a rat- tail , was found a similar depths feeding on crustaceans .
The scientists also collected about 680 specimens of microscopic animals called copepods , which live in the plankton , but they were able to identify only seven of them .
The rest appeared to be new to science , they said , including one that shone like a jewel with a golden sheen when lit .
" The distribution of species in the deep sea is full of mysteries , " said Dr David Billett of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton .
" In addition to the boundaries caused by underwater topography , ridges and seamounts , there are unseen , and as yet unexplained walls and barriers that determine supplies of food and define the provinces of species in the deep sea .
The abyssal fauna is so rich in species diversity and so poorly described that collecting a known species is an anomaly .
Describing for the first time all the different species in any coffee cup - sized sample of deep - sea sediment is a daunting challenge . "
Mireille Consalvey , of the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research , said the conditions of the expedition were difficult , with many scientists struggling with seasickness amid high winds and 30 - foot swells .
" It can be a tough environment down there , " she added .
" I recall the abject fear when our video - imaging system snagged for 40 minutes on a rockface : the slow , scary process of recovering it , and the shared worry that our valuable recording equipment would arrive at the surface battered and bent .
Thankfully , the recorder survived the ordeal better than many of us and yielded brilliant new footage of this remote realm . "

Here in the United States ( and in other European countries ) , labels on the side of food packages break down nutrition facts concerning the amount of calories , fat , carbohydrates so you have a better idea of what you ’re putting into your mouth .
Regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , nutrition facts are provided to guide people to make ( theoretically ) healthy food choices .
But what about the carbon footprint of your food ?
Would that influence your consumer habits ?
In Stockholm , Swedish food labels now include the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that were expended in production .
The labels are showing up not only in the grocery stores , but also in some restaurant menus around the country .
The plan is to help educate consumers to choose eco-friendly food .
Information on the labels will give people an easy way to comparison shop between breakfast cereals , dried pasta , sandwich fillings , and more .
Sweden is the first country to use the climate friendly labels , through the leadership of the Nutrition Department at the Swedish National Food Administration .
The food labeling system is still experimental at this time , and some people have complained about how its difficult to understand the information .
For example , the label on a box of oatmeal in a Stockholm supermarket stated :
“ Climate declared : .87 kg CO2 per kg of product . ”
Huh ?
Yet , supporters of the system believe that it will catch on , and will have an important impact , as people start to realize that the small , daily decisions they make can truly add up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
In fact , experts believe that if consumers choose more wisely based on the new food labeling system and guidelines released by the government are followed , CO2 emissions from food production could be slashed by 25 % .
I ’m telling you … when you compare the fact that a hamburger is listed with 1.7 kilograms of CO2 emissions and a chicken sandwich boasts only 0.4 kilograms , I think I know the choice I would make !
Sweden ’s new food guidelines also instruct consumption of carrots , instead of cucumbers and tomatoes .
This is because the latter are grown in heated greenhouses , which obviously require energy !
Not surprisingly , red meat is disfavored due to the CO2 emissions associated with raising cattle on factory farms .
The U.S. FDA has seen how clear , effective labeling can provide valuable information for consumers regarding nutrients , calories and dangerous saturated facts .
Many restaurants are now publishing calorie counts on the menu , in the interest of full disclosure ( or to simply comply with government regulation ) .
As a result , some Americans have changed their eating habits .
It makes perfect sense to also provide comparison figures for the carbon footprint of the foods we eat .
The new Swedish food labels are yet another example of the country ’s leadership in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
It plans to get the country off of fossil fuels ( both for electricity and transportation ) by 2030 .
When a 2005 study showed that 25 % of the national per capita CO2 emissions was attributable to eating habits , the government set out to change that result !
A low carbon diet is now on the menu in Sweden .
And , while you may not be able to see these Swedish food labels at your local grocery store , you can take into consideration your own food carbon footprint when you make shop and cook .
Eat locally - produced food ( grown or raised within 100 miles of your home ) , avoid factory - grown meats , and select organic when possible .
The planet … and probably your waistline too… will thank you !
Blanket charges of racism have become the stock - in - trade of the liberal media in reporting on Town - Hall protesters .
For converging to petition their representatives about the administration ’s profligate policies , independent - minded , patriotic constitutionalists have been savaged by rabid reporters who see signs of the divine in Obama and the devil in his detractors .
One apropos sign at a tea party captured this state of affairs : “   It doesn ” t matter what my sign says , the press will call it racist . ” 
In fairness , members of the media are more inclusive in their reprimands about racial exclusion .
The general , ( alleged ) racial backwardness of the American people is a repeated refrain in the popular press .
This non-stop , relentless propaganda , enforced by the tyranny of political correctness , helps explain why most Americans ” who themselves harbor no racial animus , and , if anything , are remarkably naÃ¯ve about human differences , cultural or racial ” believe racism saturates their society .
It is one thing for a starlet like Janeane Garofalo to defame tea party attendees as “ a bunch of teabagging rednecks , ” and accuse men and women she knows nothing about of “ hating a black man in the White House ”  and harboring unadulterated racism .
It ’s quite another for cable - network anchors to parrot the loopy lady ’s lines .
Nevertheless , ape they did .
So it was that thought - crime investigator Keith Olbermann broke news on his MSNBC nightly show .
With his most solemn , commissar - like countenance , Keith informed his viewers , matter - of - fact , that the intensity of the animosity toward Barack Obama is based on his being a black man .
Instead of arguing their “ case ”  with reference to facts and reason , Keith and Company chose to impugn their disputants based on assumptions about their motives .
Still worse : this balderdash , framed as breaking - news , was bolstered by another logical fallacy : an argument from authority .
The feeble - minded Jimmy Carter had seconded Garofalo the histrion .
By Keith ’s journalistic standards , this was all the proof he needed to pronounce the libel true , and apply the pejorative liberally .
Olbermann proceeded to “ debate ”  this ad hominem with the effeminate , bug - eyed blogger Markos Moulitsas , and before him with politician - turned - pundit , Lawrence O ”  Donnell .
The shifty and shameless O ”  Donnell asserted in all seriousness that because Carter had claimed that conservative and independent tea - party goers were guilty of harboring and acting on racially impure thoughts , this was indeed so .
After all , the former president was from the dreaded South !
He ought to know !
At the time Obama ascended to the throne his approval ratings ran to 70 percent .
Carter , Keith , Chris ( Matthews ) , and Contessa ( Brewer ) were asking their viewers to believe that between March and September of 2009 , the aforementioned Americans had developed a bad case of racism rather than buyer ’s remorse .
No wonder , then , that the malign men and women of MSNBC pointedly failed to report conclusive findings to the contrary .
A progressive research group “  among whose stars is Democratic political consultant and prominent clintonista ( now Obamaniac ) James Carville “  discovered that when it comes to their assumptions about older , white , Southern Republicans , the cable quislings had been wrong all along .
As the Greenberg Quinlan Rosner research group recently , and reluctantly , reported , the Americans whom the liberal media had been righteously denouncing were not racists .
Although the research group had done its darnedest to disparage the conservative base of the Republican Party , its racism spotters were forced to exempt this “ mocked minority ”  from the media ’s charges for lack of evidence .
The Group ’s Key Findings leap off the pixelated page :
Instead of focusing on [ the ] intense ideological divisions , the press and elites continue to look for a racial element that drives these voters ”  beliefs “  but they need to get over it .
Conducted on the heels of Joe Wilson ’s incendiary comments at the president ’s joint session address , we gave these groups of older , white Republican base voters in Georgia full opportunity to bring race into their discussion “   but it did not ever become a central element , and indeed , was almost beside the point .
The “ rubes ”  were given a clean bill of racial health by an organ of the rulers .
But the fraudulent zealots at the intellectual hinterland that is MSNBC have yet to come clean .
Many look to California for guidance on where the future is heading .
In this current economy , it would seem that some are looking for other economic leaders .
A $ 26 billion budget deficit , a housing market that is still wobbling around , and employment that seems to continue to get worse .
The current California economy , unlike many states in the nation , still seems solidly in a recession .
Yet on a nationwide level , there does seem to be faint hopes that things are getting worse at a slightly slower clip .
Unemployment is n’t flying off a cliff but jobs are still being lost .
The housing market on a nationwide basis seems to have hit a sales bottom ( although prices still seem to be heading lower ) .
Yet California has unique struggles that will make it a late bloomer in coming out of the recession .
If you have n’t already noticed , part of the budget balancing act contained earlier withholdings .
California Realtors are gearing up to fight this because many are independent contractors and get a 1099 tax form instead of the more typical W - 2 .
Most who get paid via the W - 2 pay taxes on a rolling monthly basis .
Yet many that operate under the 1099 pay quarterly estimates of their taxes .
In many cases , this creates massive fluctuations with revenues .
But you have to love the argument coming out from Realtors :
“ ( OC Register ) The Vote May be TODAY !
Please call your Assembly member NOW ! ” an association “ Red Alert ” to members said after the measure emerged from conference committee in June .
“ C.A.R. OPPOSES ( this ) proposal to force independent contractors to make interest - free loans to the state ! ”
Unlike wage earners , who get taxes deducted from their paychecks , independent contractors are n’t subject to any withholdings .
But contractors , who get a 1099 tax form instead of a W - 2 , are required to make estimated tax payments every three months .
Some state officials proposed that those paying independent contractors be required to withhold 3 % of their income and send it to the state .
The plan would accelerate tax payments and generate more cash for California ’s coffers , they maintain . ”
You have got to love this one .
Where were Realtors when brokers were giving out no money down loans and Alt - A junk to the public ?
Where were Realtors when the $ 700 billion taxpayer bailout rescued banks ?
I did n’t hear much opposition about that tax credit for home buyers which amounts to a free taxpayer subsidy to those who buy homes .
Now they are opposed to paying taxes earlier ?
This is n’t even a tax hike .
This is a typical case of cognitive dissonance in action .
Some seem to think that we are already out of the woods with the July budget :
For what it is worth , the state is still issuing IOUs .
They are however ahead of schedule and are planning to phase out the program come September 4 .
Even with all the massive cuts in programs and no new revenue streams the state is going to need to borrow some $ 10.5 billion for the fiscal year .
The chart above depicts that situation .
Without the borrowing , we would be in the red in a couple of days .
And much of the expectation is things will stay at this level :
Keep in mind that the above cuts of approximately $ 15 billion and the $ 10.5 billion in borrowing balance the budget for part of the last fiscal year and the 2009 - 10 year .
But the underlying basis is the worst has already occurred .
Given the current cuts , it is assured that the economy will face additional pain at least into the next fiscal year .
Many have only recently started furloughs which means less disposable income for the economy .
The current unemployment rate of 11.9 percent underscores the actual underemployment rate of 22 percent :
And people are doing what they can .
The economy has actually pushed many unemployed to seek a new avenue of income .
Game shows :
“( USA Today )
Before the economy soured , Pomerantz says , few prospective contestants skewed older , college - educated and unemployed .
Now its 10 % , she says .
Catch 21 players can win a maximum of $ 50,000 – apparently enough of a draw these days to lure auditioners atypical of the “ average Joes ” who usually want on .
Casting for a third season run of about 200 shows , “ it ’s absolutely clear we are seeing a lot of professionals who have lost their jobs or are looking for a way to supplement income , ” says producer Scott Sternberg . ”
People are simply trying to make ends meet .
And with 812,000 Californians receiving unemployment insurance , there are many simply trying to figure out how to handle the current downturn in the economy .
The unemployment insurance fund has been in the red since the start of the year :
And the loss of jobs has occurred in practically every industry :
The only two sectors that are slightly positive on a 12 month basis are education , health services and agriculture .
But even healthcare , the last place to cut is having to scale back :
“ ( LA Times )
One of the state ’s largest employers , healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente , said it would eliminate more than 1,800 positions as it struggles with drooping membership , uncertain healthcare reform and shriveling Medicare reimbursement rates .
Job reductions will occur within the next few months , the Oakland - based nonprofit said Tuesday .
Many of the purged positions — just under 2 % of Kaiser employees — are temporary , on - call or short - hour .
Most Kaiser medical centers in California will be affected . ”
The real question many should ask is what industry is going to bring us out of this recession ?
Also , we are assured additional financial losses with the Alt - A and option ARM products .
There is now speculation that banks will be doing lease - back options to current owners .
That is , renting the home back to the distressed borrower at market level rents with a future purchase option .
But how many people will jump on to this program ?
Are banks capable of being landlords ?
I hold my own reservations here .
Remember Hope Now ?
This was going to supposedly help tens of thousands and helped out a handful of people .
With about 1,000 properties going back to banks each day , they will have to decide quickly what they plan on doing .
California relied much too heavily on real estate and is now paying the price .
To assume real estate will lead us out again ignores the amount of distress property still coming down the pipeline .
2010 should offer us a better glimpse of where we are heading .
And now , we are only starting to see the impacts of the major budget cuts .
Many are just starting school .
Bigger class sizes and a public college system unable to meet the demand of the recently unemployed .
And those that can go to college , are now facing higher fees ( 10 percent at CSU and 9.4 percent at the UC ) .
Even community colleges hiked up their fees from $ 20 to $ 26 .
Less money for consumption .
Cash for clunkers ends today .
At a certain point , the gimmicks start running out .

About a month ago , I wrote an article about Jonathan Ayers , a Georgia Baptist Pastor who was killed by a plain - clothes undercover narcotics officer during a botched raid .
As I mentioned in that article , Ayers was not the target of the investigation , but was shot by one of the narcotics officers as he attempted to drive away .
According to the county sheriff , Ayers was shot because he struck one of the officers with his car and proceeded to drive toward the remaining officers “ in a threatening manner . ”
Video footage of the incident can be found here :
Radley Balko has an update on this story over at The Agitator .
The Associated Baptist Press also has an update on this story .
The actual target of the undercover investigation was a 26 year old woman who was later arrested on two charges of selling cocaine .
Both the woman and Ayers ’ family state that the pastor had been ministering to the woman for years , trying to get her to “ straighten out her life , ” and had given her a ride to her home about twenty minutes before Ayers was shot by the narcotics officer in front of a Shell station .
Georgia authorities are still investigating the shooting and say that the investigation would likely be concluded in another four weeks .
Once the investigation is completed , the Georgia Bureau of Investigations will turn over the results to either the District Attorney ’s office or an outsider prosecutor , who would then have the option of presenting the matter before a grand jury .
Meanwhile , friends and family members held a vigil on October 3rd to remember the slain pastor .
After the vigil , about fifty people took part in a march around the block surrounding the Stephens County Courthouse calling for justice .
According to Ayers ’ mother , no one in law enforcement has contacted her to apologize or offer any explanation about his death .

Trotsky : A Biography
Robert Service
Harvard University Press
Cambridge , Massachusetts , 2009
The Specter of Leon Trotsky
In 1955 James Burnham , the intellectual godfather of modern American neo-conservatism , reviewed The Prophet Armed , the first volume of Isaac Deutscher ’s monumental biography of Leon [ Lev Davidovich ]
Trotsky .
Fifteen years had passed since Burnham had resigned from the Fourth International at the climax of a political struggle in which he had crossed polemical swords with Leon Trotsky .
It had been a difficult experience for Burnham , who felt somewhat overmatched in this political and literary contest .
“ I must stop awhile in wonder , ” Burnham had written in a document addressed to Trotsky , “ at the technical perfection of the verbal structure you have created , the dynamic sweep of your rhetoric , the burning expression of your unconquerable devotion to the socialist ideal , the sudden , witty , flashing metaphors that sparkle through your pages . ” ( 1 )
Isaac Deutscher
In the aftermath of his repudiation of socialism , Burnham moved rapidly to the extreme right ( as Trotsky had predicted ) .
By the mid-1950s he viewed Trotsky ’s life and work through the prism of his own ideological commitment to a global struggle against Marxism .
Deutscher ’s work filled Burnham with alarm .
The problem was not literary in character .
Burnham readily acknowledged the author ’s masterful reconstruction of Trotsky ’s revolutionary persona .
“ Mr. Deutscher has cast his story of Trotsky in the Greek mould , and with sufficient justification , ” Burnham wrote .
“ His Trotsky is a protagonist of the most dazzling brilliance , who rises in 1905 , 1917 and in the Civil War to successive heights where he fuses with History and becomes her voice . ”
Burnham allowed that the author had succeeded in conveying to his readers Trotsky ’s extraordinary qualities : “ the flaming oratory , which many who heard him believe to have been the greatest of our century ; the linguistic facility ; the witty and vibrant prose ; the quickness with which Trotsky mastered every new subject ; the breadth of interest , so rare among the dedicated revolutionaries . ”
Burnham noted that Deutscher ’s portrait of Trotsky was not one - sided ; that he “ conscientiously displays , also , Trotsky ’s weaknesses … ”
But despite the many literary virtues of the biography , Burnham denounced it as an “ intellectual disaster . ”
Burnham ’s reason for his condemnation was that “ Mr. Deutscher writes from a point of view that accepts and legitimizes the Bolshevik revolution . ”
The biography was “ organically warped ” and unacceptable .
“ Not all the scholarly references from all the libraries are enough to wash out the Bolshevik stain . ”
Burnham confessed his horror that Deutscher had received “ all the courtesies of our leading research institutions , the aid of our foundations , the pages of our magazines , publication and promotion by the great Anglo - Saxon Oxford Press . ”
Did the establishment not recognize the danger in allowing , and even encouraging , the details of Trotsky ’s heroic life and revolutionary ideas to reach the broader public , and especially the youth ?
Burnham concluded his review with a cry of despair : “ The minds of many of our university students and opinion - makers are being deeply formed , on the supremely important issues with which he [ Deutscher ] deals , by his ideas .
It is surely one more among the many indications of the suicidal mania of the western world . ”
( 2 ) The conclusion that implicitly flowed from this review was that Deutscher ’s book and others like it , which portrayed the October Revolution and its leaders sympathetically , should not be published .
Burnham ’s fears , at least from his political standpoint , were not without justification .
He foresaw the subversive potential of Deutscher ’s rehabilitation of Trotsky , whose historic role and political ideas had been buried for so many decades beneath the massive heap of Stalinist lies .
In February 1956 Khrushchev’s “ secret speech ” at the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Union ’s Communist Party more or less admitted that Stalin was a mass murderer and vindicated the indictment issued 20 years earlier by the dictator ’s implacable opponent .
In the years that followed , the political stature of Leon Trotsky rapidly grew throughout the world .
Against the backdrop of growing working class militancy and the radicalization of youth , Deutscher ’s biographical trilogy – The Prophet Armed , The Prophet Unarmed and The Prophet Outcast – introduced countless thousands of youth , intellectuals and workers to the deeds and ideas of Leon Trotsky .
Organizations that claimed to base themselves on the political heritage of Trotsky grew significantly in the 1960s and 1970s .
This was particularly the case in Britain .
As early as 1964 , the leadership of the Young Socialists , youth movement of the British Labour Party , passed into the hands of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League .
Throughout the 1960s , 1970s , and even into the 1980s , the activities of Trotskyist organizations were a major preoccupation of the principal British Intelligence agency , the MI5 . ( 3 )
A New Offensive Against Trotsky
This historical experience is worth recalling as one considers a peculiar literary phenomenon : the publication , within the space of little more than five years , of three biographies of Leon Trotsky by British historians .
In 2003 Professor Ian Thatcher of Leicester University ( and previously of Glasgow University ) produced his Trotsky , which was published by Routledge .
Three years later Longman published the Trotsky of Glasgow University ’s Geoffrey Swain .
And now , as 2009 draws to a close , the Trotsky : A Biography by Professor Robert Service of St. Antony ’s College , Oxford , has been brought out with considerable fanfare .
The British publisher is Macmillan .
In the United States , Service ’s book has been published by the Harvard University Press .
What underlies this evident interest of British academics in Leon Trotsky , who has been dead for nearly 70 years ?
Trotsky
This reviewer has in another place submitted the works of Thatcher and Swain to an exhaustive analysis , and proved that they are crass exercises in historical falsification , of absolutely no value to anyone interested in learning about the life and ideas of Leon Trotsky .
As if heeding Burnham ’s warning , Thatcher and Swain were determined not to provide Trotsky with a platform , and therefore took care to quote as little as possible from his writings .
Both works set out to reverse the popular image of Trotsky that had emerged from Deutscher ’s great trilogy .
Thatcher and Swain belittled Deutscher for creating the “ myth ” of Trotsky as a great revolutionary , Marxist theoretician , military leader , political analyst , and opponent of the totalitarian bureaucracy .
The Thatcher - Swain biographies set out to create a new anti-Trotsky narrative , utilizing slanders and fabrications of old Stalinist vintage in the interest of contemporary anti-communism . ( 4 )
Now comes Robert Service ’s contribution to the on - going efforts to demolish Leon Trotsky ’s historical reputation .
In its pre-publication promotional material , the Harvard University Press proclaims : “ Although Trotsky ’s followers clung to the stubborn view of him as a pure revolutionary and a powerful intellect hounded into exile by Stalin , the reality is very different .
[ Service ’s ] illuminating portrait of the man and his legacy sets the record straight . ”
Does it really ?
Biography as Character Assassination
Trotsky : A Biography is a crude and offensive book , produced without respect for the most minimal standards of scholarship .
Service ’s “ research , ” if one wishes to call it that , has been conducted in bad faith .
His Trotsky is not history , but , rather , an exercise in character assassination .
Service is not content to distort and falsify Trotsky ’s political deeds and ideas .
Frequently descending to the level of a grocery store tabloid , Service attempts to splatter filth on Trotsky ’s personal life .
Among his favorite devices is to refer to “ rumors ” about Trotsky ’s intimate relations , without even bothering to identify the rumor ’s source , let alone substantiate its credibility .
Trotsky once declared , as he defended himself against the slanders of Stalin ’s regime : “ There is not a stain on my revolutionary honor . ”
Service , however , portrays Trotsky as an individual without any honor at all .
He attempts to discredit Trotsky not only as a revolutionary politician , but also as a man .
Service ’s Trotsky is a heartless and vain individual who used associates for his own egotistical purposes , a faithless husband who callously abandoned his wife , and a father who was coldly indifferent to his children and even responsible for their deaths .
“ People did not have to wait long before discovering how vain and self - centered he was , ” Service writes of Trotsky in a typical passage . [ 56 ]
Service ’s biography is loaded with such petty insults .
Trotsky was “ volatile and untrustworthy . ”
“ He was an arrogant individual ” who “ egocentrically assumed that his opinions , if expressed in vivid language , would win him victory . ”
“ His self - absorption was extreme .
As a husband he treated his first wife shabbily .
He ignored the needs of his children especially when his political interests intervened . ” [ 4 ]
Trotsky ’s intellectual and political life was , Service would have his readers believe , as shabby as his personal life .
Trotsky ’s “ lust for dictatorship and terror were barely disguised in the Civil War .
He trampled on the civil rights of millions of people including the industrial workers . ”
As for his subsequent political defeat , Service dismisses , without counter - argument , Trotsky ’s analysis of the growth of the Soviet bureaucracy and its usurpation of political power .
Service simply asserts , as if he were stating the obvious , that Trotsky “ lost to a man [ Stalin ] and a clique with a superior understanding of Soviet public life . ” [ 4 ]
According to Service , Trotsky was nothing more than a second - or third - rate thinker .
Trotsky , he writes , “ made no claim to intellectual originality : he would have been ridiculed if he had tried . ” [ 109 ]
“ Intellectually he flitted from topic to topic and felt no stimulus to systematize his thinking . ” [ 110 ]
Trotsky wrote quickly and superficially : “ He simply loved to be seated at a desk , fountain pen in hand , scribbling out the latest opus .
Nobody dared to disturb him when the flow of words was forming in his head . ” [ 319 ]
And what was the result of this “ scribbling ” ?
Service writes : “ His thought was a confused and confusing ragbag . ” [ 353 ]
“ He spent a lot of time in disputing , less of it in thinking .
Style prevailed over content … This involved an ultimate lack of seriousness as an intellectual . ” [ 356 ]
This is Service ’s verdict on the literary work of a man who must be counted among the greatest writers of the twentieth century . ( 5 )
A biographer need not like or even respect his subject .
No one would suggest that Ian Kershaw harbors the slightest sympathy for Adolf Hitler , to whose life he devoted two extraordinary volumes that were the product of many years of research .
However , whether a biographer admires , despises or feels a cool and detached ambivalence toward the object of his scholarly attention , he must respect the factual record and strive to understand that person .
The biographer has the responsibility to examine a life in the context of the conditions of the times in which his subject lived .
But this is beyond Service ’s intellectual capacities and the boundaries of his knowledge .
Instead , in a manner both pointless and absurd , he assumes from the outset the standpoint of a disapproving career counselor .
Trotsky , Service opines in the biography ’s introduction , “ could easily have achieved a great career as a journalist or essayist if politics had not become his preoccupation . ”
But Trotsky did choose a career in politics , and revolutionary politics at that , a decision that Service cannot abide or come to grips with .
Service describes his book as “ the first full - length biography of Trotsky written by someone outside Russia who is not a Trotskyist . ” [ xxi ]
What is meant by “ full - length ” ?
Service ’s biography is certainly long , plodding on for 501 pages .
But in terms of content , it is no more than a super - sized version of the biographies produced by Thatcher and Swain .
Like the earlier works , this is a biography without history .
There is not a single historical event that is recounted with anything remotely approaching the necessary level of detail .
Service reduces the immense and complex drama of the revolutionary epoch in Russia to a series of vacuous tableaux , which serve only as the scenic background for Service ’s ridicule of Trotsky ’s alleged political , personal and moral failures .
The coming to power of the Nazis in 1933 , the eruption of the Spanish Civil War and the formation of the Popular Front in France are dealt with in a few desultory sentences .
Even the Moscow Trials and the Terror merit little more than a page .
Far more attention is given by Service to Trotsky ’s brief intimacy with Frida Kahlo !
A Compendium of Errors
Moreover , the biography is full of factual errors that call attention to the author ’s extremely limited comprehension of the historical material .
In the course of a disoriented excursion into Trotsky ’s pre-1917 views on the subject of revolutionary terror , Service writes that Trotsky “ spoke out against ‘ individual terror ’ in 1909 when the Socialist - Revolutionaries murdered the police informer Evno Azev , who had penetrated their Central Committee . ” [ 113 ]
In fact , Azef ( the correct transliteration from the Russian spelling ) was not murdered in 1909 .
He was not murdered at all .
Azef , who had organized terrorist acts , including assassinations , while working as an agent of the Okhrana inside the Socialist Revolutionary Party , survived his exposure and died of natural causes in 1918 .
Service fails to quote even a single sentence from Trotsky ’s important article on the Azef affair .
Discussing the events of 1923 in Germany , Service asserts that the revolution failed after “ Street fighting petered out ” in Berlin . [ 31 ]
In fact , there was no fighting in Berlin .
The leadership of the Communist Party called off the uprising before fighting could begin in the capital .
The only serious fighting in a major German city occurred in Hamburg .
In a passing reference to the Chinese Revolution , Service states that the Communist International sent instructions for an insurrection against Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang in April 1927 .
“ It was just the excuse that Chiang needed to conduct a bloody suppression of communists in Shanghai and elsewhere . ” [ 355 ]
This is wrong .
No such plan existed and no such instructions were sent .
Service confuses the events in Shanghai in April 1927 with later developments in Canton .
In another passage , Service writes that in June 1928 Trotsky was working on his critique of the programme of the Comintern ’s Fifth Congress . [ 371 ]
Actually , the Fifth Congress was held in 1924 .
The critique to which Service is referring was addressed to the Sixth Congress .
Service even manages to get the year of the death of Trotsky ’s widow , Natalia Sedova , wrong .
He states , “ She died in 1960 , deeply mourned by her network of Mexican , French and American friends . ” [ 496 ]
In fact , Sedova died in January 1962 at the age of 79 .
Several months before her death , in November 1961 , as one would expect a biographer of Trotsky to know , Natalia Sedova had written to the Soviet government , demanding a review of the Moscow Trials and the rehabilitation of Trotsky .
At the end of the book , in yet another gross blunder , Service misidentifies the wife and daughter of Trotsky ’s youngest son , Sergei , as being the wife and daughter of the older son , Lev. [ 500 - 501 ]
These errors got by not only the editors at Macmillan and the Harvard University Press , but also eluded the none - too - watchful eye of Professor Ian Thatcher , who , we are informed by Service , read the entire manuscript .
Following the same procedure as Thatcher and Swain , Service fails to engage himself with Trotsky ’s writings .
With the exception of Trotsky ’s My Life , which Service attempts to discredit , there is no persuasive evidence that the biographer worked systematically through any of Trotsky ’s published books and pamphlets prior to writing this biography .
Aside from the writings of Ian Thatcher , whom he profusely praises , Service has paid little attention to existing scholarly literature on Trotsky .
Service affects an attitude of contempt toward biographers , educated in the Marxist tradition , who have taken Trotsky ’s literary output seriously .
The late Pierre Broué , a highly respected historian and the author of a massively researched and authoritative biography of Trotsky , is dismissed as an “ idolater . ”
Deutscher is mocked as one who “ worshipped at Trotsky ’s shrine . ” [ xxi ]
There is reason to doubt that Service actually read the work of most of the other historians to whom he pays perfunctory tribute in his preface .
For example , Service takes note of Professor Alexander Rabinowitch as a historian who subjected Trotsky to “ skeptical scrutiny , ” and lumps him together with James White of Glasgow University , who ridiculously denies that Trotsky played any significant role in the October 1917 seizure of power . [ xxi ]
In fact , Professor Rabinowitch ’s The Bolsheviks Come to Power substantiated Trotsky ’s role as the principal tactician and practical leader of the Bolshevik victory .
Despite Service ’s self - satisfied description of his biography as “ full - length , ” there are virtually no extracts from , or adequate summaries of , Trotsky ’s major political works .
Service does not even review the basic concepts and postulates of the Theory of Permanent Revolution , which formed the foundation of Trotsky ’s political work over a period of 35 years .
His voluminous writings on China , Germany , Spain , France and even Britain are barely mentioned .
On the few occasions when Service does refer to one of Trotsky ’s books , what he has to say is usually wrong .
In a thoroughly confused reference to Literature and Revolution , Service attributes to Trotsky the view that “ It would take many years … before a ‘ proletarian culture ’ would be widely achieved . ” [ 317 ]
Trotsky , as anyone who has actually read Literature and Revolution knows , emphatically rejected the concept of “ proletarian culture . ”
( 6 ) But Service does not know this – either because he did not read the book or because he was not able to understand it .
By now the reader must be wondering how Service , without paying attention to Trotsky ’s writings , manages to keep himself occupied for 501 pages .
How is it possible to write a “ full - length biography ” of a man who was among the most prolific writers of the twentieth century without paying the necessary attention to his literary output ?
Unearthing Trotsky ’s “ Buried Life ”
As if anticipating this question , Service informs his readers at the very outset that his central concern is not with what Trotsky wrote or actually did .
“ This book ’s purpose , ” Service writes , “ is to dig up the buried life . ”
He allows that “ the evidence starts with the works – his books , articles and speeches – which he published in his lifetime . ”
But that is not sufficient .
Even the study of all of Trotsky ’s writings would “ tell us about his big objectives without always elucidating his personal or factional purposes at any given moment .
As an active politician he could not always afford to spell out what he was up to . ” [ 4 - 5 ]
Service continues :
His written legacy should not be allowed to become the entire story .
It is sometimes in the supposedly trivial residues rather than in the grand public statements that the perspective of his career is most effectively reconstructed : his lifestyle , income , housing , family relationships , mannerisms and everyday assumptions about the rest of humanity .
…
As with Lenin and Stalin , moreover , it is as important to pinpoint what Trotsky was silent about as what he chose to speak or write about .
His unuttered basic assumptions were integral to the amalgam of his life .
[ Emphasis added , 5 ]
This statement is truly one with which Stalin , who was very careful not to tell other people what he really thought , could agree .
It is entirely in line with the inquisitorial principle employed by Stalin in the organization of the Moscow trials .
Evidence of crimes against the Soviet state was not to be found in the public statements , writings and deeds of the Old Bolshevik defendants .
Rather , their terrorist conspiracies flowed from the “ unuttered basic assumptions ” that had been camouflaged beneath the public record .
And how does Professor Service intend to ferret out Trotsky ’s “ unuttered basic assumptions ” ?
Service announces that Trotsky ’s “ buried life ” can be uncovered by examining unpublished early drafts of his writings .
“ The excisions and amendments tell us what he did not want others to know .
This is particularly true of his autobiography . ” [ 5 ]
This statement forms the basis of Service ’s major accusation against Trotsky : that his autobiography , My Life , which he wrote in 1930 , is an unreliable and suspect work .
Service complains that Trotsky ’s “ account of himself has been accepted uncritically by generations of readers .
The reality was different , for whenever inconvenient facts obscured his desired image he removed or distorted them . ” [ 11 ]
Trotsky ’s Embarrassments
And precisely what did Trotsky conceal or falsify in My Life ?
There are two major discrepancies that Service claims to have discovered when he compared the first draft of Trotsky ’s autobiography , which is deposited at Stanford University ’s Hoover Institute , with the published version .
The first is Trotsky ’s supposed efforts to conceal the extent of the wealth of his father , David Bronstein .
The second , to which Service devotes obsessive attention , is Trotsky ’s supposed attempts to downplay his Jewish origins .
Service writes :
As a Marxist he was embarrassed about the wealth of his parents , and he never properly acknowledged their extraordinary qualities and achievements .
What is more , the published account of his boyhood in his autobiography tended to drop those passages where he appeared timid or pampered ; and without denying his Jewish origin he trimmed back references to it .
By examining the drafts and proofs , we can catch glimpses of aspects of his upbringing that have long lain hidden .
Thus he stated publicly only that his father was a prosperous , competent farmer .
This hugely understated the reality .
David Bronstein , married to Aneta , was among the most dynamic farmers for miles around in Kherson province .
By hard work and determination he had dragged himself up the ladder of economic success and had every right to be proud of his achievement . ” [ 12 ]
Before answering Service ’s allegation that Trotsky downplayed his father ’s wealth and sought to conceal his ethnic and religious background , let us first draw attention to the dubious character of the underlying claim : that the progression of drafts to their completed form is best understood as a process of concealment and falsification .
Service asserts what he must first prove .
To support his charge , he would have to show why Trotsky ’s “ excisions and amendments ” should not be seen as the proper exercise of artistic discretion by a great master .
There are many reasons , which have nothing to do with the intention to conceal , why Trotsky may have removed certain passages and added others .
Service fails to provide a single example in which Trotsky ’s published account of his childhood differs in any material way from the earlier draft .
At any rate , Service ’s allegations are entirely without substance .
That Trotsky “ was embarrassed about the wealth of his parents ” is a claim for which Service can cite no authority other than his own imagination .
Trotsky ’s account traced his father ’s rising prosperity , though it must be pointed out that David Bronstein achieved significant wealth only well after Trotsky had left home .
The Bronstein family did not move from the mud house in which Trotsky was born into a house built with bricks until the future revolutionary was almost 17 years old .
But Trotsky provides in My Life a richly detailed and affectionate account of his father ’s relentless struggle to rise in the world and to accumulate wealth .
Writing of his own social position as a child , Trotsky stated : “ As son of a prosperous landowner , I belonged to the privileged class rather than to the oppressed . ”
[ My Life ( New York : Dover , 2007 ) , p. 87 ]
Max Eastman's
The Young Trotsky
Max Eastman ’s 1926 biographical account of Trotsky ’s early life states that David Bronstein “ got rich working and hiring the peasants to work with him .
He controlled almost three thousand acres of land around the little Ukrainian village of Ianovka , owned the mill , and was altogether the important man of the place . ”
Eastman knew these facts because Trotsky related them to him .
Eastman wrote , “ Trotsky is proud of his father , proud of the fact that he died working and understanding .
He loves to talk about him . ”
[ The Young Trotsky ( London : New Park , 1980 ) , p. 3 ]
Service ’s own account of the Bronstein family – whom he refers to as “ plucky Jews ” [ 14 ] – is based entirely on what was published in My Life and Eastman ’s Young Trotsky .
He has conducted no new and independent research that either adds to , or refutes , the information provided by Trotsky and Eastman .
There is not a single detail in Service ’s account of Trotsky ’s early childhood that cannot be traced back to these two earlier works .
Even more astonishing , in light of his claims to have exposed the untrustworthiness of Trotsky ’s autobiography , Service relies for his depiction of Trotsky ’s youth almost entirely on the published version of My Life , not on the earlier draft .
In the second chapter of his biography , entitled “ Upbringing , ” Service includes nine substantial extracts from Trotsky ’s autobiographical writing .
Eight of them are reproduced from the published version of My Life ; only one is from the earlier draft .
In not one instance is Service able to pinpoint an important discrepancy between the published work and the draft .
That does not mean that Service comes up entirely empty handed in his exploration of the draft version of My Life .
For example , he discovers that a young school friend whom Trotsky identifies as Carlson in the published edition of the autobiography was identified as “ Kreitser ” in the draft .
This discovery , proudly noted by Service in a footnote , must surely be counted as a major breakthrough in the field of Trotsky studies !
If he had accomplished nothing else , Service has , with one mighty footnote , restored young Kreitser ’s name to its proper place in history .
Trotsky ’s Origins
Trotsky as a boy
Let us now turn to Service ’s contention that Trotsky sought to downplay his Jewish ancestry .
There is , to be blunt , something rather unpleasant and suspect about Service ’s preoccupation with this matter .
The fact that Trotsky was a Jew occupies a central place in Service ’s biography .
It is never far from Service ’s mind .
He is constantly reminding his readers of this fact , as if he were worried that it might slip from their attention .
Indeed , given the emphasis placed on Trotsky ’s ethnicity , this book might have very well been titled , Trotsky : The Biography of a Jew .
Before we explore this disturbing element of Service ’s biography in greater detail , let us first respond to the allegation that Trotsky sought to conceal or deflect attention from his ancestry .
This claim is as false as the biographer ’s contention that Trotsky sought to downplay the wealth of his parents .
As always , Service assumes that his audience will never bother to read Trotsky ’s autobiography , in which Trotsky exhibits not the slightest reticence in discussing his ethnic and religious background .
And how could he have possibly avoided the subject ?
The circumstances of his childhood were inextricably intertwined with his Jewish ancestry .
Trotsky 's depiction of his Jewish background and its place in his intellectual and political development is entirely consistent with what is known of the broader Odessa - influenced social and cultural milieu within which he lived .
Trotsky writes candidly about the place of religion in the life of his family :
David Bronstein
… In my father ’s family there was no strict observation of religion .
At first , appearances were kept up through sheer inertia : on holy days my parents journeyed to the synagogue in the colony ; Mother abstained from sewing on Saturdays , at least within the sight of others .
But all this ceremonial observance of religion lessened as years went on – as the children grew up and the prosperity of the family increased .
Father did not believe in God from his youth , and in later years spoke openly about it in front of Mother and the children .
Mother preferred to avoid the subject , but when the occasion required would raise her eyes in prayer . ( 7 )
As for his own relation to his Jewish origins , Trotsky explained :
In my mental equipment , nationality never occupied an independent place , as it was felt but little in every - day life .
It is true that after the laws of 1881 , which restricted the rights of Jews in Russia , my father was unable to buy more land , as he was so anxious to do , but could only lease it under cover .
This , however , scarcely affected my own position .
As son of a prosperous landowner , I belonged to the privileged class rather than to the oppressed .
The language in my family and household was Russian - Ukrainian .
True enough , the number of Jewish boys allowed to join the school was limited to a fixed percentage on account of which I lost one year . ( 8 )
Trotsky reflected on the relation of his Jewish background to his intellectual development :
This national inequality probably was one of the underlying causes of my dissatisfaction with the existing order , but it was lost among all the other phases of social injustice .
It never played a leading part – not even a recognized one – in the list of my grievances . ( 9 )
The Torah and the Rabbi
Service is quite clearly dissatisfied with this explanation , which he does not even bother to quote .
He sets out to “ correct ” Trotsky ’s account by attempting to make the subject ’s life conform to the prejudices of the biographer .
This effort proves unfortunate for the credibility of Mr. Service .
In a key passage , which supposedly refutes My Life , Service writes that Trotsky
liked to give the impression that he was integrated into every common aspect of school activities .
This was not so .
St. Paul ’s , like all Imperial schools , had to teach religion .
Leiba Bronstein entered it as a Jew and did not convert to Christianity .
He had to continue his spiritual devotions under the guidance of a rabbi who taught the Jewish pupils , and David Bronstein paid for his services .
The rabbi in question failed to make clear whether the Torah was superb literature or holy writ – and Leiba was later to conclude that he really was an agnostic of some kind . [ 37 ]
This account is attributed by Service to Max Eastman ’s The Young Trotsky , which was published in 1926 .
But has Service been faithful to Eastman ’s narration ?
Let us take a look at the original text .
This is how Eastman tells this story :
It had been the ambition of his father ’s – as combining cultural elevation with a certain conventional piety – to have a private tutor read the Bible with his son in the original Hebrew .
Trotsky , being only eleven years old , was somewhat abashed before the bearded old scholar who undertook the task .
And the scholar , being old and full of his duty , was hesitant about unveiling his own critical views to so young a boy .
So it was not clear at first whether they were reading the Bible as history or as literature , or as the revealed word of God . ( 10 )
There is a quite noticeable difference between the two accounts .
Eastman ’s “ Bible ” becomes , in Service ’s account , the “ Torah . ” Eastman ’s “ bearded old scholar , ” who reveals himself to be an agnostic , is transformed by Service into a “ rabbi . ”
It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the text was , indeed , the Torah – though this word generally conveys a wider range of texts than that encompassed in the Pentateuch .
But as Service has no additional information to offer , beyond what Eastman wrote , what is the purpose of this change in wording ?
There is even less justification for Service ’s transformation of the old agnostic scholar into a rabbi .
It should be stressed that this is not a translation issue .
Service is referencing an English - language text .
It might be possible to dismiss this as nothing more than a careless exercise of authorial imagination but for the fact that Service ’s continuous harping on Trotsky ’s religious background is obsessive , obnoxious , and , in its cumulative impact , ugly .
He employs the suspect device of noting anti-Semitic attitudes and then proceeding to reinforce them .
The reader is offered such passages as the following on page 192 :
Russian anti-Semites had picked out Jews as a race without patriotic commitment to Russia .
By becoming the foreign minister for a government more interested in spreading world revolution than in defending the country ’s interests Trotsky was conforming to a widespread stereotype of the ‘ Jewish problem . ’ …
As things stood he had already become the most famous Jew on earth .
America ’s Red Cross leader in Russia , Colonel Raymond Robins , put this with characteristic pungency .
Talking to Robert Bruce Lockhart , head of the British diplomatic mission in Moscow , he described Trotsky as ‘ a four kind son of a bitch , but the greatest Jew since Christ . ’
Trotsky , furthermore , was merely the most famous Jew in a Sovnarkom where Jews were present to a disproportionate degree .
The same was true in the Bolshevik central party leadership .
If Lenin were to have dispensed with the services of talented Jews , he could never have formed a cabinet .
[ Emphasis added ]
Robert Service and the Jews
This passage is shortly followed by a chapter entitled “ Trotsky and the Jews , ” which begins : “ Trotsky hated it when people emphasized his Jewish background . ” [ 198 ]
This emotion may have had something to do with the type of people who were inclined to do the emphasizing .
There follow several pages of pointless and ridiculous observations .
On page 201 the reader is helpfully informed that “ Trotsky ’s rejection of Judaism by no means meant that he shunned individual Jews . ”
After naming a few of the Jews with whom Trotsky was on good terms ( all major figures in the Russian and European socialist movement ) , Service notes ( also on page 201 ) that “ Trotsky also had companions who were cosmopolitans without being Jews . ”
Trotsky , you see , “ spoke a lot with August Bebel , ” the founder - leader of the German Social Democratic Party .
The biographer allows that “ there was no trace of Judaism in Trotsky ’s adult lifestyle , ” although there were many “ secularized Jews [ who ] continued to observe religious food prohibitions and celebrate traditional feast days . ”
Service then proceeds to call his readers attention to the fact , in case they had not made the appropriate mental note , that Trotsky ’s four children – Nina , Zina , Lev and Sergei – “ were given names without association with Jewishness . ”
More important information follows on page 202 : Trotsky “ was brash in his cleverness , outspoken in his opinions .
No one could intimidate him .
Trotsky had these characteristics to a higher degree than most other Jews emancipated from the traditions of their religious community and the restrictions of the Imperial order .
He was manifestly an individual of exceptional talent .
But he was far from being the only Jew who visibly enjoyed the opportunities for public self - advancement .
In later years , they were to constitute a model for Jewish youth to follow in the world communist movement when , like communists of all nationalities , they spoke loudly and wrote sharply regardless of other people ’s sensitivities .
Trotsky can hardly be diagnosed as having suffered from the supposed syndrome of the self - hating Jew .
Hatred did not come into the matter .
He was too delighted with himself and his life to be troubled by embarrassments about his ancestry . ”
[ Emphasis added ]
Having suggested that Trotsky ’s revolutionary career was an example of Jews taking advantage of opportunities for “ public self - advancement , ” Service develops this idea in the next paragraph :
“ Trotsky was one of those tens of thousands of educated Jews in the Russian Empire who at last could assert themselves in situations where their parents had needed to bow and scrape before Gentile officialdom . ”
Many Jews , Service notes thoughtfully , sought advancement in respectable professions .
But “ the second route was to join the revolutionary parties where Jews constituted a disproportionate element . ”
This is a theory of well - known anti-Semitic parentage : revolution as a form of aggressively ambitious Jewish revenge against a society dominated by Christians .
But Service has still more to say on this subject .
He declares :
“ Young Jewish men and women , trained in the rigors of the Torah , found a congenial secular orthodoxy in Marxist intricacies .
Hair - splitting disputes were common to Marxism and Judaism ( as they were to Protestantism ) . ”
It is now possible to explain Service ’s previous twisting of the Eastman citation .
Trotsky , according to Service ’s distorted account , had also been trained in the “ rigors of the Torah . ”
From there , the reader is led to believe , it was only for the career - minded Bronstein a hop , skip and jump to Das Kapital , the Theory of Permanent Revolution , and a corner suite in the Kremlin .
Service , on page 205 , writes that : “ The party ’s leadership was widely identified as a Jewish gang . ”
No source is given for this statement .
He adds , a few sentences down , “ Jews indeed were widely alleged to dominate the Bolshevik party . ”
Again , there is no source provided for this allegation .
These allegations are not challenged , let alone refuted .
On the next page , 206 , Service reproduces a paragraph from an “ anonymous letter to Soviet authorities ” which is a wild anti-Semitic denunciation of “ full - blooded Jews who have given themselves Russian surnames to trick the Russian people . ”
In another bizarre passage , dealing with the famous negotiations conducted by Trotsky with representatives of Germany and Austria - Hungary at Brest - Litovsk in 1918 , Service writes : “ As the Germans and Austrians strode to the table for talks they expected to be treated with deference .
They acted as if victory was already theirs .
They shared the prejudices of their social class .
For them , socialists of any kind were hardly human .
Russian communists , who included so many Jews in their leadership , were little better than vermin . ” [ 197 ]
Service fails to provide a source for this assessment of the attitudes of the German delegates .
In his autobiography , Trotsky wrote : “ At Brest - Litovsk , the first Soviet delegation , headed by Joffe , was treated in a most ingratiating way by the Germans .
Prince Leopold of Bavaria received them as his ‘ guests . ’
All the delegations had dinner and supper together . ”
Trotsky noted with bemusement that “ General Hoffmann ’s staff was publishing a paper called Russky Vyestnik ( The Russian Messenger ) for the benefit of the Russian prisoners ; in its early phases it always spoke of the Bolsheviks with the most touching sympathy . ” ( 11 )
Naturally , this initial friendliness was politically motivated and did not last long .
The deadly seriousness of the issues that confronted the opposing parties at Brest - Litovsk inevitably found expression in the increasingly tense and confrontational atmosphere .
This process is depicted brilliantly by Trotsky in My Life .
His characterizations of his chief adversaries , Kühlmann , Hoffmann and Czernin , are true to life .
They are political reactionaries , representatives of the aristocratic elite , but not monsters .
Their attitude toward the Bolsheviks is a complex mixture of curiosity , bewilderment , fear , hatred and respect .
In Trotsky ’s account , there is no suggestion that he was dealing with men who viewed the Bolsheviks , with or without Jews , as “ vermin . ”
That thought belongs to Service , not to the leaders of the German and Austrian delegates at Brest - Litovsk .
For all Service ’s preoccupation with Trotsky ’s religion , his book is remarkably uninformed by any of the very serious and outstanding scholarship on the question of Jewish life and culture in Odessa and Imperial Russia .
The important works of Steven J. Zipperstein of Stanford University are not included in Service ’s bibliography .
There is nothing more than a fleeting reference to the bloody anti-Semitic pogroms that killed thousands .
Service does not even mention the infamous case of Mendel Beilis , the Jewish worker who was arrested in 1911 for the ritual murder of a Christian youth – a case that provoked international outrage against the tsarist regime .
Had he bothered to do so , Service might have taken note of Trotsky ’s important and influential essay on this case .
This reviewer wishes to register his disgust with Service ’s inclusion among the biography ’s illustrations , for no obvious reason , of a Nazi caricature of “ Leiba Trotzky - Braunstein . ”
The caption provided by Service states : “ In reality , his real nose was neither long nor bent and he never allowed his goatee to become straggly or his hair ill - kempt . ”
Did Service intend this as a joke ?
If so , it is in very bad taste .
What , then , should be made of Service ’s obsessive fixation with Trotsky ’s Jewish background ?
The use of anti-Semitism as a political weapon against Trotsky is so well known that it is impossible to believe that Service ’s incessant invocation of his subject ’s Jewish roots is innocent .
Whatever Mr. Service ’s personal attitude to what he refers to as “ the Jewish problem , ” he is all too obviously making an appeal precisely to anti-Semites for whom Trotsky ’s Jewish background is a major concern .
It is fairly certain that the Russian - language edition of this biography will find favor within this reactionary constituency .
One cannot help but suspect that Professor Service has taken this into consideration .
Service ’s Sources
A substantial portion of Service ’s book is devoted to the blackguarding of Trotsky ’s personality .
He extends his efforts to discredit Trotsky as a revolutionary politician to every aspect of his personal life .
Service seems to believe that the Theory of Permanent Revolution will be less persuasive if Trotsky can be shown to have been an unpleasant individual .
And so , Service ’s portrait of Trotsky never rises above the level of a vulgar caricature .
His subject is always impossibly vain , insensitive , domineering and egotistical .
Service is intent to show that these traits were already painfully apparent when Trotsky was still a teenager .
He relies entirely on the testimony of a single individual , Gregory A. Ziv , who first met Trotsky in the late 1890s during the first stages of his revolutionary activities .
Much later , in 1921 , after he had emigrated to the United States , Ziv wrote a bitter memoir which was extremely hostile to the former friend and comrade who had , in the meantime , become the world famous leader of the Russian Revolution .
No one would deny that Ziv ’s memoir is a document that any serious historian would consult in the preparation of a biography of Trotsky .
After all , Ziv knew Trotsky at a critical juncture in the life of the emerging revolutionary .
But a historian is obligated to approach documents and sources critically , to carefully consider the degree of trust that can be invested in the information they provide .
A highly critical approach is certainly warranted in the case of Ziv .
There are many reasons to doubt the objectivity and reliability of his evaluation of Trotsky ’s personality .
First and foremost , Ziv , after he arrived in the United States , became extremely hostile to Trotsky ’s stand on the imperialist war .
Ziv was a supporter of Russia ’s participation in the “ war for democracy . ”
This information is not given to the reader by Service .
But Max Eastman , who was familiar with Ziv ’s memoir , offered the following background information :
When Trotsky came to New York [ in January 1917 ] during [ the ] war – anti-patriot , anti-war , revolutionist – he met Doctor Ziv , who he knew had been publishing a little pro-war paper there in the Russian language .
He met him most cordially ; and wishing to remember the friendly emotions of these earlier days , he invited him to his house .
They talked long and drifted back to the mood of their recollections .
But Trotsky , knowing that Ziv could teach him nothing and that he could convince Ziv of nothing , refrained from opening the political question .
It was characteristically courteous , and a very friendly , exercise of judgment .
But to the doctor ’s editorial vanity it seemed to have been an unendurable offense , the manifestation of a self - seeking intellectual arrogance which he suddenly discovered had characterized his friend ’s activities from the cradle .
Hence this little volume of weak and ludicrous personal spite . ( 12 )
Prosecutors are legally obligated to make exculpatory evidence available to the defense .
Following this general principle , a biographer should not conceal from his readers information that calls into question the credibility of the witness whose testimony he is citing .
But Service is indifferent to such principled considerations .
While insisting that Trotsky ’s memoirs must be subjected to the most skeptical scrutiny , Service shows absolutely no inclination to question anything written by Ziv in his memoir .
And so he quotes Ziv ’s statement that Trotsky “ loved his friends and he loved them sincerely ; but his love was of the kind that a peasant has for his horse , which assists in the confirmation of his peasant individuality . ” [ 46 ]
This observation makes so deep an impression on Service that he repeats it : “ Lëva looked on his revolutionary comrades as the peasant regarded his horse … ” [ 46 ]
What intelligent reader would believe such nonsense ?
Enter Schopenhauer
Another claim by Ziv that Service seizes upon concerns the influence of a pamphlet by Artur Schopenhauer , the 19th century German idealist philosopher , upon the young Trotsky .
Service does not actually provide an extract from this passage , but presents only a summary .
For the purpose of clarifying this issue , which sheds light on Service ’s method , this reviewer has consulted Ziv ’s original text .
In his memoir Ziv devotes slightly more than one paragraph to this question .
He notes that Schopenhauer ’s pamphlet “ somehow fell into his [ Trotsky ’s ] hands , ” and then offers a brief summary of the philosopher ’s argument .
The purpose of the pamphlet is to teach “ how to vanquish one ’s opponent in debate , regardless of whether one was actually correct or not . ”
The pamphlet , according to Ziv , “ does not teach rules which must be followed in conducting a debate , but rather exposes devices – more or less crude , or more or less subtle – to which debaters resort in order to be victorious in a debate . ”
Then , in a somewhat surprising admission , Ziv indicates that he does not have any precise information on the impact of the pamphlet on his friend .
He writes : “ One can imagine how Bronstein was overjoyed by this small pamphlet that by no means was less valuable for its small size . ”
Yes , many things can be imagined , but that does not make them true .
Ziv ’s wording suggests that he did not have any direct evidence that the work made a great impression on Trotsky .
He did not write , for example , “ Bronstein told me that he was overjoyed by this pamphlet … ”
If Mr. Ziv was giving sworn testimony , as a witness for the prosecution , the defense attorney would question him carefully on this point .
Indeed , after noting that Ziv acknowledges that he does not even know how Trotsky obtained the pamphlet , he would probably ask : “ Mr. Ziv , do you really know for sure that Trotsky ever read the Art of Controversy ?
Did you ever actually witness him reading the book ? ”
As a matter of fact , based on what Ziv wrote , we cannot know for sure whether Trotsky did read The Art of Controversy .
But the answer to this question is , for the purpose of evaluating this biography , less important than Service ’s failure to question Ziv ’s claims .
Quite the opposite .
Service goes far beyond the claims of Ziv .
He writes , “ Lëva prepared himself as if for a military campaign .
He scrutinized Schopenhauer ’s The Art of Controversy with the purpose of improving his debating skills . ” [ 45 ]
In fact , as we have shown , Service does not have the evidence to support this claim .
Why is this matter important ?
Service implies that Schopenhauer ’s arguments provide a key to understanding the development of not only Trotsky ’s polemical style , but also his allegedly aggressive and domineering personality .
Roaming far from Ziv ’s actual text and offering his own bowdlerized interpretation of Schopenhauer , Service misrepresents the philosopher as an advocate of an array of unscrupulous debating ploys and tricks .
“ Victory , crushing victory , ” declaims Service , “ was the only worthwhile objective . ”
The philosopher , according to Service , “ went on to declare that the ideas of ‘ ordinary people ’ counted for nothing . ” [ 45 ]
Service finally declares : “ Schopenhauer did not belong to the regular armature of Russian revolutionary thought , and Lëva Bronstein did not openly acknowledge his influence on his techniques of argument .
Yet he probably found much that he needed for his politics and personality in The Art of Controversy . ” [ 45 , Emphasis added ]
So , in the end , what are we really left with ?
Service ’s claim that Trotsky discovered in Schopenhauer a philosophical justification for his alleged contempt for humanity and poisonous polemics is based on assumptions , suppositions and guesses unsupported by facts .
If we assume , for the sake of argument , that Trotsky read – nay , studied with great care – Schopenhauer ’s Art of Controversy , that does not tell us whether he agreed or disagreed with it ; what he accepted and what he rejected .
Trotsky read many things as a youth , including , as he tells us in My Life , the writings of John Stuart Mill .
Yet no one would accuse Trotsky of being an admirer of British empiricism and liberalism .
Finally , Service seems to assume that Trotsky ’s alleged study of The Art of Controversy could only have had malign consequences .
In the opinion of this reviewer , it is more likely that Trotsky , if he had read The Art of Controversy , might have found in this pamphlet material that proved later to be of assistance in exposing the calumnies , distortions , half - truths and lies of his many unscrupulous enemies .
Indeed , one suspects that Stalinism taught Trotsky far more than Schopenhauer on the subject of dishonest polemics .
Trotsky and Sokolovskaya
The relentless efforts to malign Trotsky backfire , and cast Service himself in a very unflattering light .
He appears to be organically incapable of feeling any sympathy whatever for the many emotional injuries and traumas endured by his subject in the course of a life dedicated – or , to use the words of his first love and wife , Alexandra Sokolovskaya , consecrated – to the revolutionary cause .
Even when dealing with the plight of the 19 - year - old Lev Davidovich , imprisoned and in solitary confinement , Service ’s attitude is contemptuous and sneering .
For example , he quotes from a deeply moving letter that Trotsky wrote to Sokolovskaya in November 1898 .
The young man is consumed by loneliness and suffers from insomnia .
He confesses that he has contemplated suicide , but then reassures Alexandra that he is “ extraordinarily tied to life . ”
And what is the response of Robert Service ?
He writes : “ There was showiness and immaturity in these sentiments .
He was a self - centered young man . ” [ 52 ]
Eventually Trotsky and Sokolovskaya marry and are sent into Siberian exile .
They have two children .
Trotsky ’s reputation as a brilliant young writer brings him to the attention of the major leaders of Russian socialism .
Anxious to expand the scope of his activity in the revolutionary movement , the young man resolves to escape from Siberian exile .
In his autobiography , Trotsky writes that Sokolovskaya encouraged him in this decision .
But Service , without presenting any evidence that contradicts Trotsky ’s narrative , declares : “ This is hard to take at face value .
Bronstein was planning to abandon her in the wilds of Siberia .
She had no one to look after her , and she had to care for two tiny babies on her own with winter coming on . ”
Service brings his diatribe to a climax with an utterly vulgar comment : “ No sooner had he fathered a couple of children than he decided to run off .
Few revolutionaries had left such a mess behind them . ” [ 67 ]
Service , contradicting himself , concedes that Trotsky “ was acting within the revolutionary code of behavior . ” [ 67 ]
But he then asserts , “ Even if Alexandra really did give her consent , Lev showed little appreciation of the sacrifice he had asked of her .
‘ Life , ’ he said as if it were a simple matter of fact , ‘ separated us . ’
In reality , he had chosen to separate himself from his marital and parental responsibilities . ” [ 67 ]
Aside from the libelous character of this allegation , contradicted by everything that is known about the realities of revolutionary struggle , it is hard to imagine a more anachronistic approach to the writing of history .
Service presumes to judge the behavior of revolutionaries in late 19th century Russia , who were engaged in a struggle to the death against the tsarist autocracy , with the hypocritical standards of a wealthy , conservative and self - satisfied upper - middle class philistine in modern - day Britain .
Trotsky with his daughter ZIna in 1915
Let us , by the way , note that Service cuts off Trotsky ’s sentence before its conclusion .
“ Life separated us , ” Trotsky wrote , “ but nothing could destroy our friendship and our intellectual kinship . ” ( 13 )
The enduring character of the profound friendship and mutual solidarity of Trotsky and Sokolovskaya was confirmed by the latter in discussions with Eastman in the 1920s .
Alexandra never betrayed that friendship , for which she ultimately paid with her life .
Stalin murdered her in 1938 .
Service makes this cold and contemptuous comment on her tragic fate : “ Her troubles started with a short - lived marriage contracted to keep her and Trotsky together in Siberia – and it was in Siberia that she finally expired . ” [ 431 ]
Service ’s treatment of the tragic fate of Trotsky ’s daughter Zina , who committed suicide in Berlin in January 1933 , is callous and malicious .
He writes , “ Trotsky coped with the tragedy by blaming everything on Stalin and his treatment of her . ”
He continues :
This accusation , frequently repeated in accounts of Trotsky , was ill aimed .
Zina had spent all the time she had wanted in Sukhum ; it had been Trotsky who summoned her abroad and not Stalin who had deported her – and it had been Trotsky with whom she wanted to live .
Trotsky ’s attempt to politicize the death was not his finest moment . [ 386 ]
Service chooses not to quote from the letter Trotsky wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on January 11 , 1933 , less than a week after his daughter ’s suicide .
He does not inform his readers that Zina was unable to return to Russia , where her husband , daughter and mother still lived , because the Stalinist regime had revoked her Soviet citizenship .
As Trotsky wrote , “ Depriving her of her citizenship was only a wretched and stupid act of vengeance against me . ” ( 14 )
Determined to discredit Trotsky in any way possible , Service absolves the Stalinist regime of any responsibility for the death of his daughter .
And this is despite the fact , as Service knows full well , that Stalin would , within just a few years , murder Trotsky ’s first wife , his sons , his brothers and his sister , and even his in - laws .
A Shameful Episode
Despite the considerable length of this review , it has left much unsaid .
A comprehensive refutation of all of Service ’s distortions and misrepresentations would easily assume the size of a substantial book .
This reviewer will leave for another time the exposure of Service ’s political falsifications as well as his persistent defense of Stalin against Trotsky .
In this regard , another important issue that remains to be explored is the significance of the Trotsky biographies of Thatcher , Swain and Service as manifestations of the confluence of neo-Stalinist falsification and traditional Anglo - American anti-Communism .
Indeed , a striking feature of the on - going campaign against Trotsky is the degree to which it draws upon the lies and frame - ups of the Stalinists .
There is one final issue that needs to be raised , and that is the role of Harvard University Press in publishing this biography .
One can only wonder why it has allowed itself to be associated with such a deplorable and degraded work .
It is difficult to believe that Service ’s manuscript was subjected to any sort of serious editorial review .
There are still , or so one would like to believe , professors in Harvard ’s Department of History who can distinguish serious scholarship from trash .
There was a time when Harvard was justly proud of its role as archivist of the closed section of Trotsky ’s papers , which it guarded under lock and key – in accordance with the instructions of Trotsky and Natalia Sedova – for nearly 40 years .
The Houghton Library considered these papers to be among its historically significant collections .
In 1958 , Harvard , on its own initiative , published the diary that Trotsky kept in 1935 .
The publisher ’s foreword noted respectfully that Trotsky “ is to many today one of the heroes of our time . ”
A half - century later , it provides its imprimatur for a slanderous and slovenly work .
Is Harvard today , in a period of political reaction and intellectual decay , atoning for its earlier displays of principles and scholarly integrity ?
Whatever the reason , Harvard University Press has brought shame upon itself .
One suspects that at some point in the future , with the recovery of morale and courage , it will look back upon this episode with great regret .

5 . It should be noted that Service hews closely to the line developed previously by Geoffrey Swain , who complained that Trotsky has been viewed as “ a far greater thinker than he was in reality .
Trotsky wrote an enormous amount and , as a journalist , he was always happy to write on subjects about which he knew very little . ” [ 3 ]
It must be also be noted that Service , in his 2004 biography of Stalin , dealt far more respectfully with the Soviet dictator and mass murderer .
“ Stalin was a thoughtful man , ” Service wrote , “ and throughout his life tried to make sense of the universe as he found it .
He had studied a lot and forgotten little . …
He was not an original thinker nor an outstanding writer .
Yet he was an intellectual to the end of his days . ”
See Fred Williams ’ review of Service ’s Stalin : A Biography in the World Socialist Web Site. [ return ]
6 . In opposition to the proponents of “ Proletcult ” in the early 1920s , Trotsky argued that the proletariat , as an oppressed class , cannot create its own culture .
The culture of the future , which will emerge on the basis of a far higher development of the productive forces , when there is no need for a class dictatorship , “ will not have a class character .
This seems to lead to the conclusion that there is no proletarian culture and that there never will be any and in fact there is no reason to regret this .
The proletariat acquires power for the purpose of doing away forever with class culture and to make way for human culture .
We frequently seem to forget this . ”

Joe Rao snapped these images of the after - effects of a single Leonid meteor on Nov. 17 , 1996 from Brodheadsville , PA .
His Nikormatte Camera was aimed toward the " W " of Cassiopeia .
He was not quick enough to snap the cable release when a brilliant fireball streaked through the sky , but this train lasted more than 5 minutes .
The first image was taken about 15 seconds after the fireball appeared .
The second image was made about 1 minute after the fireball appeared , and the last image was made 5 minutes after the meteor first showed up .
Wind in the upper atmosphere distorted the trail .
When people hear about an impending meteor shower , their first impression may be of a sky filled with shooting stars pouring down through the sky like rain .
Such meteor storms have actually occurred with the annual Leonid meteor shower of November , such as in 1833 and 1966 , when meteor rates of literally tens of thousands per hour were observed .
In more recent years , most notably 1999 , 2001 and 2002 , lesser Leonid displays of up to a few thousand meteors per hour thrilled skywatchers .
This year will be not set any records , but the Leonids – set to peak early Tuesday morning , Nov. 17 – should offer a better - than - average display .
Tricky forecasting
The Leonid meteors are debris shed into space by Comet Tempel - Tuttle , which swings through the inner solar system at intervals of 33.25 years , looping around the sun then heading back into the outskirts of the solar system .
With each visit the comet leaves behind a trail of dust in its wake .
Plenty of the comet's old dusty trails litter the mid-November part of Earth 's orbit and the Earth glides through this debris zone every year .
But predicting exactly what 's out there is tricky .
On special occasions we 'll pass directly through an unusually concentrated dust trail , or filament , which can spark a meteor storm resulting in thousands of meteors per hour .
That indeed is what transpired in 1999 , 2001 and 2002 .
Since Comet Tempel - Tuttle comet passed near the sun ( and in doing so crossed Earth 's orbit ) in 1998 , it was in those years immediately following its passage that the Leonids put on their best show .
But the comet has since receded out to some 1.8 billion miles ( 2.9 billion km. ) from the sun , having taken most of those dense filaments of dust with it .
That 's why this year , during the predawn hours of Nov. 17 , when the Leonids traditionally should be at their most numerous , we now expect to see no more than 10 meteors per hour , even with the promise of this year 's excellent viewing conditions thanks to a New moon .
Still – for some parts of the world , a far more prolific Leonid show could be in the offing this year .
For although Comet Tempel - Tuttle is now far removed from the inner solar system , independent studies by several noted meteor scientists suggest that the Earth will pass through several notable trails of meteor activity in 2009 .
We 'll list these encounters below in chronological order , including the prime regions of visibility .
Nov. 17 , early a.m. , Europe , western Africa / North America
The first cloud of comet dust was released from the nucleus of Tempel - Tuttle back in the year 1567 .
North America will be turned toward the constellation Leo when these particles begin pelting the upper layers of our atmosphere , some 80 to 100 miles ( 130 to 160 km . ) above us .
Earth 's encounter with the comet dust is going to be brief – possibly no more than several hours long .
Unfortunately , we wo n't be going directly through the center of cloud , but rather skim through its outer edge on Nov. 17 , chiefly between about 4:30 and 10:30 GMT .
As a consequence , the meteor rate is not expected to get much higher than 20 or 30 per hour ( on average about one meteor sighting every two or three minutes ) .
Still , this is about two to three times the normal Leonid rate .
At the beginning of this window , it will still be dark across Europe and western Africa with Leo high up in the southeast sky , but within an hour the sky will be brightening as sunrise approaches , soon putting an end to meteor watching .
North Americans – especially those living near and along the Atlantic Seaboard – will be able to watch for Leonids from after 1 a.m. local time right on until the first light of dawn , which comes soon after 5 a.m. local time .
Those in the eastern U.S. and Canada are especially favored because Leo will be high in the southeast sky between 3:30 and 5:30 a.m. EST , just before Earth is expected to exit the meteor cloud .
For the West Coast , this translates to 12:30 to 2:30 a.m. PST , when Leo is much lower down in the eastern sky .
From Hawaii , Leo will be coming up above the east - northeast horizon right around the time that Earth is exiting the meteor cloud ( 12:30 a.m. Hawaii Time ) .
However . . . this circumstance could lead to the appearance of a few long - trailed Earth - grazing meteors , due to meteoroids that skim along a path nearly parallel to Earth 's surface .
Although the overall meteor numbers are expected to be modest at best , the particles that produce them might be larger than the usual flecks of dust that comprise the Leonid swarm .
Recall that this cloud of comet particles was released into space in 1567 .
When such " comet bits " circle the sun for many hundreds of years , the tinier ( dust grain ) material tends to be pushed away from the sun and dispersed by the pressure of solar radiation .
Conversely , because they are relatively unaffected by radiation pressure and leave the comet nucleus with less velocity than their smaller brethren do , the larger pebble - to - marble sized particles tend to linger for a much longer time .
The result could be meteors that are predominantly bright .
Watch for the possibility of catching sight of a fireball or bolide ( a meteor that silently explodes like a strobe along its path ) .
About half might leave luminous trains lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes .
Indeed , catching sight of even one such meteor will make the vigil of a cold November night worthwhile !
Nov. 18 early a.m. , Asia / India / Indonesia
The " Main Event " in 2009 is expected to take place when the Earth has rotated about 12 to 14 hours after passing through the first round of comet dust from 1567 .
Astronomers Jeremie Vaubaillon ( France ) , Mikhail Maslov ( Russia ) , David Asher ( Ireland ) , and Bill Cooke and Danielle Moser ( NASA 's Meteoroid Environment Office / MEO ) are all in agreement that material that was ejected from the nucleus of Tempel - Tuttle during the years 1466 and 1533 will likely produce a very strong meteor display over much of Asia , India and Indonesia .
There is a high level of confidence that an outburst of bright meteors will occur .
This is based mainly on the fact that last year , Earth encountered material that was shed by the comet in 1466 produced about 100 Leonids per hour .
This year , Earth will cross through that same 1466 stream again , but much closer to the center of that particular comet cloud .
In addition , at about the same time , the Earth will also be passing through dust ejected by the comet in 1533 .
The consensus forecast among the astronomers for this year suggests rates of anywhere from 130 to perhaps 300 Leonids per hour , but trying to hash out a specific number when two different streams literally coalesce with each other makes a forecast much more difficult to make ; it could even be less or it could be much more .
The Earth is expected to pass through the densest parts of the two dust clouds at around 21:40 GMT on Nov. 17 , though heavy meteor activity is possible for about an hour or two on either side of this time .
From much of Asia , India and Indonesia , the corresponding calendar date will be Nov. 18 .
It will be 12:40 a.m. in Moscow ; 3:10 a.m. in Mumbai ; 4:40 a.m. in Jakarta and 5:40 a.m. in Beijing , Unfortunately from Tokyo and across Australia , the sun will have already risen , effectively hiding the meteor outburst .
Conversely , from Europe it will be after sunset on Tuesday evening , but although it will be nighttime , Leo will have not yet risen above the horizon , so the outburst will not visible .
Nov. 18 predawn hours , Europe / western and central Africa
As a late addition , Jeremie Vaubaillon also suggests that some Leonid activity " might " be generated by a very old trail of comet debris dating back to the year 1102 .
This material , however , is more than 900 years old and has made no less than 27 revolutions around the sun .
As a result , it could very well be almost completely dispersed and not provide any activity at all .
But at 3:29 GMT on Nov. 18 , Earth will pass within 30,000 mi. ( 48,000 km ) of the center of this trail .
" The position of this very old trail is highly uncertain , " notes Vaubaillon , " but if confirmed it may produce a noticeable activity .
As a consequence , any event related to this one is highly valuable . "
Europeans , as well as western and central Africa are in the best viewing position should there be anything to see .
Preparing for your meteor watch
No two observers prepare for a meteor vigil the same way .
It helps to have had a late afternoon nap , a shower , and to wear all fresh clothing .
Be sure to keep this in mind : at this time of year , meteor watching can be a long , cold business .
Expect the ambient air temperature to be far below what your local radio or TV weathercaster predicts .
Watching a meteor shower consists of lying back , looking up at the sky . . . and waiting .
When you sit quite still , close to the rapidly cooling ground , you can become very chilled .
You wait and you wait for meteors to appear .
When they do n't appear right away , and if you 're cold and uncomfortable , you 're not going to be looking for meteors for very long !
Therefore , make sure you 're warm and comfortable .
Heavy blankets , sleeping bags , groundcloths , auto cushions , and pillows are essential equipment .
Warm cocoa or coffee can take the edge off the chill , as well as provide a slight stimulus .
It 's even better if you can observe with friends .
That way , you can keep each other awake , as well as cover more sky .
Keep in mind that any local light pollution or obstructions like tall trees or buildings will reduce your making a meteor sighting .
Give your eyes time to dark - adapt before starting .
Probably the best bet is to rest on a lawn lounge , all the way back , so you can look up and see the whole sky .
When you see a streak , mentally run it backwards across the sky .
Do the same with the second and third and note where their paths cross .
Right there will be the Sickle of Leo , and that 's where the Leonid radiant will be .
The constellation of Leo does not come fully into view above the east - northeast horizon until after 1 a.m. local time , so that would be the best time to concentrate on looking for Leonids .
Lastly , because the Leonids are moving along in their orbit around the sun in a direction opposite to that of Earth , they slam into our atmosphere nearly head - on , resulting in the fastest meteor velocities possible : 45 miles ( 72 km ) per second .
Such speeds tend to produce meteors with hues of white , blue , aquamarine and even green .

Social networks : Data recorded - but not content The Home Office says it will push ahead with plans to ask communications firms to monitor all internet use .
Ministers confirmed their intention despite concerns and opposition from some in the industry .
The proposals include asking firms to retain information on how people use social networks such as Facebook .
Some 40 % of respondents to the Home Office 's consultation opposed the plans - but ministers say communication interception needs to be updated .
Both the police and secret security services have legal powers in the UK to intercept communications in the interests of combating crime or threats to national security .
But the rules largely focus on communications over telephones and do not cover the whole range of internet communications now being used .
The Home Office says it wants to change the law to compel communication service providers ( CSPs ) to collect and retain records of communications from a wider range of internet sources , from social networks through to chatrooms and unorthodox methods , such as within online games .
Ministers say that they do not want to create a single government - owned database and only intend to ask CSPs to hold a record of a contact , rather than the actual contents of what was said .
Technically challenging Police and other agencies would then be able to ask CSPs for information on when a communication was sent and between whom .
REASONS TO CHANGE WHAT DATA CAN BE KEPT
More communication via computers rather than phones Companies wo n't always keep all data all the time Anonymity online masks criminal identities
More online services provided from abroad Data held in many locations and difficult to find Source : Home Office consultation
In theory , law enforcement agencies will be able to link that information to specific devices such as an individual 's smartphone or laptop .
The proposals are technically challenging , as they would require a CSP to sort and organise all third - party traffic coming and going through their systems .
The estimated £ 2bn bill for the project includes compensation for the companies involved .
Home Office minister David Hanson said : " Communications data is crucial to the fight against crime and in keeping people safe .
It is a highly technical area and one which demands a fine balance between privacy and maintaining the capabilities of the police and security services .
" The consultation showed widespread recognition of the importance of communications data in protecting the public and an appreciation of the challenges which rapidly changing technology poses .
" We will now work with communications service providers and others to develop these proposals , and aim to introduce necessary legislation as soon as possible . "
Opposition and concern
The consultation results reveal that 90 of the 221 responses opposed the basic principles that the government should be seeking a method to retain or look at the data .
The Home Office said that there was a " widespread but not unanimous " recognition of the role of data in protecting the public .
But many concerns related to the detail of what would be done with the information .
Christopher Graham , the Information Commissioner responsible for overseeing the protection of private information , told the Home Office that while he recognised that the police needed to use communication data to stop crime , this in itself was not a justification to collect all possible data passing through the internet .
" The proposal represents a step change in the relationship between the citizen and the state , " said Mr Graham .
" For the first time , this proposal is asking CSPs to collect and create information they would not have previously held and to go further in conducting additional processing on that information .
" Evidence for this proposal must be available to demonstrate that such a step change is necessary and proportionate . "

( As always , China looks at things a teensy bit differently than we do )
I 've been working on getting a world overview of the Healthcare situation .
Earlier this week I ran a debate over Health Care in Australia , hearing about issues we only hear rumors about .
I kept wondering if in fact , the U.S. was the only country in the civilized ( or even semi- civilized ) world that did n't have some form of National Health , even as an option to private insurance .
Hard to believe , but it 's true - we are completely backwards in our relationships to health and healthcare .
Thanks to the BBC , I was able to locate a documentary done in 2008 which asked that very question - and did some exploring in Britain , the U.S. and China and came back with some interesting and very informative answers .
John McDonough ( Director : Health Care For All ) : “ All of the incentives , right now in our system reward Health Care providers for the volume of services they provide .
So you get more money by doing more and more and more at a higher technological level .
And we know the real secret comes from doing the lower complexity level of care much better than what ’s being now .
So all the rewards come from more procedures .
And the more talking you do , the more time you waste and the less money you make .
The incentives are completely upside down ” .
The one thing I have noticed that 's most disturbing about the current Health Care debate is the total lack of knowledge of what the issues and what the alternatives are .
Clearly , ignorance is far from bliss and finding out how the vast majority of people on this planet handle things like doctor visits and emergencies is absolutely imperative if we 're going to make crucial choices .
Having ignorant people dangle the fear card in front of you does n't do you or anyone else any good .
Useful , factual information and knowledge of something your life and peace of mind depends on may save your ass in the long run .
Call it sanctuary on wheels : San Francisco is about to give a big break to people , many of them illegal immigrants , who are caught driving without a license .
Beginning Sunday , cops will no longer impound cars the first time drivers are pulled over without a license .
The reason : Many such drivers are in the United States illegally - and thus unable to get a license - and the officials pushing the change think that impounding their cars is an unfair hardship .
Instead , unlicensed drivers will be given 20 minutes to phone a relative or other acquaintance with a valid license and insurance to pick up the car .
If the driver does n't have a cell phone , police will help him contact someone .
If no one shows up , then the cop is to call a supervisor to approve the tow .
A second offense within six months means an automatic tow .
But , for those who stay clean for half a year , the clock starts over .
The change means San Francisco will be far more accommodating to unlicensed drivers than police in Oakland , San Jose and even lefty Berkeley .
Cops in all those cities impound the cars of people driving illegally .
Recently installed Police Chief George Gascón said San Francisco is " trying to be sensitive to all of the communities we serve . "
" We recognize that this is a problem within the Hispanic community , where people working here can't get a driver 's license because of their immigration status , " Gascón said .
The 30 - day car impounds have long been a sore point with the city 's Latino politicos and activists , who feel the practice is unfair .
Some police officers we spoke with , however , said people without licenses are often lousy drivers - and that the change means more dangerous streets for everyone else .
" These are the same people who are sailing through stop signs and injuring people , " said one traffic cop who asked not to be named for fear of retribution .
Gascón emphasized that unlicensed drivers " will still be cited .
If they do n't learn their lesson and repeat offend , the car will be impounded . "
The chief said the change was already in the works when he came to town at the end of July .
He said it had sprung from conversations between Mayor Gavin Newsom , Supervisor David Campos - who arrived here illegally from Guatemala at age 14 - and former Police Chief Heather Fong .
Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard - whose boss is refusing to implement Campos - backed legislation barring the city from turning over illegal immigrant youths to the feds if they have n't been convicted of a felony - confirmed that when it comes to giving unlicensed drivers a break , the mayor and the supe agree .
" On this one , we 're all on the same page , " Ballard said .
Do n't do it :
We know one group dead set against extending San Francisco 's parking meter hours into the night - the people who hand out parking tickets .
" It would n't be safe , " said Dominic Garrett , the steward for the union representing the city 's 283 parking control officers .
" We already feeling the anger over $ 55 tickets , and now they would have us out until midnight ? "
Garrett asked .
" With no backup ? "
Growth industry :
With the feds announcing a new , go - light policy on medical marijuana , Oakland City Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan is ready to take the next step - the legalization , regulation and taxation of grow houses in the city .
For years , grow houses and warehouse operations , with their illegal and unsafe wiring , have been the bane of police and fire departments .
Kaplan says it could all be changed .
" We could set them up in the city 's industrialized zones in East Oakland and along ( Interstate ) 880 , " Kaplan said .
She notes that there are lots of empty warehouses with the space and electrical capacity for large - scale cultivation of marijuana .
Kaplan is no stranger to the marijuana debate .
She was a key backer of Measure F , the initiative approved by voters in July that substantially increased the city 's cut of medical marijuana sales .
Now she 's ready for phase two : expanding the number of pot dispensaries in Oakland and setting up legal grow operations to keep them supplied .
" There would be a system of permits , planning and safety codes to be followed , " Kaplan said .
" And , of course , we 'd tax them . "
Of course we would .
Green to green : OK , so being a good citizen , you put all your coffee grinds and food scraps into the green compost can - where does it go from there ?
Recology - the new name of San Francisco 's garbage company - trucks the muck up to Vacaville in biodiesel trucks ( of course ) to a processing plant .
After two or three months , it turns to mulch and is sold to farms , vineyards , golf courses or anyone else who wants it , for $ 25 a ton .

Many commentators have already pointed out dozens of misquotes , misrepresentations and mistakes in the ‘ Global Cooling ’ chapter of the new book SuperFreakonomics by Ste[ ph|v]ens Levitt and Dubner ( see Joe Romm ( parts I , II , III , IV , Stoat , Deltoid , UCS and Paul Krugman for details .
Michael Tobis has a good piece on the difference between adaptation and geo- engineering ) .
Unfortunately , Amazon has now turned off the ‘ search inside ’ function for this book , but you can read the relevant chapter for yourself here ( via Brad DeLong ) .
However , instead of simply listing errors already found by others , I ’ll focus on why this chapter was possibly written in the first place .
( For some background on geo- engineering , read our previous pieces : Climate Change methadone ?
and Geo-engineering in vogue , Also the Atlantic Monthly “ Re-Engineering the Earth ” article had a lot of quotes from our own Raypierre ) .
Paul Krugman probably has the main issue right :
… it looks like is that Levitt and Dubner have fallen into the trap of counterintuitiveness .
For a long time , there ’s been an accepted way for commentators on politics and to some extent economics to distinguish themselves : by shocking the bourgeoisie , in ways that of course are n’t really dangerous .
and
Clever snark like this can get you a long way in career terms — but the trick is knowing when to stop .
It ’s one thing to do this on relatively inconsequential media or cultural issues .
But if you ’re going to get into issues that are both important and the subject of serious study , like the fate of the planet , you ’d better be very careful not to stray over the line between being counter - intuitive and being just plain , unforgivably wrong .
Levitt was on NPR at the weekend discussing this chapter ( though not defending himself against any of the criticisms leveled above ) .
He made the following two points which I think go to the heart of his thinking on this issue : “ Why would anyone be against a cheap fix ? ” and “ No problem has ever been solved by changing human behaviour ” ( possibly not exact quotes , but close enough ) .
He also alluded to the switch over from horse - driven transport to internal combustion engines a hundred years ago as an example of a ‘ cheap technological fix ’ to the horse manure problem .
I deal with each of these points in turn .
Is geo -engineering cheap ?
The geo -engineering option that is being talked about here is the addition of SO2 to the stratosphere where it oxidises to SO4 ( sulphate ) aerosols which , since they are reflective , reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the ground .
The zeroth order demonstration of this possibility is shown by the response of the climate to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 which caused a maximum 0.5 ºC cooling a year or so later .
Under business - as - usual scenarios , the radiative forcing we can expect from increasing CO2 by the end of the century are on the order of 4 to 8 W/m2 – requiring the equivalent to one to two Pinatubo ’s every year if this kind of geo- engineering was the only response .
And of course , you could n’t stop until CO2 levels came back down ( hundreds , if not thousands of years later ) without hugely disruptive and rapid temperature rises .
As Deltoid neatly puts it : “ What could possibly go wrong ? ” .
The answer is plenty .
Alan Robock discussed some of the issues here the last time this came up ( umm … weeks ago ) .
The basic issues over and above the costs of delivering the SO2 to the stratosphere are that a ) once started you ca n’t stop without much more serious consequences so you are setting up a multi-centennial commitment to continually increasing spending ( of course , if you want to stop because of huge disruption that geo- engineering might be causing , then you are pretty much toast ) , b ) there would be a huge need for increased monitoring from the ground and space , c ) who would be responsible for any unanticipated or anticipated side effects and how much would that cost ? , and d ) who decides when , where and how much this is used .
For point ‘ d’ , consider how difficult it is now to come up with an international agreement on reducing emissions and then ponder the additional issues involved if India or China are concerned that geo-engineering will cause a persistent failure of the monsoon ?
None of these issues are trivial or cheap to deal with , and yet few are being accounted for in most popular discussions of the issue ( including the chapter we are discussing here ) .
Is geo -engineering a fix ?
In a word , no .
To be fair , if the planet was a single column with completely homogeneous properties from the surface to the top of the atmosphere and the only free variable was the surface temperature , it would be fine .
Unfortunately , the real world ( still ) has an ozone layer , winds that depend on temperature gradients that cause European winters to warm after volcanic eruptions , rainfall that depends on the solar heating at the surface of the ocean and decreases dramatically after eruptions , clouds that depend on the presence of condensation nuclei , plants that have specific preferences for direct or diffuse light , and marine life that relies on the fact that the ocean does n’t dissolve calcium carbonate near the surface .
The point is that a planet with increased CO2 and ever - increasing levels of sulphates in the stratosphere is not going to be the same as one without either .
The problem is that we do n’t know more than roughly what such a planet would be like .
The issues I listed above are the ‘ known unknowns ’ – things we know that we do n’t know ( to quote a recent US defense secretary ) .
These are issues that have been raised in existing ( very preliminary ) simulations .
There would almost certainly be ‘ unknown unknowns ’ – things we do n’t yet know that we do n’t know .
A great example of that was the creation of the Antarctic polar ozone hole as a function of the increased amount of CFCs which was not predicted by any model beforehand because the chemistry involved ( heterogeneous reactions on the surface of polar stratospheric cloud particles ) had n’t been thought about .
There will very likely be ‘ unknown unknowns ’ to come under a standard business as usual scenario as well – another reason to avoid that too .
There is one further contradiction in the idea that geo-engineering is a fix .
In order to proceed with such an intervention one would clearly need to rely absolutely on climate model simulations and have enormous confidence that they were correct ( otherwise the danger of over - compensation is very real even if you decided to start off small ) .
As with early attempts to steer hurricanes , the moment the planet did something unexpected , it is very likely the whole thing would be called off .
It is precisely because climate modellers understand that climate models do not provide precise predictions that they have argued for a reduction in the forces driving climate change .
The existence of a near - perfect climate model is therefore a sine qua non for responsible geo-engineering , but should such a model exist , it would likely alleviate the need for geo-engineering in the first place since we would know exactly what to prepare for and how to prevent it .
Does reducing global warming imply changing human behaviour and is that possible ?
This is a more subtle question and it is sensible to break it down into questions of human nature and human actions .
Human nature – the desire to strive for a better life , our inability to think rationally when trying to impress the objects of our desire , our natural selfishness and occasionally altruism , etc – is very unlikely to change anytime soon .
But none of those attributes require the emission of fossil fuel - derived CO2 into the atmosphere , just as they do n’t require us to pollute waterways , have lead in gasoline , use ozone - depleting chemicals in spray cans and fridges or let dogs foul the sidewalk .
Nonetheless , societies in the developed world ( with the possible exception of Paris ) have succeeded in greatly reducing those unfortunate actions and it ’s instructive to see how that happened .
The first thing to note is that these issues have not been dealt with by forcing people to think about the consequences every time they make a decision .
Lead in fuel was reduced because of taxation measures that aligned peoples preferences for cheaper fuel with the societal interest in reducing lead pollution .
While some early adopters of unleaded - fuel cars might have done it for environmental reasons , the vast majority of people did it first because it was cheaper , and second , because after a while there was no longer an option .
The human action of releasing lead into the atmosphere while driving was very clearly changed .
In the 1980s , there were campaigns to raise awareness of the ozone - depletion problem that encouraged people to switch from CFC - propelled spray cans to cans with other propellants or roll - ons etc .
While this may have made some difference to CFC levels , production levels were cut to zero by government mandates embedded in the Montreal Protocols and subsequent amendments .
No -one needs to think about their spray can destroying the ozone layer any more .
I could go on , but the fundamental issue is that people ’s actions can and do change all the time as a function of multiple pressures .
Some of these are economic , some are ethical , some are societal ( think about our changing attitudes towards smoking , domestic violence and drunk driving ) .
Blanket declarations that human behaviour can’t possibly change to fix a problem are therefore just nonsense .
To be a little more charitable , it is possible that what was meant was that you ca n’t expect humans to consciously modify their behaviour all the time based on a desire to limit carbon emissions .
This is very likely to be true .
However , I am unaware of anyone who has proposed such a plan .
Instead , almost all existing mitigation ideas rely on aligning individual self - interest with societal goals to reduce emissions – usually by installing some kind of carbon price or through mandates ( such as the CAFE standards ) .
To give a clear example of the difference , let ’s tackle the problem of leaving lights on in rooms where there is no - one around .
This is a clear waste of energy and would be economically beneficial to reduce regardless of the implications for carbon emissions .
We can take a direct moralistic approach – strong exhortations to people to always turn the lights off when they leave a room – but this is annoying , possibly only temporary and has only marginal success ( in my experience ) .
Alternatively , we can install motion - detectors that turn the lights out if there is no - one around .
The cost of these detectors is much lower than cost of the electricity saved and no - one has to consciously worry about the issue any more .
No - brainer , right ?
( As as aside , working out why this is n’t done more would be a much better use of Levitt and Dubner ’s talents ) .
The point is changing outcomes does n’t necessarily mean forcing people to think about the right thing all the time , and that cheap fixes for some problems do indeed exist .
To recap , there is no direct link between what humans actually want to do and the emissions of CO2 or any other pollutant .
If given appropriate incentives , people will make decisions that are collectively ‘ the right thing ’ , while they themselves are often unconscious of that fact .
The role of the economist should be to find ways to make that alignment of individual and collective interest easier , not to erroneously declare it can’t possibly be done .
What is the real lesson from the horse - to - automobile transition ?
Around 1900 , horse - drawn transport was the dominant mode of public and private , personal and commercial traffic in most cities .
As economic activity was growing , the side - effects of horses ’ dominance became ever more pressing .
People often mention the issue of horse manure – picking it up and disposing of it , it ’s role in spreading disease , the “ intolerable stench ” – but as McShane and Tarr explain that the noise and the impact of dead horses in the street were just as troublesome .
Add to that the need for so many stables downtown taking up valuable city space , the provisioning of hay etc .
it was clear that the benefits of the horse ’s strength for moving things around came at a great cost .
But in the space of about 20 years all this vanished , to be replaced with electrified trolleys and subways , and internal combustion engine - driven buses and trucks , and cars such as the Model - T Ford .
Almost overnight ( in societal terms ) , something that had been at the heart of economic activity had been been relegated to a minority leisure pursuit .
This demonstrates very clearly that assumptions that society must always function the same economic way are false , and that in fact we can change the way we do business and live pretty quickly .
This is good news .
Of course , this transition was brought about by technological innovations and the switch was decided based on very clear cost - benefit calculations – while cars were initially more expensive than horses , their maintenance costs were less and the side effects ( as they were understood at the time ) were much less burdensome .
Since the city had to tax the productive citizens in order to clear up the consequences of their own economic activity , the costs were being paid by the same people who benefited .
Levitt took this example to imply that technological fixes are therefore the solution to global warming ( and the fix he apparently favours is geo - engineering mentioned above ) , but this is a misreading of the lesson here in at least two ways .
Firstly , the switch to cars was not based on a covering up of the manure problem – a fix like that might have involved raised sidewalks , across city perfuming and fly - spraying – but from finding equivalent ways to get the same desired outcome ( transport of goods and people ) while avoiding undesired side - effects .
That is much more analogous to switching to renewable energy sources than implementing geo-engineering .
His second error is in not appreciating the nature of the cost - benefit calculations .
Imagine for instance that all of the horse manure and dead carcasses could have been easily swept into the rivers and were only a problem for people significantly downstream who lived in a different state or country .
Much of the costs , public health issues , etc. would now be borne by the citizens of the downstream area who would not be benefiting from the economic prosperity of the city .
Would the switch to automobiles have been as fast ?
Of course not .
The higher initial cost of cars would only have made sense if the same people who were shelling out for the car would be able to cash in on the benefits of the reduced side effects .
This is of course the basic issue we have with CO2 .
The people benefiting from fossil fuel based energy are not those likely to suffer from the consequences of CO2 emissions .
The correct lesson is in fact the same as the one mentioned above : if costs and benefits can be properly aligned ( the ‘ internalising of the externalities ’ in economist - speak ) , societies and individuals can and will make the ‘ right ’ decisions , and this can lead to radical changes in very short periods of time .
Thus far from being an argument for geo- engineering , this example is an object lesson in how economics might shape future decisions and society .
Finally
To conclude , the reasons why Levitt and Dubner like geo-engineering so much are based on a misreading of the science , a misrepresentation of proposed solutions , and truly bizarre interpretations of how environmental problems have been dealt with in the past .
These are , in the end , much worse errors than their careless misquotes and over - eagerness to shock highlighted by the other critiques .
Geo-engineering is neither cheap , nor a fix , and the reasons why it is very likely to be a bad idea are ethical and legal , much more than its still - uncertain scientific merits .
New York Governor David Patterson has promised that he will get the NY State Senate to vote on marriage equality in the coming days .
The governor has been committed to getting this legislation passed and signed into law but the NY state senate has been a wrestling rink between republicans and democrats resulting in a stalemate on many issues that occurred this summer .
Now that the senate is in the hands of the Democrats by a slim 32 - 30 margin , there is a real chance for this issue to be voted on .
While the issue may get a vote , the outcome is less than certain as some democrats will oppose it , and some republicans support it .
Be sure to contact your senator and urge their support !

Chanos :
The " cracking of state and local municipalities is coming " A Preview of What 's to Come
If you want to take long dark look into the future borrowing power of the United States , you need to keep your eyes on California .
After all , everything seems happen there first .
In that regard , it 's kind of a preview of what 's to come since the Golden State can't make ends meet either .
In fact , California is so broke that IOU 's are the new state currency .
As a result , the state has tried to sell $ 21 billion in municipal bonds over the last seven weeks alone .
The problem is there is so much of this paper on the market that yields have had to rise significantly to attract buyers .
They are willing to lend , but only if the price is right .
Because of this the state recently had to pay a 4 % tax - free yield on bonds maturing in 2013 .
That 's significantly higher than just two weeks ago when the state paid a yield of 2.48 % on similar bond .
Unfortunately , that 's a future the United States faces someday when its lenders decide it 's not worth the risk .
At that point interest rates will go north in a hurry — just like they are now for Gov. Schwarzenegger .
In the meantime , the municipal bond market itself is starting to wobble a bit as one state government after another begins to feel the pinch of caviar dreams on a bologna budget .
Unlike their Uncle Sam , they just can't print their way out of their troubles .
At least not yet .... Given enough time , some of them will be certainly be the next up begging for a bailout .
In fact , without last year 's stimulus it would have happened already .
Maybe that 's why famed short seller James Chanos now has munibonds on his hit list .
" State and local municipal finance are a mess and going to get worse , " Chanos told Barron 's earlier this week , the " cracking of state and local municipalities is coming . "
As for the states to keep an eye on , here is the list released by the Pew Center just yesterday .
It 's in article on CNNMoney by Tami Luhny entitled : 10 states face financial peril
" Here 's a summary of what Pew found is plaguing each of the states :
California : The Golden State 's housing collapse — and resulting unemployment surge — has plagued the state 's economy .
The weakening economy prompted revenue to fall by nearly a sixth between the first quarters of 2008 and 2009 .
State lawmakers have limited ability to deal with California 's massive budget gap due to several voter - imposed restrictions , including requirements that all budgets and tax increases pass the legislature by a two - thirds majority .
Arizona :
The state depends heavily on a growing economy to bring in tax revenue , and lawmakers do n't have a lot of leeway to address budget deficits thanks to voter - imposed spending constraints .
Lawmakers relied on one - time fixes to balance its budget instead of making long - term changes .
Rhode Island : The Ocean State has among the highest unemployment rates in the nation and among the highest foreclosure rates in New England .
High tax rates , big budget deficits and a lack of high tech jobs are hurting its chances to pull out of the doldrums .
State government has a poor record of managing its finances
Michigan :
The state never climbed out of the recession that started in 2001 , and matters only became worse during the Great Recession .
Two of the Big Three Detroit - based automakers went bankrupt in 2009 , sending shockwaves through a state on track to lose a quarter of its jobs this decade .
The recession accelerated drops in state revenue , and has left Michigan 's government trying to deal with today 's problems on a 1960s - sized budget .
Nevada : Nevada is one of the recession 's big losers as its gaming - based economy suffered .
Year - over - year revenue has fallen for two consecutive years , a record .
But changing tax laws is tough because some are written into the state constitution .
Oregon : Oregon 's leading industries , such as timber and computer - chip manufacturing , have been hit hard in the recession .
Lawmakers have approved more than $ 1 billion in new taxes to keep it afloat .
But voters in January will have the final say on another $ 733 million in new income taxes .
Florida :
For the first time since World War II , Florida 's population is shrinking — bad news for a budget built on new residents flocking to the Sunshine State .
Lawmakers raised $ 2 billion in new revenue this year , but could face a similar shortfall next year .
New Jersey : The Garden State , which has been plagued by years of fiscal mismanagement , spends more than it collects in revenue .
The collapse of Wall Street , which supports about one - third of New Jersey 's economy , has only made matters worse .
Illinois :
Since the last recession earlier this decade , the state piled up huge backlogs of Medicaid bills and borrowed money to pay its pension obligations .
The state 's current budget still relies heavily on borrowing and paying bills late .
Wisconsin : Wisconsin has a long history of budget shortfalls .
It also borrows frequently to cover operating expenses , among other measures .
Unemployment is climbing as manufacturing , the state 's largest sector , sputters . "
This is what happens when you would gladly pay someone tomorrow for a hamburger today .
Eventually , the bill comes due Wimpy .....

This photo was just posted to Reddit : Could it be true ?
We hope so .
Here 's what we 've found out ... The Chipotle menu board in the photo above is in Terminal B of Dulles Airport ( Washington , DC ) .
You can read all about it at Dic Tailgate - A Virginia Tech Hokies Blog Basically , we 've been informed that vendors in the terminals at Dulles must sell some form of breakfast .
In order to comply and have a location there , Chipotle decided to experiment .
And evidently during Chipotle 's last investor 's call the possibility was left open to bring this concept to other locations !
As you can see on the menu board , there are 3 breakfast item choices : Breakfast Tacos - " Three soft corn or flour tortillas with scrambled eggs , meat , salsa and cheese or sour cream . " Breakfast Burrito - " Flour tortilla with crispy herbed potatoes , black or pinto beans , scrambled eggs , meat , salsa and cheese or sour cream . " Breakfast Bowl - " Crispy herbed potatoes , black or pinto beans , scrambled eggs , meat , salsa and cheese or sour cream .
" The 3 meat choices are Chorizo ( naturally raised spicy pork sausage ) , Carnitas , or Barbacoa .
The Chorizo being a new choice .
Three of the salsa remain the same , but the corn salsa is replaced with a spicy onion - jalapeno salsa .
We can just hope that this breakfast menu spreads to other , non-airport Chipotle locations soon !

All year long animal shelters and pet rescues are in need of donations , gifts , and things to help them help the pets and animals they care for every day .
Below is a list of things you should consider as great gifts for your local animal shelter or pet rescue .
If you are not sure if an animal shelter exists in your area , phone a veterinarian and they will let you know .
1. Cash .
The number one most needed item by animal shelters is cash .
With this they can pay their staff , vet bills , utility costs , buy food , or what ever is needed .
Most are run as charities , being non-profit , some get money from the government , others get no help .
Cash donations go a long way , and most shelters have a charitable status so your cash donation will be given a tax receipt for you to claim on your income tax .
This is a win -win gift .
2. Pet Food .
Animal Shelters always need food for their pets and donations of food are greatly appreciated , but before you rush out and buy just any food , call the shelter and see what they need most .
Some shelters try to feed only one brand of food because changing brands causes tummy upset .
Some shelters get foods donated that they will not feed .
At certain times of the year they may need more kitten or puppy food ( usually summer and fall ) where as at other times of the year they mostly need adult food .
Do not forget food for smaller animals such as rabbits or birds if your shelter houses them too .
On the whole for cats and dogs , pick a food that is chicken and rice , or lamb and rice , as these are the gentlest on the pets tummy .
3. Pet Supplies .
Again it is best to call the shelter and see what they need before rushing out to the store .
Many animal shelters and pet rescues will not use donated plastic bowls because they cannot be properly disinfected , but love stainless steel bowls .
What kind of cat litter do they use , clumping , or non-clumping ?
Do they need more litter boxes , or dog collars ?
Do they need chew sticks for their small animals ?
Painting by author , not for reproduction .
4. Pet Toys .
Pet Shelters often have more cat toys than they know what to do with , and not enough dog toys .
This is because dogs are destructive and will often ruin their toys after a period of time , where as cat toys last a long time .
As such most shelters need dog toys .
Find out what sizes of dog your shelter houses predominantly and get toys appropriate for that size of dog .
Most shelters require toys for larger dogs , big rope toys , and large kong type toys work great , but so do footballs and soccer balls .
Animal shelters also appreciate edible chews , such as bully sticks , for the dogs .
5. Blankets and Bedding .
These are gifts that usually do not have to cost you a cent .
Donate your old , but not ruined , towels , and blankets .
Pets need bedding material in their cages , and these are changed daily in most shelters .
In the cases of dogs sometimes they need their bedding changed more often and sometimes they destroy their blankets altogether , so replacing them is important .
6. Give the Gift of Time .
One thing animal shelters and pet rescues always need is volunteers .
Most volunteers spend their time walking dogs , which is important .
Only a few shelters allow volunteers to help clean cages , but you can offer to fold laundry , or wash dishes .
Grooming is important , and cats need to be played with also .
Do not forget that bunnies and caged animals need attention and love .
7. Office Supplies .
Many people forget that animal shelters have other needs that do not revolve around the pets .
They need office supplies such as pens , and paper .
8. Cleaning Supplies .
The shelter might need paper towel , toilet paper and so forth , even light bulbs .
They probably can use rubber gloves and washcloths .
9. Do Not Forget the Staff .
Staff at animal shelters , are true animal lovers .
In shelters that are forced to euthanize animals ( due to health or overcrowding ) it is extremely difficult and the general public often accuses the staff of being uncaring .
Give them a fruit tray , or some other goodies .
Avoid giving chocolate as this can be deadly to dogs and you would n't want an accidental problem with your gift .
10 . Put " Adopting a Pet " on your List .
If you have room in your heart , home and life , for a pet , consider adoption .
Most shelters will not adopt pets out over the holidays , as this is a stressful time , also they want to be sure the pet is not acquired on a whim .
Never give a pet to somebody as a gift , if you know somebody who wants a pet give them a certificate to adopt , in this way they can select their own pet as they are more likely to bond with a pet they have selected .
As a Bonus , please take care of your own pets .
Spaying and neutering our pets is the best way of reducing stress on animal shelters and pet rescues world wide .

Tips for if you are Forced to Surrender your Dog to a Shelter
Tips for if you are Forced to Surrender your Cat to a Shelter
With the tech industry looking on , the Supreme Court today will explore what types of inventions should be eligible for a patent in a pivotal case that could undermine such legal protections for software .
A ruling that sides with the Patent Office could bar patents on processes and methods of doing business , such as online shopping techniques , medical diagnostic tests and procedures for executing trades on Wall Street .
And it might even undercut patents on software .
In a worst - case scenario for the high - tech industry , the ruling could invalidate many existing software patents or at least make them more difficult to defend in lawsuits .
And it could make such patents harder to obtain in the future because software is generally patented as a process for doing something rather than as a physical invention .
" Technology companies care about this case , because it will define what you can and cannot get a patent on , " said Emery Simon , counselor to the Business Software Alliance , which represents large technology companies , including Microsoft and Intel .
It 's impossible to know what products might never have come to market without patent protection for software .
But tech companies say these patents have played a critical role in keeping the U.S. at the cutting edge by giving people control over their inventions for nearly 20 years .
" The software industry would lose an important incentive to innovate if the government ceased issuing software patents , " warned patent attorney James Carmichael , a former judge on the Patent Office board of appeals .
Although technology companies insist they 'll keep innovating no matter how the high court rules , an unfavorable outcome might force them to write patent applications in a different way or rely more on copyright and trade secret protections .
And it might even draw Congress into the debate .
The actual facts of the case are not about software .
The roots of the dispute go back to 1997 , when inventors Bernard Bilski and Rand Warsaw tried to patent a method of hedging weather - related risk in energy prices .
That process , which powers energy - billing services offered by a Pittsburgh company called WeatherWise USA , can be used to lock in energy prices , even during an unusually cold winter .
The Patent Office concluded the process was too abstract and denied the application .
So Bilski and Warsaw took their claim to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which upheld the Patent Office decision last year and said a process is eligible for a patent only if it is " tied to a particular machine or apparatus " or if it " transforms a particular article into a different state or thing . "
The Bilski filing , the court found , did not meet the test .
Now , the question facing the Supreme Court is whether that " machine or transformation " test is the right standard .
The answer should settle a long - running debate over whether business methods should be eligible for patents .
Some of the best - known business - method patents in technology come out of electronic commerce , including retail giant Amazon.com 's " 1 - Click " tool for completing online purchases and Priceline.com 's " Name Your Own Price " model .
Yet many big companies , particularly in technology and financial services , argue that such patents are too broad and too often used as weapons in costly infringement lawsuits to extract licensing fees .

Tariq Ali addresses the October 24 protest in London .
More videos of the speeches below .
By Robin Beste
October 25 , 2009 -- Stop the War Coalition UK -- Stop the War 's demonstration on October 24 brought the centre of London to a standstill .
It was a landmark demonstration , led by Lance Corporal Joe Glenton -- the first serving soldier in the British army to join an anti-war march .
The march brought together at least 10,000 protesters from across Britain , calling for all British troops to be brought home .
Joining Joe Glenton at its head were ex-soldiers , a number of military family members -- including Peter Brierley , who earlier this month refused to shake former Labour PM Tony Blair 's hand , saying it had " my son 's blood on it " -- and 104 - year - old peace campaigner Hetty Bower .
The march took place on the day that a new poll showed that almost two - thirds of people in Britain want all British troops withdrawn from Afghanistan and 86 per cent believe the war is being lost .
Joe Glenton is facing court martial for refusing to return to Afghanistan .
He defied a direct order from his commanding officer to come on the march , for which he may well face further charges .
Joe Glenton , Clare Glenton and 104 - year - old Hetty Bower
He told the demonstrators : " I expected to go to war but I also expected that the need to defend this country 's interests would be legal and justifiable .
I do n't think this is too much to ask .
It 's now apparent that the conflict is neither of these and that 's why I must make this stand .
It is distressing to disobey orders , but when Britain follows America in continuing to wage war against one of the world 's poorest countries , I feel I have no choice .
" Politicians have abused the trust of the army and the soldiers who serve , that 's why I am compelled and proud to march with the Stop The War Coalition today " '
Joe 's views were supported by ex-soldier Paul McGurk , who left the army last month , after serving in Afghanistan made him realise the war was unjustied .
" I think it 's ridiculous that we 're there , " Paul told ITN News , when interviewed on the march .
" I think the government should stop pretending that it's a just war and it's worth the lives of our guys .
The government should stop saying it's a winnable war because everyone knows it 's not .
We should just leave , and that 's why I 'm here today . "
Peter Brierley -- whose son Lance Corporal Shaun Brierley was killed in Iraq and who made the headlines worldwide when he refused to shake Tony Blair 's hand -- said , " When you actually look at what 's happening , it 's exactly the same as in Iraq .
Civilians are being killed , British soldiers are being killed and the country is being ruined .
They should n't be there .
The people do n't want them there . "
Lindsey German , convenor of Stop the War Coalition .
Jeremy Corbyn Labour MP , vice - chairperson of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said : `` The war in Afghanistan has no clear war aims , is clearly escalating and spinning out of control and can only impact on Pakistan and the whole of South Asia .
NATO forces have been in Afghanistan for eight years and the result is increased drug production , high levels of corruption and terrible losses of life on all sides , civilian and military .
Now is the time to change policy and bring the troops home to prevent a Vietnam - style quagmire . ''
Tariq Ali , another speaker at the rally , challenged the British government or any politician to debate with Stop the War why Britain is fighting a war opposed by most people in Britain and in virtually every country round the world .
The country 's oldest anti-war demonstrator , 104 - year - old Hetty Bowyer , marched every step from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square , where she told the crowd : ``I march because I can see no reason for further killing .
I have walked on every march against us going to war .
At my age there is not very much I can do but while my legs can carry me I am going to march . ''
MORE than 170 military court decisions are in limbo after the High Court declared the new Australian Military Court ( AMC ) , the centrepiece of military justice reforms , to be unconstitutional
The decision gave a surprising and far - reaching victory to Brian Lane , a former sailor charged with indecent assault for placing his genitals on a sleeping colleague 's forehead - a practice known as " teabagging " - after a drunken night out in 2005 .
He denied the charge and fought it all the way to the High Court .
Ruling on Mr Lane 's case , judges ruled that the AMC , although expressly not a court according to its legislation , was exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth and that made it invalid under Chapter Three of the Australian Constitution .
Defence Minister John Faulkner said the government would review the case and develop an alternative court model which did comply with the constitution .
" In the interim , it is critical that the Australian Defence Force ( ADF ) has a functioning military discipline system , particularly when it is currently engaged in operations overseas , " he told reporters in Canberra .
" As an interim measure , the government will give appropriate priority to legislation that temporarily reintroduces the pre-2007 military justice machinery for trials by court martial and defence force magistrate . "
Senator Faulkner said preliminary advice was that the government could legislate to retrospectively validate AMC decisions in the 171 cases it has finalised since its inception in October 2007 .
" As a result of the decision of the High Court today , the validity of the decision made by the AMC during its existence will be reviewed , " he said .
" Defence will be seeking advice from the Australian government solicitor . "
Some 40 per cent of cases related to defence travel card fraud with others for assault , theft , indecency and damaging service property .
Sentences ranged from fines and loss of rank and seniority to two months ' detention .
Senator Faulkner said he was unaware if any service personnel were still serving jail terms imposed by the AMC .
Defence head Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said the majority of defence discipline matters , some 96 per cent , were dealt with by the summary system outside the court system .
He said there had been extensive reform over the last four years and most of the defence justice system was working well .
" A military justice system is essential to the workings of the Australian Defence Force .
It is important that we are able to give impartial and fair justice to our people , " he told reporters in Canberra .
The AMC and other reforms stem from a 2005 parliamentary committee inquiry report highly critical of the defence justice system .
That report recommended the creation of the Australian Military Court in a form independent of the defence chain of command but in compliance with the Constitution .
The former government disagreed on grounds that there were more advantages to creating the court as a tribunal .
Australia Defence Association executive director Neil James said there had always been differing schools of thought about the AMC 's constitutional validity .
" Until the High Court makes up its mind , you can't move forward , " he said .
" Reading between the lines of what the minister said today , they will just give the job to the Federal Court , even if they have to constitute a separate division . "
Mr James said the feeling in the military was that the AMC had been working well , although some regarded the old court martial system as fairer .
" We are not going to go back to that because there is too much opposition , " he said .

You started to abuse your position of trust .
Eventually you lured him into intercourse which should never have happened
Judge Jonathan Geake
The relationship lasted for a matter of days before Martin and the boy decided to end it in a " mutual decision " made in February .
He eventually told his mother about the affair and she immediately reported the matter to police on 20 April .
He has since quit school because he " suffered taunting " , and his relationship with his mother has been severely affected , Ms Birch told the court .
" She has seen her vivacious son lose interest in his hobbies .
He is very lethargic and has lost the sparkle he once had , " she said .
Mark Fireman , defending , said Martin had been at a vulnerable point in her life .
She was going through a divorce and her sister had recently died of cancer .
" This was something she fell into .
She was in a very vulnerable position , as was he , and she accepts full blame for what happened , " he said .
Martin has lost " just about everything " , including her job and her friends and she rarely leaves the house , he told the court .
' Emotional scars ' Judge Jonathan
Geake said the boy unfortunately has a lasting reminder of their affair in the shape of his tattoo .
He told the defendant : " This is a very sad story for all concerned , not least yourself .
" It is clear your life had come to a very low ebb .
" You started to abuse your position of trust .
Eventually you lured him into intercourse which should never have happened . "
Martin admitted 10 counts of causing a 15 - year - old boy to engage in sexual activity between 9 February 2009 and 16 February 2009 , for which she received 32 months per charge to run concurrently .
Det Sgt Dave Moores said : " Martin 's actions will leave emotional scars on her victim and his family and have also impacted on the wider community .
" I would like to praise the bravery of the victim in speaking out and ensuring justice was done for him . "
Martin has been made to sign the sex offenders register and will remain on it indefinitely .

The intrinsic vigor and hardiness of tomatoes almost always guarantees a successful harvest .
However , the rapid growth of a healthy tomato plant can also lead to problems .
A tomato is a solar - powered sugar factory .
For the first month or so , all of the sugar it produces is directed toward new leaf growth .
During this stage , tomato plants grow very rapidly , doubling their size every 12 to 15 days .
Eventually , the plants make more sugar than the single growing tip can use , which signals the plant to make new branches and to flower .
This usually happens after 10 to 13 leaves have expanded , at which time the plant is 12 to 18 inches tall .
In the next few weeks , the entire character of the tomato plant changes .
If unsupported , the increasing weight of filling fruit and multiple side branches forces the plant to lie on the ground .
Once the main stem is horizontal , there is an increased tendency to branch .
Left to its own devices , a vigorous indeterminate tomato plant can easily cover a 4 - foot by 4 - foot area with as many as 10 stems , each 3 to 5 feet long .
By season ’s end , it will be an unsightly , impenetrable , disease - wracked tangle .

• How to Prune Tomatoes
• How to Sharpen Pruners
Prune for plant structure and health
A properly pruned and supported single - stem tomato plant presents all of its leaves to the sun .
Most of the sugar produced is directed to the developing fruit , since the only competition is a single growing tip .
The result is large fruits that are steadily produced until frost .
If more stems are allowed to develop , some of the precious sugar production is diverted from fruit to multiple growing tips .
Fruit production , although slowed , never stops .
The result is a nearly continuous supply of fruits throughout the season .
In general , more stems means more but smaller fruits , which are produced increasingly later in the season .
( This is much less applicable to determinate plants , due to their shortened growing season and better - defined fruiting period .
Therefore , determinate plants require little pruning .
See “ Indeterminate vs. Determinate , ” below . )
With tomatoes , we want to maximize the efficiency of photosynthesis and minimize the risk of disease .
This is best accomplished by ensuring that each leaf has plenty of room and is supported up off the ground .
When a tomato plant lies on the ground , or when its growth is extremely dense , many of its leaves are forced into permanent shade , greatly reducing the amount of sugar they produce .
If a leaf uses more sugar than it makes , eventually it will yellow and drop off .
A pruned and staked plant will produce larger fruit two to three weeks earlier than a prostrate one .
RULE 1 : Get plants off the ground .
RULE 2 : Give plants room .
RULE 3 : Never prune or tie plants when the leaves are wet .
Pruning also affects plant health .
The leaves of a pruned and supported plant dry off faster , so bacterial and fungal pathogens have less opportunity to spread .
Soil is less liable to splash up onto staked plants .
The bottom line : Upright plants have fewer problems with leaf spots and fruit rots because their leaves stay drier and free from pathogen - laden soil .
The way you choose to train and prune your tomato plants will affect how you space your plants , as well as the best method of support .
There ’s no one right way to do it .
Instead there are a few good patterns to follow .
Side stems affect plant vigor
As a tomato grows , side shoots , or suckers , form in the crotches , or axils , between the leaves and the main stem .
If left alone , these suckers will grow just like the main stem , producing flowers and fruit .
Suckers appear sequentially , from the bottom of the plant up .
The farther up on the plant a sucker develops , the weaker it is , because the sugar concentration gets lower as you move up the plant .
On the other hand , side stems arising from below the first flower cluster , although stronger , compromise the strength of the main stem .
For a multi-stemmed plant , your aim is to have all stems roughly the same size , although the main stem should always be stronger , because it has to feed the entire plant for the next five or six months .
Here ’s how I achieve this .
I keep tomatoes free of side stems below the first fruit cluster .
When trained to one vine and left free - standing , tomato plants develop strong main stems .
To encourage a strong stem , I trim all suckers and I do n’t tie plants to their supports until the first flowers appear .
Determinate tomatoes need no pruning other than removing all suckers below the first flower cluster , because pruning wo n’t affect their fruit size or plant vigor .
If you do any pruning at all above the first flower cluster on determinate tomatoes , you ’ll only be throwing away potential fruit .
Indeterminate tomatoes can have from one to many stems , although four is the most I ’d recommend .
The fewer the stems , the fewer but larger the fruits , and the less room the plant needs in the garden .
For a multi-stemmed plant , let a second stem grow from the first node above the first fruit .
Allow a third stem to develop from the second node above the first set fruit , and so forth .
Keeping the branching as close to the first fruit as possible means those side stems will be vigorous but will not overpower the main stem .
Indeterminate vs. determinate
Indeterminate tomato plants continue to grow , limited only by the length of the season .
These plants produce stems , leaves , and fruit as long as they are alive .
Determinate tomato plants have a predetermined number of stems , leaves , and flowers hardwired into their genetic structure .
The development of these plants follows a well - defined pattern .
First , there is an initial vegetative stage during which all the stems , most of the leaves , and a few fruit are formed .
This is followed by a flush of flowering and final leaf expansion .
Finally , during the fruit - fill stage , there is no further vegetative growth .
As the tomato fruits ripen , the leaves senesce and die .
Commercial growers favor this type of tomato because all the fruit can be mechanically harvested at once .
The major advantage of planting determinate plants in a home garden is early harvest .
Semi-determinate plants , as the name implies , are somewhere between these two other types .
Although there are n’t many semi- determinate tomatoes , one of the most popular hybrids , ‘ Celebrity ’ , falls into this category .
I think semi-determinates are best grown to three or four stems .
Simple vs. Missouri pruning
In Missouri pruning , you pinch out just the tip of the sucker , letting one or two leaves remain .
The advantage is that the plant has more leaf area for photosynthesis and to protect developing fruit from sun-scald .
The disadvantage is that new suckers inevitably develop along the side stems , adding to your future pruning chores .
There are two ways to deal with a sucker that is n’t destined to become a stem .
The simplest is to pinch it off entirely ; not surprisingly , this is called “ simple pruning . ”
This should be done when the sucker is still small and succulent .
Grab the base of it between your thumb and index finger and bend it back and forth .
The sucker should snap off , producing a small wound that will heal quickly .
Avoid cutting the sucker with a knife or scissors , because the resulting stump can become easily infected .
Once a sucker becomes too tough and leathery to snap off , however , you ’ll have to use a blade .
I recommend a retractable razor knife .
Missouri pruning is necessary when things have gotten out of hand .
When you ’re dealing with large suckers , it ’s better to pinch off just the tip than to cut off the whole thing close to the main stem .
For one thing , if disease hits , it ’s farther away from the main stem .
And for another , removing just the growing tip is less of a shock to the plant than removing a foot or so of side stem .
Suckers grow very quickly during the hot summer months .
This is indeed a situation that tests one ’s resolve .
It helps to know that side stems started this late in the season will always be spindly and produce inferior fruit .
You must be heartless and tip them all .
How to tie a tomato
There are two types of ties .
Training ties direct plant growth upwards , and supporting ties keep it there .
The top foot of a tomato stem , or leader , is very succulent and easily snapped ; it needs to be directed upwards , gently .
I wrap a short piece of twine around the middle of the leader , cross it over on itself , and loosely tie it to the support .
The resulting figure - eight tie reduces the chance the tender stem will rub against the support and get bruised .
Once flowering commences , all tomato vines must be tied to their supports .
Although vigorous , the plants are also easily damaged , so take care in how you tie them and what you use .
Cloth strips work well as long as they ’re not too old and threadbare .
Pieces of panty hose cause the least damage to plants , but they ’re not biodegradable .
Twine should be at least 1/8 inch thick , or else it can cut into the tomato stems .
Fruit will form along this stem .
If left to the devices of the loose training ties , the weight of the fruit will pull the ties down the stake .
Eventually , the stem will bend over and crease .
Luckily , as the stem matures , it toughens ; by the time fruit develops , the stem can tolerate a tighter tie .
To support a fruit cluster as it fills and gains weight , I loop a longer piece of twine , 12 to 18 inches , around the stem just above the fruit cluster , creating a sling .
Then I gently pull it up to take the weight off the stem .
I wrap the twine twice around the stake , and firmly tie it to the stake 6 to 10 inches higher than the point of attachment to the vine .
To keep the tie from slipping , I knot it underneath the point where the sling meets the stake .
A final pruning pays off
About 30 days before the first frost , there is one last pruning chore :
The plants must be topped .
The fruit that has set must be given every opportunity to mature .
Removing all the growing tips directs all sugar produced by the plant to the fruit .
This can be hard to do , as every gardener is reluctant to admit the season is coming to an end .
However , this final pruning can make all the difference between hard , green fruits , hurriedly picked before frost , which later rot in a paper bag , and ripe , home - grown tomatoes in your Thanksgiving salad .
Be tough , fight your nurturing instincts , and top those plants .
Which method of support you use and how far apart you set tomato plants depends on the number of stems you allow to grow .
Cages work for plants with three to five stems .
I use them almost exclusively for determinate tomatoes .
Ready - made tomato cages are too little for all but the smallest determinate cultivars .
My ideal tomato cage is made from 5 - foot - tall galvanized fencing with openings at least 4 inches square , so I can reach in and pick the fruit .
A 4 - foot section makes a cylinder about 15 inches in diameter .
Secure it with baling wire , and stabilize it with two stakes , one of which is at least 6 feet long .
Drive the stakes in within a week of planting , but wait to set cages over the plants until the first fruits form , to simplify weeding and pruning .
Space caged plants about two - thirds of their final height in all directions .
Use the same type of fencing to make a tomato fence , which works best for plants with one or two stems .
To get a good , solid fence , you need a helper .
Secure the fencing with 6 - foot stakes every 4 feet .
Here ’s how I keep the fence taut .
Loop each non-end stake through the bottom rung of the fence , then start to drive it into the ground so its bottom is angled away from the previous stake .
Once it ’s about 4 inches into the ground , bring the stake upright and drive it in the rest of the way .
Set single - stemmed plants 18 inches apart , and double - stemmed plants 24 inches apart .
If you stagger the planting ( successive plants on opposite sides of the fence ) , you can knock 6 inches off these distances .
Erect the fence before you plant your tomatoes .
Stakes work well for plants of one to four stems .
I use 1 - inch by 1 - inch by 6 - foot lengths of untreated oak or cedar , sharpened on one end .
Drive the stakes 8 to 12 inches into the ground , depending on your soil ( deeper for loose , sandy ground ) .
To avoid damaging roots , drive your stakes in within a week of planting .
Space staked plants at 18 inches for a single stem , 24 inches for two stems , and 36 inches for three or four stems .
From Kitchen Gardener Issue # 27
My hair is my religion .
Not in a blasphemous kind of way .
As with most heads of hair on this planet , mine has undergone a series of transformations .
If I were to pick out a common trait in my head of hair , a continuous thread that has been with me from infancy to today , I ’d have to say thickness .
My head of hair has always been thick .
Even as a newborn , I had a thick head of hair .
Thick and wavy and light brownish .
That ’s how my hair had its beginnings .
By the time I was in elementary school , the wavy went curly , and the light brownish , dark .
Fully dominant traits .
Thick and curly and brown hair .
Nothing extraordinary .
In fact , this transformation is almost entirely ordinary , or maybe even completely ordinary .
I ’m not sure .
But by the time I was in eighth grade , people were already commenting on my hair and how it had the potential to become an afro .
I did my best to keep my thick brown hair under control .
I would comb it in the mornings , and while my hair was still wet , or drying , it could pass for a relaxed head of hair , but by the afternoon , after hours of the elements , my hair showed a severe tendency towards froing .
Regular visits to the barber were required to keep my afro under control .
Only water could get my hair to fall .
Only the weight of water , well , that and some kind of hair jelly .
That ’s what I like to call mousse , hair jelly .
I dappled with the stuff , heck , I even tried hairspray , but these attempts at styling did n’t last long .
All I could rationalize doing on a daily basis in terms of hair management was a shower and a comb .
Every month I would visit the barber .
What became of my hair over the course of the day and month became of my hair .
I was n’t going to fight it .
I could wear a hat if I had to , so what ?
I got to high school eventually , took me awhile but I did eventually get there , and that ’s when I lost the drive to visit the barber .
Shower and comb were all I could put up with in terms of hair management .
I wore a hat everyday .
I slept in my hat .
I sometimes even bathed in my hat .
When it came time for the head dunk and shampoo , I ’d use forefinger and thumb to take my hat off , and I ’d extend my hat upwards while the rest of my body went downwards , submerged .
With my free hand , I ’d scrub my thick brown hair until it got wet all the way down to the scalp , which was an itch to find .
My head of hair got that dense after there were no more monthly trips to the barber .
I had to dig to find my scalp .
As a substitute , I made a one - time purchase of hair clippers , the kind that uses guards numbered 1 - 8 .
I shaved my head on a three .
That means I would leave 3/8 of an inch on my scalp .
Then I ’d let my hair grow for months , and when I felt the need for a trim , I ’d take out the clippers , strap on # 3 , and buzz away .
I did n’t own a comb for years .
I ’d just shower and let my hair dry , and when it dried unruly , I put the clippers to task .
This trend did n’t stop until ooohh not that long ago .
This cycle of buzzing and growing .
I like the perpetual process of rebirth .
Or at least that ’s how it feels after letting your hair grow as it pleases for months on end , and then putting the clippers to task .
A cycle of growing , dying , and being reborn .
My hair is my religion .
Not in a blasphemous kind of way .
Growth , death , rebirth .
But right now is a special time in terms of my hair ’s life .
The growth part of my perpetual cycle has lasted longer than ever .
Maybe not by some people ’s standards , but for mine , I ’d say eleven months is a long time to not tame my hair .
Especially my hair that only falls under the weight of water .
It ’s fine in the ocean , fine in the shower , but once the elements do their drying , my hair becomes an afro .
People are recommending dreads .
I ’m not so sure about dreads .
Uh , not really .
I do n’t think I have whatever it takes to make something like dreads happen .
I have gone back to combing my hair when I get out of the shower .
A nice once -over .
Then the curls can spring into life and do as they please .
It ’s a life of its own , my thick head of hair , it ’s freedom .
I ’d even say it ’s love , my thick hair doing as it pleases .
But the time is near .
I can smell it in the air .
The time for clippers , for death by # 3 .
Then , rebirth .

The vast majority of school - aged children can focus on the voice of a teacher amid the cacophony of the typical classroom thanks to a brain that automatically focuses on relevant , predictable and repeating auditory information , according to new research from Northwestern University .
But for children with developmental dyslexia , the teacher 's voice may get lost in the background noise of banging lockers , whispering children , playground screams and scraping chairs , the researchers say .
Their study appears in the Nov. 12 issue of Neuron .
Recent scientific studies suggest that children with developmental dyslexia -- a neurological disorder affecting reading and spelling skills in 5 to 10 percent of school aged children -- have difficulties separating relevant auditory information from competing noise .
The research from Northwestern University 's Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory not only confirms those findings but presents biological evidence that children who report problems hearing speech in noise also suffer from a measurable neural impairment that adversely affects their ability to make use of regularities in the sound environment .
" The ability to sharpen or fine - tune repeating elements is crucial to hearing speech in noise because it allows for superior ' tagging ' of voice pitch , an important cue in picking out a particular voice within background noise , " said Nina Kraus , Hugh Knowles Professor of Communication Sciences and Neurobiology and director of the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory .
In the article " Context - dependent encoding in the human auditory brainstem relates to hearing speech - in - noise : Implications for developmental dyslexia , " Kraus and co-investigators Bharath Chandrasekaran , Jane Hornickel , Erika Skoe and Trent Nicol demonstrate that the remarkable ability of the brain to tune into relevant aspects in the soundscape is carried out by an adaptive auditory system that continuously changes its activity based on the demands of context .
Good and poor readers were asked to watch a video while the speech sound " da " was presented to them through an earphone in two different sessions during which the brain 's response to these sounds was continuously measured .
In the first session , " da " was repeated over and over and over again ( in what the researchers call a repetitive context ) .
In the second , " da " was presented randomly amid other speech sounds ( in what the researchers call a variable context ) .
In an additional session , the researchers performed behavioral tests in which the children were asked to repeat sentences that were presented to them amid increasing degrees of noise .
" Even though the children 's attention was focused on a movie , the auditory system of the good readers ' tuned in ' to the repeatedly presented speech sound context and sharpened the sound 's encoding .
In contrast , poor readers did not show an improvement in encoding with repetition , " said Chandrasekaran , lead author of the study .
" We also found that children who had an adaptive auditory system performed better on the behavioral tests that required them to perceive speech in noisy backgrounds . "
The study suggests that in addition to conventional reading and spelling based interventions , poor readers who have difficulties processing information in noisy backgrounds could benefit from the employment of relatively simple strategies , such as placing the child in front of the teacher or using wireless technologies to enhance the sound of a teacher 's voice for an individual student .
Interestingly , the researchers found that dyslexic children showed enhanced brain activity in the variable condition .
This may enable dyslexic children to represent their sensory environment in a broader and arguably more creative manner , although at the cost of the ability to exclude irrelevant signals ( e.g. noise ) .
" The study brings us closer to understanding sensory processing in children who experience difficulty excluding irrelevant noise .
It provides an objective index that can help in the assessment of children with reading problems , " Kraus says .
For nearly two decades , Kraus has been trying to determine why some children with good hearing have difficulties learning to read and spell while others do not .
Early in her work , because the deficits she was exploring related to the complex processes of reading and writing , Kraus studied how the cortex -- the part of the brain responsible for thinking -- encoded sounds .
She and her colleagues now understand that problems associated with the encoding of sound also can occur in lower perceptual structures .

The DNA snatchers : Police arresting innocents just to grab genetic details for Big Brother database
Innocent : Police are arresting people in order to get their DNA details on the national database
Police are arresting innocent people in order to get their hands on as many DNA samples as possible , senior Government advisers revealed last night .
The Human Genetics Commission said the Big Brother tactic was creating a ' spiral of suspicion ' among the public .
The panel - which contains some of Britain 's leading scientists and academics - said officers should no longer routinely take samples at the point of arresting a suspect .
They also called for all police - including support staff - to place their own DNA on the national database in a show of solidarity with a public being routinely placed under suspicion .
By law , officers are only allowed to make an arrest if they have ' reasonable suspicion ' that a person has committed a crime .
But the HGC , which has carried out a lengthy review of the merits of the database , said evidence had emerged of police arresting people purely so they could take their DNA .
Its chairman , Professor Jonathan Montgomery , said : ' People are arrested in order to retain DNA information that might not have been arrested in other circumstances . '
The claim , which was backed by evidence from a senior police officer , delivers a significant blow to the Government 's defence of the database - which contains more than 5.6 million samples .
Campaigners have long feared officers were carrying out mass sweeps of the population to load their samples on the database , and make future crime fighting easier .
The result is one million entirely innocent people having their genetic details logged by the state .
The Commission said one of the consequences of current DNA laws was that young black men are ' very highly over - represented ' , with more than three quarters of those aged 18 - 35 on the database .
Professor Montgomery warned this was creating a ' spiral of suspicion ' among sections of society .
A retired senior police officer , a superintendent , told the commission : ' It is now the norm to arrest offenders for everything if there is a power to do so .
' It is apparently understood by serving police officers that one of the reasons , if not the reason , for the change in practice is so that the DNA of the offender can be obtained . '
Officers in England and Wales are entitled to take samples from everyone they arrest for a recordable offence .
Proposals within the Crime and Security Bill - published last week - will for the first time put a time limit , in most cases six years , on how long profiles are stored when the alleged offender is either not charged or later cleared .
But there are no plans to reduce police powers to take samples on arrest .
Poll Should police be allowed to take a DNA sample from every person they arrest ?
Yes No Should police be allowed to take a DNA sample from every person they arrest ?
Yes 3125 votes
No 5355 votes
Now share your opinion
One possibility is to only take DNA when a suspect is charged - making it harder for police to target innocents for their DNA .
In a 110 - page report , the commission said more detailed research is required to evaluate how useful the database is in helping to solve crimes , describing current evidence as ' flimsy ' .
It accused politicians of using single case studies where the database has secured a conviction instead of carrying out a rigorous evaluation of its scale and function .
Latest Government figures show the costs of running the system - the largest in the world - have risen dramatically , to £ 4.3 million from £ 2.1 million in just a year .
Over the past two years , more than 1.17 million new profiles have been added to the database but the number of DNA - related detections fell from a peak of 41,148 in 2006 - 07 to 31,915 in 2008 - 09 .
LibDem spokesman Chris Huhne said : ' The Government 's cavalier attitude to DNA retention has put us in the ridiculous situation where people are being arrested just to have their DNA harvested .
' Ministers make no distinction between innocence and guilt and as a result everyone is treated like a suspect . '
Liberty warned police were being given a ' perverse incentive ' to arrest individuals just to get their details on the database .
Tory home affairs spokesman James Brokenshire said : ' For too long the Government has had a policy of growing the DNA database for the sake of it , regardless of guilt or innocence . '
Tories last night attacked reported Government plans to charge innocent people a £ 200 fee to apply to have their names removed from the national DNA database .
And they called for England and Wales to follow the Scottish model by not retaining the DNA of such innocents , save in exceptional circumstances .
The Government has proposed such DNA should be kept for six years .
Tory security spokesman Baroness Neville - Jones told the Lords : ' If it is the case that making an application for removal is subject to a £ 200 fee , several individuals will be prevented from making any appeal or indeed getting their names off the database .
' Perhaps the Government is using the right of individuals to appeal to help fill the big public sector deficit . '

Sandra Burt was told she needed a licence to sing in the store
A shop assistant who was told she could not sing while she stacked shelves without a performance licence has been given an apology .
Sandra Burt , 56 , who works at A &T Food store in Clackmannanshire , was warned she could be fined for her singing by the Performing Right Society ( PRS ) .
However the organisation that collects royalties on behalf of the music industry has now reversed its stance .
They have sent Mrs Burt a bouquet of flowers and letter of apology .
Mrs Burt , who describes herself as a Rolling Stones fan , said that despite the initial warning from the PRS , she had been unable to stop herself singing at work .
They would need to put a plaster over my mouth to get me to stop , I can't help it
Sandra Burt
Singing shop worker
The village store where Mrs Burt works was contacted by the PRS earlier this year to warn them that a licence was needed to play a radio within earshot of customers .
When the shop owner decided to get rid of the radio as a result , Mrs Burt said she began singing as she worked .
She told the BBC news website : " I would start to sing to myself when I was stacking the shelves just to keep me happy because it was very quiet without the radio .
" When I heard that the PRS said I would be prosecuted for not having a performance licence , I thought it was a joke and started laughing .
" I was then told I could be fined thousands of pounds .
But I could n't stop myself singing .
" They would need to put a plaster over my mouth to get me to stop , I can't help it . "
In response to the furore created by their initial hardline , the PRS contacted Mrs Burt to apologise .
In a note attached to a large bouquet of flowers they said : " We 're very sorry we made a big mistake .
" We hear you have a lovely singing voice and we wish you good luck . "

Moby Dick comes to life :
The astonishing rare images of a sperm whale feasting on a giant squid
They are creatures of the deep immortalised in fictional bestsellers like Herman Melville 's novel Moby Dick and Jules Verne 's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea .
But these ultra-rare images of a colossal sperm whale feeding on a giant squid are the real thing .
The captivating pictures show adult sperm whales feasting on a rare giant squid .
Though the squid looks small beside the enormous whales , it is thought to be an incredible eight to ten metres long .
Sea - fight : A female sperm whale with a giant squid in her mouth .
Her calf follows her closely , and another whale is pictured behind her , in this rare image taken in the seas of Japan earlier this month
One of the dead squid 's tentacles - a leftover scrap - was measured at a jaw - dropping three - and - a - half metres long .
And experts now think the pictures could be some of the rarest ever captured beneath the ocean 's surface , showing as they do the sight of five adults teaching a hungry calf how to catch its prey .
Underwater photographer Tony
Wu witnessed the pod - five adults and a juvenile - devour the mammoth squid near the Ogasawara Islands in Japan earlier this month .
' It was a childhood dream come true , ' said Mr Wu .
' I remember reading Moby Dick and the kraken scene from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , dreaming about what it would be like to see a sperm whale eating a massive squid in real life .
' Of course , in reality the animals are not quite so ridiculously over - sized , but it was an adrenaline - inducing sight to witness . '
Monsters of the deep : A close up of the image shows the giant squid - believed to be up to ten metres long - firmly clamped between the jaws of the even more giant sperm whale
Sperm whales are the largest toothed whales in the world , inhabiting every ocean on the planet .
Researchers estimate that more than 110 million tons of squid may be consumed by the species every year .
However with feeding depths ranging beyond 800 metres deep , this behaviour has rarely been recorded .
On this once - in - a - lifetime occasion Mr Wu was lucky enough to see the adult whales appearing near the surface - and teach their calf to dive into the deep blue waters to feed on its prey .
' This is extremely rare , ' said the 42 - year - old .
' I had seen one video with sperm whales feeding on giant squid but I am not aware of anyone else who has documented this behaviour .
' Of course , I did not see the whale catch the squid at depth .
I only saw the whale at the surface with the squid in its mouth .
They brought it up from the depths . '
Close your mouth when you 're eating :
Three of the whales frolic just beneath the ocean 's surface as the one in the centre savours the squid between its jaws
Accompanied by underwater photographers Eric Cheng and Douglas Seifert , Mr Wu entered the water to photograph the animals with permission from local whale watching authorities .
' The group kept diving and resurfacing with the larger whale carrying the squid in its mouth , ' he said .
' They kept repeating the scenario and it was a good opportunity to get them on film .
' It seemed as if the adult whales were trying to teach the baby to dive and also to eat squid .
' Female sperm whales are known to raise calfs in a collective manner and they have strong family units . '
Cephalopod expert Dr Mark Norman confirmed the images give a rare insight into the feeding ritual of the sperm whale .
' It is incredibly rare to record a sperm whale with a giant squid actually in its jaws , ' said Dr Norman , Senior Curator at the Museum Victoria , Australia .
' The region is famous for sperm whale aggregations and their regular dives to depth in this canyon system .
We 're going to need a bigger freezer bag :
One of the ' leftovers ' from the sperm whales ' feast - a tentacle of the giant squid measuring three and a half metres long
' I know of one previous record of a whale returning to the surface with squid remains in its mouth .
' This is the site where Dr Tsunemi Kubodera of the Tokyo National Science Museum deployed a baited still camera at 800 metres and got the only live animal shots of giant squid in its natural environment .
' The potential matrilineal teaching of calves is a wonderful thing to think of . '
And Dr Norman thinks the group may have been teaching the youngster to use its built in sonar - echolocation - to find food at depth .
' As echolocation is pivotal for sperm whales finding their prey , it is not out of the question that the females would release the dead squid at depth and let the calf echolocate and recognise it in the dark deep water , typically around 800 m deep . '
For Mr
Wu , whose work has taken him from Papua New Guinea to Colombia and Costa Rica , the encounter was a once in lifetime experience .
' It is something that only a handful of people have ever seen , ' he says .
' I 've experienced unique connections with many of the subjects I photograph , from the smallest of fish to the largest of cetaceans , so I consider myself extremely fortunate .
' There 's always a risk in trying new things , going places that are n't well explored , working with animals that are n't well understood .
But the rewards can be spectacular .'

Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker called Obama ’s office today to ask if he had attended Bilderberg .
A campaign spokeswoman refused to discuss the matter but would not deny that Obama had attended Bilderberg .
Senator Barack Obama ’s office has refused to deny that the Democratic nominee attended Bilderberg last night following reports that he and Hillary Clinton were present at " an event in Northern Virginia . "
As we reported earlier today , Obama ’s press entourage were not informed of his secret meeting with Hillary Clinton in Northern Virginia until they were literally locked inside a plane that was taxiing down the runway on its way to Chicago .
Reporters were duped into believing that they were getting on a plane back to the campaign headquarters in Chicago with the presumptive nominee , while in reality Obama ’s motorcade instead sped off in secrecy to Northern Virginia , which is also the scene of this week ’s Bilderberg conference .
The plane was stationed at Dulles International , which is less than a 20 minute drive from Chantilly Virginia as is shown below .
Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker called Obama ’s office today to ask if he had attended Bilderberg .
A campaign spokeswoman refused to discuss the matter but would not deny that Obama had attended Bilderberg .
According to Alex Jones , security is so tight around Bilderberg that it does befit the visit of a potential future President .
Armored cars , men in suits hanging out of vehicles with guns and what looked like Marines have all been spotted in the vicinity of the Westfields Marriott .
Despite the controversy of Obama and Hillary ’s secret meeting and its obvious link to the ongoing Bilderberg conference , not one U.S. corporate media outlet , or any mainstream media outlet , has reported on over a hundred of the world ’s most powerful people meeting in secret on U.S. soil .
There was one reporter from the Fairfax Times who showed up today but they were not completely confident that any such report would make it to print .

Everyone knows that Bacon is pretty much the best food on Earth … in fact , it ’s so cool , that even the grease it leaves behind creates fractals .
( note : in case you forgot about my last “ beautiful food post )
This post over at Lucia ’s Blackboard caught my interest because it shows you do n’t need to operate heavy equipment ( like Al Gore ’s famous elevator scene ) to get yourself a big data hockey stick .
More evidence that Mann and Briffa ’s selection criteria for trees leads to a spurious result .
It does n’t matter if you are using treemometers , thermometers , stock prices , or wheat futures , if your method is n’t carefully designed to prevent an artificial , and unintentional selection of data that correlates with your theory , the whole study can turn out like a hockey stick .
Anyone can do this , no special science skills are needed .
Lucia writes :
So , even though the method seems reasonable , and the person doing it does n’t intend to cherry pick , if they do n’t do some very sophisticated things , rejecting trees that do n’t correlate with the recent record biases an analysis .
It encourages spurious results , and in the context of the whole “ hockey stick ” controversy , effectively imposes hockey sticks on the results .
And she backs it up with a simple experiment anybody can do with Microsoft Excel .
Method of creating hockey stick reconstructions out of nothing
To create “ hockey stick ” reconstructions out of nothing , I ’m going to do this :
Generate roughly 148 years worth of monthly “ tree – ring ” data using rand ( ) in EXCEL .
This corresponds to 1850 - 1998 .
I will impose autocorrelation with r=0.995 .
I ’ll repeat this 154 times .
( This number is chosen arbitrarily . )
On the one hand , we know these functions do n’t correlate with Hadley because they are synthetically generated .
However , we are going to pretend we believe “ some ” are sensitive to temperature and see what sort of reconstruction we get .
To screen out the series that prove themselves insensitive to temperature , I ’ll compute the autocorrelation , R , between Hadley monthly temperature data and the tree -ring data for each of the 154 series .
To show this problem with this method , I will compute the correlation only over the years from 1960 - 1998 .
Then , I ’ll keep all series that have autocorrelations with absolute values greater than 1.2 * the standard deviation of the 154 autocorrelations R. I ’ll assume the other randomly generated monthly series are “ not sensitive ” to temperature and ignore them .
( Note :
The series with negative values of R are the equivalent of “ upside down ” proxies . )
I ’ll create a proxy by simply averaging over the “ proxies ” that passed the test just described .
I ’ll rebaseline so the average temperature and trends for the proxie and Hadley match between 1960 - 1998 .
I ’ll plot the average from the proxies and compare it to Hadley
The comparison from one ( typical ) case is shown below .
The blue curve indicates is the “ proxy reconstruction ” ; the yellow is the Hadley data ( all data are 12 - month smoothed . )
Notice that after 1960 , the blue curve based on the average of “ noise ” that passed the test mimics the yellow observations .
It looks good because I screened out all the noise that was “ not sensitive to temperature ” .
( In reality , none is sensitive to temperature .
I just picked the series that did n’t happen to fail . )
Because the “ proxies ” really are not sensitive to temperature , you will notice there is no correspondence between the blue “ proxy reconstruction ” and the yellow Hadley data prior to 1960 .
I could do this exercise a bajillion times and I ’ll always get the same result .
After 1960 , there are always some “ proxies ” that by random chance correlate well with Hadley .
If I throw away the other “ proxies ” and average over the “ sensitive ” ones , the series looks like Hadley after 1960 .
But before 1960 ?
No dice .
Also notice that when I do this , the “ blue proxie reconstruction ” prior to 1960 is quite smooth .
In fact , because the proxies are not sensitive , the past history prior to the “ calibration ” period looks unchanging .
If the current period has an uptick , applying this method to red noise will make the current uptick look “ unprecedented ” .
( The same would happen if the current period had a down turn , except we ’d have unprecedented cooling . )
The red curve
Are you wondering what the red curve is ?
Well , after screening once , I screened again .
This time , I looked at all the proxies making up the “ blue ” curve , and checked whether they correlated with Hadely during the periods from 1900 - 1960 .
If they did not , I threw them away .
Then I averaged to get the red line .
( I did not rebaseline again . )
The purpose of the second step is to “ confirm ” the temperature dependence .
Having done this , I get a curve that sort of looks sort of like Hadley from 1900 - 1960 .
That is : the wiggles sort of match .
The “ red proxy reconstructions ” looks very much like Hadley after 1960 : both the “ wiggles ” and the “ absolute values ” match .
It ’s also “ noisier ” than the blue curve–that ’s because it contains fewer “ proxies ” .
But notice that aprior to 1900 , the wiggles in the red proxy and the yellow Hadley data do n’t match .
( Also , the red proxie wants to “ revert to the mean . ” )
Can I do this again ?
Sure .
Here are the two plots created on the next two “ refreshes ” of the EXCEL spreadsheet :
I can keep doing this over and over .
Some “ reconstructions ” look better ; some look worse .
But these do n’t look too shabby when you consider that none of the “ proxies ” are sensitive to temperature at all .
This is what you get if you screen red noise .
Naturally , if you use real proxies and that contain some signal , you should do better than this .
But knowing you can get this close with nothing but noise should make you suspect that screening out based on a known temperature record can bias your answers to :
Make a “ proxy reconstruction ” based on nothing but noise match the thermometer record and Make the historical temperature variations looks flat and unvarying .
So , Hu is correct .
If you screen out “ bad ” proxies based on a match to the current temperature record , you bias your answer .
Given the appearance of the thermometer record during the 20th century , you bias toward hockey sticks !
Does this mean it ’s impossible to make a reliable reconstruction ?
No .
It means you need to think very carefully about how you select your proxies .
Just screening to match the current record is not an appropriate method .
Update
I modified the script to show the number of proxies in the “ blue ” and “ red ” reconstructions .
Here is one case , the second will be uploaded in a ’sec .

Lucia , in addition to Jeff
Id , this phenomenon has now been more or less independently reported by Lubos , David Stockwell and myself .
David published an article on the phenomenon in AIG News , online at http://landshape.org/enm/wp-co…..6%2014.pdf
.
We cited this paper in our PNAS comment ( as one of our 5 citations . )
I do n’t have a link for Lubos on it , but he wrote about it .
I mention this phenomenon in a post prior to the starting of Climate Audit , that was carried forward from my old website from Dec 2004 http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=9, where I remarked on this phenomenon in connection with Jacoby and D’Arrigo picking the 10 most “ temperature - sensitive ” out of 35 that they sampled as follows :
If you look at the original 1989 paper , you will see that Jacoby “ cherry - picked ” the 10 “ most temperature - sensitive ” sites from 36 studied .
I ’ve done simulations to emulate cherry - picking from persistent red noise and consistently get hockey stick shaped series , with the Jacoby northern treeline reconstruction being indistinguishable from simulated hockey sticks .
The other 26 sites have not been archived .
I ’ve written to Climatic Change to get them to intervene in getting the data .
Jacoby has refused to provide the data .
He says that his research is “ mission - oriented ” and , as an ex-marine , he is only interested in a “ few good ” series .

I encourage readers to try these experiments in hockey stick construction themselves .

The lights are going down in Toulouse .
Tomorrow early - rising residents of the Allée Camille - Soula in the south - western French city will have set out to work with the morning gloom held at bay by radical new technology which turns on streetlights only when pedestrians pass .
Installed on a 500 - metre section of pavement last weekend , the lampposts double the strength of the light they cast when they detect human body heat .
Ten seconds later they revert to normal .
" It 's a prototype .
Nothing like this exists anywhere in the world .
We pretty much built the technology ourselves , " said Alexandre Marciel , the deputy mayor in charge of works , highways , sanitation and lighting .
The aim is to cut energy consumption by around 50 % , first on the busy street which runs between a sports stadium and university halls , then more widely .
If it is a success , it will be rolled out across the city of around 450,000 people , France 's fourth largest .
The technology has attracted interest across France and overseas .
Last month Toulouse received a deputation of town councillors from the Japanese city of Osaka .
" Anywhere where there is a significant urban density , this could make a big difference , " said Marciel .
There is a growing campaign in France against nocturnal light pollution .
Last weekend saw countrywide demonstrations against the contamination of the night sky by urban lighting .
" Concern started just among astronomers and other specialists but is now getting much more mainstream attention , " said Clara Osadtchy , one of the organisers .
Campaigners say the light produced for each person in France increased by a third between 1990 and 2000 , the most recent date for which statistics exist , and has continued to grow since .
Astronomers claim that an unpolluted night sky can only be seen from Corsica or , on the mainland , from a small area of Quercy , high on the remote southern flanks of the Massif Central .
Cash - strapped and increasingly environmentally conscious communities are now trying to cut electricity consumption .
Many cities have changed streetlight bulbs for less wasteful models .
After years where cheap tariffs and plentiful power meant all - night lighting , smaller rural communities are returning to earlier practices and turning off streetlights after midnight .
" The new technology may be a good idea for somewhere like Toulouse but in the countryside the best thing is to just turn the lights off , " said Véronique Clérin , of the National Association for the Protection of the Sky and the Nocturnal Environment .
" The average commune [ an administrative area ] can cut its electricity bill by a quarter and protect natural habitats and the migration patterns of birds , insects and mammals . "
Earlier this year the German town of Dörentrup started turning off its lights at 11 pm , with its 9,000 residents able to illuminate a specific street for 15 minutes by dialling a special mobile phone code .
The local utility company estimated the scheme would cut Dörentrup 's carbon emissions by 12 tonnes a year .
Early trials showed that many streetlights were switched on only two or three times a night .
Marciel , an elected official from the Radical Left party , has grand ambitions .
" Imagine if instead of thinking of movements in town as consuming energy we thought of ways they could generate energy instead .
The possibilities are without limit , " he said .
One project under consideration is to connect dynamos to the thousands of free bicycles available in Toulouse .
The energy they generate could then be " harvested " overnight and used for streetlights or the national grid , Marciel said .
There is still some way to go .
Paris still promotes itself as " the city of light " .
Coinciding with the protests about night pollution were celebrations involving spectacular illuminations of the Eiffel tower .
Apparently , the evil feline believes it ’s necessary to educate Hello Kitty fanatics on hygiene and cleanliness in the bathtub or shower .
Why does it not surprise me that this is the way she goes about doing it ?

The town 's Northern League Mayor , Franco Claretti , ordered the move after receiving new powers that entitled him to check the residency status of all foreigners in the town , which has a total population of around 8,500 , Northern League member Claudio Abiendi , the councillor in charge of security in the town , which is an hour 's drive east of Milan , said that so far 50 per cent of those checked did not have permission to be in Italy .
Commenting on the timing of the policy , he told La Repubblica newspaper : " For me Christmas is n't the holiday of hospitality , but rather that of the Christian tradition and of our identity . "
Accused NASA hacker Gary McKinnon has won the support of a key Parliamentary committee , which has called on the British government to block a request to extradite him to the US .
In a letter to Home Secretary Alan Johnson , the Home Affairs Committee said there was a " serious lack of equality " in the extradition treaty invoked in McKinnon 's case .
The missive came as Johnson 's office is reviewing its authority to stop the forced transfer of the 34 - year - old hacker , who suffers from Asperger 's Syndrome .
" Because of Mr. McKinnon 's precarious state of mental health , the committee is of the view that he should not be extradited to the USA and that you should exercise your discretion in this case , " the letter , signed by committee chairman Keith Vaz , stated .
It went on to say committee MPs had received " clear , legal opinion " from lawyers that Johnson had more authority in the case that the minister believed .
The letter called on Johnson to " comprehensively review " the controversial treaty .
Johnson 's office issued a statement that largely rebuffed the committee .
" As the home secretary told the Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday , the evidence that must be provided for a US extradition request to proceed in the UK is in practice the same as for a UK request to proceed in the US , " it stated .
" The suggestion that the operation of the Extradition Act needs to be reviewed comprehensively is unnecessary . "
The statement went on to say that the office had only limited discretion to deny the request .
" Unless the evidence shows that extradition would breach the European Convention on Human Rights it would be unlawful to refuse extradition , " it stated .
The exchange follows a hearing earlier this week where McKinnon 's mother told MPs her self - confessed hacker son would rather die than face extradition to the US for trial .
" We were told this treaty was to be used mainly for terrorists , " she was quoted as saying .
" People like Gary are not terrorists .
We should stand up to America and say , ' This is wrong . ' "

from the book “ Your Music and People ” : Emphasize meaning over price .
2009-09-21
A musician named Griffin House used to sell CDs at his gigs for $ 15 .
He ’d mention it once or twice from the stage , and sell about $ 300 per night on average .
One day his manager , Terry McBride , asked him to try a completely different approach .
He said :
Tell the audience , “ It ’s really important to us that you have our CD .
We worked so hard on it and are so proud of it , that we want you to have it , no matter what .
Pay what you want , but even if you have no money , please take one tonight . ”
Say this again before the end of the show .
“ Please , nobody leave here tonight without getting a copy of our CD .
We ’ve shared this great show together so it would mean a lot to us if you ’d take one . ”
It changes the request from a commercial pitch to an emotional connection .
Allowing them to get a CD for no money just reinforces that .
As soon as Griffin made this change , he started selling about $ 1200 per night on average , even including those people who took it for free !
The average selling price was about $ 10 .
But the important part came next :
Because every person left each show with a CD , they were more likely to remember who they saw , tell friends about it , listen to it later , and become an even bigger fan afterwards .
Then , when the band returned to a town where they had insisted that everyone take a CD , attendance at those shows doubled !
The people that took a CD became long - term fans and brought their friends to future shows .
So , whatever you ’re selling , emphasize the meaning of it , not the price .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , one of the greatest college and professional basketball players of all time , says he has been diagnosed with a form of blood cancer .
" I have chronic myeloid leukemia , " Abdul - Jabbar told CNN .
He said he received the diagnosis last December .
The 62 - year - old former center for the Los Angeles Lakers said aside from having to see his doctor and checking his blood levels on a regular basis , having chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) has n't significantly affected his quality of life .
Abdul - Jabbar said he 's going public now to educate people about this disease .
" I think it 's possible for someone in my position to help save lives , " he said .
Abdul - Jabbar is best known as the 7 - foot - 2 center who led the UCLA Bruins to three NCAA championships in the 1960s , then went on to win one NBA championship with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971 and five more with the Los Angeles Lakers before retiring in 1989 .
He also has dabbled in acting , notably as an airline pilot in the 1980 comedy " Airplane ! "
However , raising awareness about cancer has been part of his portfolio for some time now , too .
He said cancer has been prominent in his life .
" My grandfather died from colorectal cancer , my uncle died from colorectal cancer and my father almost died from colorectal cancer , " Abdul - Jabbar said .
He added that he has the gene for colorectal cancer .
This led him to get involved in a colorectal cancer awareness campaign in the African - American community .
He 's also participated in an NBA - sponsored prostate cancer awareness campaign .
But now he 's a cancer patient himself .
He said he first realized something was wrong when he began having hot flashes and sweats , something he admits was n't normal , " even for someone my age . "
After seeing his physician , blood work showed he had a " white blood cell count that was sky - high . "
The National Cancer Institute describes CML as a " slowly progressing disease in which too many white blood cells are made in the bone marrow . "
Abdul - Jabbar said when he received the diagnosis of early stage CML , he wanted to know what was possible in terms of treatment .
He said his specialist told him the cancer diagnosis did not have to be a death sentence , as long as he followed a proper treatment regimen .
Abdul - Jabbar would n't reveal what his prognosis is , but he did say he is managing his disease and that having CML " does n't impact my life too significantly . "
In the process of researching CML , Abdul - Jabbar says he was shocked to learn that some cancer patients do not regularly take their cancer medication .
This led him to approach the pharmaceutical company Novartis about launching an educational campaign .
Abdul - Jabbar said Novartis is paying him for his travel and time , but the idea for the campaign was his .
" The message is simple :
You have to have the expert advice of a specialist .
You have to take your medicine and get your blood analyzed , " he said .
In an effort to provide more information about this type of cancer , he is launching a Facebook page -- Kareem Abdul - Jabbar Patient Advocate -- supported by the pharmaceutical company , which manufactures drugs to treat this and other types of cancer .
According to the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the average person 's chance of getting CML is less than 1 in 500 .
The cancer society says CML is slightly more common in men than women , and it accounts for 10 percent to 15 percent of all leukemias or blood cancers .
The ACS estimates just over 5,000 people will be diagnosed with CML this year , and that 470 will die from it .
The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society estimates the five - year survival rate for CML of 44.4 percent .
More information on CML can be found at www.cancer.org and www.leukemia-lymphoma.org.
What does a star on the edge of death look like ?
Perhaps not what you think :
This series of images [ as usual , click to embiggen ] , from the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope , will take some ' splainin .
Hang on .
A supernova -- an exploding star -- is among the brightest single objects in the known Universe .
A supernova can release as much energy in a single second as the Sun will in a thousand years .
Most people think of supernovae as massive stars exploding at the end of their lives , but there is another kind .
When the Sun finally dies in a few billion more years , it will shed most of the material making up its outer layers , revealing the white - hot , dense core .
This superhot ball will have half the mass of the Sun in it , but only be the size of the Earth .
We call such a thing a white dwarf .
If a white dwarf orbits a normal star like the Sun , it can draw material off .
This matter piles up on the surface and can eventually detonate like a stellar thermonuclear bomb .
We call these Type Ia supernovae .
The thing is , massive stars are bright , so we can see them a long way off .
We know of many stars in our galaxy that can blow that way ( though all too far away to hurt us ) .
But a Type Ia progenitor is faint , and hard to spot .
Usually , the first notice we get of one is when it explodes , and we see the sudden and vast increase in light in a distant galaxy .
But astronomers have spotted a potential Type Ia supernova in our own galaxy , a ticking time bomb about 25,000 light years away .
Called V445 Puppis , in November 2000 it underwent an explosive event : not a supernova , but a regular nova , the detonation of small ( in cosmic terms ) amount of material .
Still , it ejected a lot of matter -- several times the mass of the entire Earth -- at very high speed , about 24 million kilometers per hour ( 14 million mph ) .
That would reach from the Earth to the Moon in one minute flat .
Over the course of several years , astronomers have taken images of the expanding debris , and the change -- seen in the picture above -- is dramatic , lovely , and terrifying .
The debris did not expand spherically because the two stars are in a tight orbit , circling each other rapidly .
The matter drawn off the normal star forms a thick disk around the white dwarf .
When the material on the surface exploded , it could n't go through the disk , so it went up and down , above and below the disk .
Over time it forms what 's called a bipolar structure , because it comes out of the poles of the star .
We see lots of similar bipolar objects , but not usually in a system that 's about to go bye - bye .
Tellingly , there is no detectable hydrogen in the system .
The surface of the white dwarf appears to be mostly helium , and the normal star looks to be dumping only helium on the white dwarf .
Type
Ia supernovae are hydrogen poor , even lacking it completely , so that fits .
Also , the mass of the white dwarf in V445 Puppis is on the thin hairy edge of the maximum it can be before it blows .
When a white dwarf reaches 1.4 times the mass of the Sun , it goes kablooie ( I had to calculate this as a homework problem in grad school ) .
V445 's mass ?
1.35 times that of the Sun. Yikes .
So when will the system go off ?
Hard to say .
It may not be for thousands millions of years .
At that distance , it will be very bright in the sky , brighter than Venus .
It wo n't hurt us ; it 's way too far away to to do that .
But a nearby supernova of this type would be a huge boon to astronomy !
It 's this flavor of supernova we use to measure the expansion of the Universe ( since they are so bright they can be seen very far away , and tend to blow up with the same brightness every time ) .
It 's a little funny to think that the death of a star so many quadrillions of kilometers away can actually be a benefit to us .
But remember , the calcium in our bones and iron in our blood came from supernovae like the one V445 Puppis will eventually become , so not only do we learn more about the Universe from them , we owe our very existence to them as well .
Regularly playing a musical instrument changes the anatomy and function of the brain and may be used in therapy to improve cognitive skills .
There is growing evidence that musicians have structurally and functionally different brains compared with non-musicians .
In particular , the areas of the brain used to process music are larger or more active in musicians .
Even just starting to learn a musical instrument can changes the neurophysiology of the brain .
Lutz Jäncke , a member of Faculty of 1000 Medicine , proposes using music in neuropsychological therapy , for example to improve language skills , memory , or mood .
In a review for Faculty of 1000 Biology Reports , an online publication in which leading researchers highlight advances in their field , Jäncke summarizes recent studies of professional musicians .
The brain regions involved in music processing are also required for other tasks , such as memory or language skills .
" If music has such a strong influence on brain plasticity , " writes Jäncke , " this raises the question of whether this effect can be used to enhance cognitive performance . "
Several studies indeed show that musical practice increases memory and language skills , and Jäncke suggests expanding this field : " Hopefully , the current trend in the use of musicians as a model for brain plasticity will continue ... and extend to the field of neuropsychological rehabilitation .

( Health.com ) --
Young women should have their first Pap test no sooner than age 21 , regardless of when they become sexually active , say new guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
Earlier screening for cervical cancer may lead to unnecessary and possibly harmful treatments for an increasingly rare cancer , according to ACOG , the leading U.S. professional organization for obstetricians and gynecologists .
After age 21 , women should have a Pap test every two years , instead of every year .
At age 30 , if a woman has no history of cervical cancer and has had three normal Pap tests in a row , she can be screened every three years , rather than every two to three years .
( Women with certain risk factors , such as those who are HIV positive or who have a suppressed immune system , may need to be screened more often . )
However , annual pelvic exams -- which are necessary for performing a Pap test -- wo n't necessarily be going away .
ACOG says it may still be appropriate for women to visit their doctor annually for a pelvic exam , even if a Pap test is n't performed .
And sexually active adolescents should n't wait until age 21 to see a gynecologist for the first time .
( Such visits do n't necessarily have to include a pelvic exam . )
The guidelines were published this week in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology .
Health.com :
Have your best gyno visit ever
ACOG had previously recommended that women receive their first Pap test three years after having sex for the first time , or no later than age 21 , with annual checkups after that .
Why the change ?
Rates of cervical cancer , which is caused by the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus , have declined by 50 percent since the 1970s .
Cervical cancer is now extremely rare , especially among women under the age of 30 , the group most affected by the new guidelines .
On average , just 14 cases occur nationwide in women between the ages of 15 and 19 each year , according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Among women ages 20 to 24 , an average of 123 cases occur .
" The risk of invasive cancer is so exceedingly rare in this age group that to start screening at age 21 will still pick up the overwhelming majority of cases , " says Dr. Alan Waxman , a professor of ob - gyn at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine , in Albuquerque , who led the preparation of the document spelling out the recommendations .
" The incidence of cervical cancer in 15 - to 19 - year - olds has been reported at 1 to 2 per million girls .
That 's a lot of unnecessary pelvic exams and unnecessary potential treatments that can be avoided . "

How to protect yourself from HPV and cervical cancer
The cervical cancer rate will probably drop even further due to newer vaccines like Gardasil , which are now approved for HPV prevention in girls and women ages 9 to 26 .
However , ACOG says the vaccines wo n't affect cervical cancer rates for 15 to 20 years , so they did not play a role in the new cervical cancer screening guidelines .
Such vaccines do n't protect against all types of HPV that can cause cancer , so Pap tests are still necessary .
Health.com : How HPV causes cervical cancer and abnormal Pap smears
About half of all people are infected with HPV at some point in their lifetime , although the infection often goes away on its own .
( Only in some cases does the virus damage cervical cells , causing abnormalities that can be picked up on a Pap test . )
Studies that ACOG consulted also show that screening older women every two to three years is nearly as effective as screening annually .
And for women who've had healthy Pap tests for years , screening could probably be stopped around ages 65 to 70 .
Dr. Mark Einstein , an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at Montefiore Medical Center , in the Bronx , New York , and a spokesman for the Society of Gynecologic Oncology , says the new guidelines are a " data - driven fine - tuning , " not a major overhaul .
" It 's important for patients to realize that the science behind the guidelines is strong , " Einstein adds .
ACOG 's revisions reflect a trend toward a more conservative approach to managing the cervical abnormalities that sometimes lead to cancer .
Cervical lesions are common , especially among adolescents .
About 1 in 5 Pap tests in that age group will turn up an abnormality , but the vast majority of low - grade cervical lesions -- up to 90 percent -- will get better on their own within three years .
Among older women , the rates are lower , but low - grade lesions still rarely progress to the precancerous stage .
Moreover , a series of studies in recent years suggests that women who have cervical lesions surgically removed or burned away with a laser may be at a higher risk of giving birth to a premature or underweight baby .
As a result , ACOG and other organizations now recommend monitoring the condition rather than immediately treating it when some types of lesions are found .
Scaling back the schedule for Pap tests will minimize unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures , the guidelines say .
Although they also cite the expense of screening and the anxiety and " emotional impact " caused by abnormal Pap tests , " the risk of treatment was the driving factor " behind the changes , says Waxman .
ACOG 's recommendations come less than a week after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) , an independent panel of experts that advises the federal government on preventive care , released new guidelines for breast cancer screening .
The task force recommended that women begin mammograms at age 50 , not 40 , and decrease the frequency thereafter .
Both the mammography and Pap test guidelines are part of a broader , evidence - based shift toward less screening , says Dr. Karen Soren , the director of adolescent health services at Columbia University Medical Center , in New York City .
" We always used to feel that the more screens you get , the better .
And I think there 's a new philosophy , " says Soren , who has studied Pap tests in adolescents .
" The whole medical community in general is saying , ' Perhaps we 're overscreening . '
And that relates to mammography as well . "
By changing its guidelines , ACOG is breaking ranks with the other main authorities on cervical cancer .
The American Cancer Society and the USPSTF both recommend that women get their first Pap test within three years of having sex , or at age 21 .
Health.com :
The most common STDs : HPV , herpes , and chlamydia
The ACS recommends that women ages 21 to 30 be tested every one or two years , depending on whether a conventional or liquid - based Pap test is used .
Women over 30 with three consecutive normal Pap tests can be screened every two to three years , again depending on which tests are used .
( ACOG guidelines do not distinguish between the different types of testing . )
The USPSTF 's mammogram guidelines , which deviated from those of the ACS , caused an uproar and have sown confusion among women , but experts agree that ACOG 's recommendations are n't likely to have the same effect .
In fact , the ACOG committee that assembled the guidelines believes it will help eliminate confusion and simplify care .
" Now age 21 is there as a landmark point in a young woman 's lifetime : ' Gee , I 'm 21 , now it 's time to get my Pap test , ' " says Waxman .
The hope , he says , is that the ACS and the USPSTF will head in the same direction with their own recommendations .
" It 's very frustrating when you have three major professional organizations saying three different things , " Waxman says .
Setting a woman 's first Pap test at age 21 is clearer than pegging it to sexual activity , says Soren .
" The recommendations have been changing and evolving , and people have been slow to catch on , " she says .
" Patients have been asking for different things .
I think the fact that there are concrete guidelines now is actually better . "
Fred Wyand , a spokesman for the American Social Health Association , a nonprofit organization that raises awareness about HPV and cervical cancer prevention , downplayed the potential for confusion among the public or health - care providers .
The debate over the schedule for Pap tests is " not new , " says Wyand .
" The guidelines are new , but the discussion that preceded it dates back years .
So I do n't think anybody 's going to be caught off guard . "
Experts stress that annual pelvic exams may still be appropriate even though Pap tests will be performed less frequently .
And , most importantly , women who have received the HPV vaccine need to stick to the same screening schedule as everyone else .

" It is number one on our list to make sure that patients know that vaccination does n't replace screening , " says Einstein .
" We 're not ready to be making separate guidelines for vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients , and we wo n't be ready to do so for some time . "

The superstars of World Wrestling Entertainment invade South Park tonight .
Check out this video featuring John Cena and Edge .
Cartman and the boys attend a WWE event and find their calling as pro wrestlers .
The boys then join the school wrestling team expecting a WWE experience .
The concept sounds great and I am sure there are many wrestling fans that can relate to this .
The first airing begins tonight and will be replayed throughout the week .
Wow , the WWE missed a golden opportunity with this one .
The WWE and South Park should have co-promoted the episode and had the boys Guest Host WWE RAW .
They could have had the animated South Park crew up on the Titan Tron making matches and running the show .
I suggested something similar involving Family Guy a few months ago , but this one was handed right to them .
I think the big joke here is that South Park airs on Comedy Central which is a Viacom channel .
Viacom also owns and distributes Spike TV which airs TNA Impact !
Instead of promoting its own product , Viacom bypassed TNA Wrestling to feature the WWE .
Sorry TNA , but apparently you are an afterthought on your own network .

So your doctor says it ’s time to consider that hip replacement .
Trouble is , more than a dozen firms make artificial hips , and there ’ve been plenty of recalls — no small inconvenience when the recalled product resides in your pelvis .
So how do you know which implant — or arterial stent , or prosthetic knee joint — performs best ?
Can you trust your doctor ’s judgment ?
We ’ve been left jaded , after all , by the endless reports of drugmakers ’ seducing physicians with golf and spa weekends , expensive gifts , and lucrative consulting contracts .
Well , now that federal investigators have quietly turned their sights on the makers of medical devices — a $ 200 billion industry whose marketing practices have seen relatively little scrutiny — it ’s becoming clear that implant companies are just as solicitous of doctors as Big Pharma has been .
Consider Minneapolis - based Medtronic , the country ’s leading device maker , which hauled in nearly $ 15 billion in 2009 sales despite having become a repeat target for state and federal prosecutors .
In 2006 , Medtronic agreed to pay the feds $ 40 million to settle allegations that from 1998 through 2003 it had set up sham consulting and royalty agreements , trips to strip clubs in Tennessee , and other incentives to entice surgeons to use its spinal products .
Last year , Medtronic signed a $ 75 million settlement related to charges that Kyphon , a firm it acquired in 2007 , helped bilk Medicare of hundreds of millions of dollars .
Kyphon allegedly encouraged hospitals to keep patients — mostly Medicare beneficiaries — overnight for what should have been an outpatient procedure .
This allowed hospitals to bill up to five times more for the operation .
Kyphon also allegedly boosted sales by giving kickbacks and perks to doctors and administrators .
Now Medtronic is again in hot water with the feds , who are asking whether the company has promoted one of its most lucrative products — a bone - growth - stimulating protein called Infuse — for purposes not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration .
In July 2008 , FDA officials warned that Infuse , approved only for oral , facial , and lower spine procedures , can cause severe breathing problems when used off - label for neck surgeries .
The public warning , together with the probe and the resulting bad press , put a crimp in sales , prompting CEO William Hawkins to fret that Medtronic faced a “ perfect storm . ”
It was n’t over .
This past May , the New York Times ran an exposé indicating that Timothy Kuklo — a former Army surgeon whom Medtronic had paid nearly $ 800,000 in consulting fees over several years — had falsified data for a medical journal article citing an unusually high success rate in treating wounded soldiers with Infuse .
He also reportedly forged the signatures of four former colleagues on the manuscript .
( The article was retracted . )
The company said it paid Kuklo to do other research on Infuse but did n’t review his falsified study prior to publication .
In June , Medtronic revealed in a financial filing that it had received a Justice Department subpoena related to the case .
Medtronic is hardly the only device maker to fall under federal scrutiny .
From June 2006 through July 2009 , various industry players have paid more than $ 535 million to settle 11 federal whistleblower cases involving illegal marketing activities , according to Taxpayers Against Fraud , a DC nonprofit .
“ The medical device industry right now is where the pharmaceutical industry was five to ten years ago , both in terms of kickbacks and off - label marketing , ” explains Tim McCormack , a lawyer with Phillips & Cohen , a Washington law firm that specializes in whistleblower cases .
“ Individual sales reps sometimes serve as concierge services for the doctors , ” plying them with tickets to pricey concerts , spa excursions , and golf outings , he adds .
In September 2007 , four of the top five manufacturers of artificial hips and knees — among them Zimmer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics — said they would pay $ 311 million to settle federal charges that they gave doctors millions of dollars in kickbacks , often in the guise of consulting fees .
The government deferred prosecution of the four companies so long as they complied with the settlement terms .
In a separate case , device maker Synthes did n’t get off so easy .
The firm was indicted , along with four executives , for testing an unapproved bone - mending cement on human subjects — three of whom died following their surgeries .
This past summer , all four of the execs pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges .
The government is also scrutinizing doctors who moonlight for the device industry , promises Lewis Morris , chief counsel to the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general .
“ We in law enforcement are focusing on physicians who accept kickbacks at the same time we ’re looking at companies who give kickbacks , ” he says .
“ It takes two to tango . ”
In February 2008 , the Senate Special Committee on Aging held a “ Surgeons for Sale ” hearing to document the pervasiveness of what Sen. Herb Kohl ( D - Wis. ) deemed “ unethical payments . ”
This past January , Kohl and several colleagues , including Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2009 , which would compel makers of medical devices , drugs , vaccines , and the like to publicly disclose any payment of more than $ 100 to a doctor ; failure to report could result in fines of up to $ 1 million .
“ Studies show that when the device and drug industries have an influence on what doctors prescribe , health care costs go up , ” Kohl told me .
His bill , Kohl promises , “ will help remove industry bias from the medical world . ”
Getting device makers in line may hinge on the fate of health care reform .
Kohl ’s aides expect his legislation will be folded into the Senate health bill ; at press time the House was considering an even tougher provision .
More than 80 drug and device firms are lobbying on the issue , and many , including Medtronic , say they favor some unspecified level of transparency .
But it ’s also clear they ’re aiming to simplify their regulatory paperwork ; the top device trade group , for instance , supports “ appropriate ” disclosures , so long as the bill in question preempts a “ patchwork approach by all 50 states . ”
In 1970 , Patric M. Verrone , age 11 , started amassing the 2.75 - inch plastic replicas of US presidents made by toy company Louis Marx .
Sadly , the series petered out well before Watergate .
There would be no miniature Gerald Fords , no tiny Jimmy Carters , no Lilliputian Bill Clintons .
The geeky completist in Verrone refused to let the line of micropoliticians die — why , it would be like ending X - Men at issue 93 !
Verrone , now 50 , went on to be a writer on Futurama and The Simpsons , and he serves as president of the Writers Guild of America , West .
But in his spare time , he brought the progression of plastic POTUSes up - to - date , in his kitchen .
And when he finished the presidents , he started on the losing candidates , too .
He 's also working his way through the US Supreme Court justices , past and present .
He begins by making rubber latex molds of whichever original figurine best matches the body type he needs :
His Obama is based on Louis Marx 's JFK ; his McCain is a modded Nixon .
" That was n't meant to be a political statement , " he insists .
Verrone shapes fine facial features with " everything from fingernails to toothpicks to dental tools and X - Acto knives . "
You can admire his handiwork at Verrone.com — and nab a Sonia Sotomayor figurine for $ 25 .
She may have the torso of Mamie Eisenhower , but from the neck up she 's pure Sotomayor .
Verrone says it 's easier to make a toy version of a judge who passed away before photography was invented : " People are n't going to complain , ' That does n't look like Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth . ' "
Here 's an extended version of the interview between Patric M. Verrone and the writer of this piece , Olivier Knox .
Knox , a Washington , D.C. , correspondent for Agence France - Presse who also happens to be well - versed in Star Wars action figures , was able to keep up with Verrone as he detailed his intertwined obsessions with politicians and classic toys .
Samples of Verrone 's Work US Presidents
Jimmy Carter
Ronald Reagan
George Bush
Bill Clinton
George W. Bush
Barack Obama
US Supreme Court Justices
Ruth Bader Ginsburg
Clarence Thomas
David Souter
Olivier Knox : Can you tell me the background of these Louis Marx figurines ?
Patric M. Verrone : For about 30 years , the Marx toy company produced little 3 - inch figurines , first of generals , then of presidents , and then other related historical figures .
This was throughout the course of the ' 50s , '60s , and early ' 70s .
Louis Marx himself was a friend of Dwight Eisenwhower and was allegedly " the Man Who Saved Christmas . "
According to legend , in World War II , the Congress wanted to cut back on domestic spending so they were going to ban Christmas , and Louis Marx went to Capitol Hill and pushed to save Christmas , so to speak .
Anyway , he put out these figurines for about 30 years .
And the president figurines are the ones that were the most popular when I was a kid .
They sold them in supermarkets , and at gas stations , and the idea that you could collect the presidents was kind of a big deal to me .
My original set I got as a kid in 1970 was from a coupon in Parade magazine .
When the Marx toy company was sold to Quaker Oats in the early ' 70s they stopped making the presidents , and so the last one that anybody had was Nixon .
Once eBay came along in the late '90s , I was able to find all these other off - beat figures , prototypes , and alternative poses of Kennedy and Nixon — unreleased figures that are excruciatingly rare .
I think I probably have the largest private collection of these figures outside of the Marx Museum in West Virginia .
I had a set of these in the office during the original incarnation of Futurama , and when the show was initially cancelled , I decided I would take it upon myself to make the presidents after Nixon .
As prototypes , I used candidates that the Louis Marx company had already made .
For example , I turned Hubert Humphrey into Gerald Ford and Bobby Kennedy into Jimmy Carter .
They had made a Reagan in 1968 as a presidential candidate , when he was still governor of California .
All I had to do was give him more of a pompadour and age him a bit .
And then I turned Nelson Rockefeller into Clinton .
The first Bush was based on a George Romney , and the second , George W. Bush , was an alternative Eisenhower .
After making my own set , I made a second set and put it up on eBay .
It sold for $ 700 .
So I said " OK , there 's obviously a demand for these , at least from two people who were bidding on that one set . "
Since that time , I 've sold about 500 sets of the presidents .
Then I got it in my own craw that I would make the chief justices of the Supreme Court .
And so I went back and turned a James Madison into a John Jay , all the way up to turning a Harry Truman into William Rehnquist .
Then I started making the sitting associate justices of the court , O'Connor and Ginsburg and all the rest .
Sandra O'Connor was also made out of a Mamie Eisenhower .
This will make you laugh : Ruth Ginsburg was made out of a Jackie Kennedy .
Every so often I 'll make an older justice , you know , an Oliver Wendell Holmes or Cardozo or Brandeis .
And then when Roberts and Alito were appointed I made them .
So now Sotomayor comes along and it's the natural process for me .
Knox :
As someone who covered the confirmation hearings , I 'm curious :
At what point did you start designing that Sotomayor figurine ?
Verrone :
As soon as Souter announced his retirement , I said ' I have to make another one . '
In this case , I could n't start until I knew if it was going to be a man or a woman .
Once she was announced , I set aside a Mamie Eisenhower , and then watching the confirmation hearings , it looked like she was going to get the votes , I went ahead and made it .
Knox :
Can you walk me through that process ?
How long does it typically take to make a figurine ?
What sort of equipment are we talking about ?
It 's the old joke about Picasso : How do you sculpt an elephant ?
You carve away the stuff that does n't look like an elephant .
So I take one of the original Marx figurines , and I use a modeling clay to change the original to look like the new subject , and then add a robe , and then I use a rubber stamp to put the name on the base .
Then I cast it and strike copies .
And that 's pretty much it .
And as far as tools are concerned , it 's everything from fingernails to toothpicks to little dental tools and X - Acto knives .
The actual molds are old rolls of toilet paper , and a lot of home appliances are used .
I do it all in my kitchen .
I can sit down and actually have a prototype in about two to three hours , then the actual casting and striking and painting , that 's probably two to three days .
Once you have the system in place , I can do another one in another hour .
You cast it , and then you trim it , and then you paint it .
So making number one is a multiday process , making number two takes an hour .
Knox :
When did you make Obama ?
April 2007 .
I made it sort of figuring he would n't get the nomination , but I thought it would be a novelty item , a serious African - American candidate might be something I can sell .
By that point , I actually had a little more facility playing with the bodies , so for Obama I was able to take a John F. Kennedy body , give him a different arm , and change the pose ever so slightly .
I made a prototype Hillary Clinton that I 've never sold , and there were maybe a half dozen Sarah Palins that I made , and I just have n't had the energy to go back and make any more .
Knox :
How closely do you follow politics ?
Verrone : Oh , pretty closely .
I would n't call myself a political junkie , per se , but I read the papers , I read the blogs .
I have been the president of the Writers ' Guild for the past four years , and during the presidential election we were in communication with both Clinton and Obama camps .
We 've had ongoing meetings with Governor Schwarzenegger .
Having been a lawyer , I am probably more of a Supreme Court junkie than most people .
I was a writer for The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the late 1980s when Robert Bork was appointed , so I was extremely aware of that process , and how it changed the way this sort of thing is done .
( It used to be that Taft would appoint somebody , and the Senate would approve it that afternoon . )
Right now I guess I 've done 60 historic justices , and there 's about 50 to go .
I spent much of this weekend working on the remainder of the " Nine Old Men " that Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court with in the '30s to dilute the power of the Hoover and Coolidge and Harding appointees .
So for people who were dying for a Willis Van Devanter and a George Sutherland and a Pierce Butler , they 're coming !
( Laughs . )
There 's a problem that you get with justices that you do n't get with presidents who serve for only four or eight years .
They age .
Clarence Thomas looked different when he was appointed in 1992 versus now .
I now paint him with grayer hair than I used to .
And Scalia has this beard that comes and goes , though I 've typically kept him clean - shaven .
Knox :
So is it like the Battle - Damaged X - Wing Fighter ?
Verrone : I 'm laughing , because I do n't know that that is .
Knox : Oh .
OK , so Kenner found a way to sell you the same Star Wars toy twice , which was they would sell you the Luke Skywalker X - Wing Fighter , and they would make this one they called the Battle - Damaged one , and the difference was that the stickers for the Battle - Damaged one had burn marks .
Verrone :
No , no , the only alternatives that I 've done are William Rehnquist as associate justice , and then William Rehnquist as chief justice , who has more white in his hair and has those gold stripes on he shoulders of his robe that he had when he was chief .
But as I say , as time goes by , I will try to " gray up " the justices .
I 've actually had lawyers who argued before the court , who ordered a set of figures because they wanted the justices that they argued before .
So I painted Thurgood Marshall the way he looked at that time , later in his life .
Knox :
Have you ever had feedback from someone you sculpted ?
Verrone : No. Someone bought a Justice Alito from me and said , " I 'm meeting him next week and I 'm going to give it to him . "
Then I got an email back from the guy saying that Alito 's wife was going to send me a thank - you note .
But I have n't gotten that .
Earl Warren 's grandchildren have figures of him .
One of Mitt Romney 's sons ordered five or six copies of his grandfather George Romney .
I know Kristin Gore , who worked on Futurama .
She , of course , is Al Gore 's daughter .
I made one of him when I went back and did a handful of failed candidates from the past 60 years , going back to Thomas Dewey .
I 've met Al Gore several times , but I never gave him one .
Knox :
What do your kids think of Dad 's figurines ?
Verrone :
Well , they 're now at the age where they want to help , which is nice .
My oldest , who was about 10 when we started doing this , wanted to sculpt as well , and he turned William Henry Harrison into Dracula .
( Laughs . )
And of course he wanted to list it on eBay , and I had to say , " No , you 'll want to keep this one . "

The following true story was told to me by a woman who chooses to remain anonymous for privacy reasons .
If you think you have Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder , you can visit this forum for help .
I had my first orgasm at the age of 17 .
I was sitting at my desk at school when all of a sudden , I felt a warm , pulsing feeling in my genital area .
My vagina flared up and I could n't think straight .
It was like someone had squeegeed my thoughts away .
I was like , whoa , what 's that ?
It felt really erotic and good , but I was also freaked out , scared , and confused .
After that , it started happening a few times a day .
I searched online for spontaneous orgasms , but all I found was weird porn .
It kept getting worse .
During my second semester of senior year , I counted orgasms on a sheet of paper .
I was having 100 and 200 a day .
I ran to hide in the bathroom between classes to relieve the pressure .
By the time I started college , the orgasms became even more intense and disruptive , and I was having trouble concentrating .
I became really depressed .
I did n't know what was wrong with me , and I was n't getting any better .
I cried a lot .
I hid in the bathroom .
I became violently protective of my privacy .
In the beginning , I told everyone I trusted about my condition .
People said things like : " You 're so lucky ! " and " Dude , I 'd love to date you . "
They did n't understand why I wanted it to go away , and labeled me a drama queen .
The school psychiatrist thought I was crazy .
After my sophomore year , I bought a bunch of vibrators and took medical leave .
One day in 2003 , a friend sent me an article in the Boston Globe about a newly discovered condition called Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome * .
When I read it , I started crying hysterically — it described exactly what I was going through .
I immediately made an appointment at the institute the article linked to , and after hours of tests , I was diagnosed with PSAS .
My engorged genitalia and hypersensitivity made me a textbook case .
Every other doctor had thought I was just a delusional hypochondriac .
PSAS feels like having a second heartbeat .
No , it 's more than that .
It 's alive — it has its own life force , a mind of its own .
I often wonder if this is how teenage boys feel about their erections .
My parents pretend my PSAS does n't exist .
It makes me feel uncomfortable and rejected .
My mother is very conservative — she has trouble saying the word " orgasm " out loud , and she thinks I 'm a pervert because I have toys .
A couple months ago , out of the blue , she said , " You still having that orgasm problem ? "
That was only the second time she asked about it since 2003 .
I sometimes wish I could make reference to it in normal conversations without feeling like a freak , but I understand that PSAS is n't exactly dinner conversation .
Every time I do something , I have to evaluate my situation .
Where am I ?
Are there other people around ?
How well do I know them ?
What is the likelihood that , if I do n't get someplace private in time , things could get complicated ?
Can I make noise ?
( Being vocal is n't necessary , but it helps release more of the pressure . )
I avoid triggers — things like music with heavy bass , vibrations from riding a train or an idle car , cold air , musky cologne , darkness , stress , scary movies , romantic movies , unexpected touch , a full bladder .
PSAS is completely unrelated to sex drive .
Watching sex scenes does nothing for me , but the other day , when a friend put his hand on my back , I found it really hard to contain a screaming orgasm .
If my heart rate shoots up too high for too long , I flare up .
I avoided exercise and gained a lot of weight .
One time , I was hugging a male relative and I felt an orgasm arise .
It felt really dirty and wrong , and I totally freaked out .
Now , I try to avoid hugs in general unless I feel ready for them .
I 've been with my boyfriend for about six years , but we still have n't had sex .
I do n't know if I 'll ever be ready to do it .
Because of a vulvar pain disorder I have that sometimes comes with PSAS , I know it will hurt like hell .
Others who have PSAS say that sex is not satisfying at all — the orgasms associated with sex are nothing compared to the ones induced by the condition .
Sometimes I wish I could have sex with him because I think he deserves to have a ' real ' girlfriend , but honestly , I just enjoy being held by him and not having it feel inappropriate .
He 's been very patient and understanding ; he 's my best friend , and we talk every night .
I 'm 24 now , and have learned to manage PSAS pretty well .
I discovered dancing — it 's a great alternative to jogging because it 's not as cardio - intensive .
As long I take breaks between routines , folk dancing or doing salsa does n't cause a flare up .
Last week , I was at the movies and had to leave twice because I was flaring up .
Each time , I ran to the bathroom and tapped my heels on the floor to hear if there was anyone else around .
Then I locked myself into a stall , braced myself against the stall door , and let the orgasm run its course .
I missed about 15 minutes of the film , but that 's just one of the many things that result from managing PSAS and its collateral damage .
My orgasms feel like a cosmic joke .
I do n't know why this happened to me and not someone else .
If I did n't have PSAS , I 'd be much more outgoing , and I probably would have finished college two years earlier .
I 'd have a normal sex life .
I feel like I 'm lugging around a shadow , a ghost that I just can't shake .
It depresses me that I 'm stuck with it , probably for the rest of my life , but strangely enough , I do n't want to be cured instantly of PSAS .
It appeared suddenly in my life , and if it disappeared just as suddenly , I would always be looking over my shoulder , and I 'm not sure I would know who I was .
I would rather have it slowly fade away , but if it does n't , well , I 'm doing my best to make peace with this part of my life .

Everything is proprietary
The PSP 3000 simply works with the cables you have .
The hardware has a mini-USB port on the top of the system so you can move files or hook up accessories , and you can connect your PSP to your PS3 using any USB cable .
In fact , one USB cable attached to your PS3 will let you both charge your controllers and connect to your PSP to move content .
That was a good thing , so of course it was time to get rid of it .
The PSP
Go now uses a proprietary plug , which means no more generic USB cables .
Your old chargers wo n't work either .
In fact , the charging solution is rather tedious : you plug the cable into the PSP , and then into a block of plastic , and then you plug the power cable into the other side of the plastic , and then plug that into the wall .
Let that sink in : the cable you use to charge the hardware comes in three parts .
You do n't own a single cable that will work with the PSP Go .
It gets even sillier , however .
You can use the Bluetooth capabilities of the system to link a Dual Shock 3 to the system , in order to play with an actual controller .
That 's a pretty cool feature , right ?
The only problem is , without USB you need to connect the controller , and the PSP Go , to a PS3 .
So to sync the controller to the system you need another system , a USB cable , the proprietary PSP Go cable , and the controller .
It 's not exactly the most elegant solution , and in this situation the PS3 works as a $ 300 adapter .
Again , the reasons for this are obvious : retailers get to sell high - margin replacement cables , and that also benefits Sony .
Those who lose out ?
The gamers .
Getting started is a pain
This is petty , but I love new hardware .
I love the look of it , I love the smell of it , I love taking it out of the box for the first time and playing a game .
The problem is that the PSP
Go does n't want you to play with it .
In fact , you need to carve out a significant amount of time before you get to the gaming .
On the PSP , Sony requires you to install each update before playing games .
After the system was first powered on and connected to our wireless router , we were told that an update was required before we could go online and download a game .
So we downloaded the update , which was a speedy affair .
After the system rebooted , it told us that , although the system was plugged into a wall socket , the update could not be installed until the batteries were fully charged .
So the system had to charge , and then the update was installed .
But then of course you have to download a game , since you can't use any of your UMD software , and that takes a while .
But then the system disconnected from my network randomly because the 802.11 b hardware does n't handle being walked around my house very well , so I had to start completely over on the download .
All told , it took around three hours to get to playing an actual game .
I passed the time by playing Gran Turismo on the PSP 3000 .
If you buy a PSP Go , I suggest bringing another video game along to keep yourself occupied while you wait for it to allow you to play something .
Now , keep in mind that the update issue exists on the standard PSP , but if a game required the update you always have the choice of putting in an older UMD that does n't .
You can have the system up and running in minutes .
Since you 're locked into using Sony 's servers to get games for the PSP
Go , you 'll be forced to get every update they decide to send out , no matter if the game requires it or not , and if your battery is n't fully charged that could take a while .
Is there anything to like ?
Lest you think we 're simply going to bash the system for the entirety of this review , we 'll bring up a few things that are good about the system .
A smaller screen at the same resolution means that the image is brilliant , sharp and clear .
The system is obviously smaller , not to mention thinner , so it 's a little more portable .
Both the d-pad and the face buttons are much " clickier , " although that 's obviously personal preference .
But for our money , the buttons feel great .
The other solid addition is the pause feature , and this is something we hope at some point makes the move to other PSP models .
At any point in any game you can hit the PlayStation button , and save the game wherever you are .
Then you can play another game , listen to a song , watch a movie , and come back to exactly where you saved when you 're ready to play again .
In the middle of a fighting game or mid-turn in a racing game , this is a great way to make up for games that do n't have portable - friendly save systems .
You can only have one save on one game at a time , but it 's still a wonderful feature .
In conclusion
It 's hard to pin down who exactly this system is for .
People with unlimited gaming budgets ?
The Go is more expensive than the current PSP offerings , and it gives you fewer options about where you can get your games .
Since Sony has stated publicly that the company is going to stick with MSRP for all of its releases , the digital versions of games may be the same price as their retail counterparts , but more likely will be more expensive in many circumstances .
You can't shop around for the best deal with your games , you 'll never be able to sell a game , and the system is completely locked down when downloading a purchase .
The controls are more cramped , and Sony has made sure you can only buy their cables .
The wireless standard has n't been upgraded , and the system is significantly more expensive than any of its competitors .
When you close the system you see a big , beautiful screen you can't do anything with .
In other words , this system is for people who do n't mind rebuying all their content , never buy used games , and do n't mind paying more for less .
If you 're agoraphobic and the idea of driving to a physical store to buy a game is terrifying , this system is for you .
So we 're looking for a gamer who is both wealthy and frighteningly antisocial .
The rest of us will stick with our current hardware , thanks .
If you sell a system that takes hours of setup , downloading , and charging before you can see what a game looks like on the screen , you have failed pretty spectacularly .
I absolutely love my PSP , but this new iteration of the platform is what would happen if a facepalm was turned into a piece of hardware .
The Good
The screen is beautiful in action
Clicky , responsive buttons
Hardware is aesthetically pleasing
The pause function is great
Bluetooth headset , to use with your bluetooth headset , PS3 controllers , or to tether to your cell phone
Sound is strong using the built - in speakers
The Bad
The system can't download games while you 're doing other things
Way too expensive
Absolutely no way to play any of your existing games
Controls are cramped
Smaller screen
Games tend to be more expensive than retail
No competition in pricing for games
No way to sell games you buy
None of your cables or accessories will work , except for headphones
Screen is wasted while closed , only shows clock , calendar
The Ugly
Waiting hours to download a patch , charge your batteries , buy a game , download your game , and then install your game , and then finally ... guess what ?
playing your game !
Your system can already do what this system claims to do , and better .
Minus the bluetooth and the 16GB of internal storage , this is a step back in every way
If Sony continues this trend , expect a $ 500 PS3 that does n't play Blu-ray discs
Verdict : Skip

BERLIN , Oct 7 ( Reuters ) - Americans will have to save more in the future , transforming the global economy , and Europeans and Japanese must work to boost domestic demand , U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was quoted as saying on Wednesday .
“ Everyone is going to have to come to terms with the fact that we are going to save more in the United States , ” Geithner said in an interview with German weekly Die Zeit , conducted on Sunday in Istanbul , and due to appear on Oct.
8 .
“ If the U.S. starts saving more , that changes the whole world ’s economic reality , ” he said , according to the German text of the interview .
Geithner said China was already doing a lot to consider how to put growth on a more sustainable path .
“ In China , the government is at the forefront of thinking about new ways to reduce the dependence of the economy on export and investments , ” he said .
“ But it is not just about the U.S. and China .
Europe and Japan make up 40 percent of the global economy . ”
Geithner said the U.S. could not force Europe to boost domestic demand to adapt to the new economic reality , but he saw it as the only viable strategy to guarantee lasting growth .
“ They have to decide themselves how to adapt .
I am not aware of any other strategy that promises success . ”
He also said that the recovery was in a very early phase , and there were many risks ahead .
“ If you look at past crises , politicians mostly made the mistake of tightening the purse strings too early , ” he said .
“ The private sector needs to start growing on its own for a sustainable recovery to take place . ” ( Reporting by Sarah Marsh and Dave Graham ; Editing by Toby Chopra )
The belief that healthy older brains are substantially smaller than younger brains may stem from studies that did not screen out people whose undetected , slowly developing brain disease was killing off cells in key areas , according to new research .
As a result , previous findings may have overestimated atrophy and underestimated normal size for the older brain .
The new study tested participants in Holland 's long - term Maastricht Aging Study who were free of neurological problems such as dementia , Parkinson 's disease or stroke .
Once participants were deemed otherwise healthy , they took neuropsychological tests , including a screening test for dementia , at baseline and every three years afterward for nine years .
According to the report in the September Neuropsychology , published by the American Psychological Association , participants were also given MRI scans at Year 3 to measure seven different parts of the brain , including the memory - laden hippocampus , the areas around it , and the frontal and cingulate areas of the cognitively critical cortex .
After examining behavioral data collected from 1994 to 2005 ( with scans taken between 1997 and 1999 depending on when people entered the study ) , the researchers divided participants into two groups : one group with 35 cognitively healthy people who stayed free of dementia ( average starting age 69.1 years ) , and the other group with 30 people who showed substantial cognitive decline but were still dementia - free ( average starting age 69.2 years ) .
That cognitive decline was measured by drops of at least 30 percent on two or more of six core tests of verbal learning and fluency , recall , processing speed , and complex information processing , and / or drops of 3 or more points , or scores of 24 or lower ( raising suspicion for cognitive impairment ) , on the Mini-Mental State Examination screening tool for dementia .
In contrast to the 35 people who stayed healthy , the 30 people who declined cognitively over nine years showed a significant effect for age in the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas , and in the frontal and cingulate cortices .
In short , among the people whose cognition got worse , older participants had smaller brain areas than younger participants .
Thus , the seeming age - related atrophy in gray matter more likely reflected pathological changes in the brain that underlie significant cognitive decline than aging itself , the authors wrote .
As long as people stay cognitively healthy , the researchers believe that the gray matter of areas supporting cognition might not shrink much at all .
" If future longitudinal studies find similar results , our conception of ' normal ' brain aging may become more optimistic , " said lead author Saartje Burgmans , who is due to receive her PhD later this year .
The findings should caution scientists about drawing conclusions from brain studies that do n't screen participants over time , using precise and objective definitions , the authors added .

At the time , the novelist Annie Thomas , an intimate friend , was staing with Mrs. Marryat .
Florence and Annie took the adress Mr. Dunphy gave them of the American medium Mrs. Holmes , who was then visiting London and lodging in Old Quebec Street .
They refused any introduction , and went to see her incognito .
The next evening , when Mrs. Holmes held a public seance , the two women presented themselves at Mrs. Holmes ' as Miss Taylor and Miss Turner .
They had first removed their wedding - rings , because they wanted to look " as virginal as possible " .
Mrs. Holmes did not receive them very graciously .
They were strangers to her – probably sceptics - and the medium eyed them rather coldly .
It was a bitter night ; the snow lay so thick upon the ground that Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Turner had some difficulty in procuring a hansom to take them to Old Quebec Street .
No other visitors arrived , and after a little while Mrs. Holmes offered to return their money ( ten shillings ) .
She said there would probably be no manifestations on account of the inclemency of the weather .
( Any extreme heat or cold is indeed liable to make a seance a dead failure . )
But Annie Thomas had to return home the following day , and so they begged the medium to try at least and show them something .
Florence was not quite sure what she expected or hoped for on this occasion .
She was full of curiosity , but she did n't think to see a face which she would recognize as having been on earth .
Florence waited till nine o'clock in hopes that a circle would be formed ; but as no one else came , Mrs. Holmes consented to sit with them alone , warning them however to prepare for a disappointment .
The lights were extinguished , and they sat for the usual preliminary dark seance .
When it concluded , the gas was re-lit and now they were waiting to see the “ Spirit Faces ” ...
There were two small rooms connected by folding doors .
Annie Thomas and Florence Marryat were asked to go into the back room and to lock the door communicating with the landings , .
They had to secure it with their own seal , stamped upon a piece of tape stretched across the opening .
Mrs. Holmes asked them to examine the window and bar the shutter inside , and to search the room thoroughly .
There was no one concealed in it .
When they were satisfied that no one could enter from the back , Mr. and Mrs. Holmes , Annie Thomas and Florence Marryat were seated on four chairs in the front room , arranged in a row before the folding doors .
The doors were opened , and a square of black calico was fastened across the aperture from one wall to the other .
The calico had a square hole of about the size of an ordinary window , at which the spirit faces would appear .
" There was no singing , nor noise of any sort made to drown the sounds of preparation , Florence Marryat related , " and we could have heard even a rustle in the next room . "
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes talked of their various experiences , and then , suddenly , something white and indistinct like a cloud of tobacco smoke appeared and disappeared again .
“ They are coming !
Oh , I am so glad they are coming ! ” exlaimed Mrs. Holmes .
“ I did n’t think we should get anything tonight ! "
The white mass advanced and retreated several times , and finally settled before the aperture and opened in the middle .
A female face was distinctly to be seen now , above the black calico ... and to her amazement , Florence recognize the features of Annie Thomas ’ mother !
Annie was very much affected , and talked to her mother in the most incoherent manner .
The spirit did not answer in words , but she bowed her head or shook it , according as she wished to say “ yes ” or “ no ” .
Florence could not help feeling awed at the appearance of the dear old lady , but what puzzled her the most was the cap she wore , which was made of white net , quilled closely round the face , and unlike any she had ever seen the old lady wear in life .
Florence whispered this to Annie , and her friend replied at once : “ It is the cap she was buried in … ”
Mrs. Thomas had possessed a very pleasant but very uncommon looking face , with bright black eyes , and a complexion of pink and white like that of a child .
It was some time before Annie could be persuaded to let her mother go , but the next face that presented itself astonished her quite as much , for she recognized it as that of Captain Gordon , a gentleman whom she had known intimately and for a length of time .
Florence had never seen Captain Gordon in the flesh , but she had heard of him , and she knew he had died from a sudden accident .
All she saw was the head of a goodlooking young man .
While her friend conversed with him about olden days , Florence minutely examined the working of the muscles of his throat , which undeniably stretched when his head moved .
As she was doing so , he leaned forward , and she saw a dark stain , which looked like a clot of blood on his fair hair , on the left side of the forehead .
“ Annie !
What did Captain Gordon die of ? ” she asked .
“ He fell from a railway carriage , ” Annie replied , “ and struck his head upon the line . ”
Florence then pointed out to her the blood upon his hair …
Police officer watching out for shoplifters at HMV caught on CCTV stealing computer games
Peter Cokell was found guilty of theft after shoplifting two computer games
A police officer tasked with catching shoplifters at an HMV store was caught on camera stealing computer games by concealing them underneath his stab vest .
PC Peter Cokell , 34 , was found guilty of theft after he was caught on CCTV shoplifting from the store he was being paid to protect .
The damning footage , which was shown to magistrates in his trial , shows him stealing two PlayStation 3 games and then taking them to the rear of the shop in his police hat .
He can then be seen slipping the games - Call of Duty and Kill Zone - worth only £ 74.98 , inside his stab vest before walking from the shop without setting off the alarms .
However , a security guard who witnessed the crime contacted police and Cokell was arrested and charged with theft .
Cokell , from Bristol , denied the charge but was found guilty at Frome Magistrate 's Court , Somerset .
He told the court he was looking at the games to ' help him relate to young people ' and claimed he was ' rearranging his trousers ' , not shoplifting .
He said : ' I tried my best to be inconspicuous to the general members of the public so that they would not form the wrong impression of what I may or may not have been trying to do with my trousers .
' I had no reason to steal and no reason to steal PS3 games , as I do n't have a PS3 . '
During the trial District Judge David Parsons said the games ' certainly left the site ' after watching the CCTV evidence .
Peter Cokell can be seen picking up computer games in the store
He said : ' I do know the games certainly left the site , having seen the evidence of the CCTV and the evidence of Mr Sutton . '
Gary Sutton , a security guard for HMV , told the court he saw the PC acting ' suspiciously ' before he stole the games .
He said : ' He placed two games inside the cubby hole and just leaned on the edge of the desk .
' After a short while he did what appeared to be tucking the two items up his vest and inside his coat .
Cokell then takes the games to the rear of the shop in his police hat
He straightened his front and made his way out of the store .
I then asked him where the games were , the two he had selected in the store .
' I replied that I had seen him on CCTV and that I needed the games back .
' At this point he was leaning on the edge of a chair and he informed me that he had the games but could not get hold of them due to where they were now locked up . '
Cokell then exited the store , without activating any of the security alarms , and carried on walking his beat .
Mr Sutton who was ' shocked ' by the crime , confronted Cokell , who offered to return the games two days later .
However , the following day Mr Sutton spoke to PC Shaun Oliver , Cokell 's regional manager , and reported the incident .
The court heard Cokell , who joined the force in 2000 , had a ' very good ' arrest record and received a certificate of commendation last year from his district commander .
Following the trial a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said : ' This is not behaviour we expect of a police officer .
' Mr Cokell resigned in June , when an investigation into this started , and the decision of the court shows how seriously the force views matters of this kind , particularly when it concerns a breach of trust . '
Cokell will be sentenced on November 27 .
Microsoft has been ordered to stop selling Windows XP in China after a court ruled that certain fonts in the operating system infringe on a Chinese firm 's intellectual property .
On Monday , Beijing 's 1st Intermediate People 's Court decided that Microsoft had overstepped a deal with Zhongyi Electronics to include the company 's Chinese fonts in Windows 95 by also slipping them into eight other versions of Windows without permission .
The alleged font - pas includes Windows 95 , 98 , 2000 , and XP — but not more recent releases : Vista and Windows 7 .
The court has ordered Microsoft and its China - based ops to immediately stop producing and selling the infringing operating systems , according to the English - language version of state television broadcaster , CCTV .
When asked for comment , Microsoft said via prepared written statement that it will appeal the decision and believes its license agreement with Zhongyi covered in full their use of the technology .
According to the company , the ruling will not go into effect until it is affirmed by an appeals court .
The Bejing court rejected additional claims from Zhongyi that Microsoft was equally neglectful in paying licensing fees for its flagship " Zhemga " product , which allows users to enter Chinese characters using Western keyboards .
Microsoft having been declared guilty of IP theft in China is of course rather cutting , as the company spends much of its time in the country championing its own intellectual property .
This August , Microsoft boasted that a Chinese court jailed two men for three and a half years and two accomplices for two years for distributing a bootleg copy of Windows XP .
In fact , the company quite regularly announces Chinese IP piracy busts .
Not this one , though .

Review : New Super Mario Bros Wii
“ New Super Mario Bros Wii is a game baked in classic action , the kind that seems as fresh and fun today as it did 20 years ago . “
Vitals
Game : New Super Mario Bros Wii
Developer / Publisher : Nintendo
Released : November 2009
Platforms : Wii
“ Perfect chaos . ”
Those two words are the easiest way to describe what New Super Mario Bros Wii is designed to be .
Whether it ’s the refined single player adventure across the stereotypically fun Mario worlds or the chaotic action that refines how local multiplayer should be done in action games , NSMBWii nails it on all levels .
It serves as the ideal “ bridge ” game , designed to satisfy both the core and casual gamers at the same time , and pulls off that feat with near perfection .
It ’s the kind of answer to the Call of Duties and Maddens this season that video game purists have been eagerly waiting for .
Mario
Wii feeds off of our nostalgia for a time when games were designed to simply be fun .
It takes the tried - and - true platforming mechanic of Mario — the kind of pixel perfect side - scrolling action that games like Little Big Planet could n’t quite achieve — and combines it with a much more modern multiplayer mechanic .
It is the natural successor to Super Mario World , showcasing the familiar tones and tunes of the world ’s most famous plumber in a genre that is making a welcome resurgence .
It ’s not trying to be a classic Mario game ; it ’s trying to be the next Mario game .
Positives
– Nostalgic : Playing Mario games was something that everyone did as a child : easily accessible , always replayable , and impossible to master .
New Super Mario Bros
Wii does n’t stray from that formula in the least bit .
It adheres to the lore of Mario by including fire flowers , power - ups , coins , and pipes .
It ( finally ) brings back the Koopa Kids and Yoshi .
It uses the familiar overworld map system and contains 8 - 9 stages per themed area .
In essence , the game is a celebration of all that is good and wholesome about Mario games .
It plays exactly like what you ’d hope that a Mario game would play like , sticking to incremental improvements over revolutionary ones .
– Multiplayer : Mario games were best played by passing the controller amongst friends in front of a tv .
If I could not complete a level , my brother would try .
NSMBWii builds off of that by placing all four players on the screen at once in a part competitive , part co-operative concept a la Mario Kart .
And , it works .
Extremely well .
The action fills the screen with players bumping into each other , jumping on top of one another , and throwing items back and forth .
Each round starts off seemingly innocent but do not kid yourselves : Nintendo has secretly and cleverly designed the levels to have them bring out the worst in everyone .
It ’s important to back - stab your partners here .
Tempted between getting the lone 1 up or rescuing my near - death partner , I despicably always choose the former .
I feel bad for doing it , and that ’s the magic .
– Difficulty Curve :
There are portions of NSMBWii that make me want to rip my teeth out .
The game starts off as I ’d expect : the easy introductory level 1 - 1 showcases a few of the new powerups and features , without being a tutorial ( there is none in the game ) .
The difficulty curve then spikes to mountainous levels .
I died several times on almost every level , out of my own stupidity .
But the game is designed to eventually teach me to make it over whatever pit was preventing me from reaching the flag at the end .
And when I did , the satisfaction I got was enough to keep me giddy until the next fail .
The game is n’t “ difficult , ” but it is definitely fiendish .
The addition of the optional Super Guide , an ingenious combination of hints and automated play that opens up as an option when dying 8 or more time in a level , will help those who may not want to ( or be able to ) make it to the end and just want to skip ahead .
The core gamer may ignore it and the casual may embrace it , but the idea of “ just giving up ” because a game is too hard no longer exists .
Everyone will have the chance to finish this game .
– Obsession :
The game revels in the fact that I will make mistakes , highlighting them by dangling a star coin or powerup in some obscure location that I just need to get to , to the behest of my ability .
I died over and over trying to get a single 1 up on a level , as obsessive compulsion kicked in .
The amount of secrets in the game adds to the replayability as entire new levels open up , new paths and puzzle solutions , and so on .
The prerequisite Mario “ star world ” exists in this game as well , providing added adventure for those who dare to stay past the credits .
– New Suits :
The latest new suits to star in New Super Mario Bros Wii are the propeller hat and the penguin suit .
Carryovers include both the fire & ice flowers , the mini mushroom , and Yoshi , the enigmatic dino pal that can eat enemies with its long tongue .
The propeller suit allows Mario to jump high into the air , float around , and drill down onto enemies or objects .
The uber - cute penguin suit allows Mario to throw freezing snow balls , slide on his stomach , and swim better .
These great , fun additions to the proceedings are found in several locations and can be carried over into any level desired via the overworld item screen .
I quickly settled on the two new suits as my favorites , rarely using the others if possible .
– Level Design :
The real star of New Super Mario Bros Wii is the careful , methodical level design .
In fact , Nintendo created worlds they were so proud of that they added in - game unlockable videos for those who wanted to see incredible run-throughs of them played by the developers .
Each level takes 5 - 10 minutes to complete , depending on how many times you might fail at it , and returns the flagpole completion from the original Super Mario Bros .
The mid-way point marker is there and is needed , as the deaths mount up quickly ; expect to play each level 3 - 4 times the first time through .
Tricky jumps abound and plenty of enemies manage to be in just the right place to knock out one of my lives .
The delightful level design creates memorable experiences , and the ability to rush through or to stop and explore allows for several ways to play .
Negatives
– Visuals :
The characters appear just a bit small on the screen and under - detailed , causing some undesired pixelation in a few cases .
I would have loved to see a slightly bigger Mario help fill up the sometimes empty screens .
Even though much of the game is made of 3D elements , some of the visuals actually do appear to be 16 - bit , or damn near it .
Bright color palettes aside , the lack of shadows , and lighting effects make the game look decidedly flat .
– Motion controls :
The tacked - on waggle is unnecessary in many cases .
In order to pick up an enemy , I have to hold the “ 1 ” button and shake the Wiimote .
It works in specialized cases like platform tilting , but is rather tedious almost anywhere else .
Using the B-button on the underside of the Wiimote would work much better .
– No Online :
There were times when I really wanted to play this game with friends .
Unfortunately , no one was around to join in .
If I was able to hop online and start an adventure with a friend or stranger I could have enjoyed many a late night playing .
The decision to not include online play was design - driven , as the developers wanted to push simultaneous in - house play .
But , we Americans are a country on the move and do n’t always have the time to go to someone ’s house .
In conclusion
While far from perfect , the game does come at the perfect time .
It strips the complicated controls of many modern games ( including Super Mario Galaxy ) for a two - button layout that still manages to have incredible depth .
It opts for bright , fluffy visuals and music designed to whistle to .
The chaos that ensues when playing with others is welcomed , allowing for the game to feel like two completely different experiences whether alone or with friends .
A realization takes place almost instantly when popping in the game : Mario has n’t changed .
Mario is still fun .
Mario will always be fun .
He is easy to understand and easy to underestimate , as can be seen by the incredible curve in difficulty that can make a Guitar Hero expert weep .
Mario is still King of the 2 - D castle .
This is the next Mario .
And for those who own the Wii , this is the natural next game to buy .
This review is based on a retail copy of the game purchased by SideQuesting .
The main storyline was completed , opening up all additional worlds and levels .

Humiliation for Harriet Harman as statisticians dismiss her claims on equal pay
Harriet Harman has been left red faced by statisticians
Harriet Harman was yesterday slapped down by national statisticians over her claims that women are paid a fifth less than men .
The Women and Equality Minister was told she must no longer use a single figure to describe the complex differences in the earnings of men and women .
Instead she will have to give three measures - among them one which shows that far from earning less than men , women in part - time jobs are actually paid more on average than their male counterparts .
The ruling from the Office for National Statistics is the culmination of a running row between Labour 's deputy leader and Whitehall watchdogs , who called her use of figures on the gender pay gap ' misleading ' .
It will also affect the workings of Miss Harman 's Equality Bill , as until now the minister has insisted that public sector bodies - which will have to say whether their pay scales are unfair to women - should use her way of working out the pay gap .
A report from the ONS called Presenting Gender Pay Statistics said no one measure of the pay gap was adequate or appropriate for Government bodies to use .
Instead , it said three different figures should be counted .
One is Miss Harman 's favourite measure .
This lumps in all workers , both full - time and part - time , and gives a pay gap of 22.5 per cent .
How they compare
But this fails to take into account that because more women choose to work part - time than men , the average pay for women is artificially driven down .
In the past the ONS has favoured a figure that counts just full - time employees .
This shows men earning 12.8 per cent more than women .
From now on , yesterday 's report said , both figures must be used , together with a third setting out the gap between male and female parttime workers , which is 3.5 per cent in women 's favour .
During the summer , watchdog Sir Michael Scholar , head of the UK Statistics Authority , wrote twice to Miss Harman 's department warning of misleading use of gender gap data .
He told the Equalities Minister in the spring that her interpretation of state earnings surveys could ' confuse the general public ' and ' undermine public trust in official statistics ' .
Yesterday the ONS report pointed out that because 41 per cent of women in employment work parttime , compared with only 11 per cent of men , Miss Harman 's preferred method skews the figures to make women look worse off .
Miss Harman 's officials welcomed the acceptance by the ONS of the 22.5 per cent figure as one of the measures which will be used in future .
The Government 's equality watchdog , the Equality and Human Rights Commission , said the ONS report was ' important ' but insisted it should also have compared the pay of full - time men with part - time women - which gives a 39.9 per cent pay gap in men 's favour .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some 14,700 rich Americans , worried about a stepped - up U.S. crackdown on offshore tax cheats , have turned themselves in under the government ’s amnesty program .

The Internal Revenue Service amnesty program , which ended in October , offered reduced penalties for voluntarily disclosing previously undeclared foreign holdings .
It is part of a broader effort by the United States and other authorities to crack down on tax evasion .
Of the nearly 15,000 newly disclosed accounts , many involved bank accounts in Switzerland and Europe , but assets were hidden in more than 70 countries .
Participation in the IRS program was “ unprecedented ” and the final number was nearly double the agency ’s estimate in October , U.S. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Douglas Shulman told reporters in a telephone briefing .
Barbara Kaplan , a lawyer for high net - worth clients in New York , said : “ The IRS has never got anything like that in response to prior initiatives .
It ’s a little higher than I anticipated based on the pace of my own practice and the panic that was out there . ”
A high - profile U.S. lawsuit against Swiss banking giant UBS AG led the bank to agree earlier this year to promise to reveal the names of 4,450 client accounts held by Americans .
Those accounts at one time were worth a total of $ 18 billion .
While IRS officials were still analyzing the amount of offshore assets declared in the amnesty program , Shulman said , “ we are talking about billions of dollars coming into the U.S. Treasury ” from the new disclosures .
One IRS official said that at the end of the amnesty program , there was a “ significant influx in accounts with holdings in the Far East . ”
The IRS has said recently it is focusing on funds flowing out of Europe and into Asia , and is opening a new office in Beijing .

UBS DEAL STANDS
Shulman also said the outpouring of information about hidden offshore accounts had no bearing on the legal obligation of UBS to turn over names of 4,450 American account holders .
There had been some speculation that success in the amnesty program might affect how much information UBS had to share .
“ Some have misinterpreted this , ” Shulman said .
The IRS emphasized it would closely examine the new information with an eye toward what role tax advisers played in helping their clients hide assets .
Shulman declined to say if the IRS was looking at other financial institutions .
The voluntary amnesty program was open to accountholders of all banks , and lawyers have said customers from Credit Suisse Group AG and HSBC Holdings are among those that took part .
CRITERIA FOR UBS NAMES
The U.S. and Swiss governments on Tuesday also released the criteria that will be used to select the 4,450 accounts that UBS must eventually provide to the IRS .
The Swiss Justice Department said it would hand over the names of wealthy American clients of UBS with accounts holding more than 1 million Swiss francs ( $ 986,200 ) where there is a reasonable suspicion of tax fraud .
Accounts of a lesser size , as low as 100,000 Swiss francs , could be included in certain circumstances when there is a “ scheme of lies ” identified , according to the document .
“ The threshold for disclosing accounts , in my opinion , is low , ” said Kevin Thorn , a Washington - based tax lawyer .
“ Most believed the threshold would have been $ 1 million - plus but it appears the government is holding to its word and looking at conduct more than amounts and is going after taxpayers across the board . ”
Also included in the criteria is suspicious activity related to the use of debit cards , cell phones or wire transfers to hide accounts .
Senator Carl Levin , whose congressional panel has investigated tax evasion for several years , said the language leaves too many loopholes for the Swiss .
“ The tortured wording and the many limitations in this ( agreement ) shows the Swiss government trying to preserve as much bank secrecy as it can for the future , while pushing to conceal the names of tens of thousands of suspected U.S. tax cheats , ” said Levin , a Democrat .
“ It is disappointing that the U.S. government went along . ”
The IRS said the criteria will identify the accounts it is most interested in and those that would be hardest for the agency to identify on its own .
The criteria apply to UBS accounts held between 2001 and 2008 by U.S. citizens .
The 8 hour journey to a single character Posted by Louis Brandy on 23 November 2009
I came into work on day not too long and was met with an unfortunate piece of information .
The test we ran the previous night reported a 4 % drop in accuracy ( we found 4 % fewer faces ) .
I frowned .
I had clearly screwed something up .
You see , the day before , I found that our code was doing some really pathological and unnecessary color conversions on images .
We were using our video i/o library ( a very thin wrapper on ffmpeg ) to read in movies and allowing it to convert the frames into RGB .
As soon as our code got ahold of these RGB frames , we immediately converted them to grayscale .
The pathology of the situation is that the vast majority of all video formats are already in the YUV color space ( or YCbCr color space .
I will use the terms interchangably , but you should know they are n't quite the same thing ) .
For those among you that are n't image processing nerds , the Y - channel of YUV is functionally equivalent to a gray channel .
In other words , videos are almost always encoded with a gray channel and 2 color ( chrominance ) channels .
That means converting these images to RGB just to convert them back to gray is beyond wasteful .
We had actually known about this problem for awhile but it 's never been a terribly pressing issue .
That changed recently when we were doing some really high speed processing and we noticed our color conversions were a non-trivial portion of the time .
I dug into our video i/o library , removed the conversion to RGB , and piped the Y channel of the YUV frames into our software .
Everything appeared to be working perfectly .
Output looks good .
No memory leaks .
Commit .
Go home .
Watch House .
The next day ...
So I walk in , bright and early , and hear the disappointing news .
We lost 4 % accuracy .
Did my colorspace change cause this ?
I hope not .
Within a half an hour , I realized that my colorspace conversion change clearly was not correct .
The frames that I had tested on the previous day looked identical , but they were n't .
I expected some minor round off error as a possibility , but the changes were more than I anticipated .
The error became extremely obvious when I ran the new decoding library on the opening of Star Trek .
Conveniently , the opening of Star Trek is pitch black .
My " new " library was not producing black !
It was near - black , but very clearly NOT black .
Uh oh .
What 's going on ?
Let 's look at the numbers
I dug into ffmpeg and very quickly reproduced the problem .
The very first pixel of the very first frame of this episode of Star Trek had a Y value of 16 .
Not zero .
When ffmpeg converted this value to RGB , the result came out to be ( 0,0,0 ) .
Black .
Wait a minute , since when is Y=16 equal to black ?
What is going on ?
I looked at the only other place in our codebase where we deal with this type of information : JPEG decoding .
JPEG 's also use YUV formatting .
What would this particular frame look like in a JPEG's YUV ?
This is a quick test .
Is it also 16 ?
Nope , it 's zero .
For an RGB value of ( 0,0,0 ) , ffmpeg is telling me the Y value is 16 , and the jpeg library is telling me the value is 0 .
Either there is an egregious bug in one of the two most well - tested libraries on the planet , or I clearly do n't understand wtf is going on .
I 'm going to assume the latter .
But that will have wait until after lunch .
Research time
When I got back from lunch , it was time to hit up the internet .
If you search the internet for formulas to convert yuv to rgb you 'll get all sorts of conflicting information .
You 'll even get very different formulas .
If you read the YUV or YCbCr Wikipedia pages , you can easily miss the most important information ( hint : it 's not the equations ) .
After spending a tremendous amount of time reading ( and being confused about the different formulas ) , I made the critical discovery .
There are different definitions of YUV .
I then had to dig into the details to find out just how deep this particular rabbit hole goes .
In the end , it was n't terribly complicated ( but it was difficult to find good information ) .
In essence , though , different standards define different dynamic ranges for the YUV color space when digitized into 8 - bit per sample .
Movie files ( e.g , MPEG ) will often use 16 -235 for the Y channel ( black - > white ) , while images ( JPEG ) will use 0 -255 .
A movie file 's white ( 235 ) != a jpeg file 's white ( 255 ) .
To make matters worse , the Cr and Cb ( ie , U and V ) channels use an entirely different set of dynamic ranges for MPEG files ( though jpeg is always ( 0- 255 ) ) .
Oh my .
Note : if you are here because you are having similar yuv / rgb problems and google led you here , I strongly suggest you read every single word of these three links :
The Fix , part 1
If all I need to do is rescale to a different dynamic range , that is not a difficult problem to solve .
It 's a fair bit tricky ( watch those unsigned overflows ! ) but it 's nothing that can't be accomplished through the power of C . I spent an hour or so writing a function to convert the three channels to the expanded dynamic range ( remembering that the Y channel uses a different range than the U and V channels ) .
I knew I 'd lose some information , but what choice did I have ?
Once I had finished , I ran all my previous tests and found the output to be far , far better than the one I was using from the previous day .
I also tested my new conversion routine on images that failed from the overnight test and what do you know , they were now finding faces .
Mission accomplished !
Not so fast my friend
It was about this time that I felt the need to vent .
Seriously , movie and jpeg people , why are you doing this to me ?
Why are there two ( note : actually more than two ) different dynamic ranges for 8 - bit YUV pixels ?
Why oh why ?
( more notes : if you want to learn why , it 's actually a fairly fun and interesting story ... taketh thee to wikipedia ) .
In the need for some complaining , I decided to go onto IRC and complain to the only video developer I know ( he works on x264 -- the open source h264 encoder ) .
I asked him why " they all " go around screwing with people like me with such nonsense .
He laughed and went on to explain there are actually more than two different formats and commiserated with me for a moment .
And then he said something important .
He said only " -- fullrange " .
Wait .
What is -- fullrange ?
Is that an x264 parameter ?
Yes , yes it is .
What does -- fullrange do ?
It uses the fullrange of YUV .
Ah! x264 devs are genius .
Why would they leave this silly conversion to us ?
Oh wait .
Does that mean ... does ffmpeg ... do it too ?
It has to , right ?
Let 's check the docs , shall we .
There sure are alot of formats on this list .
I wonder if any of them are " full - range " YUV .
PIX_FMT_YUVJ420P
Planar YUV 4:2:0 , 12 bpp , full scale ( jpeg ) .
PIX_FMT_YUVJ422P
Planar YUV 4:2:2 , 16 bpp , full scale ( jpeg ) .
PIX_FMT_YUVJ444P
Planar YUV 4:4:4 , 24 bpp , full scale ( jpeg ) .
Does that " jpeg " mean these are " jpeg- style " full - range YUV outputs ?
I should try this .
Within minutes I realized that yes , these formats outputted YUV channels that used the full dynamic range 0 -255 .
Excellent .
I reverted all my ugly changes with my own customized range expansion code and committed this final fix .
- PIX_FMT_YUV420P , + PIX_FMT_YUVJ420P ,
One character .
One friggin ' " J " . 8 hours .
I hope no one is keeping track of " lines of code per hour " .
BEIJING ( AP )  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says his two - day visit to Beijing this week is part of the creation of a " new world order . "
The frequent U.S. critic , who met with China 's president and Communist Party leader Hu Jintao on Wednesday , told reporters that power in the world was shifting from America to countries such as Iran , Japan and China .
" We are creating a new world , a balanced world .
A new world order , a multipolar world , " Chavez said after arriving Tuesday evening .
" The unipolar world has collapsed .
The power of the U.S. empire has collapsed , " he said .
" Everyday , the new poles of world power are becoming stronger .
Beijing , Tokyo , Tehran ... it 's moving toward the East and toward the South . "
Chavez continued his theme in his meeting with Hu , telling the president that " no one can be ignorant that the center of gravity of the world has moved to Beijing . "
" During the financial crisis , China 's actions have been highly positive for the world .
Currently , China is the biggest motor driving the world amidst this crisis of international capitalism , " Chavez said in preliminary remarks before reporters were ushered from the room .
Chavez has made Beijing a frequent stop in his global travels to promote his agenda of anti-American world unity , stopping in the Chinese capital six times since taking power in 1998 elections .
His visit follows a sweep through the Middle East last week , including a stop in Iran where he said he has little hope of better relations with Washington under President Obama because the United States was still acting like an " empire " in his eyes .
While China 's Communist leaders have been low key in their response to Chavez 's political rhetoric , Beijing 's state - run industries have been eager to use Venezuela as a jumping - off point for their entry into South America .
Chinese companies in the mining and petroleum sector have been especially eager to secure South American mineral resources .
During his visit , Chavez said he planned to review with Chinese leaders a goal of boosting exports of Venezuelan oil to China from 380,000 barrels last year to 1 million barrels by 2013 — part of Venezuela 's strategy of diversifying oil sales away from the United States , which buys about half the South American nation 's heavy crude despite political tensions .
Included in that strategy are plans for China and Venezuela to build four oil tankers and three refineries in China capable of processing Venezuela 's heavy , sulfur - laden crude .
China and Venezuela have also invested in a $ 12 billion fund to finance joint development projects in areas including oil production , infrastructure and agriculture .

Imagine a full - scale farm right in the heart of New York City , in the deserts of Darfur or on the moon .
While you might have to wait some time for your lunar lettuce , vertical farming technologies are increasing the possibilities of cultivating crops much more efficiently here on earth .
Moving farms into buildings might change the way much of humanity grows its food .
And while vertical farming is on the cusp of blooming , the main hurdle is n’t technology ; it ’s one of engineering and funding .
" We know how to grow food inside , " says Dickson Despommier of Columbia University .
" That ’s not the problem .
What we do n’t know yet is how to integrate that technology into a tall building .
That appears to be a simple , but perhaps expensive engineering problem . "
The End of Farming As We Know It
Known as the founder of the modern vertical farming concept , Despommier is a Public Health professor and stresses the urgency of changing the way humanity cultivates its food .
{related_content}
" We choose to live in cities , " he says .
" By the year 2050 , nearly 80 % of the earth ’s population will reside in urban centers .
The human population will increase by about 3 billion people during the interim .
If we do n’t learn how to [ vertical farm ] soon , these will become horrible places . "
According the UN , the amount of arable land per person decreased from about an acre in 1970 to roughly half an acre in 2000 and is projected to decline to about a third of an acre by 2050 .
There will simply not be enough farmland to feed us .
Offland farming also uses a fraction of the water land farming does .
This is why Despommier believes that vertical farming will take root first in " water challenged " areas of the world , like the Middle East .
Toil without Soil
Moving farms off land and into urban buildings offers a solution to land and water scarcity and a really impressive swath of other natural , health , economic and political challenges :
• Produces crops year - round ; 1 indoor acre is equivalent to 4 - 6 outdoor acres or more , depending upon the crop ( e.g. , strawberries : 1 indoor acre = 30 outdoor acres )
• Avoids weather - related crop failures due to droughts , floods , pests
• Grown organically : no herbicides , pesticides , or fertilizers
• Virtually eliminates agricultural runoff by recycling black water
• Returns farmland to nature , restoring ecosystem functions and services
• Greatly reduces the incidence of many infectious diseases that are acquired at the agricultural interface
• Converts black and gray water into potable water by collecting the water of evapotranspiration
• Adds energy back to the grid via methane generation from composting non-edible parts of plants and animals
• Dramatically reduces fossil fuel use ( no tractors , plows , shipping . )
• Converts abandoned urban properties into food production centers
• Creates sustainable environments for urban centers
• Creates new employment opportunities
• We cannot go to the moon , Mars , or beyond without first learning to farm indoors on earth
• May prove to be useful for integrating into refugee camps
• Offers the promise of measurable economic improvement for tropical and subtropical Least Developing Countries ( LDC ) .
If this should prove to be the case , then vertical farms may be a catalyst in helping to reduce or even reverse the population growth of LDCs as they adopt urban agriculture as a strategy for sustainable food production .
• Could reduce the incidence of armed conflict over natural resources , such as water and land for agriculture
Designing Towers of Sustenance
The many potential benefits from vertical farming have inspired a dazzling display of proposed projects that present novel architectural , energy , farming and recycling solutions .
Vertical Farms and Climate Change
Vertical Farms are the fruit of a global greenhouse movement decades in the making .
Yet only as recently as last year - with the collaborations of artists , architects , city planners , farmers and politicians - did the concept reach high - profile media attention by way of an Op-ed in the New York Times .
The upsurge in vertical farm visibility might be linked to its role in the climate change debate .
Land use ( mainly forestry and agriculture ) and its impact on the earth ’s natural carbon cycle has been given much attention by policymakers looking to reduce carbon emissions .
" Every indoor acre you farm gives around 5 - 6 outdoor acres for the trees grow back and suck up more carbon , " says professor Despommier .
" That gives someone a chance to catch up with the climate change issue .
Vertical farming allows the possibility to giving land back to what it was intended for and that is producing hardwood forests . "
Delivery Date for Vertical Farms
Despommier estimates that if a city were to give the nod , a viable vertical farm would spring up within a year .
" That ’s why a prototype would be a good place to start , writes Despommier in the New York Times .
" I estimate that constructing a five - story farm , taking up one - eighth of a square city block , would cost $ 20 million to $ 30 million .
Funding for the farm should be a blend of public and private capital .
" Part of the financing should come from the city government , as a vertical farm would go a long way toward achieving Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s goal of a green New York City by 2030 .
If a farm is located where the public can easily visit it , the iconic building could generate significant tourist dollars , on top of revenue from the sales of its produce . "
Yet , the bulk of funding should come from private venture - capital investors who see the potential profits of vertical farms .
Despommier cites a Cornell University project of hydroponic ( soil - free , water - only ) lettuce that produced each year 68 heads of lettuce per square foot .
" At a retail price in New York of up to $ 2.50 a head for hydroponic lettuce , you can easily do the math and project profitability for other similar crops . "
Despommier and the rest of the world - particularly the urban and arid world - are waiting to see which city will be the first to take off - land farming seriously .
Apparently , Manhattan Borough President , Scott Stringer , has expressed interest in bringing a vertical farm to the city .
In more ways than one , the sky is the limit .
Of the nine people who shared this year 's Nobel Prizes in chemistry , physics and medicine , eight are American citizens , a testament to this country 's support for pioneering research .
But those numbers disguise a more important story .
Four of the American winners were born outside of the United States and only came here as graduate or post - doctoral students or as scientists .
They came because our system of higher education and advanced research has been a magnet for creative talent .
Unfortunately , we cannot count on that magnetism ...
Mr Miliband said the codebreakers should never be forgotten
Men and women who worked in top secret to break Nazi Germany 's military codes during WWII have been publicly honoured 60 years on .
Some of the surviving veterans gathered at Bletchley Park , Buckinghamshire , to receive commemorative badges from Foreign Secretary David Miliband .
Mr Miliband said : " The people of Bletchley Park helped win the war ... we must never forget . "
Many historians agree the codebreakers ' efforts shortened the war by two years .
Their success allowed the Allies to know in advance what German forces were planning .
Mr Miliband added : " They made a decisive contribution to the actions we took on the battlefield through the most startling intelligence breakthroughs .
" We must never forget the contribution they made . "
Roll of honour
The secret of the cracking of the German enigma code was kept from the public until the 1970s .
About 10,000 people worked on breaking codes during the war .
About 1,500 are still alive , 35 of whom were invited to receive their badges in person on Friday .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the Bletchley Park men and women - who worked in conditions of " utmost secrecy " - had finally been given public recognition .
" After so long in the shadows the contribution of the codebreakers has at last been recognised , " he said .
Last week , badges were given out to some former workers during an event at Bletchley Park 's modern replacement , GCHQ in Cheltenham , Gloucestershire .
And in July some veterans were given commemorative badges in a service attended by The Duke of Kent , when the award was first launched .
Veterans who are no longer alive will be commemorated by a Roll of Honour , to be put on display at Bletchley Park .
Last year the Dog wrote the following first person example of waterboarding .
It is taken from literature and descriptions from those who have actually experienced waterboarding , though not from the Dog ’s personal experience .
The intent is to give those of us who have never been tortured one small , imperfect , glimpse into what that might be like .
WARNING : For those who have been tortured , this description may be triggering to PTSD .
If you have lived through torture yourself , please consider not reading this or read it knowing it is graphic and may be disturbing .
Your feet are shackled , and so are your wrists .
When you were lead into the room , you saw that it did not have the usual table , this room had a board , and a drain in the floor .
You are blindfolded by the guards and roughly forced to lie on the wet wooden board .
Even though you are shackled they tie you down to the board with three ropes , one across your chest , on across your waist and one across your legs .
You are now completely unable to move , your head is below the level of your feet making the blood rush to your head .
You can hear them moving around and hear a hose running , filling a bucket of water .
Your heart begins to race as your mouth is forced open and a wet rag is stuffed inside .
There is enough clothe that it fills your mouth , and prevents your teeth from meeting , even at the back of your mouth .
You feel a person sitting next you on the board , and they put their hands on your stomach , just above your diaphragm and push down , keeping you from taking a deep breath through your nose .
You sense someone else standing above your head , and then the water starts to pour over your face .
Not a little , but a torrent of water , it is running up your nose , and you can not breath !
Your gag reflex kicks in , but the rag in your mouth does not let you gag .
Your body begins to convulse , convinced in the most primitive of reflexes to try to do anything to get more air !
You thrash but the ropes and shackles have you completely immobilized .
You feel the water hitting your face , as the person on the bench presses down on your diaphragm , forcing what little air you have out , not in .
You are now sure that you are going to die , that you are going to drown , not an abstract , but for real , and right now .
Your chest buns with the need for more air , your eyes tear under the blindfold as you struggle to get one more breath .
You are no longer a rational human , you are now just a survival machine , ready to beg anyone , do anything to make the pain stop and get just one more breath .
The water stops falling on you .
You suck air in through your nose and try to suck it in through you mouth .
Both bring more water along with the small amount of air you can get .
You hear the hose running again and know that this is not over , it is just starting .
Your heart is going like a trip hammer , and you are in a state of terror , like nothing you have ever experienced or thought of .
You know if and when they ask you something , you will do or say anything , anything to prevent them from doing it again .
Then the hands push on your stomach , and the water starts falling again .
You struggle , trying to hold your breath , but the gag reflex kicks in again , and again you become more animal than man as you struggle for breath your body wracked with pain and convulsively struggling to get free to breath .
This is the horror we inflected on Khalid Sheik Mohammed , 183 times in less than a month .
It is what happened to Abu Zabaydah 86 times .
One time is too many , but we tortured these men over and over and over to gain no actionable intelligence .
Sadly , this is not the only kind of torture we inflicted on these men and others .
Try to imagine yourself in a concrete room , where the temperature is in the low 30 ’s for days at time , where the lights are always on , where the guards come in and move you any time you start to sleep .
These are also torture , though not as directly deadly , combined with the clear disregard for your life , they are nearly as damaging .
This is what the Dog fights for accountability for every week in the Weekly Torture Action Letters .
If what you just read sickens you , if it makes you even vaguely ashamed of what your government has done in your name , the please consider joining this effort to convince AG Holder and the other decision makers that just because it will be politically hard to fully investigate and prosecute the people who committed these crimes and those who ordered it , it is not enough to justify letting the criminals get away with it .
There is no washing away this stain without full investigation and prosecution .
Waterboarding was done in our names , torture was done in our names , and as always with torture , it produced nothing which would make us safer , it merely inflicted pain and fear and helplessness on prisoners in our custody .
This torture did not make us safer ; it merely made us more like the people we were supposed to be fighting .
If this upsets you , good .
Do not just be upset , act .
Below is a list of e-mail contacts for the officials who can make a difference on accountability .
Write them and tell them why you insist on accountability , and join the Dog every week on Monday ’s to do the same until we have accountability under the law for all citizens .

As a standard formula , ROI is pretty basic , ROI = ( X - Y ) / Y , where X is your final value and Y is your starting value .
In other words , if you invest $ 5 and get back $ 20 , your ROI is ( 20 - 5 ) / 5 = 3 times your initial investment .
In the financial sense , ROI is measured purely in the context of dollars and cents , however , the principles can really apply to any type of investment — monetary or not .
Having concrete goals and concrete baselines is crucial to calculating your return on investment .
So before you set out to measure and monitor your social media returns , you need to have a clear idea of what it is you want to accomplish .
Once you have your goals defined , you need to gauge the baseline for your levels before starting or changing your social media strategy .
For example , if your goal is to increase social media mentions of your company , in order to measure the ROI of any actions taken toward that goal , you need to know where you stand now .
You can't evaluate the ROI accurately without a baseline .
Although ROI ≠ metrics , traditional web metrics like traffic counts , number of comments , Twitter followers , Facebook fans , etc. are an important component when calculating your ROI .
The trick is to not rely solely on the numbers , but on what the numbers end up leading to .
For instance , does your increase in website visitors correlate with higher sales ?
Are people that find your website from Twitter or Facebook then clicking on your product pages or going to the e-Commerce section of your site ?
That 's the sort of data you want to be able to look for .
Back in January , we did a round - up of 50 +
Tools for Measuring Web Traffic .
Here are some of our favorites and some additional social media related measuring options :
Be sure to check out our post on Tracking Social Media Analytics for help with these tools and for the type of data you want to look for .
Also check out some other reasons to use a URL shortener Having a metric for something like Twitter mentions is pretty meaningless if you do n't know if those mentions are positive or negative .
This is where sentiment analysis is interesting .
Sentiment is also a useful baseline to look at before implementing or changing a social media strategy and calculating your ROI .
We 've written a lot about different sentiment analysis tools for Twitter and here are some highlights :
These products can be extremely useful in measuring ROI on social networks but are primarily designed for bigger brands and corporations .
Still , in terms of all - encompassing tool sets , these tools have the edge .
This is the hard part .
After you have defined your baseline , you need to take the metrics from your monitoring tools and see how they correlate to higher sales , better customer retention , or whatever your primary markers for output are .
If your ultimate measurement is sales for instance , look at your sales level .
If it has increased , look at the number of referrers on your e-commerce site ( assuming you can track this data ) from your website or Twitter or the number of coupons used that were given away in a Facebook campaign to start calculating which sales stemmed from your social media campaigns .
Do you see any trends ?
Is traffic up to your store after posting on Facebook ?
What about Twitter ?
Does store traffic correlate with more sales when evaluating that same data ?
Does a higher sentiment analysis on Twitter lead to more sales or more visits ?
is the key to measuring ROI .
What do you use when measuring social media ROI ?
Is ROI the best term for measuring impact of social media , or should something else be used ?
What have you found to be good indicators of things that work and do n't work when using social media ?

At the other end of the scale , when the oil price hit rock bottom earlier this year , the WTI crude benchmark appeared to be too low in relation to global demand .
The WTI crude is usually about $ 1 more expensive than London Brent , but at one point in January , it fell $ 12 below the rival European benchmark .
The problem was inadequate storage at Cushing , Oklahoma , where physical WTI crude is delivered .
The reserves were full to bursting point , creating the illusion of an oversupply in the international markets when the severity of the glut was in reality localised to this particular terminal .
Microsoft Corp. has done more to popularize graphical programming than any other vendor .
The company 's development tools , led by Visual Basic and Visual Studio , have been used by millions of software developers over the past two decades .
But during a revealing and often humorous panel discussion on the future of programming at last week 's Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles , Microsoft 's own superstar developers espoused their loyalty to old - school methods of coding software .
" I will fight you if you try to take away my text editor , " said Don Box , a Microsoft distinguished engineer .
" Do people want to draw pictures [ to program ] ?
Sure , I guess , " continued Box , who works on creating declarative languages and tools for Microsoft .
" But if you grew up programming when I did , you did it in text .
And I think we lose that at our peril . "
" Graphical programming environments are usable when they are useless , but unusable when they would be useful , " said Jeffrey Snover , another Microsoft distinguished engineer and creator of Microsoft 's Power Shell scripting tool for Windows .
" When there are five things on the screen , you can burp that out [ in text ] .
But when there are 500 things , [ graphical programming ] is completely unusable .
You zoom in and zoom out and you lose all context .
I think it 's just smokin ' dope . "
While visual programming can be easier to learn and can help make developers more productive , it 's also " easier to delude yourself , " said Butler Lampson , a technical fellow at Microsoft .
For instance , " no one can ever tell you what a UML diagram means . "
Lampson , winner of the Association for Computing Machinery 's A.M. Turing Award in 1992 for his " contributions to personal computing and computer science , " is a co-creator of nine programming languages .
Microsoft is belatedly increasing support for the Unified Modeling Language , or UML , in the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 release that 's slated to ship next year .
Besides visual programming tools and UML , Microsoft is pushing managed code through its Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) technology in the next version of the tool set .
Managed code runs inside a virtual machine .
That makes it easier and faster to write , and more secure , say proponents .
Managed code also lets developers " perform above their level of competence , " Snover said .
" Managed code is like antilock brakes , " he added .
" You used to have to be a good driver on ice or you would die .
Now you do n't have to pump your brakes anymore . "
Snover joked that programming is getting so abstract , developers will soon have to use Microsoft 's in - air motion sensor game controller for the Xbox , dubbed Project Natal , to " write programs through interpretative dance . "
Other programming gurus , such as Herb Sutter , lead designer of Microsoft's C++/CLI programming language , predict that writing code to run on bare metal may come back into fashion , as chip makers find themselves unable to keep boosting processor speeds at current rates .
" I think we have maybe five to 10 years left [ with Moore 's Law ] , " he said .
" Optimizations will get very , very sexy again , when people realize how we pay for abstractions . "
Also , Sutter said , programmers need to start writing apps optimized for parallelized , multicore PCs , which have been available for the past several years .
However , significant improvements to multicore programming languages are needed first , said Burton Smith , a Microsoft technical fellow and expert on parallel programming languages .
" Today 's [ multicore ] programming languages are pretty low level and not very productive .
They take a lot of human attention and effort , " Smith said .
It will be a long time before parallel programming becomes mainstream , he predicted .
" Because of the bias towards sequential programming , we 'll still be reinventing ourselves [ as parallel programmers ] 12 years from now , " he said .
Back in 2001 , a fellow by the name of Kees van der Westen had already made a big name for himself as an artist with metalwork and someone who loved espresso and the technology behind it .
He 'd designed one - off machines for some of the top echelon of the espresso world for almost two decades by that point , including machines showcased at La Marzocco , used at Espresso Vivace , and dreamed of by a yet to be started up roastery in Portland known as Stumptown .
He was well into the run of building his fabled Mistral lineup of machines , using La Marzocco parts ; mainly from Lineas .
van der Westen had spare machine parts in ample supply because he was the distributor and service agent for La Marzocco in Holland at the time .
Lineas were La Marzocco 's sole machine during that period , but van der Westen also had a collection of old GS / 2 machines - single and double groups - at a time when La Marzocco had long ceased production of the machine .
As he puts it himself on his website ,
" Through the years we acquired some of the old type paddle - groups from the GS machines .
As we could not bring ourselves to dump these we eventually decided to use these in a fun-project : building a small series of one - group machines , especially designed to use these groups for their proper purpose .
This machine was called Speedster . "
The Speedster of that era was about as old school inside as you could get .
It featured the original GS 's same - size boilers used for both brewing and steaming .
It was almost entirely mechanical , with no temperature stability or state of the art electronics .
It did however feature three key things - the iconic and revolutionary La Marzocco paddle group ; the aforementioned dual boiler setup ; and the complete uniqueness of van der Westen 's design skills .
Original Speedster
One of the six original Speedsters built in 2001 ; features La Marzocco boilers , paddle group .
Only six were built .
I first saw the Speedster back in 2002 when I was at La Marzocco 's Seattle office for a meeting about developing the machine that would eventually become the GS / 3 .
Kent Bakke was one of the purchasers of those Speedsters and had it proudly on display in his showroom at La Marzocco .
I still remember my first glimpse of the machine , and this was after I 'd been wow'ed by another van der Westen artwork piece Bakke owned and had on display : the Zizi lever group machine .
As impressive ( and big ) as the Zizi was , the Speedster almost seemed on a different plane .
Where the Zizi was huge and a lever and a complete work of art ( definitely forsaking a certain amount of usability for the art ) , the Speedster encompassed art , design , style and usability .
It was small .
It had dual boilers .
It had a GS / 2 paddle group .
It was completely unique .
I 'd never seen a machine like it before .
I even got a chance to pull shots on it , and immediately felt this was a singular moment in my coffee and espresso career ( and to put that into perspective , I was at a meeting for the development of the GS / 3 ! ) .
Everything " clicked " - the machine felt comfortable .
It steamed exceptionally well .
The paddle group put you , as a barista , in direct connection with the machine .
It was tight , light , solid , beautiful , industrial , exceptional all at the same time .
From that very moment onward , I had it in my mind that , if I ever won a million dollars , I 'd make an offer on this machine so I could own my own - and the offer would n't be cheap .
After all , van der Westen built only six of these and by 2002 , was already saying that was that - there were six and there would be no more .
I finally met van der Westen in 2004 at a trade show and we immediately hit it off .
He 's a dynamic , energetic fellow ( who ironically enough does not like to be photographed ) ; and there 's a clear passion for espresso , espresso technology and art within the man .
My first questions to him were " so when are you going to build the Speedster again ? " and I got a surprise answer : " find me the guts to a well working GS / 2 and I 'd be happy to build one ! " .
I 'm not sure if he was joking or not , but I do know two things - I did in fact search for a reasonably priced GS / 2 I could salvage and send to van der Westen ( hint : I never found one ) , and secondly , he never did build another paddle group Speedster as far as I know .
Over the years , I stayed in contact with van der Westen , and the subject of the Speedster would always come up - are you building them again ?
Send me a GS / 2 and I will .
How about a lever Speedster ?
Oh , you 're a crazy man , Prince .
Then in early 2008 , during an email conversation with him , van der Westen dropped a bomb : he decided he needed a one group machine to complement and supplement his current line up of state - of - the - art and exceptionally beautiful Mirages and ( licensed to La Marzocco ) Mistrals , and that one group machine would be a next generation Speedster .
It was right at that moment I started socking away $ 200 a month into a special savings account .
And some 18 months later , I became the proud owner of a next - generation Speedster espresso machine from Kees van der Westen .
The Machine Speedster Crate
The shipping crate is 82kg
Inside
Inside is the machine , accessories , pump , water softener .
First Look
First glimpse of the Speedster during unpacking .
Ltd Edition Cups
Very limited edition cups that come with the machine .
Kees ' Tamper
A custom - height tamper included with machine .
There 's not much I could write about the technological innards of the Speedster that van der Westen has n't already fully detailed himself on his website - but I 'll give it a go , at least from a third party perspective .
It 's also important to note that the machine has already seen upgrades and will continue to do so .
The Speedster ships quite complete .
In the crate you 'll find : all necessary tubing , pressure tubes , connections , etc .
water softener machine .
the pump .
single spout and double spout portafilter ( or a chopped portafilter if you ordered one ) , teflon lined ( chopped PFs are not teflon lined ) .
Kees van der Westen custom tamper , height adjustable .
Heavy , beautiful , mirror polish finish .
custom Speedster espresso cups - two .
These are ltd edition though .
a cleaning brush ( a clone of the Pallo design ) in aluminum .
spare gaskets , filter baskets , blind filter .
aluminum tamping stand .
Speedster t- shirt ( again ltd item , once gone , no more ) .
Speedster instruction manual including setup instructions .
cleaner .
Little things like the brush , cups , t- shirt , and bigger things like the way - cool tamper make a big difference to the overall package .
Seems complete .
About the only thing missing is the grinder .
By comparison a La Marzocco GS / 3 comes with a plastic tamper , bottle of cleaner , two PFs and little else .
And no grinder either .
The Speedster Espresso Machine is about as state of the art inside as you can get in today 's espresso world , and is quite different from the 2001 era Speedster , at least inside .
The machine is built around a dual boiler , dual PID ( proportional integral derivative ) controller setup to deliver brewing water , heating water and steam .
The boilers feature the latest go - to technology in espresso : the 3.5 litre steam boiler is fitted with a heat exchanger to provide pre-heated water for the smaller 2.3 litre brew boiler .
This technology was initially developed for the GS / 3 to help with power consumption but it was also found to increase temperature stability , especially shot - to - shot - to - shot performance in all machines , Along with the Speedster , some of the most technologically advanced machines in the world feature this design , including the La Marzocco FB80 and GB / 5 series , and the Synesso machines .
Both boilers are controlled via solid state relays , a much more reliable and efficient way to control the heating elements over the old mechanical relays .
They are also virtually silent , and much less prone to break down ( or wearing down ) compared to the older style of relays most machines have .
Taking a peek inside the Speedster takes all of two minutes : four side bolts and three hex bolts in the back and both the side panels and top panel slide off easily .
If you 've seen earlier interior photos of the Speedster ( 2008 version ) , things have changed a bit .
There are no less than four electronic Parker solenoid valves controlling everything from steam boiler refill to water mix , to injecting the preinfusion chamber unique to the Speedster ( and Mirage line from van der Westen ) .
Initially , the Speedster had the steam boiler PID on the right side of the machine , accessible through a maze of copper tubing , but that has since moved to the more clean left side .
Also gone from the initial 2008 version is the internal adjustable mix valve the Speedster offered for hot water dispensing ; instead there 's a very unique dual mode hot water option available via a front panel rocker switch .
Let me focus on that one bit for a second .
The Speedster 's two ginormous dial handles up front were traditionally for steam ( the left side ) and hot water ( the right side ) .
But on the 2009 edition of the Speedster , the right side dial handle is for show and aesthetics only because accessing hot water on this machine is accomplished via a rocker switch on the right front panel .
Why a rocker switch ?
van der Westen heard feedback from many professional baristas regarding hot water from a machine .
Some wanted a mix valve , pulling both water from a steam boiler ( above boiling , usually 275F ) and line water ( 72 F ) so the resulting water pulled into a cup could be below boiling or usually around 200F .
Others wanted steam boiler only water ( 275 F but " flashes " to 212 F as it comes out of the tap ) for the heat .
van der Westen devised a system in 2009 that provided both , via microswitches , solenoids and computer control and the result was the rocker switch activation for hot water .
Flip the switch upward and the hot water tap feeds steam boiler - only water .
Flip it down , and you get mixed water - steam boiler and line water - for approximately 200F water at the tap head .
Quite ingenious .
Steam Wand Detail
An elongated " acorn " tip , this is easily one of the best tips we 've ever used in the CoffeeGeek Lab .
Four Holes
The tip has four small holes ; the other included tip ( the " Mistral Tip " ) is the same design with bigger holes .
PID Control
The Speedster uses top - of - the - line Fuji PID controllers for both boilers ; the one up front is for the brew boiler , but the K1/ K2 are indicators for both PIDs ( K1 is front boiler PID ) .
Programming the temperatures is as easy as pressing P for a second and adjusting up or down .
Offset can be programmed in ( as it is here ) .
Heat Exchanger Tubing
The maze of tubing you see is primarily the heat exchanger tubing , running outside the boilers to cool down HX water before it gets to the brew boiler .
Mounting Legs , Adjustment
This is the drip tray mount ( there 's one on each leg up front ) .
It can be slid up or down to give an extra inch in tray height .
Rocker Switch for Hot Water
This is the up / down rocker switch for delivering two temperatures of hot water .
Dispersion Screen
The screwless dispersion screen ; note the centre does n't have the hole - perforations - that is to further disperse water ( which can drain in the middle from the dispersion block )
Hot Water Tap
Flipped up for photographing , the hot water tap 's wide articulation of motion and well engineered flow dispersion is top of the line .
I focused on the hot water delivery to prove a point about this machine and about the person who builds it : Kees van der Westen is a details man .
Pretty much every aspect of this machine , from the aesthetics , to the usability , to the technology inside shows a supreme attention to detail by an artist and engineer who " gets " modern day espresso .
This is n't a machine designed by someone who 's building for 10,000 units sold in Spain , or 25,000 units sold in China , where niceties such as temperature stability , steaming ability or manual controls are not valued much .
This is machine designed by someone who gets what the modern day professional barista demands from a state of the art espresso brewer .
It shows in every single aspect of the machine 's design and function .
Preinfusion System Preinfusion Piston
Piston is fully engaged ( sticking out of the machine ) showing full preinfusion .
This is where the Speedster really starts to stand out .
When it was first announced that the machine was going to be built again in limited numbers , the prototype machines that van der Westen showed at the Copenhagen World Barista Championships in 2008 were missing something obvious - it was no longer a paddle group machine .
Instead , brewing was done via a three - position shift lever on the right side of the front panel .
Here is another example of van der Westen 's brilliance in engineering design - two areas actually .
He fully understands the allure and hands - on control that La Marzocco 's 20 + year technology known as the paddle group offered to a professional barista for crafting a shot of espresso .
So do Synesso and Slayer - their machines feature paddles for hands on control of preinfusion .
van der Westen also believes that the lever group design ( for spring piston lever espresso machines ) offers the best form of preinfusion and coffee saturation today , which is why his Mirage machine line up includes the Idrocompresso variant .
van der Westen found a way to marry three key desired methodologies in espresso machines - dual boilers , manual preinfusion , piston lever enabled preinfusion - into one machine controlled by solid state relays and PIDs - and this is what makes the Speedster entirely unique .
The Mirage lineup are heat exchanger machines ( single boilers with heat exchangers for the groupheads ) ; the Speedster is a dual boiler machine that still encompasses all the best from two other machine technologies .
How it works is a bit difficult to explain but we 'll try here .
When water for brewing first comes into the machine it actually goes through a heat exchanger in the steam boiler .
It gets heated up quite a bit - hotter than what is adequate for brewing in fact - but the machine 's design takes that into account .
The brewing water exits the steam boiler heat exchanger and goes through over 50 cms ( almost 2 feet ) of copper tubing that snakes around the back - right side of the machine .
The tubing eventually makes it into the brew boiler , where the water is now just slightly below usual boiler water temperature settings .
The brew boiler 's PID is constantly turning on and off the heating element to manage the temperature to 0.1 F / 0.1C ranges .
At this point the water is approximately 3 - 4 F hotter than your customised brewing temperature ( if you 've programmed the front PID to have a pre-programmed offset ) .
When you move the shift lever away from its off position , a microswitch is disengaged and one of the machine 's two brewing water solenoids is re-engaged ( the one right behind the groupcap ) to keep the pressure - release path closed , and the other brewing water solenoid on the right front of the machine is disengaged , allowing water flow from the line pressure ( 3 bar usually ) to start flowing into a preinfusion chamber which sits just behind the right front panel .
While this small chamber ( not unlike the size and shape of a lever piston 's water chamber ) starts filling up with water , the water also flows at normal atmospheric pressure to the grouphead where your coffee is sitting .
For approximately 5 to 6 seconds , if you do n't engage the machine 's pump , the coffee is saturated with water being pushed by nothing more than gravity .
You also get a visual indication of this via the preinfusion chamber 's most notable design feature - there is a spring - loaded piston that starts to jut out from the front panel of the Speedster as the chamber fills up .
As it fully extends , pressure in the grouphead ramps up from normal pressure to 3 bar ( about 60psi ) .
It will hold steady at this point as long as you do n't move the brewing shift lever to its third position - the pump position .
Shifting the machine into ' second gear ' means ratcheting the shift lever down to the lowest position and slotting it left into the locked position .
At this point , a second microswitch is engaged and the pump starts , delivering 9 bar through both the preinfusion chamber and solenoid to start the true espresso brewing process .
Shifting off the second gear lock position does one thing , and one thing only - it disengages the pump .
If you do n't put the shift lever back up into the neutral or starting position , the machine keeps the group cap solenoid engaged ( ie back pressure is not released ) and the preinfusion chamber solenoid disengaged ( ie , open flow to grouphead from boiler water ) ; what this means is you can do a preinfusion , brewing via pump , and a post brew using line pressure , if you want .
Whether this is a boon or not for espresso brewing quality is not for deciding here - instead , I mention it to show the possibilities a hands - on barista has for fully manipulating water flow and pressure during the entire shot process .
Putting the shift lever back into the neutral position does two things - it closes the brew boiler / preinfusion chamber solenoid , and opens up the back pressure solenoid to instantly relieve the pressure in the brewing group .
On last thing about this preinfusion system .
There 's actually two ways it works .
If you ratchet the brewing shift lever into the first position ( first gear we call it here ) , you as the barista control the preinfusion and the preinfusion is quite slow since it is entirely based on line water pressure ( 60 psi , 3 bar ) , and not pump pressure ( 135psi , 9bar ) .
But you can use the van der Westen - designed " programmed " preinfusion by simply ratcheting the shift lever directly into position two ( second gear ) and letting the preinfusion chamber fill up via pump pressure .
It is a faster preinfusion , but a neutral pressure preinfusion none - the - less .
Speedster Shifter
One of the things that makes the Speedster so special - it 's shift lever brewing activation system .
Ratchet System
The shift lever arm is perforated , and can ratchet into the first position , right onto that metal bracket sticking out midway - ratcheting below that moves it into pump position .
Preinfusion Piston
A lot of people ask what this is .
You show them by brewing a shot .
Shift Lever & Microwsitches
The interior of the shift lever system .
Here , at the neutral or off position , it is depressing the top metal microswitch ( with a roller - wheel ending for smooth control )
Shift Lever in 1st Gear
Here , in " 1st Gear " , the arm is not pressing any microswitch - at this stage , the pressure relief solenoid is closed , but the line water solenoid is open , preinfusing the bed of coffee .
In 2nd Gear
Here , in the " 2nd gear " position , the second microswitch is pressed , which engages the machine 's pump .
It also does other things , like tell the machine 's brains to not auto - fill the steam boiler at this time ( to make sure 100 % of the attention and power of the machine goes to shot brewing )
Preinfusion Piston - Off
Here , before starting a shot , the preinfusion piston is flush with the rest of the mounting .
Preinfusion Piston - Starting
As the preinfusion commences , the chamber behind this piston is filling up , and the piston itself starts to extend out .
Preinfusion Piston - continuing
Preinfusion continues ; if the machine is in 1st gear , it is fairly slow as line pressure slowly builds up .
If it were in 2nd gear , this would come out approximately 40 % faster .
Preinfusion Piston - Almost full
At this stage ( about 6 - 7 seconds in on line preinfusion , or 3 - 4 seconds in on pump preinfusion ) , the chamber is almost full .
Water on the bed of coffee is still below 3 bar pressure .
Preinfusion Full
Once the piston stops moving , the puck is then saturated with a full 3 bar of pressure ( or will ramp up to 9 bar if you 're direct into second gear ) .
Chopped Portafilter
I ordered the machine with an optional chopped portafilter .
The finish on it is quite nice - not re-chromed , but polished , buff and smooth at the chop .
Other machine technology aspects
The Speedster features three 900 watt heating elements - two in the steam boiler ( left and right ) and one in the brewing boiler .
It runs on 220V , 20 amp service , and requires special electrical hookup in N. America in a home environment - you cannot plug this machine into a standard 110V 15 amp ( or 20 amp ) plug .
The Speedster also requires plumbing in .
You could run it off a water bottle setup with a Flo - jet handling the preinfusion , but to get the full benefits of the multi- preinfusion systems , running a cold water line from a T - valve off your kitchen 's sink is a requirement , not an option .
Little niceties about the machine include the use of POM plastic for the dispersion block inside the grouphead - something I do n't think any other espresso machine uses ( at least that I know of ) .
POM is extremely durable , temperature neutral , and very resistant to any kind of oils contamination from the coffee .
The dispersion screens are a screwless design ( similar to E61 machines ) and the grouphead itself is a fully saturated design - the grouphead is in effect part of the brewing boiler - its volume of water is part of the brewing boiler 's overall volume .
There are so many more technological things to talk about with regards to the Speedster but the last we 'll discuss is something that is both elegantly simple and painfully obvious but you have to wonder why something like this is rarely done by other machine builders .
The Speedster has a very simple and accessible boiler draining system .
If you take the left panel off the machine , you can see two beefy pipes extending out from the two boilers at the bottom of each .
These pipes come to the right border of the machine 's frame and have caps on the front and shiny red levers on top .
When the machine is cooled down all you need to do to completely drain the boilers is remove the caps , attach hoses to the pipes and open the valves .
No bendy - twisty actions to get to a bottom - capped boiler drain .
No flipping the machine this way and that to access them .
Simple .
Elegant .
Efficient .
Gear Lever
You 'll find the dual - ball design of this gear lever for activating brewing to be very comfortable once you use the machine for a few shots .
Speedster vs GS /
3
The machines side by side - very interesting to see the speedster has a lower profile , is a tiny bit wider , and quite a bit more deep front to back .
For aesthetics , there 's no question which one wins .
On Off Switch
The switch is huge , and easy to access .
I never turn this thing off though .
Drain Valves
The drains on the right side of the machine .
Clear .
Big. Accessible .
And very bright candy - red turning dials .
These water drains are a perfect example of what this machine is all about - a complete , state of the art espresso machine designed by a company that pays attention to the smallest most minute details .
Aesthetics and Usability Speedster User Angle
The Speedster ( before offset was programmed in ) from the user angle .
It was evident the moment this machine was taken out of its crate - the Speedster is something special , and part of that special - ness comes from the absolute attention to details this machine has been given by the manufacturer .
From the business side of the machine ( the operational front ) , you feel like you 're operating a 1950s roadster , or perhaps even a racer - airplane and facing the dash or control panel .
The portafilter evokes feelings of a joystick in a retro plane .
The shifter on the right side is super slick and tends to catch most new users by surprise .
From the side , the roadster and retro-aeronautic feelings continue , but as you get around to the back of the machine , it feels like a 1950s flying wing or slight - steam - punk alien bug ship .
All very cool .
The side panels .
What really can I say , except to say photos do n't even do them justice .
In person , they are a major wow factor .
The high gloss polish on the aluminum panels is broken up by the carved out powder - coated yellow stripes and red lettering .
Just stunning .
Polish is inside as well as out .
The plating on the machine , known commercially as " perlage " or engine tuned plating is first rate , and blemish free .
I own a a fair bit of hand built products .
I had a locally hand built mountain bike for some time .
I have a variety of hand built coffee and espresso machine products .
I feel I can safely say this :
There is no product I 've seen that is hand built , one a time that has the level of fit and finish the Speedster has .
Heck , even where there are metal and plastic washers ( like on the drip tray frame bar mounts ) , the plastic washers are lined up perfectly with the metal washers - I know because when I went to go adjust the height of the drip tray and re-tightened the bolts , I put the plastic washers slightly out of alignment ( easy to do ) .
There is not a single dirty / scorched weld on this machine .
There are no gaps .
Every single seam , angle , joinery , weld , curve and physical part on the outside of the machine is flawless .
I noticed it right away in the drip tray 's design and build : given the angular , " floating on air " nature of the drip tray and drip tray cover , I half expected to see weld scorch marks in hidden areas or where metal has been joined with metal , but there are none .
All the bends are precise .
All the welds are flawless and polish - finished .
All the pieces align perfectly .
You can see it from every angle on the machine - for as much attention that has been given to the internal construction of the Speedster , at least as much ( if not more ) has been given to the fit and finish .
In preparation for this first look I scoured the machine front to back , side to side and top to bottom to find one flaw , no matter how small , in the build quality .
I found none .
Compare this to the GS / 3 .
We have a paddle group model in the CoffeeGeek Lab and it is an amazing machine technologically , but the aesthetics are very meh , and the fit and finish is questionable at times .
You can see weld scorch marks on the upper cup tray of the GS / 3 for example .
You can wiggle around the cup tray and drip tray because the fit is n't terribly precise .
The side panels on my original GS / 3 paddle group had misaligned mounting bolts making it quite difficult to remove the left side panel .
The Speedster has none of these issues .
It is in a completely different league when it comes to aesthetics , quality of build and fit and finish .
I cannot say it enough : I have never seen an espresso machine with such a complete attention to every minute detail as I have with the Speedster .
It sets a completely new standard .
Speedster Usability
Usually aesthetics and usability in an industrial product are mutually exclusive - or at the very least , a case of 60 % one way , 40 % the other way .
Usually something has to give .
On the Speedster , there 's very little give in the usability department when compared to the aesthetics .
Let 's get the usability quirks out of the way first .
The drip tray is a gorgeous piece of the artwork puzzle on the Speedster .
From the user viewpoint , it hangs in mid air with seemingly no supports .
It cuts a wide arrow shape out from the body towards one of the Four " M "s ( that 'd be you ) , and is wide and spacious .
But the top tray , the perforated part , is only held in place by gravity , a small " lip " overhanging the back end of the tray , and by virtue of the sides sitting on the angled basin of the tray .
In short , it kind of slides around , mainly when you 're cleaning the tray .
It is not an issue when brewing shots .
This is an entirely minor thing and to show you how good this machine is , probably my biggest gripe .
The gauges are also a bit hard to read from the user 's standpoint .
They are on the front panels of the machine but seem angled downward somewhat and you have to drop lower to fully read them .
The rocker switch for the multi-choice hot water gives the appearance of being flimsy ( it actually is n't - its more of a perception ) and very minutely out of place on the machine .
Most other elements are beefy ( the steam and hot water handle dials , the shift lever ) , so the long narrow rocker switch seems different .
The grouphead and portafilter position is quite low - at the factory - setting , the drip tray is in its uppermost position ( it is height adjustable by about an inch ) and the spouts on the double portafilter barely clear an illy espresso cup by 3 cm ; cappuccino cups clear it by maybe 1 cm .
For my use this is perfect - I rarely brew into anything larger than a latte wide - bowl cup , but for some it may be an inconvenience - you wo n't be fitting your 16 oz mug under a spouted portafilter .
Probably the last thing to mention in the negative column is n't really a negative at all - it is the result of something very positive about the machine .
The steam boiler 's intake is fed by a 0.6 mm gicleur valve to slow down the boiler refill and keep the temperatures rock steady solid in the steam boiler .
This is by design .
It makes the machine even more temperature stable than even the best from Synesso and La Marzocco ( at least those without a 0.6 mm gicleur on the steam boiler ) .
The downside is when you first fill the machine it takes quite a bit longer than other similar sized boilers and when you access steam boiler hot water , the refill via the pump runs a bit longer .
A very minor thing and an excellent tradeoff for amazing temperature ability .

Drip Tray Details
From the user perspective it appears the drip tray floats in air without any visible support .
Also note the angled back plate - it's a " poor man 's " mirror , showing an exposed portafilter pour without needing to bend underneath .
Edging Detail
The fit and finish is very visible here - special bends , polishing rough edges , intricate cuts .
Nothing is missed on the build of this machine .
There 's a weld in there !
In the drip tray basin , there are welds , but you'd be hard pressed to find some of them .
They are polished , finished off , and no scorch marks .
Plating Detail
Here , the top trip tray sits on the drip tray basin .
You 're dealing with angles , bent metal , slopes and such , but it all fits perfectly .
Badging
The machine 's batching details , including serial number .
Kees ' has a super sweet logo .
Orman Dials
The dials are very retro , black , white lettering , fire engine red dials .
the machine plating is first rate .
Note no gaps at all between the front plate and side aluminum panels - though they are not attached at all to each other .
Ormon Dial - Pressure
This is the pump pressure dial .
It shows status of preinfusion and pump pressure .
Onto the positives in usability .
Well , just about everything !
The grouphead 's gasket accessibility is literally the best I 've ever worked with .
Accessing the PID for the brew boiler is a breeze - it is right up front , dead centre on the machines lower front panel .
Use the shift lever for a week and it feels like the most natural way to control brewing espresso that has ever existed .
The machine is quiet , rattle free , and extremely solid on the counter .
The hot water wand articulates into the middle of the machine - a very good design which at first may seem to go against the machine 's aesthetic look .
But trust me , you want the hot water over the drip tray , not over the side of the tray .
Articulation is quite extensive too - you can rotate it on a near 180 - 360 degree plane on both vertical and horizontal axis ( and other axis too , I guess ) .
What I 'm trying to say is you can point the water wand almost anywhere on the right side of the drip tray .
It is hot touch , but has a rubber grabber on it that is nice and big but not ugly ( nothing on this machine is ugly ) .
Using the three position shift lever for brewing is something that at first seems weird , but quickly becomes natural for brewing espresso and as you fine tune your preinfusion and brewing technique , you 'll wonder why this kind of brewing system is n't on every machine .
It actually works quite similar to the way a paddle group operates - move to one position and the line valves to the grouphead open up .
Move to another position and you engage the pump .
After one week , the Speedster 's brewing control seemed incredibly natural .
Viewing a shot as it develops is extremely easy on this machine - there are no blocked ' sight lines ' .
Because of the nature of the exposed grouphead and groupcap , the portafilter spouts sit out in the open , not obscured in any way by other parts of the machine .
People sitting to the side of the machine can see a shot develop just as well as the operator or people standing in front .
Let me focus on one particular aspect of usability - steaming .
This machine is of course a manual steamer , meaning you control the steam through a variable control dial handle , and there are no gizmos or froth aiders to help impede things .
The steam boiler is rated to handle 3.0 + bar of pressure ( most commercial machines top out at 1.8 or 2.2 bar ) meaning that it is a complete steam monster in terms of power - it comes factory preset to run at around 2.3 bar , and you can easily modify the steam boiler 's PID up or down by removing the left side panel and accessing it .
The machine ships with two steaming tips - the stock one ( the " Speedster tip " ) is a bit of a limiter in that the four holes are small and restrict the full steaming pressure somewhat , making it easy to steam 12 oz pitchers .
The other included tip ( the " Mirage tip " ) has four bigger holes and will fully utilize the steam boiler 's ample steam production .
I definitely do not need the bigger - hole tip .
With the slightly restricted tip , I was steaming and frothing in 24oz pitchers ( starting with about 12 oz of milk ) in under 15 seconds .
Doing 5 oz of milk in a 12 oz pitcher takes less than 10 seconds ( I have n't timed it yet , but it is closer to 7 seconds than 10 ) .
What amazed me was that , even for all that power ( the GS / 3 takes twice as long ) , I was creating beautiful microfoam and had great control over the steaming from the very first pitcher .
Part of it is the valve system the Speedster uses - there 's actually quite a bit of control over the amount of steam you use via the dial .
Where most steam knob dials go from nothing to full power with very little turn , you have a radius of at least 2 hours ( ie from noon to 2 pm on a clock face ) adjustment possible on the Speedster to fine tune how much steam you 're releasing down the pipe .
I have not found another machine with more fine tuning control over the volume of steam .
The machine is also extremely serviceable .
As mentioned previously , 4 side bolts ( twist off by hand ) and three hex bolts at the back of the machine are all that are needed to remove before you can take off the side panels and top plate .
I 've done it in under 1 minute .
Almost everything is accessible at this point , save for the water line connections .
For me this is a huge usability gain .
Ordering Process
If you want a Speedster you can order it direct from Kees van der Westen , or order one through a local distributor .
Three of note include 49th Parallel in Canada , and Visions Espresso and Gimme Coffee in the US ( though there are more ) .
Two things to factor in .
This machine costs 4,975 Euros ( approximately $ 7,800 Canadian dollars , or $ 7,200 US dollars as of this writing ) , and you will have to pay shipping ( $ 350 sea , $ 620 air ) , duties and taxes ( 9 % duty in Canada plus your local PST and GST ) , bringing the cost close to $ 10,000 Canadian dollars , or around $ 9,000 US once it is set up in your home , office , cafe or roastery .
The second thing to factor in is a waiting list - a long one .
You may have to wait up to six months to get a Speedster .
van der Westen only builds a few each month and the waiting list last time I checked was over 4 months long .
Some distributors may charge a premium over van der Westen 's 4,975 Euro price + shipping + taxes , some may not ( 49th Parallel , for example , sells them at " cost " ) , but it is best to go through a distributor because they usually include installation as part of the price , and local servicing and warranty is included .
If you order direct , they will take your name and put you into the queue .
You may have to put a deposit down at that time .
Once the machine is being built , they will ask for the full amount paid via wire transfer .
The machines are shipped COD for delivery costs , so expect to pay the full delivery charge when it arrives .
Machines are well crated ( 82kg incl. crate ) and will ship to your nearest Intl ' airport , or if coming by sea , to a major shipping destination ( again usually an airport ) .
There are plenty of variants you can order when getting the Speedster .
They include , but are not limited to the following : Black powder - coated side plates ( black where you see red and yellow on our model ) (
Chopped portafilter instead of spouted model
Wide cup rail instead of narrow one
Mirror finish body work instead of perlage style
All black body panels , powder coated finish matching the legs
In addition , van der Westen debuted a lever version ( yes !!! ) at the Cologne World of Coffee Expo during the Summer of 2009 .
It is a prototype , but may go into production for 2010 .
Exposed Shot Extraction including Preinfusion
This video shows a HD rendition of an espresso shot on a Speedster espresso machine , using a factory - modified chopped portafilter .
This particular shot was done using manual preinfusion , which does tend to muck up the shot timing overall - with pump pressure , it was around 22 seconds , but I 'd call it about 30 seconds total including the preinfusion time .
One thing I 'd love to see on the Speedster in the future is one or two speedometer style gauges that show shot times for both full shot ( including manual or pump driven preinfusion ) and pump " on " time .
Conclusion I do n't know if I 'll ever post a full detailed review on the Speedster or not - hence this super long " first look " .
It 's quite an exclusive machine and a major expense - possibly the biggest expense someone would make for their home outside of actually buying the home or buying a car .
At the start of this First Look I hinted this may be the best espresso machine in the world .
Of course that is a subjective opinion and not rooted in any fact , but here are some real world things about the machine :
The Speedster has been installed and operating for five weeks now and has been viewed , used and experienced by at least 30 people , including many professional baristas , restaurant owners , sommeliers , bartenders and cafe owners .
One thing all had in common - to a one they all felt it was the most beautiful and intriguing espresso machine they 'd ever seen .
At times I had them observe and use both the Speedster and GS / 3 Paddle Group and while the more technologically savvy baristas recognized the GS / 3's ground breaking design and electronics , the Speedster was the constant first pick .
Usability is first rate .
It 's obviously a hands on machine allowing a certain amount of latitude in how shots are brewed , but where you want automated control ( in temperatures and pressures and stability ) , the machine has very few equals .
What could be better ?
At this point , only the addition of a few niceties might improve the machine , but they'd be minor things .
I 'd like to see a shot timer incorporated into the machine - perhaps , keeping with the retro feel , an analog stopwatch / speedometer kind of dial that engages as soon as the pump does , perhaps even two such devices - one on the left for overall shot time , and one on the right showing just the pump activation time .
It would keep with the automobile / racing plane theme of the front and sides of the machine .
Other than that , the machine is just about perfect .
For us at least , it is the best espresso machine in the world .
Nothing else , save for perhaps other Kees van der Westen machines , come close .
Hey everybody , great gangbang last week .
Really enjoyed it .
I would like to start by thanking Marsha and Bill for letting us use the mattresses in their garage for the gangbang .
I know Bill was keeping those underneath his old rowboat , so I hope the rowboat will be okay on the floor .
We did n't know that Bill 's mom would be in town and staying in the usual gangbang room , so thanks for going ahead with the gangbang anyway .
The chip and dip was really good , Marsha .
Nice selection of pops , although I would prefer some Coke and Pepsi over the store brand next time .
I talked to a few different guys and we would all be willing to chip in another couple extra bucks .
I think I can speak for everyone involved in the gangbang by saying it was a really fun and interesting night .
Got to meet a lot of really great people in the neighborhood , had some really good conversations , and I think I made some friends for the long haul .
Having said that , I think the best way to improve these gangbangs is to discuss some of the problems we might have had with it .
Other folks in the gangbang mailing list might have some other thoughts .
These are just my views on what I think might have been better .
Do n't take any of this the wrong way because you know how much these gangbangs mean to me and my wife since our daughter died .
Ways to improve the gangbang :
Less touch - intrusion .
I do n't know how exactly to put this , but I think it 's okay to reach in and feel around , just do n't do it right where somebody 's junk is going .
Hands touched my balls a few times , including somebody who stroked my taint for several seconds .
I could n't see who was doing it because of my position in the gangbang , but please , hands off unless somebody is inviting you to pinch and twist their balls .
Please keep your dogs locked up .
I can't stress this one enough .
Please , please , please keep your dogs in the backyard or locked in a spare bedroom or just otherwise away from the gangbang .
A barking dog can be a real distraction , but that 's nothing compared to a loose dog .
Gangbangs really make dogs rowdy .
I do n't know if it's all the pheromones up in the air or what , but they will just yap and run all around until they 're panting and going crazy .
Babies .
Find a sitter , please .
Gangbangs are only three hours long or so and if you can't find a sitter or a family member to watch your baby then just skip the gangbang .
Absolutely nothing against Marsha or Bill on this one , but I noticed babies just coming and going , crying , and peeking in during the gangbang .
A gangbang is not a daycare center , folks .
Different people take different amounts of time to orgasm .
I know orgasms can be a touchy subject for gangbangs , but sometimes I can feel a lot of pressure to hurry it up .
This is biology here , folks .
We 've got things going on , phantom hands grabbing balls , dogs running all over , babies crawling through the room ... gosh , you 've just got to be a little more generous with the time .
If we were all Roger Jeremy this would be easy .
Please do n't come to the gangbang drunk .
I 'm not going to name any names , but someone had a little bit too much liquid courage before showing up at last week 's gangbang and things did not end well with this person .
They were picking fights with people on the sidelines , someone was punched , and I know Marsha did n't enjoy spending all that time cleaning up after you .
Be considerate of your hosts and be considerate of your fellow gangbangers .
Do n't invite people you barely know to the gangbang .
We gangbangers are a pretty tight - knit bunch , but I 'm not against letting someone new into the group .
But please , you need to vouch for your guest .
In the past we 've had that guy who stripped down to just the toque and stared from the corner .
The guy never said anything .
Let me think , we had Randy 's cousin , the klepto .
God bless you , Randy , I know he 's family but the guy stole all the finger sandwiches Roxanne made for that week 's gangbang .
I guess what I 'm saying is that plus one on the invite is a precious thing , do n't squander it .
And how about leaving your problems behind when you enter the gangbang ?
The gangbang should be sacrosanct .
I really do n't want to hear about the squirrels messing up your birdfeeder or how you 're worried about layoffs .
I do n't need to know about your bunions .
If we start blabbing about all our troubles then people are coming in with agendas , they 're trying to make points by what position they pick or whatever .
I get head trips from Connie all day , the last thing I need is one during my gangbang .
No more criers !
Good choice this last week Bill and Marsha , but you 've gotta use an agency folks .
It 's a total crapshoot with the Craigslist and whatnot .
They may say they 're into a gangbang , but then when they get on that mattress in the garage and the dogs are barking and Pete 's got that wind up flashlight and the baby falls on the concrete and starts screaming and we 're all standing there with our peckers primed and she just starts bawling .
I mean , honestly , who does n't feel a little irritated by that ?
I can't be alone on that one .
You need a professional for a gangbang .
Keep track of your gum .
I know in my house at our gangbangs we 've got a strict no - gum rule .
If your hosts let you chew gum then be gracious enough not to just spit it out on the carpet or floor in the middle of the gangbang .
I 've been at some of these gangbangs where it felt like we were doing it on the floor of a movie theater .
I 'm too old for that sort of thing .
I gotta watch out for germs .
A little less judgmental about body types , please .
There 's bigger guys than me at these things , but come on , some of us are getting on in years and we can't all be Charlie Atlas .
Enough with the flexing and taking your shirts off .
There is no reason a man needs to take his shirt off in a gangbang .
Leave it on !
You think we want to see that ?
Forget it .
Music .
Some of these music choices are for the birds .
I do n't even know what sort of rap mans or metal bangers or whatever you are playing , but it 's out of control .
A little jazz or classical is all you really need .
I 'll accept some of that technology music you kids like with the electronic keyboard .
That 's fine as long as it has a good rhythm for gangbanging .
Please do n't make eye contact with other people during gangbanging , especially if you 're involved in the gangbanging at that moment .
Maybe it 's just my pet peeve , but when I am gangbanging on one part of the lady , and I look up and a man stares at me while he 's gangbanging the lady 's other part , it feels sort of like we 're gangbanging each other .
Which is not at all what this is about .
This is about community .
About sharing and making bonds , but not that kind of bonds .
A few days after the Sumatra earthquake , a friend of mine told me that she was lost for words when her daughter asked her : " Mother , why did God send us an earthquake ?
Why should we worship a God who sends us natural disasters and miseries relentlessly ? "
It is not only children who ask this kind of question in the aftermath of natural disasters , especially ones on a massive scale like the Aceh tsunami and the more recent Sumatra earthquake .
Many say that God is angry with us .
They say the Indonesians deserve the punishment because of their sins .
Clerics and priests urge us to ask forgiveness from God .
In the words of Muslim clerics , taubat nasuhah ( an act of contrition to God ) is what the Indonesians have to do .
Others confidently say natural disasters are signs the apocalypse has come nearer .
To make matters worse , some of our media give too much space to upholders of the ...
* Motorola to finance part of $ 149 mln investment
* Clearwire unveiled expansion to Spain last week
HELSINKI , Oct 14 ( Reuters ) - Motorola MOT.N said on Wednesday it had won an order to supply WiMax - technology network for Irish firm Imagine Communication Group , in another advancement for the ailing technology in Europe .
Motorola said it would finance a portion of the 100 million euro ( $ 149 million ) network investment .
Last week Clearwire International CLWR .
O unveiled its expansion into Spain , hoping to inject life into a technology that many in the mobile industry had already laid to rest .

WiMax has been competing for the status of next - generation mobile technology , but has largely lost the battle to Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) , which has become mobile operators ’ favoured solution as it can exploit existing infrastructure .
Hockenheim will next stage the German GP in 2010
Hockenheim will continue as one of Germany 's two Formula 1 circuits until at least 2018 after an agreement was reached over the track 's F1 future .
Formula One Administration ( FOA ) and circuit chiefs have agreed a deal to cover any loss the event makes .
A statement on www.hockenheim.com read : " The FOA and the Hockenheim - Ring GmbH will share in the entrepreneurial opportunities and risks of the event . "
Hockenheim , which alternates with the Nurburgring , first held the GP in 1970 .
Promoters have predicted a 6 m euro ( £ 5.5 m ) loss on next year 's Grand Prix .
Here ’s an interesting glimpse into the world of product placement .
As you can see , in the early 80s , now defunct tobacco giant Brown & Williamson hired a company by the name of Associated Film Promotions ( also now defunct ) to secure screen time for their cigarettes in major motion pictures .
This particular letter outlines their plan to have Sylvester Stallone promote the products in his next five films – a plan which he agreed to ( Pic ) – in return for $ 500,000 .
Equally as interesting is the stark reminder that Stallone was extremely close to starring in ( and directing ) The Godfather Part III at the time , as Joey Zasa .

Python 2.6.3 is out , will a lot of bugs fixed .
I had my share with Distutils and fixed quite a few , and 2.6.3 is looking very good so far !
Just a quick note for Setuptools users : you might bump into a problem if you provide a C extension .
The setuptools code makes some assumptions on how and in which order the Distutils build_ext API are called .
It also overrides some of these API to do some internal extra work .
In other words , the way Setuptools patches Distutils makes it very sensitive to any internal Distutils code changes .
In this particulare case you might have this bug :
File " ...setuptools/command/build_ext.py " , line 85 , in get_ext_filename KeyError : ' xxx '
The fix is quite simple , it can be done by the end - user or in your package ( which is better of course ) .
In your package : use “ Distribute >= 0.6.3 ″ distribution instead of the usual “ Setuptools == 0.6c9 ” distribution in you dependencies list .
The code remain unchanged and you can still “ import setuptools ” and have it working fine .
As an end - user : just do a Distribute installation and your fine “ ( sudo ) easy_install Distribute ”
Hang in #distutils on Freenode , or drop a mail in distutils - SIG in case you have a problem .
Just to make things clear : The Distribute 0.6.x series is a mirror of Setuptools 0.6c9 code , with bug fixes .

The UN rights chief says punishing war criminals is vital for peace The UN Human Rights Council has ended a first day of debate on whether to endorse a report into the Israeli offensive in Gaza last winter .
The report by veteran South African judge Richard Goldstone accuses both Israel and Hamas of war crimes .
Human rights groups have welcomed his report as serious and well - balanced , but Israel and the US say it is biased .
A vote is expected on Friday on a draft resolution about the report and Israel 's policies .
Pressure from allies " A culture of impunity continues to prevail in the occupied territories and in Israel , " Navi Pillay , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , said at Thursday 's opening of the special meeting of the UN Human Rights Council .
She called for " impartial , independent , prompt and effective investigations into reported violations of human rights and humanitarian law " .
Israel 's envoy said the resolution threatened to " set back peace " Israel has already come under pressure from its allies - including the US , UK and France - to investigate the UN allegations .
But Israel 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , Aharon Leshno Yaar , said the resolution threatened to " set back hopes for peace " .
The text of the draft resolution says UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon should monitor Israeli and Palestinian compliance with the Goldstone report .
It also contains a condemnation of Israel 's policies in East Jerusalem , another issue likely to divide the Council .
At its first debate two weeks ago , the Council decided to delay its response for six months .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at first agreed to this under pressure from the US aimed at getting the Middle East peace process back on track .
But after much public criticism at home , he demanded that the debate be reopened .
Old divisions
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the problem is that while the Goldstone report is widely regarded by rights groups as fair , the human rights council itself has a history of focusing on Israel 's alleged violations .
She says once again the old divisions are appearing , between the US , Israel and Europe on one side , and African and Arab nations on the other .
UN condemns ' war crimes ' in Gaza Israel condemns report Key excerpts : UN Gaza report
Our correspondent says rights groups fear that calls for the civilian victims of the Gaza conflict to have their grievances addressed could evaporate amid all the diplomatic wrangling .
The Goldstone report accuses Israel of using disproportionate force and deliberately harming civilians during the 22 - day conflict , which began on 27 December 2008 .
Palestinian Hamas militants are accused of indiscriminate rocket fire at Israeli civilians .
The report urges the Security Council to refer allegations to the International Criminal Court if either side fails to investigate suspects within six months .
Israel has rejected the evidence , saying it has already investigated its troops ' conduct , clearing most of the subjects of wrongdoing .
Hamas has also denied committing war crimes .
Israeli military action destroyed thousands of homes , hundreds of factories and 80 official buildings in Gaza .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 people were killed in the violence between 27 December 2008 and 16 January 2009 , more than half of them civilians .
Israel puts the number of deaths at 1,166 - fewer than 300 of them civilians .
Three Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli soldiers were also killed .

A few minutes ago , the Ubuntu development team unleashed the Beta release of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.10 ( Karmic Koala ) operating system , due for launch in late October this year .
As usual , we 've downloaded a copy of it in order to keep you up - to - date with the latest changes in the Ubuntu 9.10 development .
What 's new in Ubuntu 9.10 Beta ?
Well , as you probably already know , there is now a revamped Human theme , the Humanity icons and lots of wallpapers !
Moreover , the Ubuntu Software Store has been renamed to Ubuntu Software Center and updated several times in the last two weeks .
And ... in order to improve the boot performance , the Ubuntu developers have now transitioned to Upstart .
Ubuntu Software Center
A lot of the applications in the repository have been compiled using compilation flags that create Position - Independent Executables , which enable them to take advantage of the Address Space Layout Randomization function that is available in the Ubuntu kernel .
That way , when the programs load themselves into memory , they do n't always use the same layout , so an attacker can't redirect the program 's execution in the same way every time to run exploit code .
GNOME 2.28.0
The home folder encryption option in the installer is back , and after the installation , when the desktop appears , you will be prompted by a dialog to set up the encryption passphrase , in case you will ever need to recover your data from the encrypted partition .
See the picture below ...
What 's new in Kubuntu and Xubuntu 9.10 Beta ?

Every travel insurance policy covers different things but all would offer a varying degree of cover on :
Medical cover
Unforeseen illnesses , injuries or accidents will be covered under the medical section of your policy .
This covers the cost of receiving treatment overseas – including dental emergencies in most cases – and repatriation , the cost of having to fly you back to the UK .
On a slightly more morbid note , most policies cover cremation costs or the repatriation of a body should you or someone else covered under the policy die during your holiday .
Cancellation
Travel policies also cover cancellation if you can no longer go on your holiday or you need to come back early .
However , there needs to be a valid reason for you to abandon your trip .
Being made redundant , having to do jury service , or having to take care of a seriously ill family member are among the list of valid reasons .
But if you decide you no longer fancy a trip to the Canary Islands because you would rather go to the Maldives , or you want to return to the UK because you forgot to put EastEnders on series record , your claim will probably be rejected .
Important :
You need to know that new policies wo n't cover you against coronavirus - related cancellation , or if you 're travelling against Foreign Office advice .
Baggage and personal belongings
Your travel policy will also cover you if your stuff is lost , stolen or damaged while you are on holiday .
Almost everything you take overseas , including computers , phones , cameras and expensive clothing is included .
Many providers will also cover you for the loss of a passport , cash or a driving licence .
However , policies can vary greatly both in the amount covered and in the excess – the amount you have to pay towards the claim yourself .
For example , items such as cash or expensive goods can be subject to an additional higher excess .
Personal liability
Personal liability protects others and their property from accidents you may cause while on holiday .
For example , the personal liability element of your insurance would cover you if , during a skiing trip , you crashed into another skier and injured them .
Insurers will typically cover you for up to £ 2 m , which is generally more than enough .
Delays
Travel schedules are often the victim of adverse weather , so delay cover is one of the more important aspects of travel insurance .
Most policies cover against more than just storms , with many including events such as industrial action and mechanical breakdown .
If your flight 's been delayed for more than three hours or it's been cancelled you may be able to claim compensation of up to £ 530 directly from the airline but the reason for the delay or cancellation must be the airline 's fault , so bad weather for example , wo n't count .
This compensation is only for EU - regulated flights .
An EU flight is where the flight departed from an EU airport , regardless of the airline OR where an EU airline landed at an EU airport .
Under this law , EU airports also include those in Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway and Switzerland .
See our Flight Delay Compensation guide for more info .
If this does n't apply – perhaps because you flew both from and to an airport outside the EU – you can also try making a claim on your travel insurance policy .
Insurers typically pay out for each 12 - hour period you 've been delayed , but the payouts are often tiny compared to what you can get from your airline .
The GDP numbers for the third quarter of this year came out today and after months of contraction in the economy , the US Gross Domestic Product rose by about 3.5 % .
How can that be ?
Some say we are in recovery while others say it ca n’t last .
Critics point out that there was about a 23 % increase in durable goods and that the overall increase cannot be sustained .
They point to the US government ’s “ cash for clunkers ” program and that created a one - time , artificial jump in new car sales .
It is said that it is not sustainable .
Then there was the real estate numbers which also rose about 23 % .
That too , critics say , was a result of another government program of giving several thousands of dollars in tax credits to first time home buyers .
That too is seen as unsustainable .
Interest rates have been near zero for a long time now and now there are fears that the Fed will raise interest rates , though others point out that a rise in interest rates would indicate that the economy can handle it and that the economy is indeed pulling out of the recession .
Then there is this oddity .
Edmunds.com is a site that is an advocate for car buyers .
Their analysis of the cash for clunkers program says the government spent $ 24,000 per car sold , which is about 6 times more than the actual allowance provided .
They say that only 125 , 000 of the 691,000 cars sold were directly tied to cash for clunkers .
While that ’s a criticism , is that not also an argument that car sales were indeed real and not a facade ?
Yet , the government disputed their numbers as if to say , “ hey … those car sales were too ginned up by our program and not a real indicator of growth ! ”
Of course , theI have yet to hear about this duplicity in the media .
Who knows ?
No one predicted the big decline in the economy , yet we are supposed to believe that the sages know what will happen in the future .
If you look at the chart below , you see that after the crash of ’ 29 , the markets rose several times over the next 3 years , only to fall farther .
So , who knows what will happen .
One thing that is for certain .
Millions remain without jobs and until those who want to work can get work , it matters little what the data shows or the experts say .
If you have a job , its been a recession .
If you are out of work , it ’s a depression .
Which is what began 80 years ago .
On This Date in History :
On this date in 1929 , the stock market crashed .
The Dow had been quite
volatile before suffering a sharp drop on Oct 24 and then again on Oct 28 .
On Tuesday October 29 , 1929 , a day that became known as “ Black Tuesday , ” The market collapsed .
16 million shares of stock were sold as prices tumbled with a loss estimated at $ 9 Billion , which was a lot of money back then .
The decline continued and by mid-November losses totaled some $ 30 Billion .
( Video from 1929 )
Fortunes were lost and eventually jobs were lost
and then there was the Depression that followed .
Many historians of economics suggest that it was not the stock market crash that caused the depression , but rather governmental action and reaction that caused the economic malaise .
Congress passed the Smoot - Hawley Act that raised tarriffs on 3200 imports by 60 % in late September .
On October 21 , Congress defeated an attempt to exempt agricultural goods .
Three days later , the market began its decline .
President Hoover could have vetoed the measure but instead signed it 7 months after its passage and the resulting market crash .
Prices on many good rose .
Taxes were also increased .
This is why you hear politicians today say that now is not the time to raise taxes and not the time to be closing the global market place .
Why would they say this now ?
Last year , we were in a stock market decline with shares falling some 40 % from the all time highs from the prior year .
I have compared this with the panic of 1907 . ( Click Here )
However , I must say that history is not prescriptive and what happened in the past does not necessarily repeat itself .
The times and conditions are different on a number of levels .
Nevertheless , if you must look at history as a guide , you need to know the truth .
In general if you bought stock at the highs in 1929 , you did not see your portfolio back to even for 25 years .
Some individual stocks took longer than that .
The speculation running rampant in the “ Roaring 20 ’s ” was probably more comparable to the run up in the market in the 1990 ’s than this past run .
The decline in the late 1920 ’s into the 1930 ’s was about 87 % .
An 87 % of a drop from the Oct 2007 highs would be about 1700 which would take us back to the 1980’s .
Last fall ’s decline took us back to numbers we had in late 2001 and early 2002 then they fell even farther before bottoming out in March 2009 .
Now , we have rebounded to near 10,000 .
So , we ’ve gone up and down and up and down again in the past 10 years , which is not comparable to the 1920 ’s , 30’s , 40 ’s and 50’s .
Anyway , with all that in mind , I offer you this .
It is an excerpt of a letter written by Earnest Elmo Caulkins to
the New York Times on this date in 1929 , the day after “ Black Tuesday . ”
Caulkins was a successful advertising executive who had a rather extraordinary life story .
( Click Here )
He was deaf but was an achiever who did not let his disability get in his way .
It ’s really remarkable when you consider that he did this in the late 19th and early 20th century when it was particularly difficult for deaf individuals living in a hearing world .
He began by saying “ I have a feeling that fewer persons are affected by the stock market drop than one would infer from the figures , just as fewer persons were affected by the previous rises . ”
That can be said today but not entirely .
Today , millions of Americans have pension plans and 401K plans that are affected .
For instance , I have a 401 K but its decline does not affect my standard of living today .
He goes on to say that one day , the men on the market decide his AT&T stock is worth $ 310 and a few weeks later $ 232 .
He bought the stock at $ 98 , so he is disappointed but he does n’t consider it a loss .
First off , he points out that its still more than twice as much as what he paid for it .
So , to suggest that lumping he and other together and say that millions have been “ lost ” is a false implication .
Compared to the previous day its a loss but compared to a few weeks before , he ’s even and compared to prior to that , its a gain .
I think what he is pointing to is the only difference is time .
Millions of shares were NOT traded and for those who did not trade , what was a great position of happiness and wealth in September was being characterized as a position of gloom and despair in late October .
He went on to review his portfolio and said that his previous high profits were on paper and his recent losses were on paper and reasoned that the two cancel each other out .
He concluded with a story of a farmer who told his friend that Mr. Stebbins offered him $ 200 for his horse .
The friend replied , “ But Stebbins ai n’t got $ 200 . ”
The farmer answered , “ yes , but ai n’t it a good offer ? ”
Much of what Caulkins says here is true today .
The Dow at the end of Jan 1980 was at 874.40 .
Oct 28 , 2008 it closed at over 9,000 .
Yet , in October 2007 , the Dow hit 14,000 .
When I worked at Merrill Lynch , my office mate , Martin Feinberg , used to say “ Stocks go up and stocks go down . ”
They do .
The question here is time .
We like it when stocks go up quickly but then get upset when they fall quickly , as if one is normal and the other is a crisis when , in fact , both signal volatility .
I have always reasoned that it is not wise to “ play the market . ”
Over the past 30 years , people have entered the stock market like they are going into Churchill Downs to bet on the ponies .
Men like Caulkins entered as investors .
I guess what I am saying is that it ’s silly for people to claim this is 1929 all over again .
I took a look at 1907 but I never suggested that this was 1907 all over again .
That was then .
This is now .
The future has yet to be written .
It is often said that it ’s not whether we face adversity but how we react to adversity that counts .
I ’ve read a quote from Vince Lombardi( inspirational quotes ) ( origin probably elsewhere ) that said “ the greatest accomplishment is not in never failing , but rising again after you fail . ”
The past is the past and its how we conduct our future , whether it be governmental policy or personal actions , that really counts .
With global intervention , coordination and new policies , this may be the beginning of a turnaround and , then again , it may be the beginning of a long fall .
Who knows for certain ?
But , I do know that nothing lasts forever either way .
If you believe that the sun rises every day and will again on this nation , this economy and the global economy , then invest in the future .
If you do not , then stay out of the market .
In my view , its as simple as that .
Mr Caulkins overcame his disability and had great confidence in the future .
You need to ask yourself if you have the same ideals .
Weather Bottom Line : I made a mistake yesterday .
I thought that Halloween was on Friday .
It ’s on Saturday .
I never know what day it is .
I took a quick looksee at the models and I ’ve got a bit of a dillema .
See , the GFS numerically claims that rain begins lightly on Friday morning then more in earnest by late Friday and then carries it through Sunday for a total of about 1.33 ″ .
Yet , when you look at it graphically , it advertises all of the rain is out of here by Saturday afternoon .
Now , the NAM is a bit more consistent as the numbers reveal .77 ″ from Friday evening through midday on Saturday and the graphic presentation shows the same thing .
Either way , neither model is bullish on the big rain event that loomed in yesterday ’s numbers and some folks on TV decided to take as Gospel .
It was never really forecast but , the area was reasonably close to keep an eye out for that possibility .
Now the HPC rain forecast has come in line with what my contention was several days ago , which was that the convergence zone is really in the lower Mississippi Valley and I had reasoned that would be the area of big storms and that it might tend to cut off the moisture our way .
Well , now the 3 - day total QPF from the HPC indicates over 4.5 ″ inches of rain in that convergence region and just about an inch around here .
All of that seems reasonable .
So , my bottom line is that it will be cool for the trick or treaters but probably dry .
Look for rain activity from say noon on Friday to noon on Saturday .
Unseen Academicals is formed from three interlinked plot strands .
The first strand follows the development of the rules and customs of football from the chanting of the fans to the invention of the ball itself .
The second strand follows the story of Mr Nutt , the enigmatic hero of the novel , who turns out to be an orc , a race of violent but misunderstood semi-mythological creatures .
Nutt turns out to be , not only a natural football trainer , but also a natural leader of men .
The third strand follows the internal political wranglings of the Unseen University as the wizards venture out of their ivory towers to compete ( without magic ) in the football match .
The match itself forms the climax of the story , bringing the various strands together .
Whilst reading Unseen Academicals I could n’t help thinking about ( and you ’ll have to bear with me on this ) the American TV series The Wire .
It ’s initially tempting to compare Pratchett ’s world building with Tolkien , but , in fact , his focus on different institutions in each book and his satirical approach to modernisation is closer to the depiction ( and fictional construction ) of Baltimore in the television series .
As in The Wire , the social and cultural innovation and change in Unseen Academicals is written from the perspectives of both the street criminals forced to accept organisation and of the political and intellectual leaders of the city , precipitating the innovation but also affected by it .
Pratchett uses football as a metaphor for social cohesion , demonstrated when Mr Nutt , the orc , takes to the pitch in the climax and is ( sort of ) accepted by the population of Ankh - Morpork .
Where Pratchett differs from the hardboiled writers of The Wire is with his pure , cheerful optimism .
While he deals with his subject matter cynically ( characters such as Vetinari are the very definition of morally ambiguous ) he always allows the innovations to succeed in the end .
This is a very British approach to the subject .
In all his Ankh - Morpork books , Pratchett celebrates the eccentric inventor .
Characters such as Willaim de Worde , Moist von Lipwig , and now Mr Nutt , are all outsiders who are ridiculed and challenged , the equivalent of the British myth of the amateur in the shed building the future .
Indeed , Pratchett himself can be added to this list – pictured as he often is , writing in his office facing an unlikely bank of computer monitors and surrounded by the memorabilia of Discworld .

This is truly amazing footage from a camera mounted on the Discovery Shuttle 's rocket booster .
Watch in real - time as the shuttle launches , seperates and then we fall back down to earth with the rocket booster ; landing in the ocean .
Amazingly , the whole journey is over in about 5 minutes .
So I 'm looking for suggestions for television , films , books etc that have the same breath and depth that The Greatest Show On Television , Ever ( TM ) had .
Also any music in the same vein that was used in the series would be good .
An obvious place to start is one of the several novels written by the show 's main writers ... but I 'm wondering what else might be out there that I might miss otherwise .
The Wire 's finished ( wipes tear ) ... what do I watch / read / listen to , now ?
While joking around on his radio show Wednesday , Fox News personality Glenn Beck addressed the idea that he and Sarah Palin should run for president together in 2012 .
Beck apparently likes the idea of a Beck - Palin ticket , but a Palin - Beck ticket ?
Not so much .
“ I was just thinking , what , I ’m going to take a back seat to a chick ? ”
Beck quipped , to laughter from the studio .
“ Go shoot a bear , make some stew , I ’m hungry in here . ”

In an interview with Newsmax last week , Palin “ would n’t rule out ” running with the controversial talk show host in 2012 .
“ So while she ’s considering it … I just want her to know , I ’m ruling it out .
A Palin-Beck ticket , I ’m absolutely ruling it out , ” Beck said .
“ I ’m just saying , Beck - Palin , I ’ll consider .
But Palin - Beck — can you imagine what an administration with the two of us would be like ?
She ’d be yapping or something , I ’d say , ‘ I ’m sorry , why am I hearing your voice ?
I ’m not in the kitchen . ’
I mean , you ’d have to live up to the evil conservative stereotypes , you ’d have no choice but to do so . ”
“ A woman ’s appropriate place on a presidential ticket , according to Beck , is in the number two spot , ” writes Alex Seitz - Wald at ThinkProgress .
“ Otherwise , she should just ‘ yap ’ away in a kitchen somewhere .
Apparently , being a vice presidential running mate behind a woman is a serious challenge to Beck ’s manhood . ”
“ Palin has a hair - trigger reaction to sexist slights … so I would predict a wingnut feud , ” writes Azaria Jagger at Gawker .
“ But in this case , Lady Alaska ’s martyr complex is going to conflict with her effusive love of right - wing media .
Also ,
Beck ’s producers will likely pressure him to make nice .
She ’s way too valuable to them . ”
But , hey , it ’s all a joke , right ?
“ Yeah , Glenn , it ’s a ‘ joke . ’
We get it , ” writes bluegal at the Crooks and Liars blog .
“ We get that you ’re a former shock jock , that you do n’t actually believe a single word you say , and that you will say anything for money .
We get that the vice - presidency is even further out of your league than it is for Palin , and that ’s saying a lot .

“ We also get that you ’re an infantile jerk . ”
The following audio was broadcast on The Glenn Beck Program , November 25 , 2009 , and uploaded to the Web by ThinkProgress .
" Things are undoubtedly better security - wise , " he says .
" People can finally come out and enjoy themselves in the evening .
The main problem , for us , is that there is not much money around to stage productions that we can be proud of . "
The world ’s first universal programmable quantum computer has been put through its paces .
But the test program revealed significant hurdles that must be overcome before the device is ready for real work .
Earlier in the year , a team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , Colorado , built a quantum computer capable of processing two quantum bits , or qubits .
Qubits store more information than the simple “ on ” or “ off ” bits of conventional computing , which means that a quantum computer outperform conventional computers in tasks such as cryptanalysis .
As in a classical computer , a series of logic gates processes the information – although here the gates are quantum logic , or qubit , gates .
“ For example , a simple single - qubit gate would change a ‘ one ’ to a ‘ zero ’ and vice versa , ” says David Hanneke , a member of the team .
But unlike the physical logic gates of a classical computer , the quantum logic gates used in the team ’s device are each encoded into a laser pulse .
Logic trick
The experimental device uses beryllium ions to store qubits in the way they spin while the laser - pulse quantum gates perform simple logic operations on the qubits .
The trick to making a quantum logic gate is in designing a series of laser pulses that manipulate the beryllium ions in a way that processes information .
Another laser then reads off the results of the calculations .

“ Once we had demonstrated we could successfully combine lots of components in this way , we ask : what can you do with that ? ” says Hanneke .
They found their answer in quantum computational theory .
“ One of the more interesting results to come out of the early years of quantum information was that you can do any quantum operation on any number of qubits using only single and two - qubit logic gates , ” says Hanneke .
Although one and two - qubit gates have already been built and used to perform specific algorithms , no one had yet built a device capable of all possible quantum routines .
Until now .
Infinite possibilities
At the heart of the device is a gold - patterned aluminium wafer containing a tiny electromagnetic trap some 200 micrometres across , into which the team placed four ions – two of magnesium and two of beryllium .
The magnesium ions act as “ refrigerants ” , removing unwanted vibrations from the ion chain and so keeping the device stable .
There are an infinite number of possible two - qubit operations , so the team chose a random selection of 160 to demonstrate the universality of the processor .
Each operation involves hitting the two qubits with 31 distinct quantum gates encoded into the laser pulses .
The majority were single - qubit gates , and so the pulse needed to interact with just one ion , but a small number were two - qubit gates requiring the pulse to “ talk ” to both ions .
By controlling the voltage on the gold electrodes surrounding the trap , the team can uncouple the ions when single - qubit gates are needed and couple them again for two - qubit operations .
Not perfect
The team ran each of the 160 programs 900 times .
By comparing the results with theoretical predictions , they were able to show that the processor had worked as planned .
But it did so with an accuracy of only 79 per cent , says Hanekke .
“ Each gate is more than 90 per cent accurate , but when you stack them together the total figure falls to 79 per cent or so for a given operation , ” he says .
That ’s because each of the laser pulses that act as the gates varies slightly in intensity .
“ They ’re not ‘ square ’ pulses [ that switch on and off cleanly ] – they fluctuate , ” he says .
And the beam has to be split , reflected and manipulated in various ways beforehand , which also introduces errors .
Such errors would drown the results of any more extensive computations .
The fidelity needs to increase to around 99.99 per cent before it could be a useful component of a quantum computer .
That could be done by improving the stability of the laser and reducing the errors from optical hardware , says the team .
If those levels of accuracy can be reached , the new chip could form an integral part of a useful quantum processor .
“ If you have a simple and repetitive task you might have a dedicated region [ of the processor ] to do that , ” he says .
“ But you need regions that can do all kinds of stuff – this is just such a device . ”

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama said Sunday time was running out for diplomacy to resolve a crisis over Iran ’s nuclear program , but Russian President Dmitry Medvedev offered softer criticism of Tehran .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The United States had been willing to give Iran time to decide whether to accept a U.N. - brokered deal meant to allay suspicions it is after atomic bombs but which has drawn Iranian objections , a U.S. diplomat said a week ago .
Sunday Obama , speaking after talks with Medvedev on the sidelines of an Asia - Pacific meeting in Singapore , suggested patience was running low .
“ Unfortunately , so far at least , Iran appears to have been unable to say yes to what everyone acknowledges is a creative and constructive approach , ” Obama said while seated next to Medvedev .
“ We are running out of time with respect to that approach . ”
Repeating previous Russian language , Medvedev said “ other means ” could be used if discussions did not yield results , but did not specify what they might be .
“ Thanks to joint efforts the process of ( the Iran talks ) has not stopped but we are not completely happy about its pace .
If something does not work there are other means to move the process further , ” he said .
“ Our aim is clear -- a transparent nuclear program rather than a program which causes others ’ concern . ”
In talks with six powers in Geneva on October 1 , Iran had agreed in principle to send the bulk of its low - enriched uranium to Russia and France for further processing and conversion into fuel plates for the Tehran reactor , Western officials said .
The plan for Iran to part with stocks of potential nuclear explosive material in exchange for fuel to keep a nuclear medicine facility running has subsequently stumbled on Iranian calls for amendments and more talks , which Washington has rejected .
Iran ’s pledges in Geneva won itself a reprieve from sanctions targeting its oil sector but Western powers stressed they would not wait indefinitely for Tehran to follow through .
Russian officials such as foreign minister Sergey Lavrov have said Washington was trying to push Moscow into a position of publicly threatening imposition of sanctions soon if Iran did not play ball .
Iran says it is enriching uranium only for power plant fuel , not for nuclear warheads .
But its history of nuclear secrecy and continued restrictions on U.N. inspections have raised Western suspicions Iran is latently pursuing nuclear weapons capability .

Anyone who rejects the two - state solution , wo n’t bring a one - state solution .
They will instead bring one war , not one state .
A bloody war with no end .
— Israeli President Shimon Peres , 7 November 2009 .
One of the most commonly voiced objections to a one - state solution for Palestine / Israel stems from the accurate observation that the vast majority of Israeli Jews reject it , and fear being “ swamped ” by a Palestinian majority .
Across the political spectrum , Israeli Jews insist on maintaining a separate Jewish - majority state .
But with the total collapse of the Obama Administration ’s peace efforts , and relentless Israeli colonization of the occupied West Bank , the reality is dawning rapidly that the two - state solution is no more than a slogan that has no chance of being implemented or altering the reality of a de facto binational state in Palestine / Israel .
This places an obligation on all who care about the future of Palestine / Israel to seriously consider the democratic alternatives .
I have long argued that the systems in post - apartheid South Africa ( a unitary democratic state ) , and Northern Ireland ( consociational democracy ) — offer hopeful , real - life models .
But does solid Israeli Jewish opposition to a one - state solution mean that a peaceful one - state outcome is so unlikely that Palestinians should not pursue it , and should instead focus only on “ pragmatic ” solutions that would be less fiercely resisted by Israeli Jews ?
The experience in South Africa suggests otherwise .
In 1994 , white - minority rule — apartheid — came to a peaceful , negotiated end , and was replaced ( after a transitional period of power - sharing ) with a unitary democratic state with a one person , one vote system .
Before this happened , how likely did this outcome look ?
Was there any significant constituency of whites prepared to contemplate it , and what if the African National Congress ( ANC ) had only advanced political solutions that whites told pollsters they would accept ?
Until close to the end of apartheid , the vast majority of whites , including many of the system ’s liberal critics , completely rejected a one person , one vote system , predicting that any attempt to impose it would lead to a bloodbath .
As late as 1989 , F.W. de Klerk , South Africa ’s last apartheid president , described a one person , one vote system as the “ death knell ” for South Africa .
A 1988 study by political scientist Pierre Hugo documented the widespread fears among South African whites that a transition to majority rule would entail not only a loss of political power and socioeconomic status , but engendered “ physical dread ” and fear of “ violence , total collapse , expulsion and flight . ”
Successive surveys showed that four out of five whites thought that majority rule would threaten their “ physical safety . ”
Such fears were frequently heightened by common racist tropes of inherently savage and violent Africans , but the departure of more than a million white colons from Algeria and the airlifting of 300,000 whites from Angola during decolonization set terrifying precedents ( “ Towards darkness and death : racial demonology in South Africa , ” The Journal of Modern African Studies , 26 ( 4 ) , 1988 ) .
Throughout the 1980s , polls showed that even as whites increasingly understood that apartheid could not last , only a small minority ever supported majority rule and a one person , one vote system .
In a March 1986 survey , for example , 47 percent of whites said they would favor some form of “ mixed - race ” government , but 83 percent said they would opt for continued white domination of the government if they had the choice ( Peter Goodspeed , “ Afrikaners cling to their all - white dream , ” The Toronto Star , 5 October 1986 ) .
A 1990 nationwide survey of Afrikaner whites ( native speakers of Afrikaans , as opposed to English , and who traditionally formed the backbone of the apartheid state ) , found just 2.2 percent were willing to accept a “ universal franchise with majority rule ” ( Kate Manzo and Pat McGowan , “ Afrikaner fears and the politics of despair : Understanding change in South Africa , ” International Studies Quarterly , 36 , 1992 ) .
Perhaps an enlightened white elite was able to lead the white masses to higher ground ?
This was not the case either .
A 1988 academic survey of more than 400 white politicians , business and media leaders , top civil servants , academics and clergy found that just 4.8 percent were prepared to accept a unitary state with a universal voting franchise and two - thirds considered such an outcome “ unacceptable . ”
According to Manzo and McGowan , white elites reflected the sentiments and biases of the rest of the society and overwhelmingly considered whites inherently more civilized and culturally superior to black Africans .
Just more than half of prominent whites were prepared to accept “ a federal state in which power is shared between white and non-white groups and areas so that no one group dominates . ”
During the 1980s , the white electorate in South Africa moved to the right , as Israel ’s Jewish electorate is doing today .
Support seeped from the National Party , which had established formal apartheid in 1948 , to the even more extreme Conservative Party .
Yet , “ on the issue of majority rule , ” Hugo observed , “ supporters of the National Party and the Conservative Party , as well as most white voters to the ‘ left ’ of these organizations , ha[d ] little quarrel with each other . ”
The vast majority of whites , wracked with existential fears , were simply unable to contemplate relinquishing effective control , or at least a veto , over political decision - making in South Africa .
Yet , the African National Congress insisted firmly on a one person , one vote system with no white veto .
As the township protests and strikes and international pressure mounted , The Economist observed in an extensive 1986 survey of South Africa published on 1 February of that year , that many “ enlightened ” whites “ still fondly argue that a dramatic improvement in the quality of black life may take the revolutionary sting out of the black townships — and persuade ‘ responsible ’ blacks , led by the emergent black middle class , to accept some power - sharing formula . ”
Schemes to stabilize the apartheid system abounded , and bear a strong resemblance to the current Israeli government ’s vision of “ economic peace ” in which a collaborationist Palestinian Authority leadership would manage a still - subjugated Palestinian population anesthetized by consumer goods and shopping malls .
Because of the staunch opposition of whites to a unitary democratic state , the ANC heard no shortage of advice from western liberals that it should seek a “ realistic ” political accommodation with the apartheid regime , and that no amount of pressure could force whites to succumb to the ANC ’s political demands .
The ANC was warned that insistence on majority rule would force Afrikaners into the “ laager ” — they would retreat into a militarized garrison state and siege economy , preferring death before surrender .
Even the late Helen Suzman , one of apartheid ’s fiercest liberal critics , predicted in 1987 , as quoted by Hugo , “ The Zimbabwe conflict took 15 years … and cost 20,000 lives and I can assure you that the South African transfer of power will take a good deal more than that , both in time and I am afraid lives . ”
But as The Economist observed , the view that whites would prefer “ collective suicide ” was something of a caricature .
The vast majority of Afrikaners were “ no longer bible - thumping boers . ”
They were “ part of a spoilt , affluent suburban society , whose economic pain threshold may prove to be rather low . ”
The Economist concluded that if whites would only come so far voluntarily , then it was perfectly reasonable for the anti-apartheid movement to bring them the rest of the way through “ coercion ” in the form of sanctions and other forms of pressure .
“ The quicker the white tribe submits , ” the magazine wrote , “ the better its chance of a bearable future in a black - ruled South Africa . ”
Ultimately , as we now know , the combination of internal resistance and international isolation did force whites to abandon political apartheid and accept majority rule .
However , it is important to note that the combined strength of the anti-apartheid movement never seriously threatened the physical integrity of the white regime .
Even after the massive township uprisings of 1985 - 86 , the South African regime was secure .
“ So far there is no real physical threat to white power , ” The Economist noted , “ so far there is little threat to white lives . …
The white state is mighty , and well - equipped .
It has the capacity to repress the township revolts far more bloodily .
The blacks have virtually no urban or rural guerrilla capacity , practically no guns , few safe havens within South Africa or without . ”
This balance never changed , and a similar equation could be written today about the relative power of a massively - armed — and much more ruthless — Israeli state , and lightly armed Palestinian resistance factions .
What did change for South Africa , and what all the weapons in the world were not able to prevent , was the complete loss of legitimacy of the apartheid regime and its practices .
Once this legitimacy was gone , whites lost the will to maintain a system that relied on repression and violence and rendered them international pariahs ; they negotiated a way out and lived to tell the tale .
It all happened much more quickly and with considerably less violence than even the most optimistic predictions of the time .
But this outcome could not have been predicted based on what whites said they were willing to accept , and it would not have occurred had the ANC been guided by opinion polls rather than the democratic principles of the Freedom Charter .
Zionism — as many Israelis openly worry — is suffering a similar , terminal loss of legitimacy as Israel is ever more isolated as a result of its actions .
Israel ’s self - image as a liberal “ Jewish and democratic state ” is proving impossible to maintain against the reality of a militarized , ultra-nationalist Jewish sectarian settler - colony that must carry out frequent and escalating massacres of “ enemy ” civilians ( Lebanon and Gaza 2006 , Gaza 2009 ) in a losing effort to check the resistance of the region ’s indigenous people .
Zionism cannot bomb , kidnap , assassinate , expel , demolish , settle and lie its way to legitimacy and acceptance .
Already difficult to disguise , the loss of legitimacy becomes impossible to conceal once Palestinians are a demographic majority ruled by a Jewish minority .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s demand that Palestinians recognize Israel ’s “ right to exist as a Jewish state ” is in effect an acknowledgement of failure : without Palestinian consent , something which is unlikely ever to be granted , the Zionist project of a Jewish ethnocracy in Palestine has grim long - term prospects .
Similarly , South African whites typically attempted to justify their opposition to democracy , not in terms of a desire to preserve their privilege and power , but using liberal arguments about protecting distinctive cultural differences .
Hendrik Verwoerd Jr. , the son of assassinated Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd , apartheid ’s founder , expressed the problem in these terms in 1986 , as reported by The Toronto Star , stating that , “ These two people , the Afrikaner and the black , are not capable of becoming one nation .
Our differences are unique , cultural and deep .
The only way a man can be happy , can live in peace , is really when he is among his own people , when he shares cultural values . ”
The younger Verwoerd was on the far - right of South African politics , leading a quixotic effort to carve out a whites - only homeland in the heart of South Africa .
But his reasoning sounds remarkably similar to liberal Zionist defenses of the “ two - state solution ” today .
The Economist clarified the use of such language at the time , stating that “ One of the weirder products of apartheid is the crippling of language in a maw of hypocrisy , euphemism and sociologese .
You talk about the Afrikaner ‘ right to self - determination ’ — meaning power over everybody else . ”
Zionism ’s claim for “ Jewish self - determination ” amidst an intermixed population , is in effect a demand to preserve and legitimize a status quo in which Israeli Jews exercise power in perpetuity .
But there ’s little reason to expect that Israeli Jews would abandon this quest voluntarily any more than South African whites did .
As in South Africa , coercion is necessary — and the growing boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) movement is one of the most powerful , nonviolent , legitimate and proven tools of coercion that Palestinians possess .
Israel ’s vulnerabilities may be different from those of apartheid South Africa , but Israel is not invulnerable to pressure .
Coercion is not enough , however ; as I have long argued , and sought to do , Palestinians must also put forward a positive vision .
Neither can Palestinians advocating a one - state solution simply disregard the views of Israeli Jews .
We must recognize that the opposition of Israeli Jews to any solution that threatens their power and privilege stems from at least two sources .
One is irrational , racist fears of black and brown hordes ( in this case , Arab Muslims ) stoked by decades of colonial , racist demonization .
The other source — certainly heightened by the former — are normal human concerns about personal and family dislocation , loss of socioeconomic status and community security : change is scary .
But change will come .
Without indulging Israeli racism or preserving undue privilege , the legitimate concerns of ordinary Israeli Jews can be addressed directly in any negotiated transition to ensure that the shift to democracy is orderly , and essential redistributive policies are carried out fairly .
Inevitably , decolonization will cause some pain as Israeli Jews lose power and privilege , but there are few reasons to believe it cannot be a well - managed process , or that the vast majority of Israeli Jews , like white South Africans , would not be prepared to make the adjustment for the sake of a normality and legitimacy they cannot have any other way .
This is where the wealth of research and real - life experience about the successes , failures , difficulties and opportunities of managing such transitions at the level of national and local politics , neighborhoods , schools and universities , workplaces , state institutions and policing , emerging from South Africa and Northern Ireland , will be of enormous value .
Every situation has unique features , and although there are patterns in history , it never repeats itself exactly .
But what we can conclude from studying the pasts and presents of others is that Palestinians and Israelis are no less capable of writing themselves a post - colonial future that gives everyone a chance at a life worth living in a single , democratic state .

A source inside lawyers Davenport Lyons and their partner DigiProtect has leaked sensitive documents detailing how the companies generated profit from porn .
They show how the pair extracted money from alleged file - sharers , how the revenue was split and how individuals were ranked to decide who to chase and who to leave alone .
In 2007 , UK lawyers Davenport Lyons ( DL ) got into the lucrative business of threatening to sue file - sharers .
Their clients used anti-piracy tracking companies to harvest the IP addresses of many thousands of users allegedly sharing video games .
This information was used to get court orders which forced ISPs to hand over their details .
DL then wrote to the individuals demanding several hundred pounds to make the threat of a lawsuit disappear .
Some paid up , but many did not , and the only cases DL took to court were against those who did n’t defend themselves .
Generating revenue from porn proves controversial
Then the law firm overplayed its hand and got into bed with DigiProtect , the German piracy exploitation outfit with a catalog of hardcore porn titles to its name .
The rights were signed over to the company by the copyright holders so that DigiProtect could use them to generate revenue – lots and lots of revenue .
After mountains of bad publicity , DL withdrew from this business model .
In May this year , the exact same scheme reappeared with UK lawyers ACS : Law .
TorrentFreak asked company owner Andrew Crossley about the connections between ACS and DL – his reply : “ NONE ” .
However , it was crystal clear that there were many links , not least that staff from DL were now working at ACS : Law directly on these cases – known cyber - squatter Terence Tsang as one example .
We ’ve known all along that if those threatened put up a spirited defense and refused to be cowed they were never taken to court , but we had no proof as to the mechanism employed .
Then , out of nowhere , months ago someone from inside either Davenport Lyons or DigiProtect leaked lots of sensitive documents to German news outlet Gulli .
Having remained secret until now , the documents made very interesting reading and along with a helping hand from TorrentFreak and armed with the leaked personal details and email addresses of some of the letter recipients , Firebird77 at Gulli was able to confirm the authenticity of the documents .
Document 1 – Ranking alleged infringers in order to decide who to pursue
The first document reveals how the targets are ranked based on an estimation of how likely it is that they will pay up .
Each alleged infringer has their details filled in on a form ( download here from WikiLeaks ) .
The document shows that despite the claims that an IP address alone is irrefutable evidence of an infringement and will lead to being taken to court , the reality is rather different .
Letter recipients are given a ranking based on many parameters .
Does the law firm want to continue to pursue the person ?
What are the chances of success ?
A zero would mean “ no action ” up to ten which would mean the respondent is ripe for maximum pressure .
One letter recipient hired Michael Coyle at Lawdit Solicitors to defend him and this earned him a “ three ” .
One part of the form is entitled “ Circumstances ” and this is a very surprising section indeed .
Despite the “ fact ” that the law firms supposedly already have solid evidence of infringement that they say will lead to court action if recipients do n’t comply , the section seems to show that they make their decisions on who to pursue based on the recipients ’ personal circumstances .
One circumstance is labeled “ impecuniosity ” , i.e the letter recipient is flat broke .
Another is whether the recipient is on state benefits – this is expected to be proven by way of copies of benefit books and / or letters .
TorrentFreak has evidence that one gentleman was asked to prove that he was indeed disabled in order to make the claims go away .
Other circumstances include whether the recipient is a pensioner , a student or a child .
One other circumstance is an eyebrow - raising “ out of jurisdiction ” ( no rightful claim could be made the against the recipient ) along with whether or not the individual was aware of that fact .
The form also lists possible defenses that recipients rely on , including the breach of their wireless router , a virus infected PC , not being at home when the infringement occurred , no knowledge of infringement or the possibility that someone else in the location carried out the infringement .
Document 2 – Letter from lawyer Dr Kornmeier from Kornmeier & Partner to Brian Miller at Davenport Lyons
The 14 page document ( download from WikiLeaks ) details the agreement DigiProtect enters into with rights holders in order to exploit their copyrights for profit .
Included is a section which confirms that the original rights holders sign over the rights to DigiProtect so that they are legally allowed to make the works ( hardcore porn movies ) publicly available on P2P networks such as BitTorrent .
Dr Kornmeier asks : “ Does this constitute any problem under UK law ? ”
According to page 2 of the letter , when the recipient of these letters pay up , the spoils are divided up as follows – 51 % to DigiProtect , 37.5 % to Davenport Lyons and 11 % to DigiRights Solutions .
The remaining pages detail the exact business arrangement along with a list of the hundreds of porn movies covered by the agreement .
TorrentFreak discussed the documents with staff at the excellent BeingThreatened.com , a site set up to support and inform those targeted by Davenport Lyons and ACS : Law in the UK .
“ These documents confirm what we have long suspected , ” they told us .
“ This scheme is not about getting justice for the rightsholders at all ; it is there to fill the pockets of companies like DigiProtect by exploiting many innocent people .
Everyone with an IP address has reason to be worried about becoming a victim of these exploitative practices , whether they use P2P networks or not . ”
Indeed , John Stagliano , boss of porn company Evil Angel which also worked with DigiProtect , admitted to earning less than £ 50 from each infringement and told the BBC the scheme “ … was completely misrepresented ” to him .
Uk consumer magazine Which ?
earlier reported Davenport Lyons to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority for alleged “ bullying ” .
It will be interesting to see how these documents develop that case .
Thus far just two documents have been made public .
Stay tuned for further updates .
Mount­ Everest is the h­ighest point on planet Earth .
Because of this unique distinction , humans have been climbing it since Sir Edmund Hillary 's first successful ascent in 1953 .
The peak of Everest is located in Nepal and stands tall at 29,035 feet ( 8,850 meters ) above sea level [ source : mnteverest.net ] .
The mountain itself shares a border with both Nepal and Tibet .
Because of the severe weather at the summit , climbers rarely attempt to complete the trek outside of the May to June window , when the jet stream is pushed north .
Even then , the weather is pretty inhospitable .
An average day in May 2008 saw a high temperature of minus 17 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 27 degrees Celsius ) and winds of 51 miles ( 81 km ) per hour [ source : USA Today ] .
­ At other times during the year , the jet stream passes directly by the summit and winds can blow at hurricane strength -- 118 miles ( 189 km ) per ho­ur -- and temperatures can dive as low as minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 73 Celsius ) [ source : teameverest03.org ] .
Add to this the fact that there 's less than one - third the amount of oxygen in the air compared to sea level , and you can see why Everest adventurers have their work cut out for them .

Still , this does n't stop the adventurous spirit .
The downside to having that spirit is that it could lead to your death .
Everest News estimates that , as of 2004 , more than 2,000 people had successfully reached the summit , while 189 died trying .
If you 're one of the roughly 150 people to attempt to scale Mount Everest in this year , there 's something you 'll be sure to see along the way -- dead bodies .

Nearly 80 % of girls say that having the HPV vaccine makes them think twice about the risks of having sex , according to a University of Manchester study published in the British Journal of Cancer .
The survey - the first to focus on girls ’ views of the vaccine rather than their parents ’ - showed that , despite speculation that the vaccine could make girls more likely to start having sex younger , it highlighted the risks of sex for the overwhelming majority .
The study also revealed that the support of parents is crucial to the success of the vaccination programme - of the girls whose parents refused the vaccine , 42 per cent actually wanted it .
And 10 per cent of those who were vaccinated did n’t want it .
Dr Loretta Brabin , study author based at the University ’s School of Cancer and Imaging Sciences , said : “ This is the first insight into how a girl decides whether the vaccine is important to her and who influences her decision .
“ Talking to their parents was massively influential on the girls , and mums and dads will play an important role in maintaining the success of the programme so far .
“ The thing that put girls off the most was fear of needles and how much it would hurt .
“ Some girls had also heard rumours about side - effects , which had filtered down from the media and their parents and had been exaggerated along the way .
“ Interestingly , media suggestions that the vaccine could make girls more likely to start having sex at a younger age had n’t affected them .
In fact , the vaccine actually made them more aware of the risks of sex . ”
The researchers questioned over 500 twelve and thirteen year olds who had been offered the vaccine in a study in Manchester before the vaccine was available nationally .
Although 79 per cent of girls said the vaccine reminded them of the risks of sex , 14 per cent said they might take more sexual risks because of it .
Nearly four in five girls said they discussed the decision to have the vaccine with their parents .
Ninety - three per cent of girls said having the vaccine shows that you are serious about your health and 54 per cent felt the jab was very important to them .
In the UK , girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the HPV vaccine as a part of the government ’s vaccination programme that started last year .
The vaccine has the potential to prevent at least 7 out of 10 cervical cancers .
Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , said : “ Despite the scare - stories , this research suggests that the HPV vaccine could make the majority of girls more cautious about sex .
“ The HPV vaccine is an important step towards preventing cervical cancer in the UK but it will only be truly successful if uptake is high .
“ It ’s important that girls also get appropriate sex education so that they ’re all aware of the risks .
“ This research gives us important insights into how we can help to maximise the uptake of the vaccine and allay any fears girls and parents may have . ”

Police arrested a 61 - year - old man on Tuesday for obstruction of duty after he allegedly called the 110 emergency number over 12,000 times .
Hisao Sumitani , a resident of Otsu , has admitted to the charge but was quoted by police as saying " the whole case is ridiculous . "
According to police , Sumitani called the Shiga Prefecture emergency number 12,300 times between December 2006 and Sept 30 of this year .
Sumitani would shout into the phone at operators , and is accused of disrupting their duty .
He also reportedly dialed the Otsu fire department 1,390 times on the 119 number .
Authorities visited Sumitani's home four times requesting him to stop , but he refused to comply .

Werner Heubeck , who has died aged 85 , served in Hitler 's Africa Korps during the second world war , but made his real mark in quite a different arena of conflict – by keeping the buses running in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles .
Shortly after Heubeck moved to Belfast in 1965 to work as managing director of the publicly owned bus company , his vehicles became a prime target for rioters and terrorists .
They were hijacked and burned on the streets , or badly damaged along with their depots .
A distinctive figure in his customary trilby hat and raincoat , Heubeck believed in leading transport staff from the frontline and , at times of crisis , he took to the wheels of vehicles on some of the most volatile routes to reassure staff .
After the Belfast vehicle - free security segment was created in 1970 , buses were still allowed to traverse the area after being searched , so it was inevitable that the facility would be exploited by terrorists trying to smuggle bombs into the area .
However , army bomb disposal teams on their way to " ventilate " his vehicles , as they put it , began to find themselves beaten to the scene by Heubeck , who had frequently removed the devices by the time they got there .
On one occasion , I watched as he pushed against the throng of people fleeing from yet another scare , boarded the bus and emerged a few moments later with the suspect device , declaring it to be safe .
This time it was a bag left behind by a forgetful passenger .
One morning in Londonderry , he removed a beer keg from each of three buses abandoned outside the local police headquarters .
On another occasion , an army bomb disposal team got a shock when , lining up their Wheelbarrow robot to fire a pressurised water disrupter , Heubeck came into sight on their viewfinder , walking along inside the target bus .
As they watched in astonishment , he calmly moved the device to the street and asked the army to neutralise it there .
Disposal teams came to regard him with a mixture of annoyance and reluctant admiration .
The vast majority of the terrorist devices he moved were indeed hoaxes , but he was not to know that at the time .
He must have been well aware of the risks , for there were many tragic cases of people dying while trying to remove bombs planted on their premises .
It is astonishing that Heubeck survived unscathed .
He would never talk about his derring - do .
" My job is just to run the buses , " he would say modestly .
By the time he retired in 1988 it was calculated that despite the loss of 1,100 buses and the deaths of 11 transport staff , Heubeck had personally cleared close to 100 incidents .
He was widely seen as a hero by the public .
His work was twice recognised by the Queen , with an OBE in 1977 and a CBE 11 years later .
Heubeck was born in Nuremberg , the son of a municipal gasworks engineer , and was conscripted into the German armed forces in 1942 , serving first with the Luftwaffe , then as a soldier in France and Italy before joining the Africa Korps .
He survived an air attack on his transport ship off the African coast and , with some 60 other survivors , managed to swim four miles to shore .
He was captured by Allied forces and shipped to a prisoner - of - war camp in Louisiana , where he spent the rest of the war .
After he was repatriated to Germany in 1946 , he helped to rebuild the family home in Nuremberg before landing a job with the US army .
He later became a translator and proofreader at the war crimes trials which were taking place in his native city .
His future wife , Monica , a fluent German speaker , was also attached to the war crimes tribunal after serving at the Bletchley Park code - breaking station during the war years .
In 1949 , despite the bureaucratic difficulties facing a German citizen entering Britain , they married and settled , first in her native south Wales and then in Aberdeen , where he managed a paper mill .
He became a British subject in 1954 .
His next move was to Belfast to run the bus company where , despite the travails of the Troubles , he introduced driver - only buses and renewed the ageing fleet .
By Northern Ireland 's conservative standards , he was seen as quite eccentric .
He had an enthusiasm for physical fitness long before it became fashionable and practised many forms of exercise , encouraging his senior colleagues to join him for rigorous swimming sessions .
Upon his retirement , the parting gift he requested was a large quantity of wood .
During the years after he settled in Co Antrim , he hand - carved numerous artefacts and furnishings , many of them commissions for more than 40 churches across Ireland .
Later he moved to Shetland , where one of his three sons is a professional ornithologist , and became well known in the community there for the supply of more than 100 handmade cushions to charity shops and the distribution of his fruit cakes at Christmas .
He is survived by his three sons .
Monica predeceased him in September .

Professor David Nutt , the Government 's chief drug adviser , was sacked today after claiming ecstasy and LSD were less dangerous than alcohol , Home Office sources said
Prof . Nutt , chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , attacked the decision to make cannabis a class B drug .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is understood Home Secretary Alan Johnson asked him to consider his position in the wake of the comments , saying he had " no confidence " in him .
In a lecture and briefing paper for the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King 's College , London , Prof Nutt attacked what he called the " artificial " separation of alcohol and tobacco from other , illegal , drugs .
He accused former home secretary Jacqui Smith , who reclassified cannabis , of " distorting and devaluing " scientific research .
Prof Nutt said smoking cannabis created only a " relatively small risk " of psychotic illness .
And he claimed advocates of moving ecstasy into class B from class A had " won the intellectual argument " .
All drugs , including alcohol and tobacco , should be ranked by a " harm " index , he said , with alcohol coming fifth behind cocaine , heroin , barbiturates , and methadone .
Tobacco should rank ninth , ahead of cannabis , LSD and ecstasy , he said .
He also repeated his claim that the risks of taking ecstasy are no worse than riding a horse .
Ms Smith 's decision to reclassify cannabis as a " precautionary step " sent mixed messages and undermined public faith in Government science , he said .
He added : " I think we have to accept young people like to experiment - with drugs and other potentially harmful activities - and what we should be doing in all of this is to protect them from harm at this stage of their lives .
" We therefore have to provide more accurate and credible information .

" If you think that scaring kids will stop them using , you are probably wrong . "
Richard Garside , director of the centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King 's College London , which published the article , accused Mr Johnson of undermining scientific research .
He said : " I 'm shocked and dismayed that the home secretary appears to believe that political calculation trumps honest and informed scientific opinion .
" The message is that when it comes to the Home Office 's relationship with the research community honest researchers should be seen but not heard .
" The Centre for Crime and Justice Studies published David Nutt 's analysis because we believed it to be in the public interest that high quality scientific research should inform public policy in relation to drugs .
" The home secretary 's action is a bad day for science and a bad day for the cause of evidence - informed policy making . "
Speaking to Sky News , Prof Nutt said he was disappointed by the decision but linked it to " political " considerations .
He said : " It 's unusual political times , I suppose , elections and all that .
It 's disappointing .
" But politics is politics and science is science and there 's a bit of a tension between them sometimes . "
Prof Nutt attacked politicians for " misleading " the public .
He said : " My view is policy should be based on evidence and I would have thought most politicians , when they have a chance to make policy based on evidence , that would actually be something they would enjoy doing .
" It 's a bit odd to make policy that goes in the face of evidence . "
" The danger is they are misleading us .
The scientific evidence is there , it 's in all the reports we published .
" Our judgments about the classification of drugs like cannabis and ecstasy have been based on a great deal of very detailed scientific appraisal .
" To say that there should be different classifications to send messages - I find this very confusing . "
He said cannabis was " not that harmful " a drug and repeated his warning to parents about the impact of alcohol on their children .
" My children are much more likely to die or be seriously injured from alcohol than any of those other drugs .
" The greatest concern to parents should be that their children do not get completely off their heads with alcohol because it can kill them ... and it leads them to do things which are very dangerous like kill themselves or others in cars , get into fights ... get raped , engage in other activities which they regret subsequently .
" My view is that if you want to reduce the harm to society from drugs , alcohol is the drug to target at present and all parents should be very aware of that . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " This was an inevitable decision after his latest ill - judged contribution to the debate but it is a sign of lack of focus at the Home Office that it did n't act sooner given that he has done this before . "
A spokesman for the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) said : " We can confirm that Prof Nutt has resigned as chair of the ACMD .
" It will be announced in due course who will deputise until a new chair is appointed . "
Speaking later on BBC Radio 4's PM programme , Prof Nutt strongly criticised the Government 's attitude to scientific evidence .
" Gordon Brown makes completely irrational statements about cannabis being ' lethal ' , which it is not , " he said , adding that there was no reason why policy should not be " evidence based " .
Prof Nutt said he was " disappointed " by Mr Johnson 's move because he had a " much better " relationship with him than with Jacqui Smith , his predecessor at the Home Office .
But he went on : " I 'm not prepared to mislead the public about the harmfulness of drugs like cannabis and ecstacy .
" I think most scientists will see this as a further example of the Luddite attitude of this government , and possible future governments , towards science . "
The Home Office said Mr Johnson had expressed " surprise and disappointment " over what Prof Nutt said earlier this week .
As ACMD chairman he should be providing independent advice and not " lobby for changes in policy actions " .
A spokesman said : " The home secretary has asked Professor Nutt resign as chair of the ACMD .
" In a letter he expressed surprise and disappointment over Professor Nutt 's comments which damage efforts to give the public clear messages about the dangers of drugs .
" As chair of the council his actions undermine its role and scientific independence .
" We fully support the work of the ACMD and remain committed to considering the independent advice and evidence it and other advisory bodies provide to the Government .
" However , the clear role of the chair of the ACMD is to provide independent scientific advice and not to lobby for changes in policy .
" We remain determined to crack down on all illegal substances and minimise their harm to health and society as a whole . "
In his letter Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt had gone beyond providing evidence to " lobbying " for changes to policy .
" As chair of the ACMD you cannot avoid appearing to implicate the council in your comments and thereby undermining its scientific independence , " he wrote .
" As Home Secretary it is for me to make decisions , having received advice from the ACMD .
" It is vitally important that the public understand the council 's role and also understand what the Government is trying to achieve .
" It is important that the Government 's messages on drugs are clear and as an adviser you do nothing to undermine the public understanding of them .
" As my lead adviser on drugs harms I am afraid the manner in which you have acted runs contrary to your responsibilities .
" I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy and have therefore lost confidence in your ability to advise me as chair of the ACMD .
" I would therefore ask you to step down from the council with immediate effect . "
Prof Nutt said in reply he was " extremely disappointed " to be asked to quit .
He said : " I believe my advice to you and your predecessors has been of the highest quality and in the best interests of the UK public .
" Whilst I accept that there is a distinction between scientific advice and government policy there is clearly a degree of overlap .
" If scientists are not allowed to engage in the debate at this interface then you devalue their contribution to policy making and undermine a major source of carefully considered and evidence - based advice . "

Created by a sophisticated society that crossed the line ?
The ancient Nazca people of Peru are famous for the lines they drew in the desert depicting strange animal forms .
A further mystery is what happened to this once great civilisation , which suddenly vanished 1,500 years ago .
Now a team of archaeologists have found the demise of the Nazca society was linked in part to the fate of a tree .
Analysing plant remains they reveal how the destruction of forests containing the huarango tree crossed a tipping point , causing ecological collapse .
The team have published their findings in the journal of Latin American Antiquity .
This remarkable nitrogen - fixing tree was an important source of food , forage timber and fuel for the local people
Dr David Beresford - Jones
University of Cambridge , UK " These were very special forests , " says Dr David Beresford - Jones from the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research , University of Cambridge , UK who led the team .
The huarango tree ( Prosopis pallida ) is a unique tree with many qualities and played a vital role in the habitat , protecting the fragile desert ecosystem , the scientists say .
" It is the ecological keystone species in the desert zone enhancing soil fertility and moisture and underpinning the floodplain with one of the deepest root systems of any tree known , " Dr Beresford - Jones says .
The tree was also a useful resource .
" This remarkable nitrogen - fixing tree was an important source of food , forage timber and fuel for the local people . "
Researchers have previously found evidence that suggests the disappearance of the Nazca society was a due to catastrophic flooding event as a result of El Nino around AD500 .
El Nino is a cyclical event that occurs as a result of a change in ocean temperatures that can cause a change in climate and severe flooding to the the west coast of South America .
The researchers have now found new evidence that suggests the society would not have been so easily destroyed if they had not cut down the forests around them .
An ancient Nasca canal crosses a desertified modern landscape in the lower Ica Valley , south coast Peru .
Analysing plant remains and pollen in soil 1.5 m deep , the team was able to trace an important sequence of events which show the clearing of woodland for agriculture .
" At the bottom of the profile there is a lot of huarango pollen and little evidence of human impact , " explains Dr Alex Chepstow - Lusty from the French Institute of Andean Studies in Lima , Peru who also took part in the study .
" Then , at 80 cm deep , maize pollen becomes common , showing the importance of this crop , suggesting a greater need for food and an increasing population , " he says .
" It is now we notice a big impact on the huarangos and a major decrease in their pollen . "
The landscape only became exposed to the catastrophic effects of that El Nino flood , once people had inadvertently crossed an ecological threshold
Dr David Beresford - Jones
University of Cambridge , UK " Then suddenly corresponding with the El Nino event at AD500 or shortly afterwards , the pollen is dominated by weeds in the family Chenopodiaceae , which are adapted to salty conditions and this landscape is now the desert seen today . "
The Nazca are famous for creating complex line drawings that can only be seen from the air in the Nazca desert , Peru 400 km south of Lima .
They were created between 500BC and AD500 and depict animals such as monkeys and whales as well as geometric figures several kilometres long .
As well as the lines , the Nazca also formed a sophisticated society , constructing complex irrigation systems for agriculture .
However , despite their skills and expertise , the researchers say the Nazca society inadvertently contributed to their own demise through the removal of the tree species .
Our research contradicts the popular view that Native American peoples always lived in harmony with their environment until the Spanish Conquest
Dr David Beresford - Jones
University of Cambridge , UK " The landscape only became exposed to the catastrophic effects of that El Nino flood , once people had inadvertently crossed an ecological threshold , " explains Dr Beresford - Jones .
" Such thresholds or ' tipping - points ' are sharply defined in these desert environments . "
" Our research contradicts the popular view that Native American peoples always lived in harmony with their environment until the Spanish Conquest , " Dr Beresford - Jones says .
Dr Beresford - Jones explains that with sufficient huarango cover , El Ninos were in fact not great disasters and actually created years of abundance replenishing water aquifers .
Once too much clearance had occurred the landscape was exposed to the effects of the El Nino floods .
" The river down cut into its floodplain and that floodplain narrowed hugely , irrigation systems were left high and dry , " he says .
" Human induced gradual change is just as important to the full story of Nazca collapse as the major climatic impacts that eventually precipitated them . "

Securities regulators are investigating potential insider trading of Global Gaming Factory before it announced its planned purchase of The Pirate Bay for $ 7.7 million , exchange AktieTorget told Swedish media .
AktieTorget , a Swedish exchange listing some 116 public companies , suspended trading in Global Gaming a week before the announcement as trading volume and share prices jumped without public news to account for it .
" There are reasons to suspect that information was leaked , " said Peter Gönczi , executive vice president at AktieTorget .
Gönczi also said that the exchange , if the purchase is finalized as planned in August , might open an even wider probe , given that the four Pirate Bay 's co-founders were convicted of facilitating copyright infringement by running the world 's most notorious BitTorrent tracker , and face a year each in prison and millions of dollars in fines .
Gönczi said AktieTorget does not permit criminal enterprises to trade on the exchange .
" AktieTorget wants to make sure that the companies that are traded on the list are managing legitimate businesses , " Gönczi said .
The new owners said they planned to make the site legitimate and pay content providers for their wares .
Before the sale , average daily volume in Global Gaming was about 162,000 shares .
From June 5 to June 18 , there was little trading in the stock with an average price of about 9 cents .
On June 22 , shares nearly doubled to 18 cents with 1.2 million shares sold before trading was halted .
( .pdf )
Trading resumed Tuesday , the day of the announced purchase , and shares closed at 38 cents , with a heavy volume of 5.8 million shares traded .
Trading closed at 25 cents Wednesday , down 13 cents , and the volume was nearly 7 million shares traded .
The 5 - year - old Pirate Bay boasted some 20 million - plus users and was the world 's most go - to website to find pirated movies , music , games and software .
Heads began spinning on Tuesday when the planned purchase was announced by software concern Global Gaming .
That sparked The Pirate Bay to become inundated by its fans asking whether their account information could be leaked .
" We are going to build a user deletion interface later today , " The Pirate Bay said on its blog .
" Many people have asked about having their account removed and we will not force anyone to stay on of course .
However , we also want to point out that we have no logs of anything , no personal data will be transferred in the eventual sale ( since no personal data is kept ) .
So , no need to be worried for safety . "

This week , a federal judge in Washington is presiding over preliminary hearings in a case in which five employees of the Blackwater security firm are accused of killing 14 Iraqi civilians in 2007 .
A case involving the U.S. presence in Iraq is of obvious public interest , but if you want to get a seat in the courtroom -- or to read about what goes on there -- do n’t bother .
District Judge Ricardo Urbina has closed the hearings to the public and the media .
Urbina ’s action is an extreme and unjustifiable response to fears about pretrial publicity .
It is also difficult to square with long - standing Supreme Court decisions requiring that courtrooms be open unless there are extraordinary circumstances justifying closure .
The preliminary hearings are exploring whether government prosecutors are illegally making use of statements the defendants made to State Department interviewers under a grant of immunity .
Urbina closed the hearings , he said , because he feared publicity at this early stage of the proceedings would influence witnesses and potential jurors and undermine the defendants ’ right to a fair trial .
He also expressed concern about the disclosure in open court of secret grand jury material .
It ’s appropriate for a judge to worry about the effect of prejudicial publicity .
But the Supreme Court repeatedly has insisted that there are ways to minimize the effect of publicity without closing the courtroom or forbidding the media to report on what transpires there .
For example , when it comes time to select the jury , candidates can be subjected to what the late Chief Justice Warren E. Burger called “ searching questioning ... to screen out those with fixed opinions as to guilt or innocence . ”

In 1980 , the Supreme Court ruled that only full - dress trials must be public .
But in 1986 , in a case involving a sensational murder trial in Riverside , the court extended its ruling to preliminary hearings .
“ Although grand jury proceedings have traditionally been closed to the public and the accused , ” Burger wrote , “ preliminary hearings conducted before neutral and detached magistrates have been open to the public . ”
As for the revelation of secret grand jury material , to the extent that ’s a problem , the judge could close sessions in which such testimony was likely to play a part and release redacted transcripts later .
But blanket secrecy is no more justified by a fear of disclosing grand jury testimony than it is by a concern about pretrial publicity .
It ’s not a sign of weakness for a judge to reconsider a hasty or misguided decision .
Urbina should do so .
What 's Paul McCartney 's doomsday scenario ?
Someone , somewhere , somehow manages to leak the Beatles ' music onto the internet , where it will be stolen by everyone , all the time .
This must be prevented !
Notice a problem there ?
Yeah , it gets worse .

A few days ago , we found out that Apple Corps and EMI would finally release the Beatles ' catalog in a digital format .
It 's not that we could n't have just purchased CDs and ripped them — that 's what everyone 's been doing for years now — it 's just that it felt like progress .
In reality , it was just the near - random actions of someone who has no idea what 's going on , at all .
From the Guardian via Ars , Paul McCartney 's view on selling the Beatles ' music online :
I met [ EMI 's chief executive ] on a plane once .
I said : " What is the problem ?
I want to do it , we all want to do it . "
And he explained that in the deal that we want , they feel exposed .
If [ digitised Beatles music ] gets out , if one employee decides to take it home and wap it on to the internet , we would have the right to say , " Now you recompense us for that .
And they 're scared of that . "

Just to be clear , Paul McCartney says he wants to sell music online , but he — and his record company — are worried that someone could conceivably download it , upload it back to the internet , and open the floodgates to piracy .
As opposed to just uploading the higher - quality digital files you 're selling to people on Apple - shaped USB drives right now , or on CDs , more than a decade ago .
McCartney expects an agreement by which he would be compensated if people share his music , as if it would be somehow correlated with the release of Beatles ' tracks online , which EMI — no stranger to releasing music online — is scared of because it 's insane .
Poor Paul !
Someone should tell him , you know , about all the wapping .

UPDATE : From anonymized ( not anonymous ) source who researched similar subjects in the past , a possible explanation :
It 's not the music for sale they 're worried about but the raw remasters ( this is why McCartney specifically refers to an employee potentially uploading the music ) .
I do n't know how much you 've read about the making of [ Beatles Rock Band ] but they went to incredible lengths to protect the masters .
It was only towards the end of the project that Harmonix received the ( heavily encrypted ) music they needed ; before then , Apple Corps had been sending them " dirtied - up " copies of the music just in case it was intercepted halfway .
The real threat from McCartney and the other Beatles ( and er , spouses of Beatles ) is that if , somewhere in the process of turning their music into iTunes - friendly files , the MASTERS get leaked ... then they will sue the pants off of EMI .
And EMI allegedly said they are in such a precarious financial position that they do not want to take the risk of getting hit by a lawsuit that could take the company down .

An alternate theory , which still does n't quite work .
If masters leaked to the internet , presumably they'd be encoded in something like FLAC at best , which would be indistinguishable from the files the Beatles are OK with selling on USB drives right now .
Or if this refers to the recording 's component parts , like the ones used to create Rock Band , still :
This seems avoidable .
And in either strain of paranoia : Paul McCartney does n't understand the internet .
( And possibly other things , too ! )
Dang guys , get a life ( referring to the above commenters ) .
Of course it should be legal .
Do you guys ever try to put yourself in the position of the people you criticize ?
Imagine : you 're a cop , and you 're standing there over some young punk who for some freaking reason wo n't give you a swab from his cheek again .
You threaten him verbally .
Nothing happens .
Now you 're just standing there , and all you want to do is get on with your life , get back to what you really became a cop for .
How do you suggest this cop should get the swab ?
Should he get down there and force the guys 's jaws open ?
Extremely hard to do , AND he 'll probably bite the swab off if he 's not cooperative .
In case none of you knew , when you taser someone it actually renders them feeling pretty helpless and weak .
Its the same way with the freakin waterboarding thing .
Everybody compares it to the wrong things , and out of context .
Example : IN comparison to doing nothing to harm a human being , something like waterboarding is horrible .
Even though there are more horrible things out there in the world , and waterboarding is one of the lesser forms of torture out in the world ( for those of you unacquainted with the world , just take my word for it !
there are worse things !! ) .
Anyway , now everyone 's getting into trouble for waterboarding .
Imagine again though , if you were in a camp , and you were ordered to extract information from a terrorist guy that might help save other 's lives , and you are restricted to just ..... what ???
yelling at him ?
You think anyone will tell you anything ?
If you do ... you have problems .
An educated person will realize that war is war , and one persons life is worth much less than those he is trying to murder .
Why the hell do you think the vietnamese , japanese , germans , etc. had such horrific forms of torture ?
Sure they went too far , but they understood the value of information .
I think we should keep waterboarding because to me it seems like one of the least violent ( compared to torture ) forms that may still yield results .
All this to say ..... look at it through the guy doing the job 's eyes .
Armadillo was the first team to qualify for the prize ( Image : W. Pomerantz / X Prize Foundation )
Two rocket teams will compete in back - to - back tests this week for what remains of the $ 2 million Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge prize for pilot - less vehicles that could take off and land vertically on the moon .
They have until Saturday to prevent the top prize of $ 1 million going to Armadillo Aerospace of Rockwall , Texas .
Armadillo scooped $ 350,000 – the top prize for the first level of the competition – last October for being the first team to launch a rocket vertically to 50 metres and hover for 90 seconds before landing , and repeating the process within hours .
In September , the company became the first to complete the second level of the challenge by keeping a rocket airborne for 180 seconds before landing on terrain that simulates a cratered , boulder - strewn lunar surface .
Doing that under Earth ’s gravity and air resistance is calculated to require the same power as would be needed to successfully touch down on the lunar surface , where gravity is six times weaker , and air absent .
If no one else can do that by 31 October then Armadillo will swell its winnings by claiming the challenge ’s top $ 1 million prize as well .

Rocket race
Announced in 2006 , the prize has attracted a dozen registered teams , but until last year none had completed any part of the challenge .
On 7 October Masten Space Systems , based in Mojave , California , became the only other team to pass the challenge ’s first level ( see a video of the team ’s rocket doing so ) , qualifying for the $ 150,000 prize for taking second place in that level .
Masten will make attempts on the second level on Wednesday and Thursday from a site in the Mojave desert .
Another team , Unreasonable Rocket , will attempt both levels of the challenge on Friday and Saturday .
A third team , California - based BonNovA , was slated to do the same today and tomorrow , but yesterday announced via Twitter that they had withdrawn from competition .
Hits the spot
Should either of Armadillo ’s competitors pass the second level of the challenge , the top prize will be awarded to the team that lands its craft most accurately .
The Masten team think this tie - breaking rule gives them a good shot at first prize , says spokesperson Douglas Graham .
While Armadillo ’s vehicle landed on average 90 centimetres from its target in the second - level tests , Masten ’s landing accuracy in the first level averaged about 15 centimetres .
Public demonstration
Over the course of the competition , teams have invested $ 20 million and 100,000 person - hours in pursuit of the prize purse , says William Pomerantz , head of space prizes at the X Prize Foundation , based in Playa Vista , California , which is managing the contest for NASA .
“ Generally speaking you ’ll find that most teams are willing to spend on average about two and a half times the prize value trying to win the prize , ” says Pomerantz .
“ The reason they do that is they see the prize not as the end of their activities but really just the start .
[ The prize is a ] way to very quickly recoup a lot of their initial capital expenses and in a very public way demonstrate their capabilities in a way that will be attractive to future customers . ”
The competition organisers concede that future lunar landers will necessarily be quite different from those in the contest , but say many of the underlying technologies developed will apply on the moon .
Rockets able to land vertically may also be of use for taking humans and scientific payloads to the edge of space , Pomerantz says .
If no other team completes the second level of the challenge successfully , the second prize of $ 500,000 will be carried over to next year for a last round of competition .
If it then remains unclaimed , it will be returned to NASA .
Anarchism in Latin America : The Archivo Histórico Angel Cappelletti
There ’s an interesting new online archive devoted to the work of anarchist writer and intellectual Angel Cappelletti .
Born in Buenos Aires in 1927 and spending the second half of his life in Venezuela , Cappelletti taught philosophy at various universities in Argentina , Uruguay , Venezuela , Mexico , and Costa Rica .
As a philosopher , he wrote on a wide range of topics — including pre-Socratic , Aristotelian , and medieval philosophy .
And he has written a slew of books on the theory and history of anarchism , including :
* El Anarquismo en América Latina ( edited with Carlos M. Rama )
* Hechos y figuras del anarquismo hispanoamericano
* El pensamiento de Kropotkin , ciencia ética y Anarquia
* A Ideoloxia Anarquista
* Estado y poder político en el pensamiento moderno
Below is an excerpt from the prologue of Cappelletti’s El Anarquismo en América Latina .
The excerpt was posted to the @ - infos listserv in 1996 by Luis J. Prat , who I also think did the translation .
And , beneath that , I ’ve pasted the Archivo Historico Angel Cappelletti’s “ About Us ” statement , first in Spanish , then my , um , sloppy translation .
Best ,

from Anarchism in Latin America
… Anarchism has an ample history in Latin America , rich in peaceful and violent struggles , in demonstrations of individual and collective heroism , in organizational efforts , in oral , written and practical propaganda , in literary works , in theatrical , pedagogic , cooperative or communitarian experiments , etc .
This history has never been totally documented , although there are very good partial studies .
Moreover , those who write the social , political , cultural , literary , philosophical history of the subcontinent usually neglect or minimize the importance of the anarchist movement .
There is in this as much ignorance as bad faith .
Some historians do not know the facts or consider anarchism as a marginal ideology absolutely minoritarian and scornful .
Others , on the contrary , know what anarchism means in the history of socialist ideas and understand its attitude towards Marxism well , but precisely because of this they try to forget or belittle it as the fruit of revolutionary immaturity , abstract utopianism , craftsman and petit bourgeois rebelliousness , etc .
… Like all thought originating in Europe , anarchist ideology was for Latin America an imported product .
But ideas are not mere products but rather organisms that , as such , must adapt to the new environment and in so doing , change in a lesser or greater measure .
To say that anarchism was brought to these shores by European immigrants is to say the obvious .
To interpret this fact as a sign of lesser value seems rather like a show of stupidity .
( The very idea of “ fatherland ” and nationalist ideology came from Europe ) .
But anarchism was not simply the ideology of the working and peasant masses who , newly arrived in the continent , felt cheated of their hopes for a better life and saw the exchange of oppression from the ancient monarchies with the no less weighty oppression from the new republican oligarchies .
Soon , it was the outlook on world and society that the native and even indigenous masses adopted , from Mexico ( with Zalacosta in Chalco ) to Argentina ( with Facon Grande in Patagonia ) .
It has seldom been noted that the anarchist doctrine of self - managed collectivism , as applied to the agrarian problem , coincided in fact with the ancient way of life and organization of the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Peru , prior not only to Spanish imperialism but also to Aztec and Inca imperialism .
To the degree that anarchists got to approach the natives , they did n’t have to inculcate exotic ideologies , but only to make conscious the peasant ideologies of “ calpull ” and “ ayllu . ”
At the same time , a tendency toward liberty and a detachment from all forms of statist structure took root in the Creole population .
When it was not channeled into following feudal caudillos , this provided fertile ground for libertarian ideology .
Almost no one mentions the existence ( in Argentina and Uruguay ) of anarchist gauchos , who had their literary expression in the libertarian “ payadores . ”
But even disregarding such phenomena , which will doubtlessly be considered insignificant by academic and Marxist historians , it can be said without doubt that anarchism sank roots among native workers much more deeply and extensively than Marxism ( with the only exception , perhaps , of Chile ) .
Even when , from a theoretical point of view , the Latin American movement has not contributed fundamentally to anarchist thought , it can be said that from the organizational and practical point of view it produced forms unknown in Europe .
Thus , the Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina ( FORA ) was an example of a center that , being majoritarian ( to the point of becoming , in many ways , a single center ) , never made any concessions to syndical bureaucracy , while at the same time adopting an organization as different from the CNT and other European anarcho - syndicalist organizations as from the North American IWW .
Another example , typically Latin American , is the existence of the Partido Liberal Mexicano , which a few years after its foundation adopted an ideology that no doubt was anarchist ( the work , above all , of Ricardo Flores Magon ) and that nevertheless kept its name and continued presenting itself as a political party ( which earned it sharp criticism from orthodox Europeans like Jean Grave ) .
Anyway , with the exception of this singular case , it can be said that in Latin America anarchism was almost always anarcho - syndicalism and was essentially linked to peasant and worker ’s organizations .
There were , no doubt , some anarcho - individualists in Argentina , Uruguay , Panama , etc. , and also some anarcho - communists foes of syndical organization ( in Buenos Aires during the 1880s and 1890s ) , but the great majority of Latin American anarchists were followers of a syndicalism both revolutionary and anti-political ( not , as it ’s usually and erroneously said , apolitical ) …
On the other hand , anarchism also presents different traits in different Latin American countries .
In Argentina , it has been , with the FORA , more radical , to the point of being considered extremist by the Spanish CNT .
In Uruguay , it has been more peaceful , as Nettlau noted , perhaps because it was less persecuted ( except during the last dictatorship ) .
In Mexico , it has had governmental significance , not only with the Magonist participation in the revolution against Porfirio Diaz , but also because the Casa del Obrero Mundial offered Carranza its “ red battalions ” in the fight against Villa and Zapata and because the CGT presidents debated with president Obregon .
In Brazil , on the contrary , it was always outside all statist influence , and the military - oligarchic republic never did anything but persecute , ostracize , or assassinate its militants .
A typical phenomenon of certain Latin American countries , between 1918 and 1923 , was anarcho - Bolshevism .
In Argentina , Uruguay , Brazil , and Mexico , when the Bolshevik revolution took place in Russia , many anarchists pronounced themselves for Lenin and announced their unconditional support for the Soviet government , but did not stop considering themselves anarchists .
This current disappeared with Lenin ’s death , because those who decided to follow Stalin no longer dared call themselves anarchists .
In all the countries in the region , anarchism produced , besides a vast newspaper propaganda and a copious ideological bibliography , many poets and writers that often were front - line figures in their respective national literatures .
Not everywhere , however , were they equally numerous and significant .
In Argentina and Uruguay , it can be said that the majority of the writers that published between 1890 and 1920 were , at some point and in some measure , anarchists .
In Brazil and Chile there were , likewise during this period , more than a few literary anarchists , though not as many as in Rio de la Plata .
In Colombia , Venezuela , Puerto Rico , etc. , if a properly anarchist literature did not flourish , the influence of libertarian ideology was more among literati and poets than among the worker ’s movement .
It is important to note , however , that even where literature and anarchism were almost synonymous as in Rio de la Plata ( during the above - mentioned period ) , anarchist intellectuals never played the role of elite or revolutionary vanguard and never had anything to do with the University or with official culture .
In this anarchism differs profoundly from Marxism .
The decline of the Latin American anarchist movement ( which does not imply its total demise ) may be attributed to three causes :
1 ) A series of coup - d’états , more or less fascist , that take place around 1930 ( Uriburu in Argentina , Vargas in Brazil , Terra in Uruguay etc. ) ; all of them characterized by a general repression of the worker ’s movement , leftist groups , and especially the anarchists .
In certain cases ( Argentina ) , they achieve the total disarticulation of the organizational and propagandistic structure of the workers ’ anarcho - syndicalist federations .
2 ) The founding of Communist ( Bolshevik ) parties .
The support of the Soviet Union and affiliated European parties conferred them a strength that was lacking in the anarchist organizations , which had few material resources other than dues paid by their militants .
More in some countries ( Brazil ) , less in others ( Argentina ) , there are anarchists that cross over to the communist party .
3 ) The appearance of national - populist currents ( more or less linked to the armed forces and even , sometimes , to the promoters of fascist coups ) .
The particular situation of dependence in which the Latin American countries find themselves with respect to European and , above all , North American imperialism steers the class struggle towards struggles of “ national liberation . ”
The workers view the exploitation of which they are victims as the imposition of foreign powers .
The bourgeoisie ( national and foreign ) are linked to certain sectors of the army and the Catholic church convinces workers that the enemy is no longer Capital and State , but only foreign Capital and State .
This conviction ( skillfully induced ) is , in reality , the principal cause of anarchism ’s decline .
All else , even the intrinsic difficulties that affect an anarchist organization in the world today ( such as the need to make unions work without bureaucracy and the real or apparent unviability of its concrete proposals ) is secondary .

Satellite that predicts floods is launched by European scientists
A satellite which will make flood prediction easier by tracking water flows around the Earth was today launched by European scientists .
The Smos spacecraft will also improve weather forecasts and gauge the impact of climate change .
The £ 282 million probe monitors the amount of moisture held in soils and of the quantity of salts dissolved in the oceans .
Scroll down to bottom to watch a video showing how the satellite works
Orange dawn :
The Smos satellite is launched aboard a rocket at Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia
Experts hope the European Space Agency mission will be able to fill important gaps in our knowledge about the planet ’s vital water cycle .
The satellite , which was lifted into space from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia , could also help develop more accurate weather forecasts .
Global estimates of soil moisture will also help forecast drought and flood risk .
When a storm breaks , for example , the ability of rainwater to percolate down depends on the type of soil and how much water it is already holding .
The probe , which also monitors photosynthesis and plant growth , can measure moisture to a depth of up to 7ft .
Vital work :
A computer generated image of the probe which tracks water flows around Earth
It is also critical for calculating Earth ’s carbon cycle , the process by which heat - trapping carbon dioxide is released and absorbed , especially by plants and the oceans .
Climate change , scientists agree , is largely caused by CO2 pollution that has upset that natural balance .
Its second job is to measure changes in the salt content of sea surface waters , data that will enhance our understanding of what drives global ocean circulation patterns .
Ocean circulation helps moderates climate , notably by transporting heat from the equator to the poles .
Some studies have suggested that global warming could disrupt these cycles in ways that could dramatically alter regional weather patterns .
Catastrophe : But last year 's Venice floods could have been predicted by Smos
Variations in the salinity of ocean waters depend on the addition or removal of fresh water through evaporation and precipitation and , in polar regions , on the freezing and melting of ice .
‘ Climate change is a fact , but its impact on precipitation , evaporation , surface runoff and flood risks is still uncertain , ’ said Yann Kerr , a researcher at the Centre for the Study of the Biosphere from Space and scientific director for the Smos mission .
‘ The availability of water plays a more important role on these impacts than temperature itself . ’
Scientists rely heavily on computer models to project weather and climate patterns , and having additional data based on concrete observations will make those models more accurate .
Data will be collected by a single instrument called Miras , the large Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis .
Tewkesbury , 2007 :
The city floods regularly and can now be more prepared as soil moisture is measured
Smos , which stands for Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity , is set to conduct its mission over three years , with a possible two - year extension .
A second ESA satellite lifted into space today called Proba - 2 is designed to demonstrate innovative in - orbit technologies .
It will test a new type of lithium - ion battery , an advanced data and power management system , a dual - frequency GPS receiver , an experimental solar panel , an exploration micro-camera and a dozen other technologies .
Proba - 2 will also conduct experiments related to solar observation and space weather .

Published in 1925 , The Great Gatsby is set in New York City and Long Island during the Prohibition era ( remember , the Prohibition era was a time in which alcohol was illegal , no matter how old you were – yowsa ) .
Flappers ?
It 's got them .
Parties ?
You bet ?
Cool cars ?
Absolutely — but more on that in a minute or jump ahead to our Great Gatsby summary .
The problem is , author F. Scott Fitzgerald did n't see the Jazz Age as all about hip music and sparkly clothes .
He associated the entire period with materialism ( " I want things !
Lots of things ! " ) and immorality .
For many of the post - World War I era's newly wealthy , materialism and immortality were the name of the game .
The novel 's star is Jay Gatsby , a young , rich man in love with a society girl from his past .
A girl who , as it happens , is married to someone else .
Do we smell a Twilight - esque love triangle approaching ?
And that 's not the only reason why Gatsby still feels fresh today .
The novel 's very title has become a kind of buzzword for periods of excess and fake luxury .
The economic collapse of 2008 brought back distant and unwelcome memories of the stock market crash of 1929 , casting the boom times of the 1990s and early 2000s as the modern - day version of the Roaring Twenties .
In both cases , though , unsustainable boom times led to devastating crashes with profound cultural consequences .
In the 1920s , it had been a bubble in stocks that brought easy prosperity , while in our own time the bubble had been in the housing market .
In both times , easy money meant that many people could begin to dream of living out their days like Jay Gatsby , with life as just one grand party in a seersucker suit .
But as that vision of easy luxury crashed and burned ( in both 1929 and 2008 ) , newfound hard times required a redefinition of the American Dream .
And while Gatsby is a work of fiction , Fitzgerald 's real life contains some suspicious similarities .
( Gulp . )
Narrator Nick Carraway is both mesmerized and disgusted by Gatsby 's extravagant lifestyle , just as Fitzgerald claimed to feel about the " Jazz Age " excesses that he himself adopted .
As an Ivy League educated , middle - class Midwesterner , Fitzgerald ( like Nick ) saw through the shallow materialism of the era .
But ( like Gatsby ) Fitzgerald came back from World War I and fell in love with a wealthy southern socialite – Zelda Sayre .
The Great Gatsby is swaddled in Fitzgerald 's simultaneous embrace of and disdain for 1920s luxury .
Since Fitzgerald did indeed partake in the Jazz Age 's decadent high life , it 's not surprising that the details of the setting and characters make The Great Gatsby a sort of time capsule of the 1920s .
Gatsby is taught all over the world partly because it's a history lesson and novel all rolled into one delicious wrap of intrigue .
Mmmmm…intrigue .
Scientific American has an interesting , “ 60 - Second Podcast ” by Steve Mirsky about research by Situationist Contributor Mahzarin Banaji and San Diego State ’s Thierry Devos finding that white Americans inherently regard white Europeans as somehow more “ American ” than Asian - or African - Americans .
Here are some excerpts from the podcast , which you can link to here .
* * *
The so - called birthers can’t accept that President Obama is really a natural - born American citizen .
Part of what ’s behind this seemingly irrational belief may lie in what ’s called implicit social cognition — the deep - rooted assumptions we all carry around , and may act on without realizing it .
Harvard ’s Mahzarin Banaji studies such implicit cognition .
Last fall she talked to journalists at the annual conference of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing about research into bias against Asian - Americans .
“ So we thought , what if we picked Asians who are very well known to be American .
What about Connie Chung ?
Are they going to be seen as less American than , let ’s say , Hugh Grant ?
And so we thought this was a bizarre study to do but we did it anyway . ”
Amazingly , white Americans did see a white European like Hugh Grant as being somehow more American than the Asian - American Connie Chung .
And similar research in 2008 found that whites thought of ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair as somehow more American than Obama .
So the mental framework to believe that Obama is foreign probably was , to use a health care term , a preexisting condition .

El historiador y escritor Félix Luna falleció hoy a los 84 tras algunos meses de internación .
" Falucho " , tal como se lo conocía entre los íntimos al autor de Breve historia de los argentinos , había sido distinguido el lunes último con el premio a la trayectoria otorgado por la Legislatura .
Durante el acto , la hija del escritor e historiador recordó la afición juvenil de su padre por la guitarra , su incursión en la poesía con los valores de la tierra y la creación de la Misa Criolla , con Ariel Ramírez .
* * *
Aunque muchos lo creían oriundo de La Rioja , la provincia de donde era su familia , Félix Luna había nacido en Buenos Aires , el 30 de septiembre de 1925 .
Sin embargo , supo aunar como pocos todas las pasiones y muchas de las virtudes de un argentino cabal .
Por ello , resultarán escasas estas líneas para tratar de resumir una vida larga y fecunda , caracterizada por el hacer y el pensar en muchos y muy distintos ámbitos de nuestra realidad cultural y política .
Mañana con la edición de
En 1951 se graduó de abogado en la Universidad de Buenos Aires y muy pronto comenzó a publicar los primeros títulos de lo que iba a constituir una obra interesantísima e imprescindible , que transitó con igual calidad por temas de historia , ensayo , poesía , ficción y periodismo .
Contemporáneamente desarrollaba una intensa actividad como funcionario público : entre 1956 y 1958 , fue director de la Obra Social del Ministerio de Trabajo de la Nación ; en 1958 , consejero de la embajada argentina en Suiza y , entre 1959 y 1961 , en la embajada argentina en Uruguay ; desde 1962 a 1963 , jefe de Gabinete de la cancillería , y , entre 1986 y 1989 , Secretario de Cultura de la Municipalidad de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires , en una gestión muy recordada por haber impulsado el Plan Cultural en barrios , con la consiguiente realización de numerosos conciertos al aire libre , tanto como temporadas teatrales , musicales , operísticas y de ballet , en verano , en espacios abiertos y en forma gratuita .
En el ámbito universitario , se desempeñó como jefe de investigación del Instituto de Derecho Político Constitucional de la Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de la UBA , en 1956 , y en esa misma facultad fue Director del Instituto de Extensión Universitaria .
También ejerció la docencia en las universidades del Salvador y de Belgrano .
Pero su carrera " docente " propiamente dicha iba a desarrollarse de una manera novedosa y fuera de los ámbitos académicos .
Porque fue a partir de la publicación de sus libros sobre historia argentina , y de la creación y dirección de la revista Todo es Historia - aparecida en 1967 , continúa en la actualidad y ha influido decisivamente en la construcción de la historiografía argentina - que el nombre de Félix Luna estuvo indisolublemente ligado a una manera de contar , difundir e interpretar la historia y la vida de los argentinos no sólo atractiva , sino también caracterizada por la voluntad de objetividad y ( sobre todo en sus últimas obras ) búsqueda de un principio de entendimiento común .
Esa visión lo llevó también a actuar en todos los ámbitos periodísticos de su época : fue colaborador de los diarios Clarín y LA NACION de Buenos Aires , y en revistas y otros diarios del interior ; junto con el periodista Miguel Angel Merellano , realizó , entre 1977 y 1982 , el programa de radio Hilando nuestra historia , y en 1983 , estuvo en Canal 11 , en el programa denominado Todo es Historia como su revista ( que siguió después en ATC y , más tarde , en Canal 13 ) .
Por fin , junto al músico y compositor Ariel Ramírez escribió los versos para varias obras musicales , como la Misa Criolla , Cantata Sudamericana y Mujeres Argentinas , obra esta última que incluye las hoy famosísimas canciones " Alfonsina y el mar " y " Juana Azurduy " , consagradas en la voz de la recientemente fallecida Mercedes Sosa .
Indudablemente fue con la publicación de sus casi treinta libros que creció su fama como historiador y escritor .
Muy temprano , en 1954 , hizo conocer Yrigoyen , la primera de sus biografías de presidentes argentinos , y , enseguida , obtuvo su primer premio , el de la Dirección Nacional de Cultura , en 1957 , al mejor cuento costumbrista por " La fusilación " .
Después aparecieron Alvear , 1958 ; Diálogos con Frondizi , 1962 ; Los caudillos , 1966 , y , en 1968 , una de sus obras capitales , destinada a convertirse en best - seller , El 45 , que termina con este párrafo : " Pienso que daría diez años de la vida de Félix Luna a cambio de un solo día de Juan D. Perón .
A cambio , por ejemplo , de aquella jornada de octubre , cuando se asomó a la Plaza de Mayo y recibió , en un bramido inolvidable , lo más limpio y hermoso que puede ambicionar un hombre con vocación política : el amor de su pueblo " .
Y ante la necesidad de definir por qué había elegido ese año , el propio Luna arriesgó una respuesta en una entrevista , en 1971 : " Fue un año decisivo , y no solamente porque Perón haya llegado al poder e iniciado su hegemonía , sino porque el país entero decidió entonces adquirir un determinado estilo político y asumir una determinada conciencia .
Ciertos valores cayeron para siempre y ciertos valores quedaron afirmados , también para siempre , en 1945 " .
Más tarde , Félix Luna publica Argentina de Perón a Lanusse , en 1973 ;
De comicios y entreveros , y Conversaciones con José Luis Romero ( ensayo histórico ) , 1977 , y Ortiz , en 1978 .
La década del 80 fue extraordinariamente prolífica : Conflictos y armonías en la historia argentina , 1980 ; Buenos Aires y el país , 1982 ; Golpes militares y salidas electorales , 1983 ; Perón y su tiempo ( tres volúmenes ) , 1984 ; La comunidad organizada , 1985 ; El Régimen exhausto , 1986 , y la que sería otra de sus obras más conocidas y más reeditadas : Soy Roca , 1989 .
Otra vez , Luna buscó y logró con este libro una forma distinta de narración : a lo largo de 500 páginas es el presidente argentino el que , supuestamente poco tiempo antes de morir , cuenta su vida , tan ligada al destino de la República .
La belleza de la prosa y la actualidad histórica del personaje hicieron de este libro otro gran best - seller , continuamente reeditado hasta la actualidad .
En Sarmiento y sus fantasmas , 1997 , y en Martín Aldama .
Un soldado de la Independencia , 2001 , Luna volvió a usar sabiamente la voz de sus personajes para lograr que la historia , sin importar su lejanía en el tiempo , se reactualizara hasta hacerse más comprensible para todos .
Finalmente , en los 90 también publicó , entre otros , Breve historia de los argentinos , 1993 ; Historia integral de los argentinos ( 10 tomos ) , 1994 - 1998 ; Diálogos con la Historia y la Política , 1996 , en colaboración con Natalio Botana .
En 2005 , Encuentros a lo largo de mi vida , y en 2006 , Revoluciones .
Distinguido con gran cantidad de premios - en 1994 , obtuvo el Konex por el rubro " Biografías históricas " - , miembro de la Academia Nacional de la Historia , recibió además distinciones de los gobiernos de Francia , Perú y Brasil , y fue nombrado Ciudadano Ilustre de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires en 1996 , quizás uno de los galardones que más lo haya emocionado .
Félix Luna ha sido una figura sobresaliente en la historiografía argentina contemporánea pero , y por sobre todo , un escritor y un ciudadano argentino comprometido profundamente con su tiempo y su país .
Un buen ejemplo por seguir para aquellos a los cuales ahora les toca continuar con su tarea .
Palabras sobre la historia y sobre su vida
Entrevista realizada por Politicargentina.com en 2008
PHILADELPHIA -- A Philadelphia newspaper has apologized to readers for mistakenly running an ad congratulating the Philadelphia Phillies on winning back - to - back World Series titles .
The New York Yankees held a commanding 3 - 1 lead in the championship as of Monday , the day the ad was printed in the Philadelphia Inquirer .
The three - quarter - page Macy 's ad is on the back of the front section and features a T - shirt with the Phillies logo , the commissioner 's trophy and the phrase " Back To Back World Series Champions . "
The Inquirer released a message to readers saying the paper deeply regrets the error .
Virgin Media is now acting as chief lapdog to the Lord Mandleson sell out of the internet to the dying music distribution industry .
Virgin Media is to trial deep packet inspection technology to measure the level of so called illegal filesharing on its network .
Customers being monitored will not be informed .
Virgin will use a product called CView , sold by Detica , a BAE subsidiary that specialises in large volume data collection and processing , and whose traditional customers are the intelligence agencies and law enforcement .
BAE profited massively from the Neo Con Labour War in Iraq and Afghanistan , now it loks set to profit again from The War Against Piracy .
The CView product will operate at the centre of Virgin Media ’s network with an aim of estimating the proportion of filesharing traffic that infringes copyright .
40 per cent of Virgin Media ’s traffic will be monitored .
If you are on Virgin and are not being monitored today , tomorrow you may well be .
If this is truly limited to peer to peer traffic then your next game on your XBOX 360 may be monitored .
It would be all but impossible to identify the difference between a game played on your XBOX 360 and an encrypted bit torrent file .
This will therefore exaggerate the amount of “ illegal ” bit torrent traffic .
The system will look at traffic to identify peer - to - peer packets .
The programme then looks at those packets to determine what is licensed and what is unlicensed , based on data provided by the record industry .
Virgin promises data will be aggregated and and made anonymous .
The trial though has no scheduled end date .
It should be remembered that CView uses the the same technology that powered the Phorm advertising system , which monitored individual internet users to target advertisements .
It too was trialled – by BT – without customers ’ consent or knowledge .
The Government faces an EU investigation for allowing this .
Detica will want to sell this to other ISPs .
So there may be no escape from this .
Once all ISPs have this , how anonymous will traffic be then ?
Virgin Media ’s implementation will they promise focus on music sharing .
Of course their proposed music download service has nothing to do with this .
Are you sure you will not be flagged because of a video you watch on youtube or even Vidzone on the PS3 ?
Do you trust the list provided by the Music Industry ?
Detica has is also trying to flog CView to the Government .
In the sales document , Detica said that as well as aggregate data , CView could be used to categorise filesharers and apply technical measures against them , or target them to be sold legal alternatives .

Ovechkin : ' Probably a week '
Alex Ovechkin returned to the ice today , skating at the end of the Caps ' practice and again for about 15 minutes with Mark Nemish .
He took some wrist shots , did a little stickhandling and carried his stick in his left hand the entire time he was out there .
" I feel much better right now , " Ovechkin said .
" I hope soon . "
From the sounds of it , Ovechkin and team officials expect the two - time MVP to miss Wednesday 's game .
But after that , no one is willing to guess .
" I wish it was going to be tomorrow , " Ovechkin said .
" I need to make sure I 'm good and my body feels good .
Probably a week .
We 'll see . "
As for a report that came out yesterday quoting Ovechkin saying he will miss " 4 - 5 weeks , " Ovechkin said : " I was just joking . "
Ovechkin added that he has improved markedly from Thursday -- the last time he skated -- to today .
" This is progress , I think ; I 'm kind of happy about it , " he said .
Ovechkin also said that he did n't feel any pain while taking shots , though he admitted that he was n't putting too much on them .
" It was no pain , " he said .
" It was easy shots , not hard .
I do n't want to rush my body to take some real hard slap shot or wrist shot .
I 'm just getting used to it . "
Asked whether he 's concerned about getting hit , he said , " I can [ have ] contact , it 's all about moves . "
That -- and the fact that he motioned to his left pectoral / shoulder area twice during the interview -- suggests that he's got a muscle strain and not does not have any structural damage in his shoulder .

Drawing a jam - packed Ballroom 20 to its feet , creator Matt Groening said “ no end is in sight ” for “ The Simpsons , ” which received kudos from the Guinness Book of World Records following Saturday ’s hourlong panel .
Tapped by Guinness as “ the longest - running sitcom in history ” for bypassing “ Ozzie and Harriet , ” Groening thanked fans of the show and all the scores of individuals who have been a part of the show ’s 20 years .
Handing out “ Simpsons ” goodies to all who came to the mic with questions , Groening noted that he is a part of every episode of the animated hit .
In the way of achieving a healthy software development environment , a lot of projects fall in one of these two DON 'Ts : irresponsibility and territoriality .
Irresponsibility is when there is no one in charge of making things right ( with respect to a whole category of problems ) .
Territoriality is when there is someone in charge , and he wo n't let anyone else touch the code without him .
They may sound opposite to one another , but often irresponsibility is a result of territoriality , where the person in charge just is n't interested in the kind of problem you 're experiencing , and so any consideration for such problems gets disregarded in favor of whatever fits the interests of the maintainer .
As a notorious example of irresponsible software design , I will cite PHP , whose maintainer has repeatedly claimed he was never interested in designing a good programming language .
It shows .
But I 'm sure you 'll find plenty of familiar examples in your own experience , from the irresponsive provider of some proprietary software you 've been locked into using , to maybe someone from some other department of your company that you 've had to deal with , and perhaps even to yourself with respect to your own users .
Of course , it is always possible to start a new project to replace the software you 're dissatisfied with .
But the costs associated to such endeavour are often huge .
You will have to reimplement not just the parts that the replaced software did wrong , but also the parts it did right .
While by assumption you can clearly see parts of the design that are wrong and do better with respect to those parts , you may be lacking the proficiency , time and interest to do as well on these other parts .
Last but not least , the community around the original software , that made it valuable , will not switch to the new one for merely small gains , and the transition from the old system to the new system may impose demanding constraints of backwards compatibility .
Free Software can drastically reduce the cost of starting a new project , by allowing you to fork the existing code base , copy large chunks of it , or at the very least read the code of what you may have to be compatible with .
It does not make the cost go down to zero , however .
There again , cruft that made the original software bad enough that you felt like changing it will be a heavy burden upon you if you keep it , and a huge setback to reimplement if you decide to throw it away .
And even in the world of free software , some licenses can incur a higher cost to forking than others : for instance , licenses designed to be incompatible with other licenses , licences that force you to distribute the code as source , that prevent you from making any adaptation and keep the name , or otherwise put hurdles in the way of forkers .
In the world of Common Lisp , an interesting case of not - so - responsible software is ASDF .
Some of you might be tempted to sneer , is he going to blame the problem with ASDF on the original author who is long gone , and the current maintainer who is n't committing enough energy and availability to making the project go forward ?
No , not at all .
Dan Barlow actually did a great job while he was there , and if no one is stepping up to offer more than Gary King provides , it 's certainly not Gary who is to blame ; he is getting blatant bugs fixed and accepting consensual patches , and at this point forking would be trivial to fork the git repo if anyone were dissatisfied with Gary 's performance .
Rather , I 'll argue that any problem with ASDF is a symptom of the way responsibilities are distributed with respect to its update , and propose a small technical change that can hopefully improve things a lot .
When Dan Barlow wrote ASDF in 2001 , he only wanted a better semi-portable CL build system that he could use on top of SBCL for his own projects , something that would be more declarative than the previous best alternative MK : DEFSYSTEM , and would only need to support modern ANSI CL implementations not old forgotten Lisp variants .
In developing ASDF , he loosely followed the better design principles once proposed by Kent Pitman for an extensible CL build system .
In all those objectives , ASDF was a tremendous success , and CL users should all be grateful to Dan for his achievement .
However , as usual the problem lies with issues he did n't try to tackle .
Problems with ASDF include the painful way you have to configure it , deficient support for documentation or testing , broken support for conditional compilation , missing support for generated files , its weird TRAVERSE algorithm , etc .
Unlike the issue of deterministic incremental compilation that prompted me to start XCVB , none of the above issues is unsolvable in itself within ASDF .
But the constraints within which ASDF is developed make it hard to solve them .
Happily , some of these constraints can be removed with a little bit of hackery .
Most importantly , ASDF has a distribution bootstrap problem : it specifies how to load other systems , but nothing specifies how ASDF itself is loaded into your system .
That problem is left to whoever writes the Lisp implementation , distributes the Lisp package , or maintains a larger project within which ASDF is used .
And in the world of Common Lisp , there are tens of different implementations , many of them packaged in various ways .
To make the problem tractable , ASDF follows the constraint that it comes as a single file that may be loaded independently of its location , and does n't depend on any third party library beside what is included by each supported implementation .
This means that the provider of libraries that use ASDF must rely on the least common denominator of ASDF features , unless he wants to force his users to make sure they upgrade their ASDF .
Upgrading the current ASDF could conceivably be easy , but is actually hard , because of the inability to hot - upgrade a loaded ASDF .
It is still possible to remove an old ASDF and replace it , and XCVB does it in an ugly way ( see how xcvb / no - asdf deletes the ASDF package and anything that uses it ) ; however , files compiled against the old ASDF may not work with the new one and vice versa ( I 've had " interesting " issues that way while using xcvb - master in slightly different setups ) .
This inability to upgrade further makes the pre-packaging of a Lisp implementation with a given version ASDF a bit of a damned if you do , damned if you do n't proposition to Lisp implementers and distributors .
Happily , implementers have the option of only providing ASDF when REQUIRE'd , and this is the preferred way for users to specify they want to use ASDF , when it is available .
Distributors may not have this option inasmuch as there is no standard mechanism to hook into an implementation 's REQUIRE .
An example of a failed attempt at distributing Common Lisp with ASDF is common - lisp - controller .
It tried to provide a way to make sure there is always a configured ASDF , but their solution only works if everyone uses only debian or another supported OS distribution , and only if the debian maintainers keep up with all the common - lisp software ( implementations and libraries ) that one may want to use ; two hypotheses that have been disproved in practice with respect to the needs of many users .
To step back to the problem of responsibility , the current constraints of ASDF are such that a consistent upgrade of ASDF requires action on the part of tens of people , each in his own territory : ASDF contributors , Lisp implementers , package distributors .
If only one hacker alone decides to upgrade ASDF , he has to incur the cost of the associated work of modifying ASDF and the risk that this will introduce incompatibilities , for little overall progress in terms of what users may rely upon unless he convinces tens of other people also do the same .
Thus , the costs of adoption are high , the benefits of development are low , development is slow , and a cycle of stagnation continues .
If someone cares about the future of ASDF , I recommend they should address the upgradability bug , which will itself unlock a big hurdle on the way of further evolution of ASDF .
Note that this upgradability includes both the technical ability to load a new ASDF on top of an old one , but probably also the proper configuration of ASDF , to load systems from a series of configured paths declared in user and system preference files .
Personally , I 'd rather work on XCVB , and invite people interested in build systems to work on it instead of ASDF .
But if XCVB is to prevail , it may as well prevail against the best ASDF that ASDF can be .
XCVB tries to avoid all the problems of ASDF by stepping back from the assumption that everything happens in a one Lisp world that has already been setup .
Instead , XCVB will manage many Lisp worlds that it will help you setup .
It does n't live inside your Lisp image , and thus does n't depend on Lisp implementers or distributors to provide it for you ; it can therefore evolve fast without any issue due to slow distribution .
It is also liberated from the constraint ASDF has of itself having no dependencies , because these dependencies would both make bootstrap more difficult and interfere with other versions of same software as part of the software being built .
XCVB thus reuses plenty of libraries and is richer in features , and will use even more libraries in the future .
All this in addition to its original essential distinguishing feature of providing deterministic incremental compilation .
XCVB is n't complete yet , but I believe that on supported implementations ( currently only SBCL , CCL , CLISP , but I could add more on demand , or you could do it yourself ) , it is already better than ASDF .
If you care for CL build systems , please fix ASDF ; but please give XCVB a try , too .
Even if you do n't care for CL build systems , organize your software developments so that every upgrade step can be done by the single maintainer of a single project , without requiring the coordination between many people in many different projects .
This lesson should be particularly dear to those who dream of making a Standard for Lisp , Scheme , Javascript , Java or any other language or piece of software : if you need to agree on something that will require future coordination between plenty of people , it is almost sure to fail to evolve fast enough to remain relevant , even though one or two iterations might make it live ( see e.g. R6RS and its current attempted successor ) .
Instead , you should offer software that already runs with a free software reference implementation that others can trivially adapt to their systems if needed ( also in Scheme , compare the SRFI process ) .
After your code has become de facto standard , you might not even care for it being any kind of de jure standard anymore .
Whereas if there 's going to be a de jure standard , it will be blood and conflict as long as there 's anything to disagree about , and still resentment at the unsatisfying compromise that results .
The same idea also accounts for Conway 's Law : if you divide your software project between many teams , each team will build its own code base , and the structure of the software will end up following the structure of the teams that build it .
Parts of the software where the ownership is not clearly assigned but where authority is divided will be the scene for conflict , slow evolution , bad design ( if design at all ) , etc.
Vertical disintegration , where independent teams manage layers of the software and its life - cycle , will in particular lead to a multiplication of such dysfunctional interfaces between entrenched overlapping code bases the global architecture of which cannot be refactored .
Happily , solving the problem of irresponsible software is much easier than solving the problem of irresponsible government .
PS : I 've since accepted co-maintainership of ASDF .
If problems persist beyond March 2010 , blame me .
Today is a big day for gamers as the widely anticipated game modern warfare 2 is released , and as we Anticipated , the game is said to be the biggest selling hit of the history .
People gathered at shops around the world ahead of the release time to grab their copy of the game .
Retailer HMV in the UK opened at midnight to allow eager gamers to get their hands on the game as soon as possible .
HMV has predicted more than 1 million UK sales in the first week , 20 % more than previous record holder Grand Theft Auto 4 ( GTA4 ) .
“ We estimate that the game will exceed 1 m UK sales in its first week , which would be a new record , ” said HMV spokesperson Gennaro Castaldo .
Online shop Amazon said the pre-order sales were 50 % higher than GTA4 , while Play.com says that in the run up to launch it was getting more than 150 pre-orders per minute .
The publishers of Modern Warfare 2 , Activision , are cautiously predicting total sales of 3 m across the UK whilst some analysts believe it could sell 10 m copies globally in the run up to Christmas .
Tony Bartel , executive vice president , merchandising and marketing , GameStop Corp said :
By all indicators , we anticipate Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 will be the biggest entertainment launch of all time .
As of today , the number of pre-order reservations we ’ve taken for the game is the highest for any title we ’ve ever sold in our 6,200 store network .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The world will have to spend an extra $ 500 billion to cut carbon emissions for each year it delays implementing a major assault on global warming , the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday .

At United Nations climate talks in Barcelona last week negotiators from developed countries said the world would need an extra six to 12 months to agree a legally binding , global deal to cut carbon emissions beyond a planned December deadline .
The IEA , energy adviser to 28 industrialized countries , said the world must act urgently to put greenhouse gases on a track to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius .
Every year ’s delay beyond 2010 would add another $ 500 billion to the extra investment of $ 10,500 billion needed from 2010 - 2030 to curb carbon emissions , for example to improve energy efficiency and boost low - carbon renewable energy .
“ Much more needs to be done to get anywhere near an emissions path consistent with ... limiting the rise in global temperature to 2 degrees , ” said the IEA ’s 2009 World Energy Outlook .
“ Countries attending the U.N. climate conference must not lose sight of this . ”
U.N. talks meant to agree a deal in Copenhagen in December to extend or replace the existing Kyoto Protocol have struggled to overcome a rich - poor rift on how to split the cost of curbing carbon emissions , for example from burning fossil fuels .
Developed countries accept that they have to take the burden of cutting carbon emissions , but want developing nations to accept binding actions too under a new treaty .
Poor countries want financial help to implement carbon emissions cuts and prepare for unavoidable global warming , including droughts , floods and rising seas .
The IEA report estimated that the world needed to invest an extra $ 197 billion annually by 2020 to make the necessary emissions cuts in developing countries , compared with a global total of $ 430 billion by then .
“ The Copenhagen conference will provide important pointers to the kind of energy future that awaits us , ” it said .
To continue present trends of energy demand and burning of fossil fuels “ would lead almost certainly to massive climatic change and irreparable damage to the planet , ” it said .
To implement swinging carbon cuts , on the other hand , would require a huge shift in the world ’s energy system .
That would raise , for example , the share of non-fossil fuels to 32 percent of total primary energy in 2030 , from 19 percent in 2007 .
The share of the internal combustion engine in new car sales would fall to 40 percent by 2030 from more than 90 percent under current trends .

Postwar guilt was also closely related to post - colonial guilt , and post - colonial guilt was the reason why some countries , notably France and Britain , initially opened their doors so widely to Algerians , Tunisians , Bangladeshis , and Pakistanis , among others .
Surely , the argument went , their former imperial rulers owed something to the inhabitants of the British Commonwealth and the Francophone world .
This argument even worked in countries that had never possessed any colonies , as all immigrants coming from ex-colonial countries were automatically classed as members of oppressed cultures who deserved the assistance of modern , anti-racist , anti-colonial , secular Europeans .
In this sense , the postwar European project represented an admirable attempt to transcend Europe ’s old and ugly anxieties about sameness and otherness .
The European project also nurtured an admirable instinct to welcome asylum - seekers -- people who had a justifiable fear of persecution in their own countries .
Some European Jews had been saved during the war , after all , because they had successfully sought asylum elsewhere -- and many had died because they had been refused .
Over time , however , European enthusiasm for the offering of asylum was dampened by the exponential expansion in numbers of asylum seekers , not all of whom , as it turned out , were truly suffering from political persecution .
Still , the real problem for European immigration services was never the “ bogus asylum - seekers , ” as the British tabloids call them , but the real ones .
At the end of 2008 , the United Nations High Commission on Refugees counted more than sixteen million legitimate refugees , all of whom technically have a right to European asylum .
Particularly when the humanitarian need to reunite them with their spouses , parents , and children is taken into account , along with the need to make amends for colonial cruelty , this is potentially a very large number of people .
Indeed , a very large number of people -- in fact , an unprecedented number -- arrived , and are still arriving .
Some 1.5 million of the nine million people who live in Sweden are immigrants or the children of immigrants , as are some three million of the sixteen million inhabitants of the Netherlands .
At current rates , one - quarter to one - third of the population of most Western European countries will be of non-European origin by the middle of this century .
In many major cities -- Rotterdam , Marseille , Leicester -- Muslims may soon be in the majority .
In some districts of major cities , including London and Amsterdam , they already are .
Once the immigrants had arrived , the complicated morality of the European project also made it hard , rather paradoxically , for Europeans to absorb the newcomers , especially those from the Muslim world .
Europeans who were trying to abandon their own national identities were not going to thrust those identities on immigrants .
After all , who was to say whose culture was better ?
No one saw the need to promote assimilation -- to teach Turks to be German , or Moroccans to be Dutch .
The very idea was embarrassing .
Strangely , in retrospect , very few Europeans even felt that it was necessary to induct newcomers into the European project itself .
No one explained to them that being “ Dutch ” now meant respecting womens ’ rights , or that being “ German ” was incompatible with Holocaust denial , or that open distaste for homosexuals would be considered socially unacceptable .
No one felt comfortable inflicting any moral or historical lessons upon them at all .
This led to a great deal of mutual incomprehension .

Answers Come There None
As the Plimer affair shows , climate change deniers are all leaf and no plums
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 15th September 2009
Creationists and climate change deniers have this in common : they do n’t answer their critics .
They make what they say are definitive refutations of the science .
When these refutations are shown to be nonsense , they do not seek to defend them .
They simply switch to another line of attack .
They never retract , never apologise , never explain , just raise the volume , keep moving and hope that people wo n’t notice the trail of broken claims in their wake .
This means that trying to debate with them is a frustrating and often futile exercise .
It takes 30 seconds to make a misleading scientific statement and 30 minutes to refute it .
By machine - gunning their opponents with falsehoods , the deniers put scientists in an impossible position : either you seek to answer their claims , which ca n’t be done in the time available , or you let them pass , in which case the points appear to stand .
Many an eminent scientist has come unstuck in these situations .
This is why science is conducted in writing , where claims can be tested and sources checked .
So when the Australian geologist Professor Ian Plimer challenged me to a face - to - face debate in July ( 1 ) , I did n’t exactly leap at the chance .
His book Heaven and Earth , which purports to destroy the science of climate change , contains page after page of schoolboy errors and pseudoscientific gobbledegook .
As the professor of astrophysics Michael Ashley wrote , “ It is not ‘ merely ’ atmospheric scientists that would have to be wrong for Plimer to be right .
It would require a rewriting of biology , geology , physics , oceanography , astronomy and statistics . ” ( 2) But never , as far as I can determine , has Plimer responded to the devastating points made by his critics .
He just keeps shifting his ground .
None of this stopped the Spectator from publishing a cover story promoting his claims .
Plimer , the magazine suggested , has demonstrated that global warming theory is “ the biggest , most dangerous and ruinously expensive con trick in history ” ( 3 ) .
I wrote an article summarising what scientists have said about Plimer ’s claims and listing some of his obvious errors ( 4 ) .
In response , Plimer requested a debate .
The outgoing editor of the Spectator , Matthew D’Ancona , took up this cause , with a series of emails pressing me to accept ( all the correspondence is on my website ( 5,6 ) ) .
At first , having seen something of Plimer ’s debating tactics , I refused .
But then I realised that there might be a means of pinning him down .
I told Plimer that I would accept his challenge if he accepted mine : to write precise and specific responses to the questions I would send him , for publication on the Guardian ’s website .
If he answered them , the debate would go ahead ; if he did n’t , it would n’t happen .
The two exchanges would complement each other : having checked his specifics , people at the public event could better assess his generalisations .
Plimer refused .
After I wrote a blog post accusing him of cowardice , he accepted .
I sent him 11 questions ( 7 ) .
They were simple and straightforward : I asked him only to provide sources and explanations for some of the claims in his book .
Any reputable scientist would have offered them without hesitation .
But instead of answers , Plimer sent me a series of dog - ate - my - homework excuses and a list of questions of his own ( you can read both sets on my Guardian blog ( 8 ) ) .
While mine address only what Plimer purports to know , his appear designed to be impossible to answer : they are less questions than riddles .
Were you to take them seriously , every answer would require several years of original research .
Gavin Schmidt , a senior climate scientist at NASA , examined them and found that most are 24 - carat bafflegab , while the rest have already been answered by other means ( 9 ) .
But that was n’t the point .
Plimer ’s purpose appears to have been to distract attention from the fact that he can’t answer my questions .
Last Tuesday I offered Ian Plimer a £ 10 bet that he cannot answer his own questions .
He has not yet accepted .
Having put up with this nonsense for almost a month , I gave him a 10 - day deadline , after which I would assume that he had chickened out of our exchange and forfeited the debate ( 10 ) .
The deadline expired on Friday .
Answers came there none .
There is nothing unusual about Ian Plimer .
Most of the prominent climate change deniers who are not employed solely by the fossil fuel industry have a similar profile : men whose professional careers are about to end or have ended already .
Attacking climate science looks like a guaranteed formula for achieving the public recognition they have either lost or never possessed .
Such people will keep emerging for as long as the media is credulous enough to take them seriously .
What ’s odd is the readiness of publications like the Spectator to champion them .
During my correspondence with Matthew D’Ancona , I asked what it is about climate change that makes intelligent people like him abandon all editorial standards .
Why is he prepared to endorse Ian Plimer ’s claims , but not those of people who claim that the entire canon of lunar science is wrong and the moon is in fact made of green cheese ?
He replied as follows : “ All you say may well be true , which fortifies my belief that a debate would be fantastic ! ” ( 11 ) I pressed him again .
“ I think the answer , ” he replied “ may be that what I call mischievous – and it is part of the Spectator Editor ’s job description to be mischievous – you would call deeply immoral and grotesquely irresponsible .
The response to Plimer ’s piece – for and against – was passionate and cacophonous : exactly what I had hoped .
Again , that may not strike you as an excuse .
But perhaps it suffices as an explanation . ”
I told him that while the Spectator publishes noisy and provocative articles all the time , in most cases they are grounded in fact .
This article was grounded in gibberish .
So why climate change ?
Why is this issue uniquely viewed as fair game by editors who tread carefully around other scientific issues for fear of making idiots of themselves ?
And where is the mischief in doing what hundreds of publications and broadcasters have already done – claiming that manmade climate change is a myth ?
Surely to be mischievous you have to be original ?
D’Ancona replied “ I can only speak for myself and say that , as an editor , I do n’t single it out for loony treatment . ”
So I asked him for examples of loony articles he had published on other scientific matters .
He replied “ Well , MMR for a start where I supported Wakefield initially ! ” .
But when Andrew Wakefield first suggested that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism , it was an original claim which , while unsupported , had yet to be debunked .
Today we have 20 years of evidence , across tens of thousands of peer - reviewed papers , to show that people like Ian Plimer are talking out of their hats .
So Plimer wo n’t provide his sources and D’Ancona wo n’t explain why he singled out climate change .
But at least , after this frustrating episode , I have an answer to my questions : neither of them has a leg to stand on .

Matthias Ettrich with his shiny new medal .
Matthias Ettrich with his shiny new medal .
Today at 4 pm CET at the Center for Economics , Technology and Women ’s Issues at the Berlin Senate , KDE founder Matthias Ettrich was decorated with the German Federal Cross of Merit for his contributions to Free Software .
Matthias was awarded the medal in recognition of his work spurring innovation and spreading knowledge for the common good .
The award was presented by state secretary Almuth Nehring - Venus .
She mentioned that not only is Matthias among the younger recipients of the award but also that this is the first award ceremony where young children of the family were present .
Also attending was Eberhard Gienger , member of the Bundestag for the county Matthias grew up in .
Matthias started the KDE project on October 14 , 1996 with his now infamous email .
The project grew in leaps and bounds , creating one of the most active and innovative Free Software communities today , and helped redefine the expectations users have from free software in general .
Indirectly , the KDE community influenced the development of the whole Free Software ecosystem , shifting the focus from Unix as a server system to Unix as a powerful end - user desktop , pushing the boundaries until today .
The advance of Free Software depends so much on the interactions between the underlying infrastructure and the desktop that we think the award is well - deserved .
The Federal Cross of Merit is both the most prestigious as well as the only general decoration awarded by the Federal Republic of Germany .
It is awarded by the Federal President for outstanding achievements in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .
To Matthias , the award was such a surprise that he first considered the notification to be spam ...
After being decorated , his only question was : " So , now what is next ? "
Judging from his history , we think he 'll come up with something .
Congratulations , Matthias !
Most of those who have heard of the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw during World War II probably think of it in connection with the uprising of a small number of Jewish fighters prior to the final liquidation of the Ghetto by German forces .
Dr. Marek Edelman , who led the uprising , died last Friday at age 90 .
But before there was death , there was life .
The life of the Ghetto is recalled in fine detail in an astonishing 900 - page work of scholarship , “ The Warsaw Ghetto : A Guide to the Perished City ” by Barbara Engelking and Jacek Leociak , newly translated from the Polish and published by Yale University Press ( reviewed here and here ) .
The book relentlessly documents the horrors , the corruption and the tragic choices imposed by Ghetto life .
But it also brings new light to the ordinary human striving of Ghetto residents , their surprisingly rich life of the mind and the spirit , and their occasional moments of hopeless grace .

It is the wet dream of every kid who grew up playing Hurlyburly download.htm ” >
Microsoft Flight Simulator .
From the safety and comfort of Air Force bases in Nevada ( read : your angsty teenage bedroom with the Kurt Cobain poster in the corner ) , grounded pilots bomb insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan using unmanned aerial vehicles , known more menacingly as Predator Drones .
Gamers could not have come up with a more badass title .
A covert CIA drone program focuses on Pakistan , a country riddled with Taliban fighters and terrorists but no US troops .
President Obama has ordered as many drone attacks in Pakistan as Bush did in his last three years in office combined .
Approximately a third of drone attack casualties in Pakistan since 2006 were civilians , according to a report by the New American Foundation .
If that is what passes for “ surgical ” strikes these days , the C.I.A. may be in need of its brand of own health care reform .
In terms of public opinion , a surge in drone attacks is still preferable to one in US troops .
And by public opinion , I mean the apparent lack thereof when it comes to the ethics of drone attacks .
In this week ’s New Yorker Jane Mayer explains the illusion of “ costless ” war created by the use of these unmanned planes .
Pilots face the same risks and realities of war they did growing up playing IL - 2 , but with more satisfaction than a high score .
She argues , “ cut off from the realities of the bombings in Pakistan , Americans have been insulated from the human toll , as well as the political and moral consequences . ”
Mayer need only refer to David Rohde ’s compelling account of a drone attack , which he witnessed during his eight months stint as a Taliban hostage , to demonstrate its perceptible and unpleasant repercussions .
“ A stalemate between the United States and the Taliban seemed to unfold before me .
The drones killed many senior commanders and hindered their operations .
Yet the Taliban were able to garner recruits in their aftermath by exaggerating the number of civilian casualties …
The strikes also created a paranoia among the Taliban .
They believed that a network of local informants guided the missiles .
Innocent civilians were rounded up , accused of working as American spies and then executed . ”
In the absence of assailable Americans to wreak vengeance on , the Taliban is imagining enemies amongst the civilian population .
I am in no way suggesting that American soldiers should be the alternative target of aggrieved Taliban fighters , but the indirect impact means drone attacks certainly do n’t come cheap in terms of human lives .

It was another brilliantly sunny day for NASA astronaut Tom Jones .
In orbit on his fourth space shuttle mission in February 2001 , Jones was outside the International Space Station , installing a new laboratory module .
He remembers the moment with great clarity : Gerhard
Thiele , another astronaut , called from the ground to relay the news that the robotic NEAR Shoemaker probe had just made the first - ever landing on an asteroid , 433 Eros .
“ There I was , turning bolts on the ISS , ” says Jones .
“ I was thinking : What a cool job this is .
But how much cooler would it be if I were doing this on an asteroid ! ”
The idea that astronauts might visit an asteroid and explore it up close had long intrigued him .
Today , Jones is more convinced than ever that it would be a grand and worthwhile journey .
“ The asteroids , ” he says , “ are begging for a visit . ”
By “ the asteroids ” he does n’t mean one of the rocks circling out in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter , but something a lot closer to home : An Earth - crosser , or NEO ( near - Earth object ) .
A rogue .
Jones is part of an unofficial group of NASA actives and alums who have been studying , mostly on their own time , the particulars — engineering requirements , mission trajectories , scientific payoffs , and costs — of a human trip to an asteroid .
Like the Mars Underground , a larger group of enthusiasts who for the past 20 - plus years have been pushing for a voyage to Mars , the asteroid agitators are trying to build support for a mission .
The two groups are far from mutually exclusive : Plenty of Mars Undergrounders share the desire to see Constellation , NASA ’s human exploration program , send astronauts rock - hopping first .
The operational lessons learned from such an expedition would be crucial .
“ There ’s no way a Mars program could take shape without a crewed mission to an asteroid , ” says Jones .
Aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin , who , as head of the international advocacy group the Mars Society , is one of the leading proponents of an expedition to the Red Planet , likes the logic of a shakedown flight to an asteroid .
“ I think it ’s a valuable idea .
It would help validate the Constellation hardware within a meaningful time frame , ” he says .
“ Basically , it takes us farther out into space , and that ’s good .
Sort of like Columbus getting out there and saying , ‘ There are n’t dragons out here after all . ’ ”
Constellation ’s primary destinations are the moon and Mars , but the asteroid hopefuls are lobbying to insert a third stop in the itinerary .
For the record , NASA has no plans to send astronauts to a near - Earth object , and agency officials describe it as highly improbable given current budgets .
The Asteroid Underground is unfazed .
According to Jones ,
“ When you talk to an audience of taxpayers , they see the stepping stones : moon , asteroid , Mars . ”
The idea of a mission to an asteroid is not new .
In 1966 , Eugene Smith , an engineer with Northrop Space Laboratories , conducted a study for NASA on the use of Apollo hardware , including the giant Saturn V rocket , to carry six astronauts on a flyby of Eros .
The trip would have been scheduled for 1975 , when the asteroid came within 13 million miles of Earth , more than 50 times the distance to the moon .
The round trip would have been 500 days .
More recently , NEOs came to public attention in July 1994 , when the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 broke up and the pieces slammed into Jupiter , the largest packing a wallop equivalent to 400,000 times the power of the largest U.S. nuclear bomb ever exploded .
Anyone who read a newspaper that summer imagined the same thing happening to Earth , and within two years an international organization called the Spaceguard Foundation was established to coordinate the tracking of asteroids and comets that might collide with the home planet .

Scientists have developed plastic solar cells integrated with batteries and LEDs that could offer affordable lighting in developing areas .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Of the 1.5 billion people in developing countries who do not have electricity , many rely on kerosene lamps for light after the sun goes down .
But now , researchers from Denmark have designed an LED lamp that runs on solar cells , which costs less than one - quarter of the annual cost of using kerosene lighting .
The solar - LED lamps are expected to last at least a year , making them an affordable alternative to kerosene .
Frederik Krebs and other scientists at the Ris ?
National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy in Denmark have developed an inexpensive way to integrate solar cells , LEDs , and ultrathin lithium batteries to create a lamp that can produce reading - quality light .
The lamp 's polymer solar cells and circuitry are printed onto large flexible plastic films , and then the LEDs , flat batteries , and diodes are mounted using silver epoxy .
After being encapsulated in a second sheet of film , the sheets are rolled up and snapped together at the corners with metal fasteners .
The devices are very inefficient by today 's standards , capturing just 1 - 2 % of the energy that hits them .
Still , they 're cheap enough to be practical in some off - grid villages .
In rural areas of Africa , Asia , and Latin America , the average household spends $ 40 - $ 80 per year for kerosene lamps .
Even the cheapest solar - LED lighting devices on the market today cost about a year 's worth of kerosene , which would not be very advantageous .
But the total cost of the Denmark scientists ' solar - LED lamps is only about $ 27 , and they think they can manufacture an improved version for about $ 10 .
They estimate that using cheaper labor in China could reduce the cost again by as much as 50 % .
Last summer , the scientists field - tested 196 prototypes with the help of children who attended a Danish - run summer school in Zambia .
The results showed that some of the lamps had problems due to excessive flexing and light quality degrading after 10 to 20 minutes , which the scientists are fixing by repositioning the solar cells and adding circuitry to deliver power to the LEDs at a constant current .
The researchers plan to test improved versions of the lamps in Mali and Malawi .

Virtual private networking software from Cisco Systems , Juniper , and other manufacturers can make users susceptible to a variety of web - based attacks , the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team warned on Monday .
So - called clientless SSL VPN products , which provide browser - based access to intranets , email and other internal resources , expose users to attacks that allow eavesdroppers to view passwords and keystrokes .
Of the 90 companies known to market products that use the technology , Cisco , Juniper , SafeNet and Sonic Wall are known to be affected , while it 's unclear if an additional 77 are vulnerable .
The weakness can be exploited only in attacks that are narrowly targeted at a particular website or domain , so there 's not much chance of attack code going public that automates the process .
But given the wealth of proprietary information hiding behind the typical VPN , it can nonetheless be used by determined attackers to bypass a website 's authentication .
" It does look like a legitimate concern , " said independent hacker Chris Paget .
" I would be quite concerned if my site was working in the way described in the advisory .
It 's definitely a vulnerability and definitely something people should be aware of . "
Clientless SSL subverts what 's known as the same origin policy .
That 's the fundamental tenet of web security that forbids javascript , cookies and other content on one domain name from being available to a separate internet address .
Clientless SSL VPNs allow users to tunnel through a website that 's protected by secure sockets layer encryption when accessing webmail , intranets and other sites .
In the process , third - party hyperlinks and cookies are converted so they can be used by the VPN .
Attackers can cause the content to be altered in a way that allows session IDs used to authenticate users to be stolen or modified .
" By convincing a user to view a specially crafted web page , a remote attacker may be able to obtain VPN session tokens and read or modify content ( including cookies , script , or HTML content ) from any site accessed through the clientless SSL VPN , " the CERT advisory stated .
" This effectively eliminates same origin policy restrictions in all browsers . "
The technique can be used to subvert domain - based content restrictions in Internet Explorer security zones and the NoScript addon for Firefox .
There is no solution to the weakness , the advisory warns .
" Depending on their specific configuration and location in the network , these devices may be impossible to operate securely . "
Given the severity of the advisory , it would behoove clientless SSL VPN users to check with their supplier to find out if their particular implementation is vulnerable .
The issue was discovered by researchers David Warren and Ryan Giobbi , with help from Michael Zalewski .
The advisory is here . ®
From the moment he took the job heading the UN Human Rights Council 's mission to investigate human rights and international humanitarian law violations during the Gaza conflict , it was inevitable that Judge Richard Goldstone , born into a South African Jewish family , would be labelled a " self - hating Jew " and a Jewish antisemite .
Immediately on the release in September of his findings , which concluded that both Israel and Hamas had committed war crimes , Israel 's finance minister , Yuval Steinitz , could n't wait to make this accusation .
He certainly was n't alone .
The charge is so popular these days that people who use it must have felt as though they had won the lottery when they were presented with such a high - profile target like Goldstone .
They were probably still savouring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's outburst in August when he railed against the two senior and Jewish aides of President Obama , Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod , calling them " self - hating Jews " .
If anything finally shows up the concept as bogus and bankrupt , it should be the use of it against Goldstone .
Jewish self - hatred means rejecting everything about yourself that is Jewish because it is so hateful to you .
As a description of Goldstone , nothing could be further from the truth .
A life - long Zionist and a Governor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Goldstone believes bringing war criminals to justice stems from the lessons of the Holocaust and that the creation of Israel symbolised what the postwar human rights movement was all about .
But to those who level the accusation , the real degree of Jewish affiliation of the accused is irrelevant .
Now it 's quite obvious that calling someone a self - hating Jew in the context of the Israel - Palestine conflict is intended as a demeaning political insult , a way of delegitimising the views of Jews with whom you violently disagree .
But one of the reasons why the charge is so ubiquitous and is impervious to evidence and argument that proves it to be bogus is that it 's not just used as an epithet .
To some scholars and serious commentators , Jewish self - hatred is a proven psychopathological condition , an academically respectable category , and exponents of it can be found throughout history .
Their testimony helps to underpin the accusation .
Professor Robert Wistrich , who heads an antisemitism research centre at the Hebrew University , accepts the concept without question and taught a course on it .
Lord Sacks , Britain 's mainstream Orthodox Chief Rabbi , endorsing the concept in his last two books , says it was born in 15th - century Spain .
A recent convert to this way of thinking is David Aaronovitch , the Times and Jewish Chronicle columnist , who " discovered " that there was such a thing as a genuine self - hating Jew after encountering the virulently anti-Jewish writings of Otto Weininger , the brilliant young Viennese Jew who converted to Christianity in 1902 and killed himself a year later .
And Robin Shepherd , of the Henry Jackson Society , in a thoroughly wrong - headed book out this month subtitled Europe 's Problem With Israel , uses the concept to explain why leftwing Jews " publicly turn against Israel " .
This is sheer intellectual laziness , or an ideological or political predisposition dressed up in academic language , or both .
In fact , the way all of the key historical figures from the late 19th and early 20th centuries who are used to prove the existence of Jewish self - hatred – Weininger , Sigmund Freud , Karl Kraus , Heinrich Heine – related to their Jewishness has been shown to be far too complex to allow the self - hating Jew label to be anything other than a crude mis-characterisation .
Moreover , the perceived antisemitism in their writings was mirrored in the writings of Zionists , especially the founder of political Zionism Theodor Herzl .
He painted the weak ghetto Jew , in his 1897 essay " Mauschel " , as " a distortion of the human character , unspeakably mean and repellent " , interested only in " mean profit " .
Far from being the antithesis of Jewish self - hatred , it is arguable that Zionism was actually a display of it .
The Jewish self - hatred accusation assumes that there is a correct manner and degree to which people should express their Jewish identities in public ; and that there is a particular set of core values and institutions which one should favour .
Neither of these assumptions is justifiable on the basis of Jewish teachings or Jewish history .
The accusation also assumes that Jewishness " is or should be a primary identity " , and therefore to reject it or criticise it is somehow unnatural and wrong .
Yet , criticising an aspect of one 's identity does not automatically imply criticism of that identity per se .
Implied in the concept of Jewish self - hatred is the notion of a Jewish essence .
But the long history of the Jews – integral to which is conversion , assimilation , a wide variety of sometimes clashing Jewish identities , the understanding that Jewishness can be any one of or any combination of religion , ethnicity or culture – makes nonsense of such an idea .
Those who use the accusation sit in judgment on the Jewishness of others .
This might be understandable ( though insulting ) if you are , say , an Orthodox Zionist Jew .
But it 's clear that many prominent accusers are not of that persuasion .
They are , rather , people who would object very strongly to Orthodox rabbis sitting in judgment when they claim the right to determine who is a Jew .
When the self - hating Jew allegation is levelled at someone with the degree of integrity of Judge Goldstone , who takes such pride in his Jewishness , and is orchestrated by the Israeli government and prominent Jewish leaders and commentators , the ugly desperation of the accusers is laid bare .
Regrettably , given the appalling state of public debate about antisemitism and Israel - Palestine among Jews , no matter how clearly and how often the charge of Jewish self - hatred is shown to be nothing more than a political and personal insult that demeans the accuser and demonises the accused , it wo n't be going away any time soon .

By Traci Scott ,
Mothers and their newborns in an Oregon City church that practices faith healing routinely died during , before or shortly after birth because medical help was not sought .
The latest case was that of an infant boy who recently died due to the refusal of medical treatment by his parents .
This incident has brought to light the conflict over faith healing and the rights of children
According to KATU
News , the mother , who is a member of the Followers of Christ church , allegedly had complications before giving birth .
Church members prayed over her on a Friday night , and the baby was born Saturday afternoon .
But it died early Sunday morning .
The infant may have been premature .
Dr. Larry Lewman , from the state medical examiner ’s office , told KATU News of similar cases last year after 15 - month - old Ava Worthington died .
Her parents were arrested and her father Carl Worthington served 60 days in jail as a result of his conviction .
Her mother , Raylene , was acquitted of a mistreatment charge .
Lewman also studied the church in the late 1990s when three children died in a short amount of time .
“ There were also during that period – it was n’t publicized much – four perfectly healthy mothers , pregnant , who died during child birth from puerperal sepsis .
That ’s an infection that does n’t even occur today , ” Lewman told KATU News .
“ You read about it in the textbooks from the 1910s – the pre-antibiotic era .
None of these women should have died – three of their children died .
It was all perfectly treatable , and they literally suffered for days . ”
According to FactNews.org , there are several other churches that have made headlines for their faith healing practices .
The most notable is the Christian Science Church , where parents are unwilling to seek medical help for their children who have diseases or disorders that can be cured or overcome through modern medicine and medical care .
The Bible Reader Fellowship evangelical group , located in California , avoids medical treatment and fails to record births and deaths as required by law .
And members of End Time Ministries have exclusive belief in faith healing .
Not only do they reject medical treatment for children , but they also require unattended childbirth .
The right to refuse medical treatment based on religious grounds is recognized in most societies .
However , many have questioned whether this right can be taken too far .
Should religious beliefs replace or override medical procedures if the result may be the death of the individual ?
And more importantly , should a parent be allowed to obstruct traditional medical care when the health and well - being of a child is at stake ?
U.S. citizens are guaranteed freedom of religion by the First Amendment to the US Constitution , which prohibits any action by the U.S. Government that restricts “ the free exercise of religion ” .
When faced with a medical problem , an adult has several options , including seeking medical care , using faith healing in conjunction with medical care or pursuing no medical treatment at all .

For the past few years we ’ve seen a sea change on the question of U.S. relations with Israel , both in the U.S. and in the Jewish state .
In America , the idea that our " special relationship " with Tel Aviv dictates a policy of unconditional support has come under attack , not only from critics of Israel but also from some of its most passionate supporters .
In Israel , a wave of right - wing nationalism has installed a government viewed by many as extremist , and roiled relations with Washington .
The election of President Obama has exacerbated an estrangement that was already developing in George W. Bush ’s second term .
We are witnessing an anti-American trend such as has never before been seen in that country .
Obama may be almost as unpopular as the head of Hamas .
In the U.S. , this turn of events has caused many American Jews to have second thoughts , not only about the government of Israel but also its defenders here , who have uncritically supported its policies to the letter .
This evolutionary process has produced J Street , a vehicle for American Jews and their friends to advance a more reasonable agenda than that put forth by the traditional pro-Israel lobbying groups .
The occasion of J Street ’s first national conference , opening this week in Washington , has put the group at the center of a furious debate , one that often seems obscure to outsiders , i.e. , non-Jews .
After all , J Street ’s agenda is no more radical than that advanced by every American president since Jimmy Carter : a two - state solution , peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Arabs , and the tamping down if not the elimination of a conflict that has become a major detriment to U.S. interests in the region .
Yet the organization ’s very existence has caused a brouhaha of major proportions among those for whom Israel is an issue both political and deeply personal .
The reason for this controversy is simple : for many years , the pro-Israel community has conflated support for Israel with support for the policies of its government .
Back before the rise to power of such Israeli demagogues as Avigdor Lieberman , this was hardly ever a problem , though there were a few rough patches .
The sentiments of the American people were largely , almost reflexively pro-Israel , and the efforts of its government to ensure security in the face of what seemed from a distance to be a uniformly fanatical and violent Palestinian underground evoked much sympathy in the West .
More to the point , American Jews were not noticeably conflicted in their loyalty to the Zionist cause , which had started out as a liberal / progressive crusade for national self - determination .
As the power equation changed , however , and the unchallenged military and economic might of the Jewish state made it virtually unassailable by its Arab neighbors , the tide of public – and Jewish – opinion began to turn .
Growing revulsion on the part of many if not most American Jews against the reckless militarism and moral vacuity of Israeli government policies peaked during the recent Gaza " incursion , " in which thousands of defenseless Palestinians were killed and maimed [ . pdf ] – and the government seemed to glory in its own savagery .
This , following on the heels of yet another invasion of Lebanon , in which civilian targets such as churches , hospitals , and water facilities were bombed , was too much for many of Israel ’s American supporters to swallow .
J Street was born out of a desire to provide an alternative to the view that support for Israel has to mean – by definition – support for the policies of the Israeli government .
This would normally seem like an understandable and mostly positive development , but the word " normally " cannot apply in this instance , because no discussion of Israel is normal , these days .
There is so much emotion , mostly on the side of J Street ’s very vocal critics , that rational discussion is almost impossible .
This is a deliberate tactic employed by the Israel - is - always - right crowd : by calling the legitimacy of J Street as an organization with a credible agenda into question , right from the start , the Johnnie - one - notes , such as New Republic editor Marty Peretz , and the discredited neocons over at the Weekly Standard , get to define the terms of the debate .
Instead of talking about the rising extremism that is dominating the Israeli body politic and driving an increasing irrational policy of expansionism and perpetual war , we are talking about why J Street has Palestinian contributors and whether the participants in its scheduled " poetry slam " are too pro-Palestinian .
This peculiar atmosphere of inquisitorial hysterics is exemplified by an interview with J Street director Jeremy Ben Ami conducted by Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic .
The whole exchange has about it the air of an interrogation : the first question is not a question at all but a demand that Ben Ami " renounce " Stephen Walt , who has expressed some sympathy for the organization .
Ben Ami , to his credit , demurs , adding :
" One of the reasons why I wo n’t answer your call to quote - unquote renounce him is that it really smacks of witch - hunts and thought - police .
It ’s not my business to ‘ renounce . ’ "
Renounce this , renounce that , and pretty soon you ’ve renounced your way out of existence : Ben Ami clearly understands this , and is having none of it .
He does n’t agree with Walt or his co-author , John Mearsheimer , who have written a book about the Israel lobby and how it has managed to distort U.S. foreign policy .
He makes this unmistakably clear , yet Goldberg is unrelenting .
The topic takes up a good third of the interview , going on for paragraphs : " Tell me , " Goldberg demands , " about the problem with [ Walt ’s ] thesis " !
This whole concept of renunciation of deviationists brings to mind the intellectual and political hysteria that characterized the " Red Decade " of the 1930s , when American leftists were relentlessly hectored by Stalin and his followers to denounce the Trotskyists as agents of Hitler and the Mikado .
The similarities are structural , and striking : the Communist Party was , in fact , an agent of a foreign power , just as the Old Guard of the Israel lobby is today .
As such , it had to hew to a particular line and defend a very specific set of policies , i.e. , those formulated by whoever was in power in the Kremlin .
This meant that you could n’t just support the cause in general , while dissenting on this or that matter of secondary importance : the defense of the " workers ’ fatherland " had to be taken up by a united front , and solidarity with the Soviet Union meant , in practice , solidarity with its government .
Consequently , the Soviets used the American Communists as their American amen corner .
When the Kremlin announced a new policy , the party duly saluted , no questions asked , and energetically began a campaign to sell it to the American people .
The same pattern holds for pro-Israel groups in the U.S. , which , unlike the Communists , are not united in a single organization , but which are nonetheless part and parcel of the same movement , one that , historically , has spoken pretty much in a single voice .
As Grant F. Smith has shown in his extensive research , the Israeli government directly sponsored and funded earlier efforts to lobby on behalf of Israel , just as Moscow ’s gold poured into Communist coffers in this country .
Any criticism of the Israeli government has been taken , in these circles , as an attack on the Jewish state ’s very existence .
The small – and , now , much smaller – Israeli peace movement was ( and is ) seen as the Enemy , objectively aligned with the Palestinians and their Arab state patrons .
The emergence of J Street as an alternative voice is , in part , a generational shift .
The idea that Israel is a refuge for a group of people that is likely to suffer a pogrom at any given moment seems the stuff of fantasy to American Jews who reached voting age in Barack Obama ’s America .
They identify as un-hyphenated Americans and view Israel as a foreign country – one that does n’t always live up to their own moral standards .
And they are n’t afraid to say so , not just in private , but on the public stage .
As an American president puts pressure on Tel Aviv to moderate its extremist policies , mitigate its militarism , and make some meaningful concessions as the price of our generous support , these American Jews are asking why the Israeli government continues on its suicidal course .
The founding of J Street gives them a voice , which is precisely why the dinosaurs of AIPAC , the Anti-Defamation League , and the extremists over at the Zionist Organization of America are beside themselves .
The trump card of the Israel lobby has always been the often bogus charge of anti-Semitism .
Whenever a critic of the Israeli government dares to write a book , you can bet it will be compared to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion – no matter how reasonable , how accommodating to the Zionist project , or how often the author denounces anti-Semitism .
A spy is caught handing U.S. secrets to Israel , and within 24 hours a conspiracy theory positing a vast anti-Semitic cabal within the FBI is dutifully concocted .
A U.S. president asks Tel Aviv to stop building " settlements " on Palestinian land , and he is immediately confronted with the charge of being a " secret Muslim . "
J Street deprives the Lobby of its trump card by destroying the fiction that the latter speaks for all Americans of Jewish descent .
Heck , I do n’t believe the Old Guard speaks for even so much as 30 percent , yet it has the loudest voices and the biggest budgets .
Well , that wo n’t last , because it cannot last .
J Street ’s bravery in confronting the problem of how Israel survives against all demographic odds is admirable , and one can only hope their brand of cool realism soothes the fevered brow of a movement in crisis .
American Zionism is currently undergoing a crisis of conscience , one that pits sympathy for the Jewish state against the historical Jewish sense of social justice .
In his deliberately insulting interrogation of Ben Ami , Goldberg demands to know : " Are you a Zionist ? "
From what I can tell , what Ben Ami and a whole new generation of American Jews are saying is the following :
Yes to a Jewish homeland , no to a militaristic garrison state .
Yes to security , no to " settlements . "
Yes to Yitzhak Rabin , no to Avigdor Lieberman .
If Goldberg does n’t like it , he can lump it .
There was a contretemps over the invitation to Israeli ambassador Michael Oren to address the J Street conference , and in the end Oren said no .
This was made a very big deal of by the Old Guard , which chortled gleefully that the young upstart had been put in its place .
But Oren is really doing the new organization a big favor by not coming : his absence gives them the opportunity to distance themselves from the policies of a government that has become increasingly indefensible .
J Street is a heroic attempt to separate the idea of Israel from those who have usurped its government and are now in the process of undermining its very existence .
Oren represents a regime that has arguably committed war crimes and is not only unapologetic but seemingly proud that it has violated moral norms observed by all civilized countries .
Oren ’s presence at a conference dedicated to pushing for peaceful solutions to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict would have added nothing but a note of contention to the event .
The canard that to be an American Jew is to adhere to a dual loyalty was never true and not very convincing , at least to me , yet I get letters all the time from crazies railing on about Zionist control of the U.S. government and how " they " wo n’t let " the truth " come out because " they " control the government , the media , and the weather .
I ca n’t communicate how tiresome I find this nonsense ; suffice to say that I ’m surprised anyone outside of an insane asylum could believe such things .
Yet they exist in surprising numbers .
Go to any comment thread about Israel , no matter what the context , and you ’re sure to find this view represented .
J Street refutes this canard , because they break the traditional mold of the pro-Israel lobbying community : there is no party line , and certainly not one laid down by Tel Aviv .
In short , they are looking out for American interests , in tandem with their support for Israel , and do n’t see themselves as agents of a foreign power – because they are n’t .
No , I do n’t agree with all of J Street ’s official positions , but that ’s not the point .
What J Street represents is glasnost on the foreign policy front , an opening up of the discussion , especially as it pertains to the U.S. - Israeli relationship .
That alone is cause for celebration .

Continuing clockwise to the lower right panel , we once again telescope outward , and now the entire planetary part of the solar system has shrunk to a small set of concentric circles at one of the foci of Sedna 's highly elliptical orbit .
Then , telescoping outward again into the lower left and final panel , we see Sedna 's orbit reduced to a tiny ellipse within the inner extent of the Oort Cloud .
The Oort Cloud - consisting mainly of comets and other small , icy bodies with extraordinarily long - period orbits - has poorly - defined boundaries , and it it considered a possibility that these clouds intersect between stars .
Oort Cloud objects may therefore end up transferring from star to star over long time periods , or be thrown into the inner solar system .

Women who had given birth before or after developing MS were 34 % less likely to become seriously disabled Giving birth seems to slow the progression of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , Belgian and Dutch researchers say .
The researchers tracked 330 women with MS for 18 years and found that among those who had children , severe disability took longer to develop .
Writing in the Journal of Neurology , Neurosurgery and Psychiatry , they say previous studies have suggested a worsening of MS just after birth .
But the MS Society said the study was flawed and further research was needed .
MS is a long - term inflammatory condition of the central nervous system .
It affects the transfer of messages from the nervous system to the rest of the body .
Women are twice as likely to develop MS as men and many of the new cases will be among women of childbearing age .
It is difficult to form any meaningful conclusions from this research given the small size of the study and its flaws , but further studies will hopefully clarify the effects of pregnancy in women with MS
Dr Susan Kohlhaas , MS Society
The researchers from Belgium and the Netherlands said all the women had been referred to one specialist centre and had had their first symptoms from the ages of 22 to almost 38 .
Nearly a quarter of the women ( 24 % ) were childless ; 170 had given birth before their symptoms developed ( 52 % ) ; 61 had their children after their symptoms developed ( 18 % ) ; and 19 had had children both before and afterwards ( 6 % ) .
' Speed of progression '
The researchers used the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) which runs from one to 10 , where 10 is death from MS and six is when an individual needs a cane , a crutch or a brace to walk 100m .
After an average of 18 years living with MS , over half the women ( 55 % ) were categorised as EDSS six .
They found that both the likelihood and speed of progression were affected by childbirth .
Women who had given birth to one or more children at any point before or after the start of MS symptoms were 34 % less likely to progress to EDSS six than childless women .
Women whose children had been born after their MS began were 39 % less likely to progress to EDSS six than women who had not had children .
They said this held true even after taking account of the age at which symptoms began .
Women who had no children after their MS symptoms started progressed to EDSS six within 13 to 15 years on average .
But women who did have children took an average of 22 to 23 years to reach this stage .
' Beneficial effect ' Dr Maria D'hooghe , from the National MS Centre in Melsbroek , Belgium , which co-ordinated the study , said it had shown for the first time the long - term effects of having a baby if you have MS .
She said : " It 's possible that the hormones released in pregnancy are having a beneficial effect on the immune system .
" Certainly , animal studies show that pregnancy can lead to less damage in their brains .
" The other possibility is that it is lifestyle changes caused by having a baby that are delaying the effects of MS perhaps through increased activity or changes in the way we deal with stress . "
But Dr Susan Kohlhaas , research communications officer for the MS Society , said it was a small study and they had not taken account of the fact that women with more severe MS may choose not to get pregnant because they are worried about a relapse or about taking care of a baby during a relapse .
She said : " It is difficult to form any meaningful conclusions from this research given the small size of the study and its flaws , but further studies will hopefully clarify the effects of pregnancy in women with MS . "

It is described by its architects as a cocoon .
Actually , it is more like a gargantuan pebble , or even the smoothly plastered nose of a Jumbo jet encased , much like Damien Hirst 's shark , in a vast glass display case in London 's Cromwell Road .
How apt that the new £ 78 m wing of the Darwin Centre at the Natural History Museum , which opens to the public on 15 September , manages to suggest something evolving yet not quite identifiable .
But that 's precisely the point of this surprisingly self - effacing building , whose carefully tailored minimalism is not so much striking as pale and interesting .
The museum 's Danish architects , CF Moller , may speak confidently of their new " icon " in South Kensington but , thankfully , it is nothing of the kind .
Compared to the museum 's original 2002 extension , the new wing stands deferentially next to the ornate haunch of its Grade I - listed Victorian terracotta tower .
Inside , deference evaporates in a faintly surreal realm , in which potential architectural melodrama is coolly redeemed by the matt ivory stucco lucida covering the 60 m - long pebble .

This host organism for the new wing 's exhibition spaces , rising 30 m up through the atrium , is both a mystery and a triumph : how can the biggest , curved sprayed - concrete structure in Europe look weightless ?
There 's nothing mysterious about the result , though – this is a new kind of science experience in which the pursuit of research becomes more or less public property .
" Many people love the Natural History Museum for its iconic Victorian building , " said Neil Greenwood , programme director for the Darwin Centre .
" However , through the Darwin Centre , we wanted to challenge this traditional perception and highlight the work of our scientists , and the importance of our collections . "
Paul Bowers , director of the new wing 's public spaces , added : " We wanted an exquisite shell that 's beautiful to flow through . "
The building 's lead designer , Anna Maria Indrio , says that the new building " has completely changed the Natural History Museum 's relationship with the site , from being an introvert to an extrovert building . "
Surely not .
Alfred Waterhouse 's original architecture has always been a riveting and distinctly outré mélange of star turns and engrossing detail .
There is absolutely nothing shy about the 19th - century architecture , or its interiors .
Ms Indrio is , however , right to suggest that images of the pebble will become a new brandmark for the museum .
But as the building 's pale , set - piece architectural moment can be seen only faintly through the glass façade of the atrium , this brandmark is anything but extrovert architecture – and all the better for it .
The Darwin Centre 's new wing was designed at the same time as the doomed V&A Spiral , created by Daniel Libeskind and Cecil Balmond .
Unlike the architecturally radical Spiral , Moller 's " quiet " architecture managed to attract the necessary funding from the Heritage Lottery , the Wellcome Trust and a phalanx of private donors .
The simplicity of the pebble and its exhibition route is matched by the new clarity it brings to the way the Darwin Centre 's 220 scientists can now move between the old and new buildings , and into a doubled amount of laboratory space .
From next Tuesday , inquisitive members of the public will be able to rise seven storeys in sparkling glass lifts to get into the pebble , before descending in batches of about 200 at a time to follow a trail of discovery laid out for them inside .
They will glimpse a fraction of the 20 million entomological and botanical specimens filed away in 3.3 km of temperature and humidity controlled " compaction " cabinets in the lower segment of the structure .
But they will see scientists at work and , sometimes , be able to quiz tweezering boffins through glass panels fitted with two - way microphones .
Somehow , given the contemporary trend to present art or science as a blur of faintly trivial entertainment , the Darwin Centre 's new wing is not packed with interactive kit .
On the other hand , it is well chosen , generously spaced out , and mounted in such a way that it conveys a sense of seriously pursued discovery – unlike the new wing 's Attenborough Studio , a vividly over - the - top lecture space whose pentagram - designed fibreglass seating evokes a Star Wars briefing room .
Tomorrow evening sees a high - profile counter - punch by the Royal Society against creationists .
Leading genetics professor Steve Jones will deliver an unambiguous defence of Darwin 's theory , “ Why Creationism is Wrong and Evolution is Right ” at the learned society 's London HQ .
Prof Jones has written several popular science books about evolution , including the re-telling of The Origin of the Species , Almost Like a Whale .
For those who can't make it down , or get turned away by the bouncers , the Royal Society 's web chief has contacted The Reg with news that the event will be webcast live .
See here for details .
For the super - organised , there 's a calendar reminder here too .
If you can't manage that either , The Reg will be there on your behalf .
The lecture is set to be accompanied by a broader media offensive .
The Royal Society 's Fellows will throw their combined brain - weight behind a stout point - by - point rejection of creationism 's tenets .
The intervention comes in response to creationism creeping onto the educational agenda in the UK .
Let the bun fight commence . ®
