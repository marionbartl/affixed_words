Audio :
The law , science , and now HIV .
At this point we do n't even trust that her name 's Regina Griggs
by Jeremy Hooper
We 've already told you how the recent legal " win " that the PFOX organization has been crowing about for the past few months is anything but .
Our pal Timothy Kincaid wrote a great assessment of it for Box Turtle Bulletin :
And , most importantly , the judge found that it is perfectly reasonable for the NEA to exclude PFOX .
Because the NEA did not exclude them for being ex-gay , but rather because they have a disruptive political agenda that is contrary to that of the NEA .
The NEA did not reject its application because PFOX ’s members include exgays , homosexuals , heterosexuals , or members of any other sexual orientation .
Rather , NEA rejected PFOX ’s application because PFOX ’s message and policies were , in NEA ’s opinion , contrary to NEA ’s policies regarding sexual orientation .
...
So PFOX lost .
And their only “ victory ” was one that most gay folk would be willing to concede : that ex-gays should not be subject to discrimination just for being ex-gay but ex-gay political groups can be excluded because of their message .
FULL : PFOX Declares Victory in Court Defeat [ BTB ]
Essentially , the courts found that " ex - gay " people cannot be discriminated against , in general , because they identify as " ex- gay . "
And we are the first to say both " GOOD ! " and " DUH ! " on that one .
" Good , " because none of us want to see anyone discriminated against for any reason ; " Duh , " because it 's a no - brainer that " ex- gays " cannot be targeted anymore than someone who thinks that they 've changed into a piece of cornbread .
No gay activist wants a target on " ex - gay " people as people .
But far be it for the professional " ex- gays " to look at a legal ruling in a rational , deeply considered way .
Far be it to understand the truth of the reason why we , like credible science , resist their movement .
Instead , they go on programs where the hosts will buy their ridiculous claim that they gay community is fearful of the " ex- gay " community , swallow their " thousands of ex-homosexuals " rhetoric wholesale , and negligently accept their INSANELY INACCURATE and HIGHLY OFFENSIVE claims that " 71 % of men having sex with men are HIV positive . "
Enjoy :
If you made it through the whole thing , we have to commend you .
If you made it through without simultaneously laughing / throwing things at your computer , then you have the fortitude of Gandhi 's more patient , zen cousin !
Oh , and as for Regina 's insane lie of an AIDS figure is a bastardization of a 2007 CDC report ?
In actuality , the report says this :
In the United States , HIV infection and AIDS have had a tremendous effect on men who have sex with men ( MSM ) .
MSM accounted for 71 % of all HIV infections among male adults and adolescents in 2005 ( based on data from 33 states with long - term , confidential name - based HIV reporting ) , even though only about 5 % to 7 % of male adults and adolescents in the United States identify themselves as MSM
So what the report says is that of HIV infections among males in 2005 , 71 % were MSM .
THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS SAYING THAT 71 % OF GAY MEN ARE HIV POSITIVE !!!!!!!!!
AT ALL .
Whether out of her own ignorance or a deliberate disregard for data , Regina Griggs is lying through her " ex- gay " loving teeth !
And it also should be noted that worldwide , MSM account for a drastically small number of HIV / AIDS cases .
So while it may be convenient for David Barton and cohorts to use Regina 's unfathomably insane figure to say that this " is the laws of nature telling you this ain't right , " we have to wonder why , exactly , they also see their God as hating so many of the world 's heteros !
Disturbing from start to finish .
Your thoughts
Doing a little number play :
We know the U.S. population is 330 Million .
So say we choose 6 % gay overall , we get 19,800,000 .
Divide in half because we want to get the men only and we end up with 9,900,000 gay men .
So if HIV infections affect 71 % of the 9.9 million , it means 7,029,000 are infected .
Something is a little wrong with the 71 % number .
I think someone pulled it out of their ass .
The CDC puts the number living with HIV / AIDS in the U.S. at 571,378 .
From the CDC report there are 22,472 Male - Male infections reported per year .
Out of 9.9 million that comes out to about two tenths of one percent .
Someone is telling an obvious fib .

I see that the audio clip is from David Barton 's WallBuilders outfit .
The average person might assume that the name " WallBuilders " might refer to Jefferson 's " wall of separation " between church and state .
The reality is just the opposite - actually , they promote theocracy .
Barton may be this country 's leading historical revisionist promoting Christian Nation theory .
According to their website , here is the reason they chose the name WallBuilders : " In the Old Testament book of Nehemiah , the nation of Israel rallied together in a grassroots movement to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and thus restore stability , safety , and a promising future to that great city .
We have chosen this historical concept of " rebuilding the walls " to represent allegorically the call for citizen involvement in rebuilding our nation 's foundations .
As Psalm 11:3 reminds us , " If the foundations be destroyed , what shall the righteous do ? "
I also noticed the audio 's musical intro uses the words " liberty " and " freedom . "
The average person may not realize that when theocratic Christians use those words they mean THEIR God ordained authority to use THEIR liberty and THEIR freedom to dominate everyone else .

Oh I see what they did .
They took the CDC total .
But it is definitely out of sync when you match it against the estimate of the number of gay or bisexual men in the U.S .
Posted by : Tony P | Oct 21 , 2009 2:41:14 PM
Tony :
No , see , the CDC figure says that 71 % of 2005 infections were gay men , not that 71 % of gay men have HIV / AIDS .
Regina flipped the script .
Make sense ?

I suspect that they are using some lie like ' there are 50,000 members of PFOX ' , and conflating that lie into the even bigger lie that there are 50,000 ex-gays .
With the lying liars , no lie is too big .
And ... 250 groups of ex-gays in the SF Bay Area ???
The PFUX website only shows two PFOX groups ( ?? ) in California , and none in the Bay Area .
They are probably counting every single church in the area , and conflating that into a colossal lie as well .
And , if these guys are any indication , then 71 % of all lying liars are on the radio !
But I do like their seque music .. almost makes you forget that you are listening to homophobic , hatemongering liars .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Oct 21 , 2009 3:01:14 PM
Tony , on the CDC site , they also show that well over half of the 571,378 cases are not MSM .
A fact that dare - not - speak - it 's - name in the ranks of the lying liars as well .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Oct 21 , 2009 3:20:12 PM
It 's critically dangerous all over again to misrepresent HIV infections as a gay man 's issue .
It was no surprise to me that new infections also affect HETEROSEXUAL blacks and Latinos ( traditionally disenfranchised minorities as well ) at similar rates to those MSM .
Griggs and Co as typical scare mongering leverage , utilize gay male only focus when it comes to convincing young gay men to change their orientation .
It was the hetero population being convinced that gay males were the only ones who were at risk and the only ones spreading the infection , that also led to black women and men in particular , believing THEY had nothing to fear from unprotected sex .
And it 's cost lives for that irresponsible misreporting from the homophobes out there .
Apparently not Griggs , nor the FRC or FOTF has studied the parallels of HIV / AIDS and marginalized minorities .
There is much to be said about lack of access to sex ed , comprehensive information and preventive measures against STD 's in inner cities because there is so little caring for said minorities .
There can be , and with good reason , distrust of the medical and psychiatric establishment BY minorities because of well established and documented abuses .
Tuskeegee Experiment anyone ?
To name just one .
In any case , this distortion of figures is unforgivable .
I have a few points to make about the typical ways that people like Griggs , ex gay advocates and so on , can be so contradictory .
1 . Heterosexuality is no cure , or natural immunity mechanism against HIV / AIDS .
Therefore , why should anyone with a brain expect that suddenly having sex with the opposite sex is an effective shield against the infection ?
Testing is advisable whether you 're gay or not .
So is using a condom .
2 . People who are celibate do n't procreate either .
Although faith based opinion is that gay sex is a sin .
A greater concern is either gay people abstain from sex altogether , or that gay sex cannot produce children .
Whether you 're gay or not , abstinance or celibacy does n't produce children .
So what does it matter WHAT orientation you are ?
I really , really , REALLY hate it that such prejudice lowers IQ's or that PFOX believes who they are talking to can be so stupid ... or innocent and naive .
And the innocent and naive would be exactly why they want to target and influence school children and their educators .

Le sigh .
The whole 71 % of gay men/71 % of men with HIV thing is 9th grade math .
Logic , you know . . .
I find it hard to believe that not a single one of them passed 9th grade math . . .
Posted by : Charra | Oct 21 , 2009 6:15:21 PM
Regan , that 's what 's so outrageous about this .
It 's not just that they 're trying to fudge the numbers on HIV in order to smear gay men .
As bad as that itself is , their deceptions also help propagate the notion that HIV is only a problem in the gay community , which is demonstrably not the case and is a very dangerous perception for the public to have .
The fact is , people of either gender who have unprotected sex with men are more at risk of getting the disease than those having sex with women because men are the ones more likely to transmit it through sexual contact .
So yes , men are more likely to contract the virus through sex with men than through sex with women .
And women are more likely to contract the virus through sex with men than through sex with women .
So if HIV is an argument against men forming same - sex relationships , it is equally an argument for women forming same - sex relationships !
Not only are they lying about the statistics , but they 're using their lies to back up an inherently illogical argument .

In the predawn hours Friday , while those on the West Coast still snooze , a rocket is scheduled to punch a 13 - foot - deep hole in a crater at the moon ’s south pole that has n’t seen sunlight in billions of years .
The purpose : to find out whether ice lies hidden there .
NASA ’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , which set out for the moon in June , made a late - course correction Tuesday to better position itself to steer the rocket into the 2 - mile - deep crater Cabeus at 4:30 a.m. PDT on Friday .
Four minutes later , if all goes according to plan , the spacecraft will fly through the cloud of debris that will rise above the lunar surface and linger there briefly .
As it passes through the cloud , the satellite ’s nine instruments will analyze the dust and debris for evidence of water , before crashing itself .
Back on Earth , amateur astronomers from Colorado to Silicon Valley are expected to turn their telescopes to the celestial show , even though it will last less than a minute .
Advertisement
Scientists preparing for the collision could hardly contain their excitement over what might turn up in that short time .
“ The spacecraft is looking great .
I do n’t think we could miss the moon now if we tried , ” said Steve Hixson , vice president of Advanced Concepts at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach , which built the craft .
“ It ’s our job to confirm there is water there , ” said Dan Andrews , the project manager at Ames Research Center in Mountain View , Calif. , which designed the spacecraft instruments .
“ But even if it ’s very dry , that ’s a good answer to have . ”
The LCROSS satellite was originally a $ 79 - million add - on to the larger , $ 500 - million Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , whose mission is to map the moon .
But the theatrical nature of the impact event has caught the public ’s attention .
Advertisement
Thousands are expected to show up Thursday night at the Ames complex south of San Francisco for an evening of music and movies that will culminate with a live video feed of the impact .
“ It ’s kind of hard to keep on top of how much interest there is out there , ” Andrews said .
“ I ’ve heard 10,000 are coming . ”
1999 discovery
For decades after the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s , scientists considered the moon to be little more than a dry wasteland .
Advertisement
But in 1999 , NASA ’s Lunar Prospector mission found evidence of hydrogen , a possible indicator of water , in permanently shadowed craters at both poles .
Since then , other spacecraft have detected the same thing , leading scientists to wonder whether large stores of ice billions of years old are hidden in craters that never get sunlight .
According to scientists , water on the moon would be as valuable as gold .
Not only would it be useful to drink , should President Obama continue former President George W. Bush ’s ambitious plan to build a lunar base there after 2020 , but it could be broken down to make breathable air and even rocket fuel .
Transporting water to the moon , on the other hand , would cost $ 50,000 a pound .
The crater - observing satellite launched June 18 attached to a second spacecraft , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Shortly after launch , the two separated .
Advertisement
The orbiter continued on to begin a yearlong mission to map the moon in search of landing sites for future lunar colonists .
The sensing satellite went into a long , looping orbit around the Earth to line itself up for Friday ’s impact .
Originally , spacecraft controllers had chosen a nearby crater , Cabeus A , as the target .
But last week , they decided it was n’t as good a potential source for water as Cabeus , a 60 - mile - wide valley near the moon ’s south pole .
Andrews said satellite controllers were aiming for a spot in the northwest region of the crater , where temperatures of minus 397 degrees Fahrenheit would ensure that any water would be frozen as hard as rock .
Advertisement
The Centaur rocket that will hit the crater is the upper stage of the Atlas V that launched both spacecraft in June .
Having used its fuel , it is now a 5,200 - pound projectile .
About 10 hours before Friday ’s impact , the rocket will separate from the satellite and head directly for the crater .
Meanwhile , the satellite will maneuver itself into position to fly through the debris kicked up when the rocket crashes .
According to NASA , the rocket will be traveling about 5,600 miles per hour when it plunges into Cabeus .
That will create a dust cloud rising as much as six miles above the lunar surface , providing a rare show for amateur astronomers with telescopes 10 inches or larger .
Advertisement
The collision can theoretically be seen throughout the Southwest and as far away as Hawaii , providing the observer has a large enough telescope at hand and good viewing conditions .
Mountaintops and valleys with little or no ambient artificial light are the best places to go .
Because the debris cloud is expected to last less than a minute before settling back down on the lunar surface , viewers need to be punctual and have sharp eyes .
Palmdale gathering
Locally , the Antelope Valley Astronomy Club is hosting a viewing party at the Sage Planetarium at Cactus Intermediate School in Palmdale .
Advertisement
Members will set up telescopes outside , while NASA ’s broadcast of the event will be shown inside .
Scientists think the lunar water , if it ’s there , arrived the same way it did on Earth : through billions of years of bombardment by water - rich comets and meteors .
Any water that was deposited in sunlit places would quickly be lost to the moon ’s scorching daytime heat , which can reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit .
But in shadowed craters , the water could remain as ice for eons .
Bernard Foing , the project scientist for the European Smart - 1 spacecraft that took pictures of the crater several years ago , said the floor of Cabeus contained a number of small craters that appeared old enough to have trapped water from comets and water - rich asteroids .
Advertisement
Andrews said it could be days or weeks after the impact before scientists conclude that there is , or is not , water at the pole .
Besides the crater - observing spacecraft , observatories around the world will be watching , along with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter .
If the satellite does n’t find water , that would n’t be definitive proof it ’s not there .
Besides mapping instruments , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter carries instruments that can search for evidence of water as it skims 30 miles above the lunar surface in the coming months .
Several weeks ago , research teams reported evidence that tiny amounts of water exist on the surface in some areas of the moon .
But that is likely too little to be of practical use for future colonists .

The president 's home city has been knocked out in the first round of the vote to choose the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games , even though he and the First Lady travelled to Copenhagen to push the bid .
A humiliation , a moment of moment or a fact devoid of political meaning ?
I have no doubt some hostile commentators will argue the former .
The argument had already been doing the rounds that he should concentrate on the big stuff , and not on such trivia .
But that position has already been undermined .
He used his European trip to have a meeting in the front of Air Force One with Gen Stanley McChrystal , the top military man in Afghanistan .
So not a wasted journey .
It is surely the president 's duty to push as hard as possible for an event to be held in his country , when most think it will bring jobs and regeneration .
It would have been a dereliction to have sat in the White House , leaving it to his wife .
But it perhaps reveal the limits of charisma , the boundaries of Brand Obama .
There is no doubt he is still hugely revered in the rest of the world , even if his support has slipped at home .
If he is still a spellbinding superstar , this time the magic touch did not work .
You could argue the president has a history of relying too much on his own personal intervention to solve problems , rather than using it as the final touch on top of a detailed political strategy .
That certainly seems to have happened with the healthcare debate .
But perhaps the Olympic judges are not swayed by the last minute arguments , and this reality TV with world leaders is just so much showbiz .
The winning city itself may be more compelling than passionate pleading from a superstar .

With the U.S. economy on the ropes and America by far the world 's biggest debtor , investors are n't feeling as secure about the dollar as they used to .
Whodunit ?
Sneak attack on U.S. dollar
It ’s the biggest mystery in global finance right now :
Who conducted a sneak attack on the U.S. dollar this week ?
It began with a thinly sourced but highly explosive report Monday in a British newspaper : Arab oil sheiks are conspiring with the Russians and Chinese to quit using the dollar to set the value of oil trades — a direct threat to the global supremacy of the greenback .
Advertisement
Is it true ?
Everyone from the head of the Saudi central bank to U.S. officials scrambled to undercut the story , but no matter .
With the U.S. economy on the ropes and America by far the world ’s biggest debtor , investors are n’t feeling as secure about the dollar as they used to .
And the notion of second - tier economies ganging up on Uncle Sam did n’t sound so far - fetched .
For American officials , the possibility of the dollar losing its long - term dominance in global commerce is a nightmare scenario because it would likely mean sharply higher interest rates at home and a declining ability to finance the U.S. debt .
No one believes it could really happen right now , but stories like the British report this week make it seem incrementally more likely .
So the piece by Robert Fisk of the Independent shocked currency traders around the world and almost instantly sent the value of the U.S. dollar spiraling downward and the price of gold skyrocketing to an all - time high , as a hedge against a weakened dollar .
The website drudgereport.com quickly amplified the impact of the story with a headline atop the site : ARAB STATES LAUNCH SECRET MOVES WITH CHINA , RUSSIA , FRANCE TO STOP USING DOLLAR FOR OIL TRADING ...
“ You read that story , and you do two things :
You sell the hell out of dollars and you buy gold , ” said Les Alperstein , president of the financial research firm Washington Analysis .
“ The story has a lot of credibility , with some caveats . ”
So who wanted dollars diving and gold rising ?
In other words , who is Fisk ’s source , and why did he or she want to tank the dollar ?
It ’s the global currency version of the old Washington parlor game of speculating on the real identity of Deep Throat .
No one knows .
But one thing is for certain :
With the price of gold jumping to $ 1,048.20 per ounce , traders who moved early enough stood to make millions .
So in government circles in Washington , speculation immediately centered on gold traders :
With the skyrocketing price of gold , they ’d be the biggest beneficiaries of the article .
Fisk ’s story itself is n’t much help in solving the mystery — it is sourced vaguely to “ Gulf Arab and Chinese banking sources in Hong Kong , ” and it included one blind quote , attributed to “ a prominent Hong Kong broker . ”
That does n’t narrow down the pool very much .
The story does n’t name any officials who had allegedly participated in the secret meetings involving the Arab states .
It did n’t say where the meetings occurred or when .
Other than saying the plan is to stop using the dollar by 2018 , there was precious little detail to the account .
Around the world , traders turned to Wikipedia to find out more about Fisk himself .
There , they learned that Fisk is a legendary British foreign correspondent who has been based in Beirut for more than 30 years and has won a slew of journalism awards .
They also learned that he is one of only a few journalists to have interviewed Osama bin Laden ( three times ) and that he has expressed doubts that the United States has told the full story about the Sept. 11 attacks .
An analyst ’s report from the Royal Bank of Scotland concluded , “ Fisk is a veteran of the Middle East .
... he is also increasingly associated with more radical theories thus weakening the credibility of the story . ”
Beyond the specifics of the story , the geopolitical implications of the report sent shudders from Riyadh to London to Washington :
Has the long - dominant American economy been so humbled by the economic crisis that these nations would mount a frontal attack on the dollar , the underpinning of the world ’s biggest economy ?
That question is on the minds of global investors , who are keeping a skittish eye on the weakening dollar .
And over the past several months there has been a steady drumbeat of Chinese , Russian and other officials who have talked openly about finding a replacement for the dollar as the global economy ’s default currency .
Any effort to do that would be fraught with difficulty .
But however unlikely , the possibility represents a threat to the American economy , which has come to depend on the significant advantages it reaps from minting the currency most used around the world .
In another era , the dollar could shrug off such a vaguely sourced , thinly detailed story .
But not anymore .
The dollar is weak and vulnerable to rumor - mongering because many traders believe it will only get weaker .
“ The fundamental reason why this occurred is that after 9.8 percent unemployment on Friday , nobody can say with certainty that the recovery is sustainable , ” said one analyst familiar with the situation .
“ In years past , when the U.S. economic dominance was more pronounced and emerging markets were marginal players in the global economy , ” noted an analyst ’s report from HSBC , “ the debate on pricing commodities in currencies other than the [ U.S. dollar ] typically came down to the lack of practicality .
...
Today , emerging markets are clearly wielding much more influence in the global economy , and they want more , as will be borne out in this week ’s IMF meetings . ”
And that means U.S. officials whose job it is to defend the dollar may have their work cut out for them in the months to come .
WASHINGTON -- A key House panel on Thursday approved an amendment offered by Rep. Ron Paul ( R. , Texas ) to give federal watchdogs massive new authority to audit the Federal Reserve .
The approval came as the House Financial Services Committee concluded weeks of debate on a sweeping financial - overhaul bill to create a new council of regulators to wind down large institutions that pose a risk to the economy .
A final committee vote on the bill will be postponed until after Thanksgiving .
Mr. Paul 's amendment removes restrictions on the Government Accountability Office 's auditing authority , giving auditors access to every item on the Fed 's balance sheet .
He for more than 20 years has championed significantly neutering the Fed .
Meanwhile , Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D , Mass . ) said he wants to work with members of the Congressional Black Caucus over the Thanksgiving break before a final committee vote to resolve their concerns about the economic situation for their constituents .
" The issues are being addressed are not internal to this bill but affect the broader economic situation , " Mr. Frank said .
The proposal to deal with systemic risks is a critical part of the administration 's financial plan .
It also may be the most difficult because of the competing agendas of regulators and policy makers ' desire to use a deft touch with still - shaky financial institutions .
Redmond is investigating reports that a newly discovered flaw in Microsoft 's implementation of the Server Message Block 2 ( SMB2 ) protocol , an extension of the conventional server message block protocol , can be exploited to remotely crash and restart computers running Windows Vista or Windows 7 .
The attack does not require authentication , but port 445 of the target system must be open , and on Windows it is open by default .
Laurent Gaffi� , who discovered the vulnerability , has contacted Microsoft , noting that the only solution he can think of is to turn off the SMB feature and close port 445 .
Gaffi� says the vulnerability is a result of how the srv2.sys driver handles client requests when the header of the " Process Id High " field contains an ampersand ( this is n't the first time an ampersand has caused trouble for Microsoft ) : " SRV2.SYS fails to handle malformed SMB headers for the NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST functionality .
The NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST is the first SMB query a client send to a SMB server , and it's used to identify the SMB dialect that will be used for further communication . "
Windows Server 2008 may also be vulnerable , as it uses the same SMB2 driver , but Gaffi� has not tested the flaw against the server operating system .
The flaw could also potentially lead to a denial of service attack or remote code execution .
Update
Microsoft has now issued Security Advisory 975497 in regards to the issue .
The software giant noted its concern that this new report of a vulnerability was not responsibly disclosed , potentially putting computer users at risk , but that it is not aware of any attacks that try to use the reported vulnerabilities .
Redmond says it may provide a security update on Patch Tuesday or an out - of - cycle patch once it is ready .
Microsoft listed two workarounds for the flaw : disable SMB v2 and block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall .
The company also gave three mitigating factors ,
Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter .
Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed .
In this case , the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet .
In Windows Vista , if the network profile is set to " Public " , the system is not affected by this vulnerability , since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default .
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected by this vulnerability .
That 's right , despite the initial reports , Microsoft says that only Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 are affected .
This is good news for everyone who has already gotten their hands on the latest versions of Windows and Windows Server , though it should be noted that the Windows 7 RC is indeed affected .
President Barack Obama will speak Tuesday night on his new Afghanistan strategy .
( ( Jim Young / Reuters ) ) U.S. President Barack Obama ordered military officials to begin carrying out his new strategy in Afghanistan , two days before his speech to unveil a plan that includes the deployment of thousands of more troops .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the rollout began Sunday after Obama spoke with senior officials , including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , Secretary of Defence Robert Gates , National Security Adviser James Jones , Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Karl Eikenberry , ambassador to Afghanistan .
Gibbs said it was at that time that the order for the military to go ahead with new deployments became official .
As well , Gibbs said , Obama began briefing world leaders , including French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and would be in touch later with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
On Tuesday night at the United States Military Academy in West Point , N.Y. , Obama is expected to announce he will be sending more than 30,000 troops to Afghanistan .
Brown has said that several allied nations will offer a total of 5,000 more troops , which , combined with Obama ’s troops , would be close to the 40,000 more soldiers McChrystal has called for .
The escalation , which would take place over the next year , would put more than 100,000 American troops in Afghanistan at an annual cost of about $ 75 billion US .
Obama 's speech will include a revamped approach to train Afghan security forces to eventually take over from the U.S.
It will also talk about an exit strategy , stressing that he does n't plan an open - ended U.S. commitment .
But Obama could face roadblocks in the House and Senate , particularly by members of his own party who are wary of an increased troop commitment and the costs associated .
Democratic Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate armed services committee , said greater numbers of Afghan army and police are central to succeeding in the war .
Levin said it 's not clear what role the tens of thousands of additional U.S. combat troops would play in that buildup and that Obama has to make a compelling case for it on Tuesday .
" The key here is an Afghan surge , not an American surge , " Levin said .
" We cannot , by ourselves , win [ the ] war . "
The public option is still alive for a variety of reasons , as Nate Silver has pointed out .
The Dish always thought it was viable because the logic behind it makes sense to anyone with a brain , because it would save money , because it is actually popular and because the opt - out option squares the circle nicely .
But Nate is also correct about this :
None of this would have been possible without the yeoman effort of a relatively small number of bloggers and activists -- they know who they are -- who were tired of taking " no " for an answer .
They wanted this fight because of the paradigm - shifting implications it could have for how business gets done in the Democratic Party .
And , somewhat to my surprise , they 're having it .
What part of " we " in " we are the ones we 've been waiting for ? " does the Beltway still not understand ?
And why has it taken this long for the Obamaphiles to tackle their leader .
He 's the follower , for Pete 's sake , remember ?
The people who voted for him are the leaders .
So make him .

Nanoparticles can damage the DNA of cells some distance away , even when the cells seem safe behind an impassable barrier of tissue , new research has found .
But what does this curious finding , revealed yesterday by researchers at the University of Bristol , UK , mean about the safety of nanoparticles and medical treatments based on them ?
New Scientist puts the news in context .
Did the experiment represent something that could happen in my body ?
The experimental set - up was entirely artificial , and nothing like it occurs naturally in humans or animals .
Nor are the nanoparticles in question used in any current treatments , experimental or otherwise .

The tissue barrier , about four cells deep , was made from “ BeWo ” human cancer cells .
They are a standard cell line that has become well adapted to lab work , making them very different to any cells found in the body .
The nanoparticles were 30 - nanometre - wide beads of surgical cobalt - chromium alloy , a material used in much larger pieces to make surgical implants such as hip prostheses .
The “ target ” cells on the other side of the BeWo barrier to the nanoparticles were human fibroblast cells , found in skin and connective tissue .
What exactly were the results ?
After a day in a lab dish , DNA damage was discovered in the fibroblasts .
It was n’t extensive , but included single and double - strand breaks in DNA , and abnormal chromosome doubling in some cells .
Careful checking found no leaks in the barrier , and no cobalt - chromium beads on the wrong side of it .
How could that happen ?
The nanoparticles directly influenced the nearest layer of barrier cells and disrupted their mitochondria – chambers where energy is generated and stored .
That released signalling molecules – mainly the energy - transport molecule adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) – which in turn triggered a cascade of biochemical messages inside the cell .
That signalling storm eventually reached the other side of the barrier cell , opening channels that spread the message to the next layer of barrier cells .
This Chinese - whispers process continued until signalling molecules reached the fibroblasts , somehow damaging their DNA – the researchers do n’t yet know how this happened .
How do we know that ’s what happened ?
When compounds that block the “ message ” channels in cell membranes were added to the dish , there was no damage to fibroblasts .
What is special about these nanoparticles that lets them do this ?
Nothing , really .
Further experiments showed that there are ways to transmit the ghostly messages without using nanoparticles .
Solutions containing cobalt or chromium ions caused the same damage to fibroblasts .
So did using much larger particles of cobalt - chromium in place of the nanoparticles .
Might other kinds of chemicals , drugs and nanoparticles perform this trick too ?
Possibly , but the only way of finding out is to test a wider range of substances using the same experimental set -up .
Hundreds of thousands of people receive cobalt - chromium implants every year , and there has been no evidence of ill effects reported .
Could the same effect occur naturally ?
Possibly , but we do n’t know yet .
“ Maybe small particles like viruses or prions act through these processes too , ” says Patrick Case , who led the research .
Does this suggest that all nanoparticles may be unsafe ?
No .
There are hundreds of nanostructures under development and being tested as possible medical treatments and for other uses .
It would be ridiculous to suppose that they would or could all cause this phenomenon .
What about skin creams like sunblocks that contain nanoparticles ?
Might they cause unknown effects below the skin ?
Possibly .
But again , this is such a newly discovered phenomenon that it ’s too soon to say .
The researchers are adamant that their set - up ca n’t and should n’t be extrapolated to any structures in the human body .
Is more research into the new phenomenon planned ?
Yes .
Experiments are planned to see if other nanoparticles or chemicals can perform the same trick .
It will also be fascinating to see if signalling is possible across the body ’s natural barriers , such as the skin , placenta or blood brain barrier .
Much research is trying to design drug molecules able to cross such barriers , which can act as very specific filters .
But it may be possible to exploit this newly discovered effect to avoid having to cross them altogether .

This presentation will introduce a new web - based attack vector which utilizes client - side scripting to fragment malicious web content .
This involves distributing web exploits in a asynchronous manner to evade signature detection .
Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks , which are still an issue in current IDS / IPS products ,
This attack vector involves sending any web exploit in fragments and uses the already existing components within the web browser to reassemble and execute the exploit .
Our presentation will discuss this attack vector used to evade both gateway and client side detection .
We will show several proof of concepts containing common readily available web exploits .

It started when she came back to Alaska in January to be greeted by a raft of ethics complaints .
While most of them were thrown out for want of merit , the NYT says that Palin became consumed by them -- to the point her hair started thinning out , requiring an emergency visit to her hairdresser back in Wasilla .
The constant feuding over the ethics complaints and the David Letterman flap , among others , caused a lot of people who supported her to think she was losing focus .
For instance , Republican state rep Nancy Dahlstrom , who worked for Palin 's 2006 campaign , said that Palin seemed to think she was " all about adoration " rather than governing .
Another state rep , John Coghill , thinks Palin misstepped by paying too much attention to the barbs being thrown at her .
The article also details some of Palin 's missteps on the national stage .
At one point , it seemed her left hand did n't know what her right hand was doing .
After the Conservative Political Action Conference , a meeting of the Republican Party ’s evangelical base , announced that the governor would have a coveted speaking role at its annual gathering in February , she canceled , citing scheduling conflicts .
Then , organizers of one of the most important Republican Congressional fund - raisers of the year said they had been assured by a political aide to Ms. Palin that she would be their headliner , only to have her Anchorage office announce that she knew nothing about it .
Those snafus particularly concerned one of her major backers , Fred Malek .
He tried to tell Palin that she needed to get a better way to return calls .
Palin 's response ?
Wait for it --" What number are they calling ? "
No wonder John Coale , the Democratic lawyer who helped set up SarahPAC , thinks that there were times Palin did n't know what being on the national stage meant .
The NYT did manage to interview Palin for this story .
It makes it sound like she was caught by surprise by all the heat she 's faced lately .
This seems to lend a bit of credence to Andrea Mitchell 's report that she might be out of politics for good .
For one thing , Palin said the seeds for her resignation were planted when she became McCain 's running mate .
" It began when we started really looking at the conditions that had so drastically changed on Aug. 29 , " she said .
" The hordes of opposition researchers came up here digging for dirt for political reasons , making crap up . "
Hmmm -- that could n't be because McCain himself did n't even bother to vet you , could it ?
“ Government ’s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases :
If it moves , tax it .
If it keeps moving , regulate it .
And if it stops moving , subsidize it . ” — Ronald Reagan
Today , not much about Colorado ’s economy moves .
The state is broke and releases prisoners because it cannot afford to keep them .
The governor slashes the higher education budget 40 percent .
People lose jobs , homes and financial security .
Our leaders face serious issues .
And what keeps some politicians up at night ?
That sneaking suspicion that some suffering cancer patient may gain limited pain relief through medical marijuana , coupled with that gnawing certainty that someone , somewhere , actually grew the plant for that patient .
But government cannot repeal the laws of supply and demand , and cannot extinguish the spark of freedom in peoples ’ hearts .
Now , the marijuana distribution chain becomes legal .
Responsible entrepreneurs open shops to supply a skyrocketing demand for medicine .
These small businesses serve needy patients .
They pay taxes .
They hire employees .
They lease space .
They advertise .
And the drug war industrial complex ca n’t stand it .
Most elected leaders have a good sense of proportion regarding this issue .
A minority of politicians , however , avoid reasonable proposals to tax and regulate marijuana , and instead irresponsibly fear - monger in the worst tradition of Prohibition - era “ Reefer Madness ” propaganda .
We hear racially charged tales of “ Mexican cartels ” supposedly running the medical marijuana business , when the truth is Colorado homegrown marijuana puts foreign cartels out of business , and it is law enforcement that enriches cartels through hostility to medical marijuana .
We hear local bureaucrats complain about dispensaries , and then in the same breath enact moratoria , thus granting government - enforced monopolies to the very shops that offend them , and shutting out newer entrepreneurs who would do more responsible business .
Government can help lower the high cost of medicine , but artificially restricting supply has the opposite effect .
We hear unsupported anecdotal government propaganda about how dispensaries “ attract crime , ” when the truth is these shops , which are generally open only in daylight hours , have security systems and are not open to the general public and only admit registered patients , and are safer than convenience stores , liquor stores , bars , gas stations or banks .
We hear government hysteria about how these shops should not be near schools , without a single documented case of a child obtaining marijuana from a dispensary .
On Ninth and Corona streets in Denver is a small liquor store and a pharmacy , both legally dispensing drugs far more potent that marijuana , and both directly across the street from a large public elementary school .
And this is not a problem .
Children are not wandering in to buy narcotics or liquor .
It is another example of an imaginary concern designed to justify irrational restrictions .
We also hear government officials with no formal medical training demonizing and second - guessing private confidential decisions of trained physicians who advise patients .
Government should not interfere with private medical decisions .
Some officials even contend that although medical marijuana is legal , it is not legal to actually produce or distribute it .
However , the Colorado Constitution legalizes “ acquisition , possession , manufacture , production , use , sale , distribution , dispensing , or transportation of marijuana ” for medical use . ”
If “ sale , ” “ distribution , ” and even “ dispensing ” are legal , then a “ dispensary ” is legal .
And if “ manufacture ” and “ production ” are legal , then growing is legal .
Many of these proposals would drive vulnerable patients away from the well - lit , safe , secure , private , confidential medical marijuana dispensary and put them and their wheelchairs back in the dangerous black market .
There are two positive results of this government hysteria : Thousands more Coloradoans are aware that they have the option of being legal medical marijuana patients ; and voters continue discussions of the wisdom of continuing Prohibition .
This is a debate that freedom wins and government nannyism loses .

Oregon caves yield evidence of continent 's first inhabitants .
An Oregon cave has yielded the oldest artefact ever found in the Americas .
Tom Stafford
Archaeologists claim to have found the oldest known artefact in the Americas , a scraper - like tool in an Oregon cave that dates back 14,230 years .
The tool shows that people were living in North America well before the widespread Clovis culture of 12,900 to 12,400 years ago , says archaeologist Dennis Jenkins of the University of Oregon in Eugene .
Studies of sediment and radiocarbon dating showed the bone 's age .
Jenkins presented the finding late last month in a lecture at the University of Oregon .
His team found the tool in a rock shelter overlooking a lake in south - central Oregon , one of a series of caves near the town of Paisley .
Kevin Smith , the team member who uncovered the artefact , remembers the discovery .
" We had bumped into a lot of extinct horse , bison and camel bone – then I heard and felt the familiar ring and feel when trowel hits bone , " says Smith , now a master 's student at California State University , Los Angeles .
" I switched to a brush .
Soon this huge bone emerged , then I saw the serrated edge .
I stepped back and said : ' Hey everybody — we got something here . ' "
Coprolite controversy
Whether the cave dwellers were Clovis people or belonged to an earlier culture is uncertain .
None of the Clovis people 's distinct fluted spear and arrow points have been found in the cave .
" They can't yet rule out the Paisley Cave people were n't Clovis , " says Jon Erlandson , an archaeologist at the University of Oregon who was n't involved in the research .
The only other American archaeological site older than Clovis is at Monte Verde in Chile , which is about 13,900 years old .
Last year , Jenkins and colleagues reported that Paisley Cave coprolites , or fossilized human excrement , dated to 14,000 to 14,270 years ago1 .
That report established the Paisley Caves as a key site for American archaeology .
Analysis of ancient DNA marked the coprolites as human .
But in July , another group argued that the coprolites might be younger than the sediments that contained them2 .
This team , led by Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , also questioned the 2008 report because no artefacts had been found in the crucial sediments .
The Oregon team strongly disputed the criticisms3 .
Laid to rest ?
The dating of the bone tool , and the finding that the sediments encasing it range from 11,930 to 14,480 years old , might put these questions to rest .
" You could n't ask for better dated stratigraphy , " Jenkins told the Oregon meeting .
" They have definitely made their argument even stronger , " says Todd Surovell , an archaeologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie who was not involved in the research .

Other researchers questioned whether the cave 's inhabitants would have been mainly vegetarian , as the coprolites suggested4 .
( Editor 's note : Please see the comments thread of this article for the authors of this reference weighing in on the significance of their work . )
In his recent lecture Jenkins noted other evidence reflecting a diet short on meat but including edible plants such as the fernleaf biscuitroot Lomatium dissectum .
In late September , a group of archaeologists who study the peopling of the Americas met with federal officials and a representative of the local Klamath tribe to review the evidence at Paisley Caves .
The specialists spent two days examining sediments , checking the tool , and assessing other plant and animal evidence .
" It was an impressive presentation , " says David Meltzer , an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas , who attended the meeting .
" This is clearly an important site , but there are some tests that need to be done to seal the deal . "
One key , he says , is to better understand how the specimens got to the cave .

The Senate must move legislation to raise the federal debt limit beyond $ 12.1 trillion by mid-October , a move viewed as necessary despite protests about the record levels of red ink .
The move will highlight the nation ’s record debt , which has been central to Republican attacks against Democratic congressional leaders and President Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE .
The year ’s deficit is expected to hit a record $ 1.6 trillion .
ADVERTISEMENT
Democrats in control of Congress , including then - Sen. Obama ( Ill. ) , blasted President George W. Bush for failing to contain spending when he oversaw increased deficits and raised the debt ceiling .
“ Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren , ” Obama said in a 2006 floor speech that preceded a Senate vote to extend the debt limit .
“ America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership .
” Obama later joined his Democratic colleagues in voting en bloc against raising the debt increase .
Now Obama is asking Congress to raise the debt ceiling , something lawmakers are almost certain to do despite misgivings about the federal debt .
The ceiling already has been hiked three times in the past two years , and the House took action earlier this year to raise the ceiling to $ 13 trillion .
Congress has little choice .
Failing to raise the cap could lead the nation to default in mid-October , when the debt is expected to exceed its limit , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said .
In August , Geithner asked Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev. ) to increase the debt limit as soon as possible .
Changing the debt cap “ does provide an opportunity to look at fiscal policy and what its failings are , and ideally it could give both sides an opportunity to think about what we need to do so we do n't keep raising the debt limit , ” said Robert Bixby , the executive director of the Concord Coalition , a fiscal watchdog group .
“ But probably as a practical matter , it will get more attention as a partisan back - and - forth , ” Bixby said .
When the House raised the debt limit to $ 13 trillion as part of a budget resolution approved in April , Democratic leaders used a maneuver known as the “ Gephardt rule , ” named after former House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt ( Mo. ) , to avoid taking a roll call vote on the debt limit increase .
The Senate is n’t so lucky .
It lacks a similar mechanism , meaning each senator must cast a politically perilous vote on raising the debt ceiling .
The Senate Finance Committee will “ carefully review Treasury 's request on behalf of the American taxpayers , ” according to an aide to the committee 's chairman , Sen . ( D - Mont . ) .
“ Sen .
Baucus understands the critical importance of signaling to the world that the U.S. maintains the confidence and security to continue to lead the global economy out of recession , ” the Baucus aide said .
“ The request to raise the debt limit is serious and must be addressed thoroughly and in a nonpartisan manner .
” The aide noted that Baucus is pressing the Treasury Department to be more transparent about its efforts to pull the economy out of recession .
“ He will continue to demand the necessary communication and cooperation going forward , ” the aide said .
Both the White House and the independent Congressional Budget Office last month said that they expect the debt to increase by another $ 9 trillion over the next decade .
Should the Senate follow the House 's lead and set the new debt limit at $ 13 trillion , lawmakers would probably have to raise the limit again next year , when the Obama administration expects to run a $ 1.5 trillion deficit .
The business community has supported Geithner 's push for a higher debt ceiling .
Bruce Josten , the top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said it 's essential to the U.S. economy .
“ If we fail to address this in a timely fashion , then you run the risk of having to curtail government operations , ” Josten said .
“ The last thing our economy and the world economy needs is greater uncertainty throughout global credit markets .
” Josten said that the high level of debt is a reality during the recession , but it 's unsustainable and needs to be reduced by reforming Medicare and Social Security .
“ While we can freely and openly acknowledge completely and lobby to raise the debt ceiling and incur some more debt , the longer trends ultimately need to be reversed , ” he said .
Congress raised the debt limit just a few months ago when it passed the $ 787 billion stimulus package .
Scientists say they have discovered an antibody that could minimise the major internal bleeding seen in traumas like bullet wounds and car crashes .
The team at Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation ( OMRF ) has discovered that a protein called histone is responsible for much of the damage .
They say they have found a specific type of antibody that can block the ability of histone to cause damage .
They say it could lead to new ways to treat diseases and serious injuries .
' Life threatening '
Writing in the journal , Nature Medicine , the OMRF researchers found that when mice had a bad blood stream infection ( sepsis ) , their blood contained high levels of histones .
They checked this in primates and humans and found the same result .
The histone protein normally sits in the nucleus of a cell .
It forms a kind of spool around which the DNA winds enabling it to fit inside the cell .
Bullet wounds often lead to severe internal bleeding
When the cell is damaged by injury or disease , the histone is released into the blood system where it begins to kill the lining of blood vessels , causing damage , the OMRF researchers said .
This , they believe , results in uncontrolled internal bleeding and fluid build - up in the tissues , which are life threatening .
Dr Charles Esmon , of OMRF who led the research , said : " When we realised that histones were so toxic , we immediately went to work looking for a way to stop their destructive tendencies . "
Mouse antibody Marc Monestier , a colleague at Temple University in Philadelphia , had already discovered a specific type of antibody known as a monoclonal antibody that could block the histones .
It had been observed that patients with auto - immune diseases make antibodies to the proteins in their cell nuclei but it was not known why .
This antibody came from a mouse with an auto - immune disease .
The OMRF team have tested the antibody in mice with sepsis and it does stop the toxic effects of the histones and they recover , the researchers say .
They now want to test it in primates and eventually humans .
Dr Esmon said histones were similar in all mammals because they were such basic building blocks .
So a mouse antibody should work equally well in a human .
He said : " We think it was an adaptation during evolution .
" Millions of years ago , when people and animals got ill , they did not die of heart attacks or car accidents they died of infectious diseases .
" Their immune systems went into overdrive throwing everything at it and we believe the histones in the cell nucleus , part of the basic building blocks of life , were the last resort . "
Dr Stephen Prescott , president of OMRF , said : " These findings offer some clues as to why people suffering from one traumatic injury often experience a catastrophic ' cascade ' of secondary traumatic events .
" If we can figure out how to control the initial injury , perhaps that will stop the domino effect that so often follows . "

The word on the street is that Michael Schumacher could be in line for the Mercedes - Benz ( née Brawn ) drive next year alongside Nico Rosberg .
So let us have a logical look at whether this is really going to happen .
There are , of course , plenty of known associations : Ross Brawn oversaw all of Schumacher ’s World Championships at Benetton and at Ferrari and knows Michael perfectly .
Mercedes - Benz gave Michael his break in motor racing back in the days before Norbert Haug when Jochen Neerpasch picked him for the Mercedes - Benz Junior Team , alongside Heinz - Harald Frentzen , Karl Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner ( hey , you cannot always get it right ) .
Neerpasch played a major role in getting him into F1 and in slipping him out of Jordan and into Benetton .
This all makes sense although men like Brawn and Haug are rarely sentimental .
You do not get to be successful in F1 without being fairly hard - headed .
They will look the facts and decide .
On the downside , Michael is 40 and has a neck injury which was ( and perhaps still is ) far worse than he ever wanted to admit .
He tried to come back in August with Ferrari , but this was stymied by the injury .
This was six months after the motorcycle accident that caused the head and neck problems .
For now Michael can race in karts and the Race of Champions , but sustained high G seems to be difficult and , according to doctors , not healthy .
Michael did say that his neck was not strong enough “ yet ” , but that may have been a victory of ambition over good sense .
It should also be remembered that when Michael left Ferrari it was because he had been put into a position where he had no choice .
The reason Ferrari did this was that the team seemed to think that although he was still quick , he was no longer as fast as was necessary .
It replaced him with Kimi Raikkonen .
These days Michael is only working for the team as a road car test driver , the decision having been made to stop the F1 work he had been doing .
There is no doubt that Michael still loves to race , more than anything else in his life , but there are dangers of going into a Mercedes situation .
He would no longer have the advantages that were built into his contracts at Ferrari .
It would not be his team and there is not really time to build it into that .
There are also disadvantages in having Michael .
Mercedes - Benz wants to get publicity for own products , not for Michael Schumacher .
If Michael did return and win the headlines would say “ Schumacher ! ” , whereas if Heidfeld or Rosberg win it will be because the cars have turned them into winners .
If Michael arrived and failed then the car would probably take the blame .
Thus hiring Schumacher makes less sense for Mercedes - Benz than it at first appears .
This is an argument that Mercedes - Benz has long used when asked why it did not hire Michael in the McLaren days .
There is no reason why they could not hire him to stand next to cars and say : “ I love Mercedes - Benz products because … ” but there are downsides to having him racing for them .
The final point is that Michael may want to race but wise heads around him will be explaining to him that the Schumacher legacy will be damaged with poor comebacks .
Nigel Mansell could not give up the F1 dream and embarrassed himself with the miserable McLaren business .
Knowing when to quit is important in the sporting legend business .
In college , I had this old crazy hippie for a professor .
He was skinny as a split toothpick and wore the same cardigans and corduroys every day .
He had wild grizzled hair tied back in a rough ponytail and a thin scratchy beard that looked as if a particularly determined hoarfrost had decided to set up shop along his cheekbones .
He had lived his entire life in a little shack in Western Massachusetts .
He had a crazy rich old neighbor who believed he could speak to bears .
This guy would drive out to the local donut shop every morning and buy all their leftover jelly donuts .
I 'm not making this up .
He would buy literally hundreds of jelly donuts at sharply discounted morning - after prices and then load them into barrels and drive them to his house and chain the barrels to trees so that the bears could come and have a picnic .
And this guy would go out into his yard and pet the bears and coo at them and all the while my professor would be on his back porch with a rifle in his hand trying to decide which one he should shoot .
As is the case with many crazy college professors , he told me many things I 'll never forget .
Most of them had to do with aliens running the White House , but one thing which struck a peculiarly reasonable chord in me was his description of globalization as a mechanism for removing consequences from actions .
It 's easy to comprehend the labor that goes into creating a sweater when it 's grandma knitting it in the corner -- less so when it 's some kid in Indonesia .
More generally , the people who buy shit in this country are often unaware of the effects of their purchases around the world .
Even things which are domestically produced at great cost lose their salience when shipped between communities .
And when you realize the consequences of those actions , it tends to come as quite a shock .
And so it was with this week 's thread .
" I dare you to find a company more evil than De Beers , " forum goon scheherezade taunted his forums compatriots .
" Here 's a company that was founded by the guy who is basically african hitler ( cecil rhodes ) and their entire marketing is devoted to selling fucking rocks to CEO 's wives . "
The challenge was clear : find a company that had done more wrong to the world than the diamong cartel .
22 pages later , I 'm not sure we found a company more evil than De Beers , but I 'm pretty sure we learned a lot more about how we 're all going to die horrible painful deaths because of our own economic negligence or collective malfeasance .
This week 's Goldmine is a painful education , and while you may laugh , it wo n't be mirthful chuckling as much as the sort of hollow grunt one makes when confronted by a terrible ghost .
Enjoy !
Xephero :
it 's bayer , just look at this shit .
they had medicine infected with AIDS that they could n't sell in the U.S. so they dumped it on poor people overseas .
From wikipedia :
In 1997 , Bayer and the other three makers agreed to pay $ 660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States in the early 1980s , paying an estimated $ 100,000 to each infected hemophiliac . [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
Soon after the settlement , because the New York state statute of limitations required people to file a lawsuit within three years of discovering an illness , New York Governor George Pataki signed a bill allowing people infected by blood products , or their survivors , two years to bring product liability suits against the manufacturers .
[ 9 ]
The settled class members are barred from filing suits against the companies , however the bill allowed an estimated additional 75 eligible to file suits . [ 9 ]
Simon Magus Says :
Bechtel , the answer is Bechtel .
The fact that the corporation responsible for the Big Dig , the post invasion reconstruction of Iraq , and the Katrina cleanup can still be turning a multi-billion dollar profit every year is a testament to how many Americans do n't give a fuck and do n't care to ever give a fuck .
They privatized the goddamn water supply in Iraq .
Hemogoblin :
No , I 'm sorry it 's Blackwater .
They simultaneously employ their workers as contractors and salarymen so they can avoid any responsibility for their actions while retaining complete control over what they do .
Blackwater 's contracts routinely include clauses such as :
1 ) If you defy a direct order for any reason you will be abruptly terminated and Blackwater will withhold all back salary and sue your family into oblivion .
2 ) If you die or are injured on a mission due to the negligence of Blackwater you can't sue them .
If you sue them , they will withhold all your back salary and bring legal action against you and your family .
3 ) You can be terminated for any reason whatsoever and if you sue they for wrongful dismissal they will withhold all your back salary and bring legal action against you and your family .
Basically , their contracting system holds you in a state of legal servitude until you quit , and if you have a problem with Blackwater they will sue you until the problem goes away .
Who remembers this picture :
Right , those are two Blackwater contractors who drove through the middle of Fallujah in a jeep and got murdered .
Turns out their superiors at Blackwater ordered them to do the run , even though they objected , and the US Army deemed it " operationally dangerous " and refused to allow soldiers to enter .
Blackwater also failed to provide a heavy gunner who was promised to the men to safeguard their trip .
As a result , and the fact they could n't refuse the order without bankrupting themselves and their families , they ended up like that .
Naturally , when this came to light , the families of the men were upset because Blackwater failed to adequately safeguard the lives of its men and openly lied to them about the working conditions .
They opened legal action against Blackwater for negligence and wrongful death .
In reply , Blackwater refused to release their dead husbands back wages ( some collected during the run they died doing ) and filed suit for breach of contract and a bunch of other legal mumbo- jumbo like the cost of their defense and shit .
As a result , they pointlessly lost their husbands due to corporate negligence , have not been paid the monies owed them , and are being sued to the tune of millions for holding the company to account for its failures .
Wildstrike :
This thread is so depressing .
There 's so many that have n't even been mentioned yet :
RIO TINTO
- Complicity in or direct violations of environmental , labor and human rights in Indonesia , Papua New Guinea , Philippines , Namibia , Madagascar , the United States and Australia , among others .
Including :
- Eviction of the local small scale miners in the Kelian gold mine in Borneo .
The families were displaced to shanty towns .
Followed up in the area with a culture of sexual harassment and rape centered around the company .
An independent inquiry determined that victims of sexual abuse had been threatened with dismissal if they did not cooperate or were promised a job or money in return for sex .
Rio Tinto did n't inform their shareholders of this finding .
( here ) and ( here )
- In the 70s supported the apartheid government of South Africa through uranium mining operation in Namibia that the UN called ' virtual slave labour under brutal conditions ' .
These operations , by admission of the company chairman maintained a ' private army ' for the purposes of suppressing civil or labour unrest .
( here )
Keeping large gun happy security forces that are accused of everything between intimidation and outright targetted murder of opposition leaders in communities near Rio Tinto concerns is a practice the company still maintains today .( here )
- Their attempt at greenwashing includes both the typical aesthtic use of landscapes that they are actually in the process of despoiling and also the coining of the oxymoron ' sustainable mining ' .
( here )
- Under their subsidiary ' Bougainville Copper ltd ' , through pollution ( they dumped the toxic tailings from their mine directly into the main river ) and disregard for the local community whilst giving significant amounts of money to the central government they were instrumental in bringing about a full secessionary war in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea . ( here ) and ( here )
The area has been completely destabilised for around 40 years now .
The court case still has n't been resolved ( I believe ) even though it has been going on since 2000 .
From the case :
Both Rio and PNG made enormous profits from the mine and were anxious for it to operate , notwithstanding the resistance of the island 's people .
The blockade prevented medicine , clothing and other essential items from reaching the people of Bougainville .
Hospitals were forced to close , women died needlessly in childbirth and young children died from easily preventable diseases .
Rio's top manager on Bougainville encouraged continuation of the blockade for the purpose of ' starving the bastards ' out .
This blockade directly caused the deaths of at least 10,000 people between 1990 and 1997 .
According to the Red Cross , the blockade killed more than 2,000 children in its first two years of operation .
By the time the war ended in 1999 , 10 % of the population of Bougainville , approximately 15,000 civilians , were killed .
- Oh and last year in one of the most successful years ever for the mining industry as a whole Rio Tinto 's earnings were a record US $ 7,443,000,000 .
Fifty thousand feet over the California desert , the world is a vast expanse of blue with a drab carpet of khaki far , far below .
Pilot Peter Siebold sets the craft 's trim to 18 degrees , pushes the stick forward , and counts down : " Three .
Two .
One. Release . "
The mother ship rises above us as we drift downward for a few seconds .
Siebold pulls the yoke back and flips a toggle on the center console .
Then : Bang !
The hybrid rocket motor ignites and we 're a missile shooting toward the stars at more than three times the speed of sound .
The sky becomes black .
Then it gets weirder : Siebold flicks the yoke and the vehicle whips around 180 degrees .
We 're still heading straight up , but the ship is flying backward .
It 's like looking out the windshield of a car that 's floored in reverse , except my view is 1,500 miles in each direction , from the Sea of Cortez to San Francisco Bay .
My attention wanders for a split second and the verisimilitude evaporates — seeing walls and ceiling and my blue jeans jerks me back to reality .
I 'm not in the sky but in a hangar at the headquarters of Scaled Composites in Mojave , California , sitting in a flight simulator for the firm 's latest spacecraft , SpaceShipTwo .
If all goes well , SpaceShipTwo will be the commercial version of the radical rocket that won the $ 10 million X Prize in 2004 after it made two flights to the edge of space in a 14 - day period .
Richard Branson licensed the technology for Virgin Galactic , his space tourism gambit , which aims to start regular visits to the thermosphere by 2012 .
After all of the prize money and media coverage , routine space tourism — this grand flight of human fancy — seems about to happen .
SpaceShipTwo will be carried aloft by a mother ship , WhiteKnightTwo , which has been flying for nearly a year .
The first SS2 is under construction and slated to begin flight tests in early 2010 .
Virgin has already sold $ 60 million in tickets to its first 300 passengers .
And a taxpayer - funded spaceport is under construction near Las Cruces , New Mexico .
In a year , maybe two — barring any test - flight glitches — people who have the right financial stuff will be rocketing daily into space for a few minutes of sensory overload and ego gratification .
It may not be the colonization of Mars , but as Siebold says , " did the Wright brothers have Boeing 747s in their consciousness when they flew at Kitty Hawk ?
No , but it just grows from here ; what they achieved made that possible . "
If Virgin and Scaled Composites succeed in making this huge technical leap , a trip to suborbital space will have been reduced to nothing more than a pricey Tilt - A - Whirl for grown - ups .
If you spend enough time around the Scaled Composites hangars , it all begins to sound routine , almost banal — just another project for a company that churns out innovative aircraft the way Dyson turns out innovative vacuum cleaners .
Ask the team about the technical challenges it has faced assembling these ships and the answer surprises you .
" Um , really , " Scaled Composites president Doug Shane says , " it 's not much of a technical job at all . "
It 's a statement that Virgin 's would - be competitors , all years away from putting a commercial system in place , wish they could agree with .
And it downplays the biggest challenge of all :
How do you take a dangerous and radical one - off prototype and turn it into an everyday vehicle ?
In 1994 , Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen asked Scaled Composites founder Burt Rutan a question : Would it be possible to beam down broadband Internet signals from high above Los Angeles using a plane that the legendary aeronautical engineer was designing ?
Back then , broadband was basically nonexistent , and Allen was looking to fill the gap .
The plane , called Proteus , is a bizarre - looking aircraft capable of loitering at 60,000 feet for up to 14 hours , and it 's been used for high - altitude research by everyone from NASA to universities .
While he was working on Proteus , Rutan remembers wondering , " What else could you use it for ? "
He has been captivated by space ever since he saw Wernher von Braun on Walt Disney 's TV show in the 1950s .
It occurred to Rutan that Proteus might be able to carry a smaller craft under its fuselage and " do a little point - and - shoot " toward the stars .
That would eliminate one of the trickiest parts of rocket launching : the massive engines and fuel needed to lift a spacecraft through the lowest , thickest part of the atmosphere and onward into space .
By the time Scaled Composites first flew Proteus in 1998 , Rutan knew he could design and produce a mother ship capable of launching a 7,000 - pound payload at 50,000 feet .
Over the next few years , Rutan used that knowledge to chase the $ 10 million X Prize , which had been announced in 1996 .
As he designed the aircraft , Rutan made a series of decisions that proved nothing short of genius and on which Virgin 's plans ride today .
For one , he made the systems , components , and cockpits of the mother ship and spaceship identical , save for the rocket engine controls on the space ship .
For example , SpaceShipOne 's feathering actuator — the device that moves the wings into an upright position — was also used to operate the mother ship 's landing gear ; every test of the mother ship would test parts of the spaceship as well .
As pilots learned to glide the mother ship to a landing from high altitude , they would be learning to land the spaceship , too , racking up copious flight hours long before they ever flew the spaceship for real .

Rutan 's solution for the single most dangerous and technically challenging part of any spaceflight — reentry into the atmosphere — was equally creative .
His so - called shuttlecock design pivots the wings of the spacecraft up for reentry .
" The key is a low ballistic coefficient , " Rutan says , referring to the ratio between weight and drag .
" Think of the difference between a bullet and a feather . "
A streamlined bullet screams heavy and fast through the atmosphere — it has so little drag that it generates huge amounts of heat .
A feather , on the other hand , has a lot of surface area , and it 's so light that it floats slowly , lazily through the air .
By building the wings of the lightweight carbon - fiber capsule so that they pivot into a 65 - degree angle of attack , Rutan has a very light craft with a lot of drag and low aerodynamic loads — just like a feather .
His spaceship can reenter the atmosphere safely , routinely , without the pilot ever having to touch the stick .
Once the ship gets closer to the ground , the wings flatten out again for a gentle glide to the runway .
Although there were a couple of dozen competitors for the X Prize , in reality it was no contest — Rutan was solar systems ahead of everyone else .
And though he made it look easy , even his own designers doubted that a small private company could blast a manned rocket to suborbital space .
" I did n't think we 'd see it through , " Shane says .
" It was just so far out of the realm of what any of us had done .
It was radical . "
When you see WhiteKnight Two next to WhiteKnightOne , you realize what a leap Scaled Composites has made :
It 's like seeing a dragonfly next to a housefly .
The new mother ship 's wingspan is 140 feet , and it weighs 60,000 pounds .
WhiteKnightOne weighs just 18,000 .
Bob Morgan , the plane 's designer , takes me for a tour .
In his blue jeans and polo shirt , Morgan comes across as an everyday guy — just another sharp mind turned loose by Rutan 's dictate to think big and creatively , without fear .
We crawl around inside one of the twin fuselages of the mother ship and its spacious cockpit .
It 's the largest aircraft ever built completely from composite materials , all the way down to the carbon - fiber flight control cables that do n't expand or contract in the extreme temperature changes of flight .
With four turbine engines , it 's light and powerful , able to operate almost 20,000 feet higher than commercial jetliners .
In 2004 , the same year as the winning X Prize flights , Virgin licensed Rutan 's technology and hired him to design the next generation of vehicles .
To accommodate the sort of middle - aged rich people who can afford $ 200,000 for a flight ( Brads and Angelinas , as Scaled Composites ' engineers refer to them ) , the ships had to be bigger , safer , more stable , more robust .
SpaceShipOne was a challenge to fly , with a tendency toward extreme rolling .
In fact , pilot Mike Melvill could barely control it on his record - breaking flight .
That would n't do for commercial space travel .
To reduce roll , the wings of SpaceShipTwo have been moved below the rocket motor .
This enables pilots who are n't veteran test jockeys like Melvill to handle the craft .
The systems are now more redundant , and the pilot is backed up by a copilot .
" We 're not really stretching the technology , " Shane says , " so much as trying to make it safe and routine to fly day in and day out .
That 's not as sexy , but every bit as daunting . "

Virgin is also reimagining the aesthetics of a spacecraft .
There 's no cramped , utilitarian cockpit lined with hundreds of toggles and gauges .
The fuselage of SpaceShipTwo is spacious — 7.5 feet in diameter — so there will be room for its six passengers to take off their seat belts and float around in zero g .
There will likely be no barrier between pilots and passengers , and big round windows dot the ceiling and sides — more windows , it 's fair to say , than have ever been on any spacecraft .
The whole thing feels light and airy in a way that small aircraft never do — a considerable achievement that has not come cheap .
" Winning the X Prize cost about $ 30 million , " says Will Whitehorn , president of Virgin Galactic .
" We 're going to be spending about $ 400 million . "
The tech is impressive , but the experience ?
As a proud cynic who has raised three kids in a house that did n't cost much more than a single Virgin Galactic flight , it'd be easy for me to be snarky about the whole thing .
You can even imagine a passenger standing on the tarmac after the event , scratching his head with a bit of flier 's remorse : " Did I just spend the annual salary of four teachers on that ? "
These days , you can buy weightlessness in 30 - second bursts on zero -g parabolic flights at one - fortieth the cost .
But 300 people have already plunked down the full $ 200,000 price for their tickets .
Several hundred more are " in the pipeline , " a Virgin spokesperson says , and 82,000 have registered on the company 's Web site .
Space may be cold and empty , but the idea of blasting into it strapped into a rocket clearly gets people 's blood pumping .
Maybe it 's the allure of new worlds , new experiences , the pull of the glittering stars in the night sky , the fascination with a journey to the final frontier fraught with danger and promise .
To create SpaceShipTwo , Burt Rutan translated the technical advances of SpaceShipOne into a craft designed for passenger comfort and everyday reliability .

With typical Branson gusto for raw physical experience , Virgin is playing off those longings to sell a whole mini astronaut experience .
Here 's what the company wants you to imagine :
The sun is high , the sky clear as only desert sky can be , the sleek and curving bubble of Spaceport America rising from the scrub , 45 miles from Las Cruces .
On the flight line perches a crazy - looking twin - fuselaged aircraft cradling a spaceship — the three sharp noses call to mind its nickname : Triceratops .
You 're going to space , and you know it .
You 'll get a full mission profile briefing , a medical check , and a session in the simulator .
Then you 'll be strapped into a seat at the end of a long arm and spun in a centrifuge , subject to the three g's you 'll experience sitting upright for takeoff and six g's you 'll feel while lying down for reentry .
You 'll climb into the WhiteKnightTwo mother ship and fly to nearly 50,000 feet , learn to unbuckle and refasten your seat belts , and even make a few zero -g parabolic flights , all with your designated SpaceShipTwo pilots ( who will suss out their passengers ' physical and mental capacity to handle the experience ) .
Finally , the day of your flight arrives .
Earth 's curvature will just begin to be visible after a long , spiral climb attached to WhiteKnightTwo ; above will be a crown of blackness .
When the pilot releases the spacecraft , the mother ship will appear to rise above as you drop away .
Six seconds after the rocket motor ignites , you 'll be traveling at three times the speed of sound , perched on a high - energy Roman candle , hurtling into space , up there in the black void , subject to forces few humans have ever experienced .
As you approach the apogee of the flight , and for a few minutes after , you will simply be freed from gravity , falling through space .
A touch of the thrusters orients the ship in whatever direction the pilot chooses — you 'll be flying backward or sideways .
You might notice the intense silence , since there 's no noise in space and the craft wo n't be running any whirring , clanking mechanical parts .
On reentry , you 'll be able to hear the distinct pings of single molecules of helium and hydrogen hitting the carbon - fiber vessel as it begins to encounter the atmosphere .
Virgin is also pitching the idea that one day it will have spaceports spread around the globe , and that once you 've seen Southern California you 'll want to see the Arctic ice cap and the Arabian peninsula and smoky , chaotic Africa from 68 miles up .
" Think of the aurora borealis ! " crows Whitehorn .
Do n't underestimate how much people love to be tumbled around and made dizzy and scared out of their wits .
Just ask Lauren McCollum , a 43 - year - old real estate developer from Santa Monica , California , who signed on in 2005 and forked over her 200 grand on the spot .
Along with 100 other early Virgin guinea pigs , she 's already been through centrifuge training .
" Six g's lying down was n't bad , " she says .
" But the three g's through my head , well , I started to gray out a little !
It was wonderful ! "
Or B. J. Bjorklund .
" I always wanted to be an astronaut ! " says Bjorklund , a former Air Force pilot , who in 2005 saw Branson touting his newest scheme at the Experimental Aircraft Association AirVenture in Oshkosh , Wisconsin , introduced himself , and immediately pledged to take a flight .
" I 've been to all 50 states and 60 countries .
I have that exploring gene in my body , and space is just on my bucket list ! "
That Scaled Composites will soon have a passenger - carrying spaceship in the air seems pretty certain .
And it 's also clear that there are a lot of deep pockets itching for a ride .
But that still leaves a lot of questions to be answered :
Will there be enough demand to keep the five planned Virgin spaceships flying up to twice a day at maximum capacity for years to come ?
Virgin says yes , absolutely .
Can the hybrid rocket motor fire routinely without issues ?
After all , no one has ever built a rocket that 's been robust and simple enough to function daily .
( The X - 15 made 199 flights in the '50s and '60s , but the program cost $ 1.8 billion in 2009 dollars and killed one pilot . )
Again , Virgin insists the answer is yes .
And even if it all works , will flying a bunch of tourists to the thermosphere 12 times a week make access to space cheaper and simpler for more serious pursuits ?
Will a carny ride get us to the moon ?
To Mars ?
To a new New World ?
Will it revolutionize transportation or science or satellite launches ?
Virgin is betting that it will .
In July , the company signed a $ 280 million deal with Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments for a 32 percent stake in Virgin Galactic .
The company is going to spend that money to find a way to use WhiteKnight Two — or perhaps an even bigger successor — to launch rockets carrying small satellites in the 100 - to 440 - pound range into orbit .
" We think there is a market for 100 launches a year , worth $ 300 million annually , " says Virgin 's Whitehorn .
But this fleet of space - tourist - carrying rockets will serve another purpose :
It will provide experience in how to operate a rocket routinely and safely .
Virgin likes to use the analogy of commercial airplane flight after Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic : A risky and exotic accomplishment suddenly expanded the horizon of what was possible , generating investment and rapid technological innovation .
Old - time rocketeers could n't disagree more .
The essential physics of Lindbergh 's flight and a Pan Am Clipper a few years later are the same .
But , they point out , the difference between sending SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of 68 miles and sending a satellite to low Earth orbit at 200 miles is staggering .
What Virgin is doing is significant , says John Logsdon , former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University , " but it does n't solve the technical problems that no one 's been able to solve for 50 years — of low - cost , reliable , and reusable transport to orbit . "
And he has his doubts that Virgin will be able to attract many customers in the small satellite market .
" It 's an act of faith , " he says , " like build it and they 'll come . "
If anything , Logsdon points out , the gap between lifting tourists into suborbital space and launching meaningful payloads into orbit might stimulate the industry simply by showing how hard it still is to get satellites up there .
In the meantime , back at Scaled Composites , pilot Peter Siebold has been doing a lot of flying .
" Look , " he says , resetting the simulator for another go , " this is a hop before the leap .
It 's not that technically significant — going to the moon was — but we 're putting all of this together into a package that allows the average person to experience spaceflight .
This is where it starts !

The belief that freedom and equality are at tension , or even opposed , is a pretty common belief amongst non-Anarchists .
I must say , to my great discomfort , that I used to believe in the false dichotomy of the individual versus society as well .
And then you get the rabid capitalist saying things like “ fuck society , ” as if he could live without society !
The fact of the matter is that , and capitalists should know this as much as anyone else , our production is directly and utterly dependent on the production of tens and hundreds of thousands of people in one ’s own society , and by indirect extension the society as a whole .
Our production literally cannot exist without everyone else ’s .
So anyone who says “ fuck society ” is either not conscious of what he is saying , or literally prefers , for some reason , to become a hermit ( in which case there is not much stopping him ) .
We cannot lead a flourishing life without some form of society .
That is an ironclad fact !
Human nature makes us crave company and support , because the human animal needs company and support in order to ensure his survival .
The same is true for a great number of animal species on this planet ( on the biology of mutual aid , see Mutual Aid , by Kropotkin ) .
So when the capitalist refuses to acknowledge the stake that society has over everything he does , as well as the fact that he only really contributes a sliver of the total productive power necessary for any of his products , he is being illogical .
When we separate something from the rest of society for our own exclusive use , we are being illogical .
The reason for the false dichotomy between freedom and equality is pretty simple .
It arises because capitalists claim that the foundation of freedom is the concept of property rights , but property rights are inherently tyrannical and anti-equality .
Let ’s examine , from this article against anarcho - capitalism , the contradiction in Rothbard ’s own words :
For example , leading “ anarcho ” - capitalist Murray Rothbard thundered against the evil of the state , stressing that it “ arrogates to itself a monopoly of force , of ultimate decision - making power , over a given territorial area . ”
Then , in the chapter ’s endnote , he quietly admitted that “ [ o ] bviously , in a free society , Smith has the ultimate decision - making power over his own just property , Jones over his , etc . “
“ Just property ” meaning , I assume , property that is acquired in accordance with property theory , not in accordance with justice .
Either way , one other thing I should mention is the part just after the first Rothbard quote , where he also says : “ If the State may be said to properly own its territory , then it is proper for it to make rules for anyone who presumes to live in that area . ”
This only illuminates the self - contradiction further .
If it is immoral for a government to “ arrogate to itself a monopoly of force , of ultimate decision - making power , over a given territorial area , ” then it is equally immoral for Smith or Jones to do the exact same thing .
Rothbard ’s reply , obviously , would be that Smith or Jones acquired their property “ properly , ” and the government did not .
But to the Anarchist ( at least , any Anarchist who actually believes in Anarchism and is not merely an apostle for the voluntaryist tyranny ) , this makes absolutely no difference .
It does not matter if the boot at your throat was stolen or bought “ properly . ”
It also depends on a person accepting capitalist property theory , where any amount of land can be owned without any occupation or work whatsoever , something which is very counter - intuitive and not at all natural .
As for the argument that one may change owners , this has as little weight as the argument that anyone who disagrees with a government should leave its territory .
The existence of other governments or owners , and the fact that one can pledge allegiance to them instead , does not refute the immorality of one government or owner , or the immorality of the government system or of property rights : when allowed , it merely alleviates some of its excesses .
The freedom of the voluntaryists ( who often claim to be the “ true capitalists ” ) includes the “ freedom to exploit others . ”
But that ’s not a freedom , any more than killing or hurting others is a freedom .
It is an invasion which must be repelled .
Of course the statists use ( and have always used ) this as an argument for the continued existence of poverty , unemployment , filling up jails , and so on .
We need these things to exist because freedom requires a certain level of inequality , you see , and those unemployed people should be happy that they are free to choose the kind of work they ’re not allowed to do , instead of being forced into the kind of work they ’re not allowed to do .
O hallowed liberty !
Let us look , therefore , at the reality .
People say things like “ government gives us freedom . ”
But this is almost trivially false .
We are all born with freedom , and a man isolated on a desert island , while being unacceptably poor and stranded from his fellows , is also absolutely free .
Suppose a small group of human beings were raised , somehow , alone on a desert island .
The actions they could perform are much narrower in scope than that of you or me , but the possibilities they would face would be almost endless compared to ours .
We want the best of both worlds : we want freedom and we want possibilities .
It is therefore almost an axiomatic fact that freedom can only be hindered by some exterior determinism .
How can such a thing be prevented ?
Obviously there will always be aberrated people who will try to exploit or hurt others .
But the more power and authority we vest in structures that are foreign to us , the more possibilities we give to these aberrated people ( those who are most likely to be attracted by the lure of power and authority ) to exploit and hurt us .
Inequality between individuals , coupled with the existence of hierarchical mechanisms that can be used to oppress , necessarily lead , in the immediate or the longer term , to exploitation and oppression .
The principle that inequality breeds oppression , and that equality prevents oppression and thus preserves freedom , is our basic principle linking equality and freedom .
Government does not preserve freedom by enforcing laws that ostensibly “ protect our rights . ”
There is no possible way for a government to protect rights , since enforcing any rule on people without their consent and with overwhelming force is itself a direct attack against their rights .
Speaking of one ’s rights in the absence of consent is nonsensical , since the concept of self - defense ( using violence in order to protect one ’s self , whether bodily or as extended into society ) is fundamental to the idea of rights , and self - defense is obviously a creation of the self , a self - determined action , not that of an exterior determinism .
Same for the idea that we “ delegate the enforcement of our rights to the government , ” which can only be true in the presence of consent .
More importantly , it is impossible for a government to “ protect rights ” because they are innate .
The only thing a government can do is suppress their expression through violence , intimidation and indoctrination .
They could only support their expression if they took their marching orders from the individuals they supposedly “ serve , ” but we know this is always a utopian assumption to make about any hierarchy .
No hierarchy does anything that its leading members do not believe is in their interests as a class .
Property rights present another powerful case .
Giving some people exclusive ownership over what used to be a commons , and then renting it to the people who were expropriated , in short to attack individual freedom , also creates extreme inequality , generates both masses of poor and new rich supporters of the regime .
This has been observed all throughout history , in England and its colonies , in America , and everywhere where capitalism has dominated .
People who are naturally free have their freedom taken away by a hierarchical mechanism ( in this case , the acquisition of property ) and now depend on that same hierarchy and that same mechanism for their salvation .
Obviously , there is no state of affairs in which freedom is never hindered anywhere .
But the degree to which freedom can be hindered in a society is proportional to the degree of inequality in that society .
An equal society promotes the fullest possible degree of value - expression .
One may not express such crude views as “ fuck society , ” while still rejecting the idea that society is important .
Certainly many people believe that society is nothing but a group of individuals , just as a forest is nothing but a group of trees .
This view is , of course , correct , but does not refute the existence of forests or societies .
The fact that all production is , after all , the production of individuals , does not refute our dependence to that production .
In fact , acknowledging the emergent nature of society can only lead us to value it more ; if we value every single individual , then we should also value the extension of their self towards others , and therefore society , which is nothing but the union of all of these extensions , if we ’re going to be logical about it .
All major Anarchist writers , from Spooner to Bakunin , have a deep respect for the relation between individual freedom and social autonomy .
Benjamin Tucker ’s concept of “ equal liberty ” is a particularly eloquent demonstration of this , his belief being that we should first seek to put everyone on the same level of liberty , and then maximize that level as much as possible .
COBURN REACHES OUT TO THOSE HE LOATHES ….
How desperate is Tom Coburn to derail health care reform ?
He ’s willing to reach out to the LGBT community .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) penned an op -ed for the online version of the LGBT magazine The Advocate , which was posted Monday and co-authored by Christopher Barron , the chairman of GOProud , an organization for gay conservatives . [ … ]
Coburn , who is a physician , and Barron referenced the example of rationing of certain critical AIDS treatments funded by the government as an example of why the public ( or “ government - run ” ) option currently contained in House and Senate health proposals would be detrimental .
“ These bureaucratic inefficiencies and mismanagement have literally cost lives , ” they wrote .
Now , Suzy Khimm notes the substantive flaws behind Coburn ’s argument : “ Coburn does n’t explain , of course , how the private market or his own reforms will succeed in making expensive AIDS drugs more affordable than the current Ryan White programs , other than repeating the line that insurers should n’t be able to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions . ”
But I ’m having a hard time getting over the fact that Coburn feels comfortable presenting an argument in The Advocate in the first place .
Coburn is n’t just right - wing on social issues ; he ’s arguably the single most anti-LGBT lawmaker in Congress .
During his Senate campaign , for example , Coburn told voters , “ The gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country , and they wield extreme power … .
That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today .
Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners ?
That ’s a gay agenda . ”
Around the same time , Coburn said “ rampant lesbianism ” forced schools to change their bathroom policies in southeast Oklahoma .
As he explained it , school officials will “ only let one girl go to the bathroom ” at a time .
Coburn urged voters , “ Think about that issue .
How is it that that ’s happened to us ? ”
And , of course , it was Coburn ’s chief of staff who recently declared that all pornography to “ homosexual pornography . ”
Khimm also noted that Coburn has voted against marriage equality and gay adoption , and even authored legislation “ that proposed to end anonymous testing for HIV / AIDS , requiring the names of those who tested positive to be reported to public authorities . ”
And now Tom Coburn wants the LGBT community to take his warnings about health care reform seriously , and take his word on what policies will “ cost lives . ”
I do n’t understand it , either .
Clone Wars returns tonight with a season that promises to be far darker than the last .
We 've seen several episodes from the new season and talked to the creators and cast about the new faces and moral shades of gray .

The Bounty Hunters
Last season , we met Cad Bane , the blue - skinned bounty hunter working for Ziro the Hutt .
And this season , the bounty hunters will take on a more central role , with Cad Bane and his fellows joining forces with the Separatists ( for a price , of course ) against the Jedi .
Clone Wars creator Dave Filoni says the bounty hunters have given them an opportunity to get away from the clones vs. droids formula , and give Anakin , Ahsoka , and the rest of the Jedi a more colorful set of foes .

In tonight 's two - part episode , Rise of the Bounty Hunters , we 'll see plenty of Cad Bane when the bounty hunter infiltrates the Jedi Temple to steal a Holocron .
You can also check out the concept art of Bane and the other bounty hunters we posted last week .

A New Padawan
Ahsoka is n't the only padawan fighting the Clone Wars , and this season we 'll meet Luminara Unduli 's padawan , Barriss Offee ( who also appeared briefly in Attack of the Clones and featured in the 2003 Clone Wars series ) .
With Barriss , Ahsoka gets a peer , and we will sometimes see how the two fare on missions together without their masters .
Barriss ' relationship with Luminara also provides a stark contrast to Ahsoka 's relationship with Anakin .
We 'll get to consider the pros and cons of Anakin and Ahsoka 's somewhat unorthodox relationship , and the consequences of Anakin 's fierce attachment to his padawan .

Shades of Gray
Although many members of the Clone Wars team said young fans appreciate the show because the heroes are the good that triumphs over evil , Filoni says we 'll see more shades of gray this season .
We 'll be breaking out of the clones good , droids bad mold , and exploring instances where our heroes do questionable things for what they believe is the greater good .
Anakin , notably , will do something that horrifies his fellow Jedi because he fears Ahsoka 's life is in danger , and we will start to see that slide that brought a once - committed Jedi to the Dark Side .

The Specter of Death
No , Ahsoka does n't die this season , and Ashley Eckstein , who voices Ahsoka , does n't know if her character 's fate is sealed .
But death is a very present force in the new season .
Ahsoka and Barriss will be confronted with the reality that being a Jedi may mean a short life for both of them .
And even as she 's accustomed to death as a part of war , Ahsoka will be forced to consider killing an innocent person to prevent an even greater tragedy .

Zombies
As we get closer to Halloween , expect a fun horror episode , one with shades of Night of the Living Dead and the Alien movies .
And , though zombified aliens are good for some gentle scares , there 's a monster in this episode far more frightening than the walking dead .

The one - hour Clone Wars second season premiere airs tonight at 8 pm on Cartoon Network .
Meats and Sausages
How to make sausage is a popular search query and many websites provide information about making sausages , however , they limit the discussion to making fresh sausage , which is a very simple product to make .
The goal of our website is to cover not only basic sausage making skills , but to offer instruction on making more advanced meats like fermented and dry sausages , liver sausages , head cheeses , smoked meats and fish , and making hams .
In Smokehouse Plans we offer basics rules for making meat smokers and smokehouses .
Meat smokers or smokehouses come in all sizes and shapes : barrel , drum , wood and paper box smokers , smokehouses made from bricks and concrete block , the design is limited by the builder 's imagination .
As long as smoke makes contact with meat , the meat will be smoked .
Smoking meats is easy , what is harder is to maintain high temperature inside the smokehouse in order to cook the product .
Wood logs , electric hot plate , or gas burner will provide sufficient heat as long as the smokehouse is well insulated .
If cooking inside becomes the problem , smoked meat can be removed from the smoker and the cooking may be accomplished in oven or pot with water .
Sausages can be divided into :
Ready to eat sausages
This group covers every other sausage type regardless how it was made ( smoked or not , cured or not ) or what meats and ingredients were used .
This group is further subdivided into : Cooked sausages that were submitted to 160º F ( 72 º C ) internal meat temperature before storing them .
Most sausages such as smoked sausages , liver sausages , blood sausages , head cheeses , emulsified sausages ( hot dog , bologna , mortadela ) , meat loaves and pates fit into this group .
There are sausages that are smoked and air dried a few times and the finished product can be classified as a semi- dry sausage ( Polish Kabanosy or Mysliwska - Hunter 's Sausage ) with a very good shelf life .
Given sufficient time and proper storage conditions they will lose more moisture becoming in effect dry sausages .
Fermented and dry sausages which can be either made by a bacterial fermentation or not .
Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of preserving meats .
Chopped or ground meat is mixed with spices , salt and sodium nitrite .
Starter bacteria is added and the mixture is stuffed into the casing , then it is allowed to ferment and dry .
The lack of moisture after drying and the developed acids inside cause pathogenic bacteria to die and the sausage can be safely eaten and stored for a long time .
Except semi - dry type they are not heat processed in any way .
When those sausages are intentionally fermented they develop a characteristic tangy flavor .
After ground meat is mixed with spices and curing ingredients , it is stuffed into casings and submitted to a carefully controlled , long , continuous air - drying process .
During that drying time the sausage loses much of its moisture and up to 40 % of its original weight .
In colder climates most dry sausages were subjected to cold smoking 50 º - 70 º F ( 10 º - 22 º C ) from 10 hrs to 3 weeks depending on the diameter of the sausage .
In moderate climate with steady prevailing winds ( Spain , Italy ) they were just heavily spiced and processed by long , continuous air - drying .
Today they are commercially produced in humidity and temperature controlled rooms .
Some known dry sausages are Spanish Chorizo , Pepperoni , Summer Sausage and Genoa Salami , American Jerky , South African Biltong .
Dry sausages do n't have to be refrigerated and when stored in cool conditions they almost have an indefinite shelf life .
Not ready to eat sausages
Fresh sausages are made from ground meat mixed with spices and stuffed into casings with the intention that the consumer will cook them prior to eating .
It does n't matter whether they will be baked , grilled , barbecued or boiled in hot water .
They can be cured or cured and smoked but they are never heated to 160 º F ( 72 º C ) inside meat temperature as recommended by the USDA .
The exception to the rule are the dry sausages described above .
Some sausages like Chorizo , Chaurice , Boudin and others are served in two ways :
As a meat patty ( hamburger shape ) fried on a pan with eggs or other dishes and obviously they are not stuffed into casings .
Stuffed into casings thus becoming a sausage .
In both cases it is the same meat with the same ingredients and final flavor that is prepared in two different forms .
American famous Breakfast Sausage is served at McDonalds ( Sausage McMuffin ) for breakfast and it looks like a hamburger though called a sausage .
The same recipe when stuffed into tiny links becomes Breakfast Sausage and is served in hospitals for breakfast all over the USA .

In fact , I think the studies that do look at Yum Brand 's products suggest otherwise .
Woodward goes further off base when he uses net profits to illustrate his point .
He ignores the medical benefit ratio and gross profits .
He ignores that the point spread between gross and net profits goes toward executive pay , stock warrants , corporate junkets to Hawaii and the such .
He ignores how multiple health insurance CEO 's make $ 12 million per year and get $ 73 millionwhen they quit their jobs .
The Hershey Company declared a 40 % gross profit for the 3rd quarter of 2009 and a net profit of 11 % .
Compare that to Cigna 's 2nd quarter for 2009 where they declared a 54 % benefit loss ratio ( a 6 % greater gross profit ) and a 10 % net profit .
Both companies are higher than the 6 % profit figure Woodward sites as " average " ( he should take a gander at Assurant ) .
If we were comparing apples to apples , Cigna could look like a better investment , but that 's the problem ; Cigna makes death panel decisions that kill people .
Hershey makes candy , not the most healthful food , but denying people access to chocolate does n't kill them .
Declaring that health insurers make on average a 6 % net profit does n't excuse health insurance company behavior .
Woodward 's apology continues :
That 's anemic compared with other forms of insurance and a broad array of industries , even some beleaguered ones .
Profits barely exceeded 2 percent of revenues in the latest annual measure .
This partly explains why the credit ratings of some of the largest insurers were downgraded to negative from stable heading into this year , as investors were warned of a stagnant if not shrinking market for private plans .
( emphasis mine )
Excusing health insurers because they make less than malpractice , car or home owners insurers leads me to think we need to look at the entire insurance sector more closely .
Woodward does n't consider the idea that the health insurance market is shrinking because health insurers are pricing their policies beyond what the market can bear .
He does n't discuss the fact that most markets are dominated by only 2 - 3 insurance companies .
He does n't consider the possibility that fee for service reimbursements fuel over utilization .
Nor does he explore why the net profits of health insurers are so low .
Could it be due to squandering the gross profits on a select few highly compensated employees ?
It certainly is n't due to an increase in approved health care claims .
The problem is that Woodward does n't think outside the Republican box if he 's capable of independent thought at all .
The points that no Republican , insurance company , health care lobbyist or Mr. Woodward can explain to me are :
" What benefit does it give me , the patient to pay an insurance company anywhere from 30 to 54 cents on the dollar for administering my health insurance when Medicare does it for 11 ? "
What 's in it for me to preserve a health insurance company 's ability to raise my insurance rates 100 % every 8 years ?
How is paying more for insurance and getting less health care making Americans more healthy ?
Why should we allow an individual mandate requiring me to buy insurance if there is n't a government sponsored Public Option available that will ensure that most of my premium dollars go toward health care claims ?
Mr. Woodward is so enamored with the morality of preserving the " free market " for health insurance that he can't see the consequences of murder by spreadsheet .
However , there 's more to comparing health insurance to Tupperware than simply looking at the 10 Q's .
Putting profits and financial analysis aside , there 's another reason comparing candy and Clorox bleach to health insurance is silly .
Unlike health insurance there is vibrant and robust competition among processed food , food storage containers and candy corporations .
The McCarren Ferguson
Act did not exempt these companies from anti-monopoly laws .
The individual states abdicated their role in controlling insurance companies from forming monopolies and oligarchies , but when it comes to candy bars they are on the ball .
You have a selection of at least a hundred different candy suppliers .
All you need to do is go to a dollar store to trade off quality for an alternative product to Tupperware that works reasonably well for a reasonable amount of time for 1/10th the price .
There 's few alternatives if you do n't like the insurance product your employer offers you and the current reform bills offer you nothing if you do n't take the insurance your employer offers you ( even if it wo n't cover the health problem you have ) .
Health insurers have too little competition , but Woodward does n't have that concept on his radar .
Insurers have had an open season on their customers for over 60 years and the federal government has exempted them from serious anti-monopoly regulation .
Whenever a conservative touts a market - driven solution for health care , they need to start with repealing the exemption insurance companies enjoy and writers like Woodward need to back up and look at the damage they are promoting .
Pooh pooing criticism of the " poor " insurance company that is only trying to make an " honest " buck as wrong because they do n't make any more money than KFC is either idiocy or lunacy .
It ignores the reality of what health insurers do in their standard operating procedures , which is kill people by rationing care according to your ability to pay for the care your insurance company denies you or kill people by corporate death panels .
That requires more than an apology .
It requires Congressional action .
Fighting fraud
Posted Thursday , October 8 , 2009 10:09 pm
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has taken a bit of abuse for being one of only seven senators to vote against defunding the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , better known as ACORN .
Last month , both houses of Congress quickly voted to deny federal funding to the community group after the now - infamous videos by young right - wing activists James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles .
The pair posed as a pimp and a prostitute and , with a hidden camera , went to a number of ACORN ’s tax preparation offices seeking tax and business advice .
Some ACORN workers were fired for what Sanders called " an outrageous and absurd discussion with a couple of actors , " but the attacks on ACORN stemmed from more than just the questionable activities of a few people caught on tape by people with an ideological ax to grind .
It was just the latest example of how conservatives insist upon accountability for the poor and powerless , while giving the wealthy and powerful a free pass when they do wrong .
ACORN is not a well - run organization , but it does the heavy lifting in community organizing efforts from voter registration to campaigns to raise the minimum wage .
It ’s this work on behalf the people at the bottom of the ladder that seems to enrage the right .

To put it into perspective , ACORN received about $ 53 million of federal funding over the past 15 years .
Meanwhile , Blackwater , the private military contractor to which the U.S.government has farmed out security duties , may owe the government as much as $ 55 million for allegedly failing to fulfill the terms of one of its federal contracts .
Yet Blackwater ( now known as Xe ) , a company that has five

of its employees facing murder charges in a massacre of Iraqi civilians in 2007 , got a $ 217 million contract from the Obama administration to provide security in Iraq .
Or how about KBR ?
The former Haliburton subsidiary got $ 80 million in contract bonuses to provide electrical wiring in Iraq -- wiring that has fatally electrocuted 16 soldiers and two contractors .
They have n’t been defunded by Congress .
According to the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight , the biggest three defense contractors -- Lockheed Martin , Boeing and Northrop Grumman -- have been cited 109 times for misconduct since 1995 and have been fined or reached settlements for $ 2.9 billion .
Yet these contractors keep getting government contracts .
The three companies pocketed $ 77 billion in government contracts in 2007 .

That why Sanders got an amendment added to the Defense Appropriations Bill , which focuses on defense contractors .
It would require the Department of Defense to calculate how much the Pentagon pays companies that commit fraud , and also would make the Pentagon recommend how to penalize contractors that repeatedly cheat the government out of hundreds of millions of dollars .
" Virtually every major defense contractor in this country has been engaged in systemic , fraudulent behavior , while receiving hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money , " said Sanders .
" I wanted to expose the hypocrisy of going after an organization that helps low - income people while doing nothing about defense contractors who have received many , many billions in defense contracts and year after year , time after time , violated the law . "
We agree with Sanders that if conservatives in Congress want to hammer ACORN for its misdeeds , that same standard ought to be applied to every other government contractor .
" Taxpayers want to know that the money we spend -- whether it is for defense , housing , education or any other purpose -- is spent as wisely and as cost - effectively as possible , said Sanders .
" The right - wing echo chamber has focused on ACORN , but I say we need to take on the big guys who have been ripping off the American people to the tune of billions and billions of dollars , and in some instances , produced defective equipment that has put the lives of American servicemen at risk .

Are Populations Being Primed
For Nano - Microchips Inside Vaccines ?
It 's almost surreal , like something out of a sci - fi flick , but nano - microchips invisible to the naked eye are a reality that are already being hosted in wide - range of applications .
The question is , how long will it take governments and big pharma to immerse nano - microchips inside of vaccines to tag and surveil global populations ?
Nanotechnology deals with structures smaller than one micrometer ( less than 1/30th the width of a human hair ) , and involves developing materials or devices within that size .
To put the size of a nanometer in perspective , it is 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair .
More than ten years ago , simple low - cost techniques improved the design and manufacture of nano - microchips .
That unlocked a multitude of methodologies for their manufacture in a wide - range of applications including optical , biological , and electronic devices .
The joint use of nanoelectronics , photolithography , and new biomaterials , have enabled the required manufacturing technology towards nanorobots for common medical applications , such as surgical instrumentation , diagnosis and drug delivery .
Japan 's Hitachi says it has developed the world 's smallest and thinnest microchip , that can be embedded in paper to track down parcels or prove the authenticity of a document .
The integrated circuit ( IC ) chip is as minute as a speck of dust .
Nanoelectrodes implanted in the brain are increasingly being used to manage neurological disorders .
Mohammad Reza Abidian , a post - doctoral researcher at the U - M Department of Biomedical Engineering said that polymers in nanotubes " are biocompatible and have both electronic and ionic conductivity . "
He further stated " therefore , these materials are good candidates for biomedical applications such as neural interfaces , biosensors and drug delivery systems . "
Depending on the objectives of such studies , research could theoretically pave the way for smart recording electrodes that can deliver drugs to positively or negatively affect the immune response .
Through nanotechnology , researchers have also been able to create artificial pores able to transmit nanoscale materials through membranes .
A UC biomedical engineering study appearing in the journal Nature Nanotechnology , Sept. 27 , 2009 , successfully inserted the modified core of a nanomotor , a microscopic biological machine , into a lipid membrane .
The resulting channel enabled them to move both single - and double - stranded DNA through the membrane .
Professor Peixuan
Guo who led the study said past work with biological channels has been focused on channels large enough to move only single - stranded genetic material .
" Since the genomic DNA of human , animals , plants , fungus and bacteria are double stranded , the development of single pore system that can sequence double - stranded DNA is very important , " he says .
Such engineered channels could have applications in nano - sensing , DNA sequencing , drug loading , including innovative techniques to implement DNA packaging mechanisms of viral nanomotors and vaccine delivery .
" The idea that a DNA molecule travels through the nanopore , advancing nucleotide by nucleotide , could lead to the development of a single pore DNA sequencing apparatus , an area of strong national interest , " Guo said .
Scientists working at Queen Mary , University of London , have developed micrometer - sized capsules to safely deliver drugs inside living cells .
These " micro shuttles " could hypothetically be loaded with a specific microchip controlling the dose of medication to be opened remotely , releasing their contents .
Besides monitoring the dosage , the same microchip could be used to surveil the patient in conjunction with various tracking systems .
Scientists in the United Kingdom have recently reported advances towards overcoming key challenges in nanotechnology .
They demonstrated how nanoparticles could move quickly in a desired direction without help from outside forces .
Their achievement has broad implications , the scientists say , raising the possibility of coaxing cells to move and grow in specific directions .
Doug Dorst , a microbiologist and vaccine critic in South Wales , says these advances have an immense appeal to vaccine makers .
" Biotech companies and their researchers have quickly moved most funding initiatives towards nanotechnology to increase the potency of their vaccines , " he said .
If microorganisms inside of vaccines can be coaxed into targeting or invading specific cells , they could achieve their goal at an accelerated rate over conventional vaccines .
" Depending on which side of the vaccine debate you 're on , whether pro or con , nanobots inside vaccine preparations could advance their effectiveness exponentially by either dramatically improving or destroying immunity depending on their design , " he added .
Dorst claims that present day nanobot technology could just as easily be used to advance biological weapons as they can to advance human health .
" For every fear that biotech propaganda proliferates about deadly diseases and how vaccines prevent them , it is one more lie to incrementally convince the masses that vaccines are effective . "
The worry for Dorst is that one day vaccines " will do what they 've always been intended for ... control of the global populace . "
Nanoemulsion platforms are already capable of developing vaccines from very diverse materials .
Mixtures of soybean oil , alcohol , water and detergents can be emulsified into ultra-small particles smaller than 400 nanometers wide ( about 1/200th the width of a human hair ) .
These could be combined with any number of nano - microchips with all or part of disease - causing microbes to trigger the body 's immune system .
In 2007 researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) announced in an article in the journal , Nature Biotechnology , that they had developed a nanoparticle that can deliver vaccines more effectively , with fewer side effects , and at a fraction of the cost of current vaccine technologies .
The article went on to describe the effects of their breakthrough :  At a mere 25 nanometers , these particles are so tiny that once injected , they flow through the skins extracellular matrix , making a beeline to the lymph nodes .
Within minutes , theyve reached a concentration of DCs thousands of times greater than in the skin . "
Russia has recently announced a new manufacturing plant that will strictly produce nano - vaccines .
Project plans include development of two vaccines for human flu and bird flu and three biopharmaceuticals for boosting the immune system and increasing the efficiency of antibacterial and antiviral drugs , among other initiatives .
The human body is very resistant to nanoparticles that attempt to invade human cells .
Scientists are intensely investigating methods to disrupt human enzymes that may degrade nanoparticles .
Experts at the University of Liverpool found a way around this obstacle that could mean more efficient , topical drugs in the future , which could act a whole lot faster than the ones currently in use .
All these nanotechnological advances raise many issues and concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials , and their potential effects on medicine , global economics , as well as speculation about government surveillance .
These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .
The Environmental Protection Agency issued a news release last week saying that it had today outlined a new research strategy to better understand how manufactured nanomaterials may harm human health and the environment .
Interesting as that strategy document is , it was hardly hot off the presses .
Indeed , many companies advertise their use of such billionth - of - a - meter - scale constituents as a measure of a product 's state - of - the - art status , implying that ultra-small ingredients are an inherently good thing .
They arent .
Nor does size necessarily make these materials worse than others .
At this point it 's just maddeningly unpredictable what nano things will do .
Proponents of nanotechnology are very critical of regulatory measures that may impeed its progression .
Many of these critics have staunchly dismissed concerns as being fear - hyped conspiracy theories based on science fiction .
In the popular video game series Metal Gear Solid , many characters and soldiers in general , have " nanomachines " in their bloodstream , and are used to block pain , allow members of fire teams / patrols to share sensory information , heal bodily damage , as well as manipulating viruses central to video game 's plot line .
Through the use of special effects and computer - generated imagery , several blockbusters starring Keanu Reeves including The Matrix Trilogy and The Day the Earth Stood Still , have dramatized how nanobots could effectively take control of their organic and inorganic targets .
Star Trek episodes and their theatrical releases such as Star Trek : First Contact have also depicted how nanoprobes ( nanites ) could infect an individual 's bloodstream through a pair of tubules .
Regardless of the recurring themes of nanobots in video games , sci - fi shows and movies , nanotechnology is a reality , and nano - microchips are well on their way to being utilized in ways which may be detrimental to human health and freedom on a global scale .
The development of nano - microchips are a major thrust of governments and pharmaceutical industries who want the ultimate power and leverage over global populations for more profit and more control .
In December 2000 , Former Chief Medical Officer of Finland , Rauni - Leena Luukanen - Kilde , MD stated that it is technically possible for every newborn to be injected with a microchip , which could then function to identify the person for the rest of his or her life .
Such plans are secretly being discussed in the U.S. without any public airing of the privacy issues involved .
Today 's microchips operate by means of low - frequency radio waves that target them .
With the help of satellites , the implanted person can be tracked anywhere on the globe .
Such a technique was among a number tested in the Iraq war , according to Dr. Carl Sanders , who invented the intelligence - manned interface ( IMI ) biotic , which is injected into people .
( Earlier during the Vietnam War , soldiers were injected with the Rambo chip , designed to increase adrenaline flow into the bloodstream . )
The 20 - billion - bit / second supercomputers at the U.S. National Security Agency ( NSA ) could now " see and hear " what soldiers experience in the battlefield with a remote monitoring system ( RMS ) .
When a 5 - micromillimeter microchip ( the diameter of a strand of hair is 50 micromillimeters ) is placed into optical nerve of the eye , it draws neuroimpulses from the brain that embody the experiences , smells , sights , and voice of the implanted person .
Once transferred and stored in a computer , these neuroimpulses can be projected back to the persons brain via the microchip to be reexperienced .
Using a RMS , a land - based computer operator can send electromagnetic messages ( encoded as signals ) to the nervous system , affecting the target 's performance .
With RMS , healthy persons can be induced to see hallucinations and to hear voices in their heads .
Every thought , reaction , hearing , and visual observation causes a certain neurological potential , spikes , and patterns in the brain and its electromagnetic fields , which can now be decoded into thoughts , pictures , and voices .
Electromagnetic stimulation can therefore change a person 's brainwaves and affect muscular activity , causing painful muscular cramps experienced as torture .
The NSA 's electronic surveillance system can simultaneously follow and handle millions of people .
Each of us has a unique bioelectrical resonance frequency in the brain , just as we have unique fingerprints .
With electromagnetic frequency ( EMF ) brain stimulation fully coded , pulsating electromagnetic signals can be sent to the brain , causing the desired voice and visual effects to be experienced by the target .
This is a form of electronic warfare .
U.S. astronauts were implanted before they were sent into space so their thoughts could be followed and all their emotions could be registered 24 hours a day .
The mass media has not reported that an implanted person 's privacy vanishes for the rest of his or her life .
S/he can be manipulated in many ways .
Using different frequencies , the secret controller of this equipment can even change a person 's emotional life .
S/he can be made aggressive or lethargic .
Sexuality can be artificially influenced .
Thought signals and subconscious thinking can be read , dreams affected and even induced , all without the knowledge or consent of the implanted person .
This secret technology has been used by military forces in certain NATO countries since the 1980s without civilian and academic populations having heard anything about it .
Thus , little information about such invasive mind - control systems is available in professional and academic journals .
The NSA 's Signals Intelligence group can remotely monitor information from human brains by decoding the evoked potentials ( 3.50 HZ , 5 milliwatt ) emitted by the brain .
Prisoner experimentees in both Gothenburg , Sweden and Vienna , Austria have been found to have evident brain lesions .
Diminished blood circulation and lack of oxygen in the right temporal frontal lobes result where brain implants are usually operative .
A Finnish experimentee experienced brain atrophy and intermittent attacks of unconsciousness due to lack of oxygen .
Targeting peoples brain functions with electromagnetic fields and beams ( from helicopters and airplanes , satellites , from parked vans , neighboring houses , telephone poles , electrical appliances , mobile phones , TV , radio , etc. ) is part of the radiation problem that should be addressed by democratically elected governments .
However , there is currently no interest by any national government to seriously address this issue .
The timeline for integrating nano - microchips inside of vaccines is speculative .
It could be just a few years , months or perhaps it is here and we already unaware of their integration within pharmaceuticals .
Regardless , due to the many military and political advantages , their implementation is inevitable .
However fraudulent , it was an imperative for world powers and pharmaceutical cartels to promote the effectiveness of vaccinations and enact national pandemic preparedness policies which mandate vaccinations .
In 2005 the World Health Organization ( WHO ) developed international health regulations that would bind all 194 member countries to pandemic emergency guidelines which could enforce such a mandate .
Without these procedures of public health ( and propagandized vaccine campaigns ) in place , there would be little or no voluntary cooperation from the public to roll up their sleeves and accept the inoculations .
Public participation is an essential tool that will soon allow big pharma to inject the most effective surveillence tool ever designed into billions of people .
Although nanotechnology manufacturing is currently available on a global scale , before biotech companies are able to initiate mass production and testing of nano - microchips inside of vaccines , they will likely sell the idea to the public .
Through various " health enhancement scenarios " they will encourage participation and publicly announce regulatory approval from the same policies and regulatory agencies they helped create .
By mid-summer of 2009 , the WHO and the Center of Disease Control ( CDC ) effectively hyped a false flu pandemic and convinced the world to submit to H1N1 vaccines .
Additional doses of propaganda and possibly a biological event , may equally convince populations to knowingly accept microchips inside of vaccines under the guise of a " greater good " for humanity .
When our brain functions are already connected to supercomputers by means of radio implants and microchips , it will be too late for protest .
This threat can be defeated only by educating the public , using available literature on biotelemetry , nanorobotics and information exchanged at international congresses .

Mom always told you not to play with your food .
She probably did n't tell you that you could get arrested for it though .
More than two dozen students , ranging in age from 11 to 15 years old , were arrested on criminal charges after a food fight in a cafeteria at a Chicago charter school .
According to reports , a good old - fashioned food fight broke out Thursday at the Perspectives Charter Schools in Calumet .
Someone tossed a piece of food , someone else threw an orange , someone yelled " Food fight ! , " and chaos ensued .
Twenty - five students were taken into custody at about 12 noon and charged with misdemeanor reckless conduct .
We remember when students were just sent giggling to the principal 's office .
But apparently , now some fries in the sky will earn a trip to the police station .
Who knew handcuffs came in an 11 - year - old 's size ?
To make matters worse , the students ' parents allege that police kept their kids at the Gresham District police station for over 5 hours before they were notified .
Parents are also concerned that the charges could affect future jobs and college applications .
Even if the charges are dropped , the offense will remain on the students ' juvenile records until they are 17 .
So remember , kids : a food fight is grounds for arrest .
Especially if you 're throwing Brussels sprouts .
Those are just nasty .

From the beginning , Immortal was never wrapped up in the typical Anti-Christian or Satanic Norwegian Black Metal scene .
Their lyrics have always been about the wrath of nature ( typically the variety featuring blisteringly cold winds ) , war , or a combination of the two .
But how exactly does this help them stand out in the Norwegian BM crowd ?
To me , the fact that their songs contain no Satanic content actually makes the music all the more intense ; Every other Black Metal band may rely on Anti-Christian themes to make their music as vicious as possible , but Immortal use the sheer icy tone of their lyrics to their advantage .
Absolutely everything , whether it be the production , Abbath ’s raspy shrieks and growls , or the claustrophobic riffs , has an unmistakable frozen quality to it that will chill you to your marrow with every single listen .
This is pure , unhindered Immortal ; this is Pure Holocaust .
From the very first opening riff of Unsilent Storms In The North Abyss , you know you ’re in for a ride .
It ’s actually rather catchy ( are they never ? ) , and at the same time has an air of icy evil that will carry on throughout the entire album .
There really are some classic , instantly recognizable riffs here ;
The first ones that come to mind are the opening charges of The Sun No Longer Rises , As The Eternity Opens , and Storming Through Red Clouds And Holocaustwinds , all of which feature simplistic chord structure yet have unconventional lead guitar riffs in the foreground .
These are a bit difficult to make out sometimes when the drums and rhythm guitar are so loud in the mix , but I personally prefer it this way as it gives them a much more ominous , stranded - in - a - blizzard like feel .
These moments do n’t last very long , though , and before you know it they ’re swept away by subzero winds and you delve into the meat of the tracks , which feature tons of effective Black Metal riffs .
There ’s so many of them that it ’s nigh impossible to point out only a few moments ;
Just pick a track and enjoy the ensuing blast of frozen wind .
At first , Pure Holocaust was quite difficult for me to get into .
Not because of the production ( which for a Norwegian BM release at the time was perhaps a bit above par ) , but because the album suffered from one of my biggest musical pet peeves :
Most songs start at a certain tempo , guitars plowing and blast - beats blazing , before the drummer realizes that he can’t pound alternately between bass drum and snare so fast for so long , and ultimately ends up slowing down drastically after only a few seconds .
It took a while for me to overcome my frustration with this , but once I did , it made the album IMMENSELY more enjoyable to listen to .
Pure Holocaust is the only album I ’ve listened to where this unintentional slow - down is actually a GOOD thing ;
It ’s akin to starting a long trudge through the arctic snow , and though you may start at a fast , determined pace , the freezing cold and relentless winds will eventually slow you down .
I always keep in mind when listening to Pure Holocaust , as it does much to help the album seem more like a Black Metal masterpiece rather than a case of poor musicianship .
Except for maybe the excellent follow - up to this album , Battles In The North , Pure Holocaust is the best pre-At The Heart Of Winter Immortal album .
Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism may have been their debut , but PH forever solidified the band ’s status as one of the more original and promising bands of the second wave of Norwegian BM .
This is where Immortal proved that they are indeed the true Blizzard Beasts , and the one and only Sons Of Northern Darkness ( Read the lyrics of Storming Through Red Clouds And Holocaustwinds if you need proof ) .
An absolute most - own for anyone who calls themselves a true Immortal fan !
This is the first major step in Immortal ’s career , and as Abbath proclaims in the title track :
The Holocaust has just begun !
" Ministers have been forced to order an emergency shutdown of a key Government computer system to protect millions of people 's private details .
The action was taken after a memory stick was found in a pub car park containing confidential passcodes to the online Government Gateway system , which covers everything from tax returns to parking tickets . "
That 's what it said in the Mail on Sunday on 2 November 2008 .
The " key Government computer system " in the frame is the UK Government Gateway .
STORK - information on your fingertips
That 's OK for us Brits , of course , we 're used to it .
Ever since the records of 25 million child benefit claimants went AWOL , we 've become inured to our personal data turning up in the strangest of places , including roundabouts , train carriages , laptops stolen from the boots of cars and disks going missing from secure sites in Iowa City .
But what about our poor unfortunate EU partners , with their quaint habit of keeping confidential personal and business data locked up where only the intended eyes can see it ?
The thing is that EU Ministers , including Gordon Brown , signed up unanimously to the Lisbon Declaration on 19 September 2007 : " In order to meet the need to exchange information across borders , such as those arising from the obligations of the Services Directive , Member States shall intensify efforts to achieve cross - border interoperability , the importance of which has already been highlighted in the electronic Identity and eProcurement areas .
" The objective of achieving interoperability applies equally to the implementation of Article 8 of the Services Directive which will be facilitated by interoperable and mutually authenticated electronic identities and electronic documents . "
And the vehicle for our end of all this EU interoperability is ... the aforementioned UK Government Gateway .
A serious organisation like the European Commission , having once established the need for cross - border data - sharing , sets about first measuring how well each country 's computer systems can communicate , and then sorting out any problems revealed .
And so was born Project STORK : " The ultimate goal of the STORK project is to implement an EU - wide interoperable system for the recognition and authentication of eIDs [ electronic identities ] that will enable businesses , citizens and government employees to use their national eIDs in any Member State . "
Never heard of it
David Davis raised a question in the House : " The Home Office is currently prototyping a Europe - wide project called Project Stork .
How are we going to prevent a repetition of the disaster of the last few weeks [ the disappearance of 25 million child benefit records ] when sensitive personal data is held not by one government but by 27 ? "
Jacqui Smith could n't answer the question .
She had never heard of Project STORK and asked for more details .
Here are some more details .
Although the UK Government Gateway is the responsibility of the Cabinet Office , as part of their joined up transformational government initiative , we are actually represented at Project STORK meetings by IPS : " The UK ’s Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) is leading the pilot project , in close co-operation with the Government Gateway , the UK ’s centralised registration service .
' It is about the eventual pan-European recognition of electronic IDs , ' noted an IPS spokesperson . "
Nothing to do with me , guv ...
Goodness knows why IPS is involved .
As James Hall , Chief Executive of IPS , has been at some pains to explain , Project STORK has got absolutely nothing to do with his main responsibility , the NIS : " Project Stork is not about ID cards , has nothing to do with the National Identity Scheme or providing data from the National Identity Register . "
But there it is - it 's IPS that faces the flak at Project STORK meetings , and not the Cabinet Office .
And quite some flak there must have been .
With the source code and the logon details having fallen into the hands of the MoS , and any number of other people , on their journey from that pub car park in Cannock , which French company wanting to do business in the UK can be confident that its data is held confidentially on the UK Government Gateway ?
Which Spanish pensioner retiring to Cannock and which Italian student coming to university in the UK can be calmly certain that his or her medical data is not available to the MoS ?
And which German civil servant seconded to the embassy in London can be assured that his or her tax details will remain private ?
According to our Prime Minister , none of them : " It is important to recognise we cannot promise that every single item of information will always be safe because mistakes are made by human beings .
Mistakes are made in the transportation , if you like in the communication , of information . "
But what does he know ?
A request was sent to Project STORK on 17 January 2009 seeking assurance .
The request was repeated on 9 March and 5 August , and an answer finally came through from the UK government , via the STORK Dissemination Team , on 25 August 2009 : " The loss of the storage device ( a USB stick ) by a supplier [ Atos Origin ] responsible for the service delivery of the Government Gateway , did not compromise the Government Gateway or give open access to the Government Gateway application . "
So there we have it : the Prime Minister is wrong , losing the source code and the logon details does n't compromise the UK Government Gateway , and our partners in the EU need n't worry , after all . ®
David Moss has been in IT for over 30 years and works as an IT consultant .
He has failed for over six years to convince the government that we already have ID cards , in the form of our mobile phones , but it 's early days yet - the standard gestation period is apparently 12 years .
While waiting for the government to have the original idea themselves that we do n't need the ID cards the Identity & Passport Service keep writing press releases about , because we already have mobile phones , he is trying to make people confront the evidence before their eyes , that the biometrics emperor has no clothes .
One of my favorite ways to trim money from my spending is to find simple little substitutes for my regular expenses .
If I can trim a few bucks from the cost of household supplies , routine purchases , and other things like that , over the long run , that can add up to a lot of money with virtually no change in my life .
Here are twelve of my favorites ( not including my “ infamous ” homemade laundry detergent ) .
Laundry Softener ->
Vinegar
Instead of buying expensive laundry detergent , just use half a cup of white vinegar to the “ softener ” cup in your washing machine .
It accomplishes the same effect as softener – it makes your clothes really soft – plus it breaks down the laundry detergent , making the clothes much better for people with sensitive skin or allergies .
What about the smell ?
Once the clothes are dried , you smell nothing at all .
You can buy four gallons of vinegar for $ 6 , meaning the cost per load is about $ 0.05 , while a load ’s worth of Downy costs about $ 0.15 .
You save a dime per load and your clothes are less chemical laden .
Ziplocs -> Reusable Containers
Ziplocs – especially the small ones – usually wind up in the trash after one use .
On the other hand , a reusable container can last for years .
Since a typical Ziploc costs about $ 0.10 and you can get a reusable Rubbermaid container for about $ 1.00 , you break even on the container after about twelve uses or so ( the cost of washing the container in the dishwasher is estimated there ) and everything thereafter is pure savings .
Dishwashing Detergent -> Simple Homebrew
Instead of using liquid or powder dishwashing detergent ( and paying a stiff premium for it ) , just take an old milk jug , put two teaspoons of liquid dish detergent and four teaspoons of baking powder in it , then slowly fill the jug with warm water , sloshing it while you do it ( even better , just slowly add the soap as you ’re adding the water ) .
Then put that jug under the sink .
Each time you do a load , fill up the cup with the homebrew .
It works like a charm .
The jug will provide enough for eight to ten loads of dishes for about a penny each , compared to about thirteen cents per load for ordinary detergent .
Knife Set ->
Chef ’s Knife
You ’re just getting started in the kitchen and you think it ’s time to get yourself a big ol ’ knife set .
Do n’t .
Unless you ’re doing crazy things in the kitchen , all day every day , you really only need one knife – a chef ’s knife .
Head down to your local retailer and check them out .
One good chef ’s knife will make kitchen work easier than an entire block ’s worth of other knives .
It ’s really all you need – I ca n’t even remember the last time I used a knife besides that one .
Just learn how to properly hone it and sharpen it ( both are easy – check out this YouTube video ) .
Windex ->
Vinegar
Seriously .
Just use vinegar instead of Windex when you clean your windows .
It cleans off almost anything on a window and does n’t streak and , more importantly , does n’t leave a film behind as Windex often does .
Just put some vinegar in a spray bottle – maybe that Windex one that you did n’t buy a replacement for – and just wash windows as normal .
You ’ll be quite happy with the results – and you ’ll save about a penny per squirt .
Paper Towels -> Reusable Cotton Cloths
Cotton cloths work better , absorb more , and you can get a five pound (! ) box for about the same price as a jumbo pack of paper towels .
But what about the WASHING ?
It ’s easy – just keep a ton of them in a drawer in the kitchen and use them for spills and filtering and other purposes until they ’re dirty , then just toss them into any load of socks or underwear or towels .
Even a big handful take up barely any room at all and before you know it , you ’ve refilled your supply .
Better yet , you ’re not buying any more paper towels and you ’re reducing your garbage .
Drain Cleaner ->
Baking Soda and Vinegar
Remember those nifty volcanoes that kids tend to make for science fair projects in grade school ?
The basic mixture that made them bubble up was baking soda and vinegar – it expands nicely and pushes itself into everything .
Perfect for clearing a clogged drain , no ?
Just put in a quarter cup of baking soda , chase it with half a cup of vinegar , then cover the drain and wait fifteen minutes .
Once that ’s done , chase it with a gallon or so of boiling water .
This will clean almost any drain and save you from blowing unnecessary amounts of money on a big bottle of Drano .
This also works as a toilet bowl cleaner – it ’ll foam up like crazy at first , but after fifteen minutes , you ’ll be able to scrub your toilet with a brush with ease .
Television -> Old Computer
If you need a new television somewhere , why not just use an old computer instead ?
A computer that ’s five years old with a ‘ net connection can easily be a substitute for a television .
You can watch tons of programs full screen on Hulu and many channels offer a full screen stream , too , plus it ’s simple to watch DVDs on a computer as well .
Even better , you can stow the box somewhere out of the way ( in a cabinet , perhaps ) and just leave the monitor somewhere easy to access .
This can be a great solution in a kitchen , where you can watch television on it or use it to call up YouTube videos to tutor you through a meal prep – plus you do n’t have the cost of buying anything to get it working .
Oven Cleaner ->
Ammonia
If you cook at home , you ’ll eventually have to clean your oven – and it can be a nasty job .
There are lots of products out there that claim to be able to make this process easy , but the easiest way I ’ve found is far cheaper – and far easier .
Just put a cup of ammonia in a glass bowl in the evening , put that bowl in your oven , and close the door .
Let it sit overnight .
The next morning , get rid of the ammonia and you ’ll find scrubbing down the inside of your oven is suddenly quite easy .
The burnt - on drippings from spilled dishes will come right up with no problems .
Plus , a jug of ammonia is far cheaper than some spray - on solution .
Soft Scrub -> Baking Soda and Dish Soap
Soft Scrub does a great job of cleaning up serious stains all around the house , but you do n’t need to drop four bucks on a small bottle of it .
Just put half a cup of baking soda ( cost : about a quarter ) and then add a little bit of liquid dish soap and stir .
Add a bit more liquid soap and keep stirring until you have a paste that ’s about the consistency of frosting – and you ’re ready to go .
It costs about forty cents to make more than enough to clean anything you want to clean – far cheaper than Soft Scrub and with the same results .
Air Freshener -> Baking Soda
I actually do n’t like most air fresheners – they usually make a room smell like chemistry .
Fortunately , there ’s a much easier solution – just put out a saucer with some baking soda sprinkled in it near where the odor is and it ’ll go away .
Got a baby diaper pail ?
Just put some baking soda in it .
Baking soda just eats odors .
Carpet Cleaner ->
Baking Soda and Peroxide ( or Club Soda )
Got a nasty spot on your carpet ?
( I could tell you a horrible story about a blood stain on a couch , but I ’ll spare you the details . )
You do n’t need carpet cleaner to get rid of it .
Just dump a few spoonfuls of baking soda on it , rub it in , then put some hydrogen peroxide ( a capful ) or club soda ( as much as you want ) on the soda and rub it in as it bubbles .
This gets rid of almost any carpet or upholstery stain you ’ll face – it literally saved some microfiber for us that seemed to have a permanent stain on it .
Plus , it ’s cheap – baking soda is really inexpensive and even club soda is something inexpensive you might have in the cupboard .
Prozac works wonders for some depressed people , but not for others .
In some cases , patients derive little benefit and at worst , it can lead to bizarre hallucinations and fits of rage .
Researchers and doctors remain puzzled as to what causes the wide range of reaction to Prozac and similar antidepressants .
The answer , Tel Aviv University researchers believe , can be found in a patient 's genes .
And if their research is successful , these scientists may be able to provide psychiatrists with a simple genetic test to revolutionize the treatment of depression .
Hunting for " the Prozac gene " ― its response biomarker , in science - speak ― is the foundation of a new Tel Aviv University project established by a unique biobank in TAU 's Sackler School of Medicine .
Initiated by the biobank 's director Dr. David Gurwitz , and his student Ayelet Morag , the researchers are attempting to discover reliable pharmacogenic markers for antidepressants such as Prozac .
" Many drugs for treating depression are on the market , " says Dr. Gurwitz .
" The most popular ones ― including Prozac ― are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) .
But they only work for about 60 % of people with depression .
A drug from other families of antidepressants could be effective for the other 40 % , " he says .
" We are working to move the treatment of depression from a trial - and - error approach to a best - fit , personalized regimen . "
A genetic basis for psychiatric treatment
Dr. Gurwitz says the key is in our genes , and the first step to unlocking the puzzle lies in discovering relevant biomarkers , the biological elements in blood or DNA that provide clues for disease or conditions such as blood glucose in diabetes , blood pressure in heart disease , and hormones released in pregnancy .
Clinicians already base treatments for cancer patients on genetic tests .
This has proven especially useful for breast - cancer , where drugs such as Tamoxifen or Herceptin are prescribed only after genetic tests show that they would benefit the patient .
" Why not embrace the same approach for treating depression ? " he asks .
" We 've designed an experiment to search for elements that can determine who will ― and who wo n't ― benefit from drugs such as Prozac , " says Dr. Gurwitz .
An effective response to " extreme responders "
The researchers will explore " whole - genome gene expression profiles " in cell lines from healthy people .
Since Prozac and similar antidepressants are known to inhibit the growth of blood cells , they are now screening a large collection of cell lines to determine which have the strongest and weakest growth - inhibition responses to SSRIs like Prozac .
Those cells that exhibit extreme responses will then be screened across the entire human genome , to find out which genetic make - up works best with SSRIs .
Dr. Gurwitz believes that among our 25,000 human genes , only a few hundred will show a difference between the two types of " extreme responder " cells .
In the next phase of their study , they will explore which of those " hits " can be valuable clinical biomarkers for the response to Prozac , a study that can subsequently be done by psychiatrists .
" Ours is a unique model because it does not make presumptions , " says Dr. Gurwitz .
" Research on Prozac response biomarkers over the past 20 years has focused on genes related to the brain metabolism of serotonin , long suspected as the cause of depression , " he adds .
" However , after many years of research with this focus , it is now obvious that the approach has failed .
We realize that we must look at the entire repertoire of human genes . "
" Psychiatric pharmacology remains a black box , " says Dr. Gurwitz .
" Nobody knows why some people respond to Prozac - type SSRI anti-depressants , while others are helped by other kinds of antidepressants .
The World Health Organization predicts by the year 2020 , costs and lost productivity from depression will exceed those of cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of health expenditure in developed countries .
We hope to produce a clear test for antidepressant drug responses to improve the odds for successful treatment . "

Not just for depression anymore
Canadian " Prince of Pot " Marc Emery turned himself in to Canadian authorities Monday and is in custody in Vancouver pending extradition to the United States .
The Canadian Justice Minister is expected to sign extradition papers within a matter of weeks , and then Emery will be driven to the border , handed over to US authorities , shackled , and sent to a federal detention center in the Seattle area .
Shortly after that , Emery is set to plead guilty to a single count of marijuana distribution , with an expected sentence of five years in a US federal prison .
Marc and Jodie Emery ( courtesy Cannabis Culture )
Emery and two employees of his cannabis seed selling business , Greg Rainey and Michelle Williams , were arrested in July 2005 by Canadian police honoring a US arrest warrant charging the trio with marijuana distribution and conspiracy for selling seeds to customers in the US .
They faced decades or even life in prison under draconian US federal marijuana laws .
Earlier this year , Rainey and Williams accepted a plea bargain in which they pleaded guilty to a single count and were sentenced to probation in Canada .
With his employees ' legal situation resolved , Emery then cut his own deal .
But that does n't mean he 's changed his ways .
At a press conference outside the BC Supreme Court in Vancouver Monday just before he turned himself in , Emery was in typical " Prince of Pot " form .
" I 'm disappointed in my government , but very proud of my ' Overgrow the Government ' revolution , " Emery told supporters .
" This terrible , insidious prohibition has been propped up by Liberal and Conservative governments for 45 years .
It 's a public policy with no public benefit , and it has caused so much misery , heartbreak , and torment for so many Canadians . "
Emery urged supporters to lobby the Canadian Justice Ministry to not sign his extradition order -- something that is admittedly unlikely -- or , barring that , to make the government pay at the polls in the next election .
" And if they do sign they must be punished in the next election , " he said .
In the event that he is imprisoned in the US , Emery is urging supporters to demand that he be returned to Canada to serve his sentence .
" I would be out on the streets in a year from now if I am transferred back to Canada as a first - time nonviolent offender in the Canadian system , " he told the crowd .
Emery showed no remorse -- in fact , quite the opposite .
" I 'm proud of everything I 've done ; I only regret that I was n't able to do more , " Emery continued .
" I did sell those seeds so people would overgrow the government , and I gave away $ 4 million that kick - started a worldwide movement .
I'm the ' Prince of Pot ' for a good reason .
And there is no victim here ; there are no dead people in my revolution . "
" Plant the seeds of freedom .
Overgrow the government , everyone , " Emery yelled as he was led away by sheriffs .
Beginning in the mid-1990s , Emery carved out a niche for himself as a cannabis entrepreneur and legalization advocate in Vancouver , but his activism extends back to his native Ontario , where , as a libertarian bookseller , he brought cases against Canadian censorship laws that then blocked magazines such as High Times from being sold in the country .
After moving to Vancouver , Emery set up the Cannabis Culture shop , Cannabis Culture magazine , and the Marc Emery Seed Company .
A constant gadfly to law enforcement and drug warrior politicians on both sides of the border , Emery 's mouth , his money , and his commitment to the cause enabled him to become one of the most well - known voices worldwide for ending pot prohibition .
Emery founded the BC Marijuana Party and crisscrossed Canada to spread the word about " Overgrowing the Government , " and profits from his seed sales help fund drug reform groups and activists in both Canada and the US .
That did n't win him any friends with the DEA or US federal prosecutors , who indicted him on marijuana distribution charges after busting some American growers who had obtained their seeds from him .
Then DEA head Karen Tandy crowed over his arrest , describing it as a blow to the legalization movement , but then quickly backtracked in the face of accusations that his arrest was politically motivated .
While Emery is behind bars awaiting extradition to the US , his friends and supporters are mobilizing .
Their immediate objectives are three - fold : to urge the Justice Minister to refuse to sign the extradition papers , to urge the US sentencing judge to give him a short or non-custodial sentence , and , in the event he is sentenced to prison time in the US , to urge the Canadian Public Safety Minister to approve his transfer to a Canadian prison .
To that end , supporters have set up a web site , No Extradition , with instructions on how to contact the relevant authorities .
They are also planning vigils at Emery 's current BC jail digs and a demonstration in Seattle when he arrives there for sentencing .
" We 're planning it right this second , " Seattle Hempfest executive director Vivian McPeak said Thursday .
" It 's kind of difficult without having a date certain , but we 're trying to get it so we 're ready to go when it happens .
There will probably be a rally at the federal courthouse , " he added , noting that protest information would be posted on the Hempfest web site after tomorrow .
" This is terrible , " said Jeremiah Vandemeer , an editor at Emery 's Cannabis Culture magazine , which recently switched from print to an all online format .
" It is an affront to Canadian sovereignty that Marc will be handed over to the US government and its prison system .
If he committed any crime , he should have been prosecuted here in Canada . "
In fact , Emery has been prosecuted in Canada for his seed sales , back in 1998 .
In that case , he was fined $ 2,000 , with not a day of jail time .
Since then , the Canadian government had been happy to ignore his seed sales and accept his tax payments from his seed business .
" It 's terrible to see my friend and boss put behind bars for something in which there are no victims , " said Vandemeer .
" It 's difficult , but we 're getting through it , and we all have that extra resolve to work that much harder to get him back home . "
Emery 's young wife , Jodie , will be playing a key role , both in keeping Cannabis Culture and the Cannabis Culture Shop going and in waging the campaign to win his release .
" Our campaign is about Free Marc Emery , but this is really about freeing everybody in prison for cannabis , " she said Wednesday .
" There is a lot of pressure up here , and different political actors are starting to voice their support , " she said .
" There is all sorts of activism , and it 's just starting .
We will start holding vigils outside his prison beginning Saturday and going on every day after that .
We 're having postcards made today that people can send to flood the ministers with mail .
I 'm hearing that the Minister of Justice 's office is being flooded with phone calls , and people are pledging that they will call every day . "
But while Jodie Emery the cannabis activist is planning the campaign , Jodie Emery the figuratively widowed wife is feeling the pain .
" It 's horribly rough , " she said .
" During the day , I can keep busy .
It 's only when I get home and I 'm alone and I realize that he 's gone that it really hits me .
I cry a lot , " she confessed .
" Even if you think Marc is a loudmouth or got what was coming to him , think of what it does to the people who love him . "
Sensitized by her experiences , Jodie Emery is broadening her activism .
" This has motivated me to start speaking up for the families of prisoners , " she said .
" There are hundreds of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders in prison right now , nameless and faceless except to their loved ones .
I want to speak up for all the drug war widows .
We want to put faces and names to the people suffering endlessly year after year . "
The historical record will show that Marc and Jodie Emery know how to wage a campaign of agitation .
Now , the question is whether they can use those skills to raise awareness not just of the injustice done to Emery , but to all the rest of the drug war incarcerated .
She is a striking brunette with a decidedly outspoken attitude .
She lambasts President Barack Obama as a socialist and has become the darling of America 's right - wing activists who flock to her appearances .
She is hated by liberals and loved by conservatives .
Sarah Palin ?
Not quite .
Meet Michele Bachmann , a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota who is being hailed as a new and increasingly powerful voice in American politics .
Bachmann , at 53 , is a darling of the so - called Tea Party movement , which has campaigned vociferously against healthcare reform , the economic stimulus package and legislation to combat climate change .
Her followers have been behind mass rallies in Washington and smaller ones all over the country .
She has emerged as one of the most visible politicians in America , frequently appearing on the conservative Fox News channel , whose hosts often champion her causes .
She is part of an increasingly visible " female brand " of conservatism that is rising in America in the wake of the election of Obama .
They include notable syndicated commentators such as Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter , whose dislike for liberals has grown ever more shrill in recent months .
And , of course , Palin herself .
She is still a giant of the political and media landscape and next week embarks on a book tour to sell her autobiography .
It has already sparked a media frenzy , with a heavily hyped appearance on Oprah Winfrey 's show , and become a huge bestseller on pre-orders alone .
All these women express a mood of conservative discontent that is becoming increasingly vocal and , some experts warn , extreme .
The Republicans have been kicked out of power in the White House and Congress .
The party is becoming more white and southern at the same time as national demographic changes give power to other regions and minorities .
Many Americans are also suffering in the recession .
That is a grim picture but one that also makes many voters vulnerable to a talented rabble - rouser .
" They are tapping into grassroots frustration ... they are charging up an already highly charged group of people , " said Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside .
The politics espoused by Bachmann , Palin and others on the far right of the conservative movement warn darkly of Obama 's intentions .
They paint a picture of an America that is under threat from its own president .
Bachmann has spoken of the possibility of the White House setting up " re-education camps " for America 's youth .
Palin once accused Obama of " palling around " with terrorists .
To the many critics of this new breed of conservatism , people such as Bachmann and Palin are putting an attractive female face to a very ugly brand of politics .
The crowd gathered in Washington DC on 5 November had answered Bachmann 's call .
Using Fox News and her own press announcements , Bachmann had demanded that conservative activists descend on the nation 's capital to invade the corridors of Congress and demand that politicians stop healthcare reform .
Thousands of people did just that , showing up for a mass rally .
They chanted : " We want Michele ! "
Many liberals criticised the protest as a failure .
But from Bachmann 's point of view that was hard to see .
The move catapulted her to the front of the Republican party as politician after politician showed up to address the crowd .
She was a fixture on cable news all day .
In the short space of a couple of years Bachmann had gone from obscure congresswoman to national media figure .
But out in the crowd the ugly face of some modern conservatives was not hard to find .
There were 12 arrests .
One protester wore a mask of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with handfuls of bloody foetuses .
Another protester held up a picture of piles of Jewish corpses from Dachau concentration camp .
" National Socialist Healthcare " , the sign read .
Bachmann later condemned those who had made Holocaust references at the rally .
But even a cursory glance at her career reveals that this rising star has long trafficked in some extreme positions .
In October last year Bachmann called some of her fellow congressmen anti-American .
She has said Obama holds socialist views .
She has attacked global warming by saying that carbon dioxide emissions are a natural part of the atmosphere .
" Carbon dioxide is not a harmful gas , it is a harmless gas , " she said .
She has fed into fears of a violent backlash against Obama by saying that " having a revolution every now and then is a good thing " .
She has spoken of " gangster government " in a speech viewed more than two million times on the internet .
She has dubbed Obama 's plans to increase AmeriCorps – a government volunteer service group – as a plan to forcibly indoctrinate young people .
" I believe there is a very strong chance that we will see young people put into mandatory service ... there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people , " she told an interviewer .
Her language in opposing healthcare reform has been bloodcurdling .
At a recent event in Colorado she told her audience : " What we have to do today is make a covenant , to slit our wrists , be blood brothers on this thing .
This will not pass .
We will do whatever it takes to make sure this does n't pass . "
She is also extremely socially conservative , strongly opposing abortion and gay marriage , and deeply religious .
She has described herself as a " fool for Christ " .
Such extreme statements and beliefs have made Bachmann a figure of both fun and fear among liberal Americans , especially in her home state of Minnesota .
" It is hard to think that people take her seriously .
But on a national level it is happening .
It scares me , " said Aaron Landry , a senior correspondent at MNpublius.com , a Minnesota - based politics blog .
But what makes liberal Americans laugh or cry has got the conservative wing of the Republican party extremely excited .
In an article that sent shockwaves through America 's political classes , top conservative newspaper columnist George Will recently wrote a piece anointing Bachmann as a new star of the movement .
" Some of her supposed excesses are ... not merely defensible , they are admirable , " Will wrote .
It is easy to see why Bachmann is being so enthusiastically embraced by conservatives .
The high profile of Palin showed the impact a charismatic , young conservative woman could have on the right wing of the Republican party .
" Politics on the right used to be a parlour game played by old , white men , " said Bowler .
Palin changed that and Bachmann has followed .
They have replaced the dulcet tones of grey - haired Washington senators with Midwestern vowels and Alaskan twangs .
They have risen swiftly through careers forged a long way from Washington , wearing their outsider label as a badge of pride .
They have given conservatism the look of a middle - American suburban soccer mom with first - hand experience of raising a family in tough times .
That is certainly much of Bachmann 's appeal .
She was born in Iowa and then moved to Minnesota .
When her parents divorced , her mother was left to fend for herself .
Bachmann has known what it means to scrimp and save to get by .
But she made a success of herself .
She and her husband now run a small business in mental health and she is the mother of five children .
She has also given foster care to a staggering 23 kids .
Political legend has it that her career began when she spoke out at a local Republican party meeting after her state senator had shifted his politics in a liberal direction .
When asked by others in the crowd if she herself should try to unseat the incumbent , she gave a speech that so excited those assembled that she was plunged into the race , which she went on to win .
It was the unlikely start of a career that has now come to national prominence .
But Bachmann – and Palin too – are more than just individual politicians .
They have come to represent a mass social movement that stretches far beyond just turning up on election day .
It is no coincidence that both Palin and Bachmann have inspired lines of T - shirts , coffee mugs and action figures for their fans to snap up .
That movement first made its appearance during John McCain 's rallies after he picked Palin for his running mate in the 2008 election .
The choice electrified what had been a fairly moribund campaign .
Suddenly crowds of thousands were turning out to Republican rallies , as well as Democratic ones .
They were there to see Palin , not McCain .
Palin's brand of homespun wisdom , rooted in uber - patriotism and killer heels , was a breath of fresh air that conservatives had been looking for .
So were unashamedly conservative views and a willingness to state bluntly what she thought about Democrats .
Palin 's subsequent self - destruction in a series of media interviews only served to make her more popular .
Indeed , to examine the impact of both Palin and Bachmann is to see an America split firmly into two different worlds .
The first is a liberal one where such politicians make outlandish comments that become the butt of jokes on the Daily Show or Saturday Night Live .
The other is one where Palin and Bachmann are the victims of a liberal media that hates its own country .
" For their supporters , attacking Palin and Bachmann actually gives them the proof that they are the victims that they already believe themselves to be , " said Bowler .
To the conservative mind - set , these women are truth - tellers who are viciously attacked precisely because of the validity of the message that they are carrying .
That side of the great American divide is about to get a prolonged period in the sun .
This week Palin begins her book tour , touting her autobiography .
It is already a massive hit and leaks have hit the internet , generating stories and gossip .
Palin is set to talk about her feelings about her daughter 's pregnancy , dish dirt on McCain and his aides and slam the very same media that once slammed her .
Her tour is like a mini political campaign .
She and her family are set to travel by bus across America as she shuttles from stop to stop .
She is also shunning large cities such as New York and instead going to small towns and out - of - the - way states .
It is a stunning reversal of the situation after the McCain - Palin ticket lost , when McCain 's staff tried to distance themselves from Palin and blame her for the defeat .
But now McCain , hated by many conservatives , has retreated quietly to the Senate , while Palin powers from strength to strength .
But the political future is not likely to belong to Palin .
The trouncing that she received in the media during the presidential election campaign and the fact she currently holds no office have rendered her political power symbolic .
Though it is not impossible , it is hard to imagine Palin launching a credible run in 2012 .
But what she has done is pave the way for an extremist conservative candidate to emerge as the Republican nominee .
The excitement coursing through the conservative movement , and the power wielded by its media stars such as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck , has made selecting any sort of moderate very difficult .
Palin 's legacy could be to place the 2012 nomination in the hands of the people who supported her .
Could that recipient be Bachmann ?
It is an outside bet .
But Bachmann has spoken of it , couching the question in religious terms that are deeply familiar and beloved of her followers .
" If I felt that 's what the Lord was calling me to do , I would do it , " she told one conservative website of her potential presidential ambitions .
Such comments have filled liberals with scorn and fear .
" Most people do n't think she can have presidential ambitions .
She 's too crazy , " said Landry .
" But a lot of people in Alaska thought that about Sarah Palin . "

Barack Obama acknowledged today that time has run out to secure a binding climate deal at Copenhagen and began moving towards a two - stage process that would delay a legal pact until next year at the earliest .
During a hastily convened breakfast meeting in Singapore , the US president supported a Danish plan to salvage something from the moribund negotiations by aiming for a broad political agreement and postponing contentious decisions on emissions targets , financing and technology transfer .
While this falls short of hopes that Copenhagen would lock in place a new action plan for the world , it recognises the lack of progress in recent preparatory talks and the hold - ups of climate legislation in the US Senate .
" There was a realistic assessment … by the leaders that it was unrealistic to expect a full internationally legally binding agreement to be negotiated between now and when Copenhagen starts in 22 days , " said Michael Froman , deputy national security adviser for economic affairs .
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen , the host and chairman of the climate talks , flew overnight to Singapore to pitch the deferral plan to 19 leaders , including Obama and Chinese president Hu Jintao , at an unscheduled event during the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation summit .
He insisted that the Copenhagen talks could still set political targets and outline commitments .
" Given the time factor and the situation of individual countries we must , in the coming weeks , focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " he said .
" The Copenhagen agreement should finally mandate continued legal negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion . "
Obama was said to have spoken in support of the proposal , cautioning the group not to let the " perfect be the enemy of the good " , Froman said .
The proposal by Denmark , the host and chair of the climate talks , would set the stage for a political accord at Copenhagen next month and the setting of a new deadline for countries to agree on targets , levels of funding and verification of commitments .
This would give breathing space for the US Senate to pass carbon - capping legislation , allowing the Obama administration to bring a 2020 target and financing pledges to the table at a UN climate meeting in Mexico or Germany in mid-2010 .
It was unclear if China , the world 's biggest emitter , supported the delay , but other leaders said there was little choice .
" Leaders … were clear in their view that the current officials - led process is running into all sorts of difficulties , and therefore it is time for leaders , politically , to step in , " the Australian prime minister , Kevin Rudd , told reporters after the meeting with Rasmussen .
" It 's going to be tough as all hell , but let me tell you I believe everyone is seeking , right now , to put their best foot forward , and that was reflected in what transpired around a small table of 20 world leaders this morning . "
The extension of the process is not unexpected , given the flurry of downbeat statements by world leaders in recent weeks .
It may avoid a total breakdown at Copenhagen , but the delay has frustrated those who feel time is running out to prevent calamitous levels of climate change .
" Heads of states must go beyond simply discussing the problems .
They have to start solving them , " said Diane McFadzien of the Worldwide Fund for Nature .
She noted that the APEC leaders deleted emission reduction targets in their final declaration .

The thing that you sort of need to admire about the copyright maximalist lobby is that they attack the problem from so many different directions on such a constant basis .
It 's almost impossible to keep up -- though , you do begin to notice some patterns .
A particularly popular move is to alternate between the moral argument against copyright infringement ( stealing ! bad ! ) and the idea that file sharing is going to destroy your computer ( we 're just looking out for your safety ! ) .
It looks like the industry is back on that latter kick , as two recent stories indicate .
First , the BSA has its widely debunked " piracy " numbers -- but it 's now getting news for focusing instead on how you 're going to get malware if you file share .
Since it can't actually back up its bogus numbers , instead it 's hoping that most people do n't know that correlation does n't mean a causal relationship -- but at least we know that most of our readers know better .
The report notes that there 's a correlation between higher piracy rates and higher malware infections , but seems to totally ignore exceptions to that rule ( the US ) or delve into other variables that may explain either the piracy rate ( already questionable ) or the malware rate ( education levels ?
poverty ?
shared computers ? etc. ) .
Even more amusing , they claim ( with no actual evidence ) that those who get malware have to spend more to repair their computers than it would have cost to get the legitimate software in the first place .
I have no doubt that there are risks for those who file share , but this report does nothing to show the actual risks and is yet another in a long line of weak propaganda from the BSA , that despite being called on it for years , never seems to doto back up its reports with facts .
Then , we have the story of the MPAA apparently sending a bunch of anti-piracy comic books to New Zealand , home of one of many different fights on how to change copyright law .
The comic book , like the BSA report , involves plenty of ridiculous and unsubstantiated claims about how file sharing will unleash nasty malware and viruses all over your computers -- but drawn in nice comic book form .
Can we send those kids who got the MPAA comic book a copy of the Tales from The Public Domain comic books as well ?
There are free digital downloads for anyone who wants to hand them out in exchange for the bogus MPAA ones ....

I 'm a programmer .
I understand Perl .
I 'm comfortable configuring , building , installing , patching , reporting bugs in , distributing , and depending on Perl .
If there 's a problem , I can report it .
Sometimes I can fix it .
I want to be able to depend on the fix for my problem and I want it soon and I want it available for everyone who depends on the code I wrote .
There 's my perspective .
Suppose instead that I were a mere distributor of Perl -- and not because my product depended on Perl in any way , but that I hope that users might be able to make products which depend on that Perl .
My business is n't supporting Perl .
I might occasionally report bugs and feature requests upstream .
I might feed upstream patches once in a while , if I have a unique platform , but Perl and Perl support is less important to my business than many , many other things .
I 'm not making this up ; Nokia 's Maemo deliberately ships Perl 5.8.4 and has no plans to upgrade .
I can understand their position , in some ways .
They have every legal right to do this .
Perl 's Artistic License asserts no conditions on use ( and few conditions on redistribution ) for good reason .
Even so , I find the argument that it 's risky to switch to a new version on its own unconvincing .
The word risk alone is insufficient justification for an action or inaction .
The important questions are " What are the risks ? " , " How likely are they ? " , " What consequences do they suggest ? " , and " How can we identify and ameliorate the risk conditions ? "
Certifying and validating and demonstrating that an upgrade to a dependency works as expected and does n't introduce new , serious problems for users .
Sure , the existing version has hundreds of bugs that p5p have fixed in the past five years , but new versions of Perl may have other bugs .
The difference between does and may in that line of reasoning irritates me .
I do n't have specific numbers for Nokia and Maemo .
I 'm not privy to private communication between company , project , and specific Perl 5 developers .
I do n't want to single anyone out for good or bad behavior here .
I chastise in general terms .
I could be wrong about specifics ; as such , I welcome specific corrections .
Users will find bugs .
Users will find problems .
Users will report some .
Users wo n't report others .
These are truisms .
A distributed version of Perl , especially a version of Perl distributed to users via a conduit such as Maemo , reaches more and different people than a source release of Perl 5.11 intended for developers .
The more people who use Perl in different ways on different platforms , the more likely they are to find different bugs .
We know that Perl 5.8.9 has many bug fixes over Perl 5.8.4 .
Anyone who cares to delve into the RT queue and commit log for Perl 5 can give a count of exactly how many .
( Start by reading the Perl 5.8.x delta documentation for hints about the most interesting bug fixes . )
We do n't know if and how many new or re-opened bugs Perl 5.8.9 has over Perl 5.8.4 .
We believe that number is zero .
We hope that number is small .
Without feedback , we do n't know .
I can understand that upgrading dependencies in a distribution -- dependencies not necessarily intrinsic to the core product -- requires testing .
It requires deliberate thought about risk and benefit .
It also ought to require attention to upstream 's release cycle and support policy and backwards compatibility .
Picking an arbitrary release on a branch created explicitly for bug fixes , maintaining backwards compatibility with all prior branch releases , and containing an extensive test suite devoted to identify and diagnose any failures -- especially when there have been five subsequent releases on that branch ( and two other stable releases since then ) and that branch itself has explicitly disclaimed future support for almost a year -- well , that 's one way to avoid risk .
( It 's also a good way to avoid performance improvements , memory use improvements , Unicode bug fixes , huge regular expression performance improvements , and more in 5.10 .x .
You might also wonder how many CPAN distributions want to support anything older than Perl 5.8.8 .
Note that if Perl 5 had had yearly major releases starting in 2004 , we'd be discussing the difference between Perl 5.8.4 and Perl 5.18.x. )
Pegging a five year old Perl 5 release is well within the letter of the license as well , but I think it stretches the boundaries of the spirit of working with a free software community .
A security guard checks my driver 's license as I drive into the entrance to Moffet Field , a disused naval airbase that hosts the nascent Singularity University .
Night has fallen , but it still feels like entering a top - secret installation out of a James Bond movie , crowned by with strange domed buildings and adorned by sculptures of airships .
The Singularity University Executive Program is small — one - to - one staff / faculty ratio , according to executive director Salim Ismail , formerly of Yahoo's tech hothouse .
Inside an elegantly appointed palace , some 30 students assemble , a bright , well groomed group of 30 - to 50 somethings representing a dozen industries and nearly as many countries .
The SU administrators shoo the crowd into an adjacent room where rows of chairs have been arranged to face Raymond Kurzweil 's slide show .
After introductions from Ismail and X - Prize founder Peter Diamandis , who is clearly the driving force behind the school , Kurzweil steps in front of the assembled students .
He 's a surprisingly unimposing character , a sort of Walter Mitty for the Facebook age .
A casual mention of pills leads him to root around his pockets , looking for the vitamins , minerals , and who - knows - what he pops hourly to slow down the aging process so he can live to see the Singularity - the moment when machines overtake human intelligence and human history shifts into hyperdrive .
He begins by taking on his critics , which he does periodically throughout the address .
" They say , Kurzweil underestimates the complexity of — fill in the blank .
I agree with critics about the challenge .
I disagree about the power of the tools we 'll have to solve the problems at hand . "
The essential point is that humans are geared to linear change — say , an elephant charging across the African veldt .
But evolution — both biological and technological — happens exponentially , clouding our view of the future .
Exponential change is inherently counterintuitive , so we underestimate its power .
" 30 steps linearly is 30 steps , " he says .
" 30 steps exponentially is a billion . "
For the next half hour , Kurzweil rifles through graph after graph showing how technology is changing exponentially — in all fields , in all eras .
It 's a compelling presentation that leaves the audience slack - jawed .
Some are resistant , though .
What happens when terrorists have the same capability to re-engineer viruses that makes it possible for medical science to disable them ?
Wo n't politics and economics to derail technology ?
What about capital — does it grow exponentially as well ?
The futurist deftly swats down such questions like so many pesky mosquitos .
Concerns like that arise from linear thinking .
A quick look at history confirms that human problems stimulate technological solutions that then yield further exponential evolution .
I 'm not entirely convinced , but it 's hard to disagree with the man 's logic .
Kurzweil poses for some group photos and then runs to catch the next flight back to his home near Boston .

Murphy , Anne L. ( 2009 ) Trading options before Black - Scholes : a study of the market in late seventeenth - century London .
Economic History Review , 62/1 : 8-30 .
The ledger of the financial broker Charles Blunt contains the details of some 1,500 transactions realized between 1692 and 1695 , about a third of which regard the then novel trade in equity options ( p.9 ) .
The technique had arisen in the 1620s in the commodity market and was proving very useful in the decade following the Glorious Revolution , when some 100 joint - stock companies were floated in London ( p.10 ) .
During the boom of the early 1690s , it is likely that “ several thousand derivatives were transacted each year ” .
Various strategies
Four out of five options traded were calls ( i.e. the right to pursue a share at any time during a given period , usually 6 months ) and at - the - money ( i.e. for the price of the share at the time of the agreement ) .
“ It is likely that they were transacted to take advantage of an anticipated price move associated with a specific future event ” ( p.12 ) .
Most of Charles Bunt ’s clients were not professionals , for them using a broker was the only way to find a buyer .
However many of these amateurs did in fact engage in option trading .
“ It is important to acknowledge the diversity of those who dealt in options .
A market cannot exist unless it attracts participants with varying needs and attitudes towards risk , nor will it survive if it cannot accommodate those needs . ”
The purchase of an option was often perceived as a sort of insurance as one ventured in a new company ( p.14 ) or foresaw coming troubles .
In this case the sellers ’ premium really acted as an insurer ’s fees .
It was understood however that the safety offered was not complete and one could takes losses ( p.16 ) .
Moreover , options offered a speculator ’s the opportunity to take position without paying the full amount of the shares upfront , a welcomed characteristic in time of monetary instability .
It was also a good way to preserve one ’s profit .
Shared values
The shares emitted by the company were at times in such limited numbers that a single player could easily influence demand and share price using derivatives ( p.17 ) .
Much worse : the existing statistical methods that could have been used to determine the options value were most certainly ignored by the practitioners ( p.19 ) .
This shortcoming may have proved highly problematic , however Charles Blunt ’s ledger indicates the actors seems to have intuitively agreed on a number of elements used in the valuation of the options ( even if these elements actually elude us ; p.21 ) .
Even for volatile stocks , pricing response to increasing or decreasing uncertainty appears to have been consistent over time .
“ That is supportive of the assumption that option price was based on criteria that was agreed upon by all participants in the market ” ( p.22 ) .
Moreover the rule of put / call parity that avoids arbitrage trading appears to have been respected and implicitly understood .
The price difference observed being easily explained in terms of interest charges and opportunity cost ( p.24 ) .
Conclusion
Overall pricing appears to have clearly advantaged the sellers , but these extra benefits can also be explained by the significant risks run by the sellers and by the use of options as insurance by the buyers rather than as a pure maximization instrument .
Overall , the 17th - century London stock market appears to have been “ orderly and effective ” ( p.26 ) .
Nonetheless , numerous opponents described it as a zero - sum game disturbing and at times taking down otherwise sound companies ( p.27 ) .
Option trading was even several times outlawed ( e.g. John Barnard ’s Act of 1737 ) .
But the practice proved resilient showing that it was certainly not significantly disruptive ; moreover while public supervision seems to have been out of order , it is likely that the market ’s own control mechanisms kept the system reasonably sound ( p.28 ) .

Here is a short summary of the pending bill and the issue at stake .
Most biotechnology products are biologic products , as opposed to chemical drugs , and are regulated by the FDA under a different law than drugs .
Today , the FDA has the power , when the patents expire for drugs , to approve generic drugs and providing for affordable and accessible products as the mature .
The process works well in that it allows companies that discover new cures to patent their inventions , develop their products , earn a significant return on investment .
Then after the patents expire , the brand product faces significant price competition .
This keeps the cost of drugs in check .
More importantly , it creates a substantial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in real innovative breakthrough products that cure new diseases rather than just making a 2nd or 3rd version of an existing therapy because the innovative cures typically receives stronger and longer patent protection to allow for a reward for their investment .
The first generation of biotechnology products from the early 1990s is now reaching the end of their patent lives .
Biologics , unlike chemical drugs , are not eligible for approval by the FDA as generic biologics .
This is because until recently the science for demonstrating safety and equivalence of biologics was not ready .
Now the FDA has requested statutory authority to approve biogenerics , and Henry Waxman proposed legislation 2 years ago to do just that .
It is estimated by ExpressScripts based on its knowledge of pharmacy practices , that in just the next 10 years alone , consumers and our insurers would save $ 71 Billion from biogeneric savings with the passage of a workable follow - on biologics bill .
The biotechnology industry and the pharmaceutical industry marshaled their forces and opposed the bill .
They did so by proposing competing legislation that on its face provides the FDA authority to approve biogenerics , but contains provisions , like 12 additional years of market exclusivity , but also a series of other provisions that make it effectively impossible for a biogenerics company to finance the development of safe , affordable biogeneric alternatives .
The arguments made by Governor Patrick last week in his letter are very disappointing .
He parrots the industry lobbyists by asserting that without the additional 12 years of exclusivity , the industry will not have sufficient incentive to invest in new discoveries .
His argument ignores the facts of the last 30 years on the drug side of the business .
The facts are that if a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company has this automatic 12 year period of exclusivity for any new drug approved ( and as drafted , for minor improvements to a drug as well that may not offer any significant clinical advantage ) , they will have far less reason or incentive to invest in patentable new cures , and will have every reason to invest in low risk , incremental development of existing products to reap ( without taking risk ) the same profitable rewards .
In the short term , some of our local companies may like this protection of their products , but over the long term , as we fail to incent investment in new discovery research , our biotechnology edge will decline and the rest of the world will pass us by as they invent the next generation of products .
I feel like the Governor has not thought this though .
We should be encouraging innovation by granting patents , and encouraging affordable and safe generic competition as products mature and patent rights expire .
It is troubling that our Governor and our legislators in Massachusetts may be making the same mistake in Washington that their Michigan colleagues made in the 1990s relating to the auto industry .
Back then when it was clear to progressives that mileage caps were warranted to encourage innovation , Congressional pressure kept them off the table .
The argument made was that if we took away short term profits from SUV and truck sales , the automakers could not invent the next generation of cars .
Well 15 year later , it became clear that the higher profits were not invested in fuel efficient cars , and our industry either neared or declared bankruptcy .
Is this the future we want for Biotech ?
Let ’s hope our Governor and our legislators do not make the same mistake by fighting for short term profits that will not lead to long term success of our biotechnology industry .
Compared to 15 years ago , our biotechnology industry is already struggling to raise capital to fund discovery research and early stage clinical research as larger companies seek to find products to market .
If this new law passes and is not revised , it may get even worse as the incentive to invest in innovation declines and the reward for incremental improvement increases .
If the right law passes and facilitates biogeneric competition , it will encourage higher risk research into the discovery of new cures , which is just what built our biotech industry in the first place .
If you would like our biotechnology industry to remain a global leader in research and development , I would encourage you to let the Governor and your legislators know that they should support a follow - on biologics bill that does not grant excessive exclusivity ( President Obama recommends 7 years , the Federal Trade Commission 0 years , Schumer and Waxman 5 years ) , that authorizes the FDA to approve biogeneric products using its best scientific judgment , that does not impose obstacles to challenge improvidently granted patents filed to prevent competition .
London , England ( CNN ) --
An experimental vaccine for cocaine addicts can help some users kick the habit , according to a new study .
An experimental vaccine makes recipients produce antibodies to cocaine .
Researchers at Yale School of Medicine have tested a vaccine that makes people produce antibodies to cocaine .
The theory is that high levels of anti-cocaine antibodies can inactivate cocaine before it enters the brain , preventing users from getting high .
Dr Thomas Kosten worked on the study at Yale , before moving to Baylor College of Medicine , in Texas .
He told CNN that this is the first time a cocaine vaccine has been tested in people , and that the vaccine approach would be suitable for all kinds of addictive substances , except alcohol .
" Antibodies are very large proteins and when the cocaine attaches to those antibodies it can't get into the brain or heart , so people do n't get high from it , " Kosten told CNN .
Because users do n't get high , the thinking is that they will eventually stop taking cocaine .
" What was surprising was that we got patients who had limited motivation for stopping cocaine use to basically just run out of money , " said Kosten .
Participants received five vaccinations over a 24 - week period and their urine was tested for cocaine three times a week .

The study , published in the journal of the American Medical Association , found that the vaccine only achieved the desired antibody level of at least 43 micrograms per milliliter in 38 per cent of subjects , and that level was maintained for two months of the study period .
Of the subjects who achieved desired antibody levels , 53 per cent reduced their cocaine use by half , compared to 23 per cent of those with low antibody levels , and significantly more produced cocaine - free urine samples between weeks nine and 16 of the 24 - week study than those who were given a placebo , or had low antibody levels .
But Kosten told CNN that 75 per cent of subjects had high enough antibody levels to block one or two doses of cocaine , and that should be enough to prevent occasional lapses leading back to addiction .
Icro Maremmani , professor of addiction medicine at the University of Pisa and University of Siena , told CNN he believes the vaccine will be useful , but only for highly motivated patients .
" Hard users of cocaine probably will not accept this kind of treatment , " he said .
" The situation risks being similar to the use of naltrexone for heroin addicts -- a perfect drug but poor clinical results . "
Maremmani said there is also a risk that some patients will increase their intake of cocaine to overcome the antibody effect .
Kosten says it usually takes about two years for addicts to become drug - free , and that patients would have to be vaccinated every three months for that period to maintain antibody levels .
He says that while the vaccine can stop relapses leading back to addiction , it does n't solve the issues that lead to drug use .
" The vaccine does n't get you new friends , change your depression , get you out of jail , or all the other things that people have trouble with .
People could conceivably be on it for the rest of their life if they can't get it together . "
Ants are very industrious insects in which many people in the world expressed ants ’ attitude and behavior in proverbs and pithy words .
In fact , in al - Quran ( muslim book ) itself there was already a devoted one chapter which is called an ant ( an - Naml in arabic ) .
Being a small creature with only 2 stomachs and 3 eyes , they can lift the burden of double of their weight .
Let us see why the ants are very heralded by many people and cultures .
This experiment has been carried out by the investigation unit at NASA in Florida , USA , in which NASA wants to see how ants make their nests .
First , ants are placed in a closed container seen as an aquarium with only a light illuminated by ultra violet ( light purple representing the sun ) and the transparent medium gel ( having the properties of minerals and nutrients as the soil ) .
After a few minutes away passed , ants were beginning to work , making the holes of small colonies to help other ants move in the “ land ” .
These ants from my opinion want to escape from the hot sun .
As a result , it forms various types of small alleys connecting roads in the soil which is indeed a very unique arts .
If we see the container from afar , oh God !
it is very beautiful and creative architecture .
Let ’s take an example of their diligence and creativity and apply in our day life .
Plus , they are also seen to work closely together to achieve their goal of making their nests for comfortable .

The ministry of justice was one of the targets US President Barack Obama has led international condemnation of Sunday 's double suicide bomb attack in Baghdad that killed at least 132 people .
Mr Obama branded the attacks - the worst in more than two years in Iraq - " hateful and destructive " .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said they were a " terrible reminder of the threat from violent extremism " .
The blasts hit the ministry of justice and a provincial government office near the heavily fortified Green Zone .
ANALYSIS Gabriel Gatehouse , BBC News , Baghdad Sunday 's blasts present a problem for President Barack Obama .
He wants all combat troops out of Iraq by the end of August , in preparation for a full military withdrawal by 2012 .
If the security situation deteriorates , the US military may have to revise this timetable .
They will be asking searching questions about Iraq 's security forces - are they competent and well enough trained to secure the country and are they immune from infiltration by insurgents ?
After Sunday 's attacks there will be those who will argue that the answer to both these questions is no .
Back to the bad old days ?
More than 520 people were also injured when the two car bombs exploded in quick succession at 1030 ( 0730 GMT ) as people headed to work during the rush hour .
The White House said President Obama had spoken to Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki and President Jalal Talabani to pledge his support .
Mr Obama said in a statement : " I strongly condemn these outrageous attacks on the Iraqi people , and send my deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones .
" These bombings serve no purpose other than the murder of innocent men , women and children , and they only reveal the hateful and destructive agenda of those who would deny the Iraqi people the future that they deserve . "
The International Zone , or Green Zone , is the administrative heart of the capital .
The Iraqi authorities said the suicide bombers drove their vehicles into parking bays and detonated them .
Traffic limits in the street were eased six months ago and blast walls repositioned as part of a programme which Mr Maliki said showed progress was being made against insurgents .
Dozens of the dead were said to be staff members of the ministry of justice and Baghdad provincial government .

Election fears
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Baghdad says that hours after the explosions , rescue workers were still sifting through the rubble and the wreckage , looking for bodies and survivors .
DEADLIEST ATTACKS SINCE 2003 Aug 2007 : More than 500 killed in attacks on villages near Sinjar Jul 2007 : 150 killed in truck bombing in Tuz Khurmato Apr 2007 : 191 killed in car bombings in Baghdad Mar 2007 : 152 killed in truck bombing in Tal Afar Feb 2007 : 135 killed in truck bombing in Baghdad Nov 2006 : 202 killed in multiple blasts in Baghdad Mar 2004 : 171 killed in bombings in Baghdad and Karbala

In pictures : Baghdad blasts Iraq : Key facts and figures Hospitals struggled to deal with the wounded as ambulances brought in more and more casualties .
After Mr Maliki visited the scene he blamed al - Qaeda and supporters of former president Saddam Hussein .
" These cowardly terrorist attacks must not affect the determination of the Iraqi people to continue their struggle against the remnants of the dismantled regime and al - Qaeda terrorists , " he said .
Overall , violence has dropped dramatically in Iraq compared to a year ago , although sporadic attacks still continue in several parts of the country .
But our correspondent says there are fears that violence may increase as the country heads towards parliamentary elections scheduled for the beginning of next year .
The bombs went off as senior politicians were meeting in central Baghdad to try to break the deadlock over a draft law that would enable elections to take place in January .
The meeting ended without agreement , but will re-convene on Monday .
Last week the Iraqi parliament failed to meet a deadline to pass the legislation because of differences on a number of issues , among them whether to tell voters which candidates are on the party lists .

ST . LOUIS , Missouri ( CNN ) --
" I 'll take two chili , uh ... " a hungry customer stammers at the front of a two - hour - long line .
" Chile rellenos , " the money - handler trills back in perfect Spanish .
This is not a trendy Tex - Mex restaurant ; and it's more than 1,000 miles from the Mexican border .
St. Cecilia 's nearly closed .
After it was designated the parish home for Latinos , the congregation quadrupled .
The stuffed pepper causing the stutter is the hottest menu item at St. Cecilia 's Lenten fish fry in St. Louis , Missouri .
Chile rellenos , a traditional Mexican dish , have replaced fish as the main draw for Catholics giving up meat on Fridays .
This century - old parish founded by German immigrants has turned 85 percent Hispanic .
" It 's the browning of the Catholic Church in the United States , " says Pedro Moreno Garcia , who until last month led the Hispanic ministry for the Archdiocese of St. Louis .
Moreno Garcia points to St. Cecilia 's Spanish - dominant
Mass schedule as a sign of the times .
" Hispanics are the present and Hispanics are the future of the Catholic Church in the United States , " says Moreno Garcia .
One - third of all Catholics in the United States are now Latinos thanks to immigration and higher fertility rates , according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
While St. Cecilia 's parish has relished the growth , elsewhere , the Latino population boom has rocked the pews .
" Instead of screaming out , ' The British are coming ! ' " Moreno Garcia says some people are screaming , " ' The Hispanics are coming !
The Hispanics are coming !
Run , run . ' "
A self - described Nuyorican or Puerto Rican from New York , Moreno Garcia says even he gets mislabeled .
Chile rellenos are served up at St. Cecilia's »
" They still confuse every Hispanic as being from Mexico , and that everyone is here illegally , " says Moreno Garcia .
' Latino in America '
The Latino population is set to nearly triple by 2050 .
CNN 's Soledad O'Brien journeys into the homes and hearts of a group destined to change the U.S .
Tonight , 9 p.m. ET see full schedule »
After more than 15 years working for the Catholic Church in majority - Hispanic areas of Texas , Moreno Garcia spent the last year tackling the challenges of a community where Latinos , although growing , are still the minority .
He recalls a few heated phone calls after the archdiocese newspaper , the St. Louis Review , added a page in Spanish .
He fights prejudice with thought - provoking questions .
" When you go to heaven , and you 're in front of St. Peter , what would you want to have in your hand , your baptismal certificate or your passport ? "
Moreno Garcia asks .
One archdiocese parish that is struggling with the Latino influx is Holy Trinity in St. Ann , Missouri , a suburban community with an affordable housing stock that has prompted a population shift in the last decade .
Pedro Moreno Garcia is working to bridge language barriers , divisions »
Separate Sunday morning Masses in English and in Spanish at Holy Trinity are creating division among the devout .
" We 're two separate parishes operating under one roof , " says Parish Council President Gina Shocklee .
" I refer to it as Holy Trinity Catholic Church , and then there 's Holy Trinity Hispanic Church , " says council member Jody Tedeschi , who worries the separate Masses promote segregation .
Holy Trinity 's parish council has spent the past year looking for ways to bridge the divide with limited success .
Part of that complicated picture is the family of Mexican - born Angelica Garcia , the new face of Holy Trinity .
She has lived in the United States for 18 years ; Holy Trinity has been her parish for the last four .
" When I come to Mass at noon , the Anglos leave , and [ Latinos ] go in and we do n't even say ' hi ' to each other , not even ' hi , ' " says Garcia .
" Sometimes I think there is a wall , but that wall exists only because we do n't have enough faith . "
She takes her 7 - year - old son , Jose Miguel , to summer classes to improve his English .
" I would really like if we could all be together , because we all worship the same God .
We are all God 's children , " Garcia says , " but the problem is the language . "
A majority of Latino churchgoers in the United States attend Mass with mostly Latinos in the pew and Spanish - speaking clergy at the pulpit , according to a 2006 Pew Forum survey .
Today , 15 percent of priests ordained in the United States are Latinos , according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops .
" It 's like a wedding , and you have two families coming together , " says Moreno Garcia , " And they 're two distinct and different families .
And we 're not asking any family to cease being who they are .
But we are saying , ' Let 's learn to be a bigger family . ' "
St. Cecilia 's has learned to be a bigger family .
The parish pastor , the Rev. William Vatterott , is a cheery 33 - year - old St. Louis native who jokes his young parish will one day have a strong soccer team .
Vatterott studied Spanish in Mexico and now officiates bilingual baptisms -- as many as 10 at a time -- all of them Latinos .
The Latino - packed pews and the chile relleno craze belie St. Cecilia 's once uncertain future .
In late 2004 , church leaders considered closing its doors as the congregation dwindled and debt mounted .
Instead , the archbishop designated St. Cecilia 's the parish home for area Latinos , and the congregation quadrupled .
" It was a God- send , " says long - time parishioner Gloria Dowling of the Latino newcomers .
" It 's generating a lot of energy , which is what we needed because the old people passed away , went in the nursing home , and the young ones moved away , so that left a skeleton crew here . "
" Heaven on Earth is all kinds of people , " Dowling says , " We do n't have to wait ' til we get up there .
It 's all right here . "

CINCINNATI -- Chad Ochocinco is used to making news .
Now , he 's trying to break some .
The Cincinnati Bengals receiver is planning to form his own social news network on Twitter , using his player contacts around the league to develop news about other teams .
The idea grew out of his partnership with Motorola , which will provide the technology .
He 's dubbed the venture OCNN , for the Ochocinco News Network .
He will try to compete with mainstream media to tell fans what 's going on with NFL teams .
He 's even got a slogan .
" If I break it , you might as well believe it , " Ochocinco told The Associated Press in a phone interview .
Ochocinco already spends a lot of time on social networking -- he has nearly 300,000 followers on Twitter and does frequent Ustream episodes .
This latest venture will be intriguing , given the way NFL coaches try to prevent news from leaking out .
The receiver plans to operate like a reporter , getting tips from players on other teams .
He also might get other NFL players involved in his reports .
" I am that source now , " he said .
" I 'll be the leak for all 32 teams . "
Ochocinco has already had one occasion to break news about another player .
When first - round draft pick Andre Smith was close to ending his holdout during training camp , Ochocinco tweeted that he had signed .
Smith 's agent then tweeted that the report was premature .
When Smith was in the locker room the next day after reaching a deal , Ochocinco took a photo and posted proof .
That got the receiver thinking about doing more news - based tweets .
" I 'm sort of still feeling this out , " he said .
" It 's based on what I already do .
I 'll bring in news the way I always do , and I 'll actually be adding to it . "
Ochocinco used the example of a network reporter who relays what they hear from sources with various teams .
" I'm knocking out the middle man , " he said .
With a chuckle , he added , " Are you nervous ? "
The receiver began promoting it on his Twitter feed following a practice on Saturday to get ready for a game against the Chicago Bears .
Motorola is using the venture to promote its MOTOBLUR technology .
Ochocinco will use one of the company 's Cliq mobile devices for his new social network .
Motorola marketing officer Bill Ogle said Ochocinco " brings order and clarity to a multifaceted lifestyle as a professional athlete , entertainer and devoted social networker . "
It 's been a busy week for Ochocinco 's social networking ventures .
A week ago , his new iPhone app was introduced .
The app was developed by a company that includes Bengals quarterback Jordan Palmer and features various ways to get news on the receiver .
Between football and networking , the receiver does n't have much extra time .
" This is how I stay out of trouble , " he said .
" I do n't go to clubs , I do n't drink , I do n't party . "
The venture will have to stay within the NFL 's restrictions on social networking by players and coaches .
In August , the league sent out guidelines , allowing them to use Twitter , Facebook and other social media up to 90 minutes before kickoff , and again after games when traditional interview sessions are finished .
Some NFL teams have taken a hard line on tweeting .
The Dolphins imposed restrictions on players , reporters and fans during training camp .
Other teams have restrictions on tweeting from practice fields .
The Chargers fined cornerback Antonio Cromartie $ 2,500 for criticizing the food selections at training camp on his Twitter feed .
NFL head coaches routinely tell players not to talk about their injuries to the media because it could put them at a competitive disadvantage .
It ’s not out in the wild yet , but Mac OS X 10.6.2 is released and has been confirmed to kill support for the Intel Atom processor , this is especially important for Hackintosh users who have hacked various Atom based netbooks to run Snow Leopard .
So what should you do if you have an Atom based Hackintosh Netbook ?
StellaRolla recommends staying with 10.6.1 ( or 10.5.8 if you ’re running Leopard on your Hackintosh , sine 10.5.9 will likely have the same Atom problems ) for the time being , otherwise you can try upgrading to 10.6.2 but run an older or modified kernel .
I think I ’ll just stick to 10.6.1 when the update rolls around , I have a lot of confidence in the Hackintosh community so I imagine there will be a workaround rather quickly .
You ca n’t help but suspect this move is Apple ’s attempt at shutting down the growing and popular Hackintosh Netbook community , since Apple has no product line that runs the Atom itself .
Mac OS
X runs absolutely flawlessly on much of the PC Netbook hardware , once it ’s configured you would n’t know you ’re not on a Mac .
Maybe it ’s in effort to kill the Atom Hackintoh Netbooks in anticipation of the rumored Tablet ?
Or maybe it ’s something totally unrelated ?
Who knows , but for now , just take note that when the 10.6.2 upgrade comes out and you use a Hackintosh , you might want to avoid it for now .
StellaRolla : 10.6.2 kills Atom
Update : the most recent 10.6.2 build supports the Atom chip again , whether or not the final version of 10.6.2 will kill the Atom or not remains to be seen .
Update 2 : The most recent 10.6.2 build does NOT SUPPORT the Intel Atom chip and this has been confirmed .

Monty Widenius has posted a press release , urging Oracle to sell MySQL to a third party , and there is a link to the materials that he and Florian Mueller , who is working with him , provided to the EU Commission , which appears to have influenced it to delay approval .
I 've been reading all I can find on this topic , and I 'd like to tell you why I think the community should support the Oracle deal .
The most important reason is that opponents are trashing the GPL [ PDF ] and calling it a source of " infection " in their FUD submission to the EU Commission .
From the last page :
The " copyleft / infection " principle of the GPL license represents a particular obstacle not only to revenue generation by the fork vendor but also to the overall adoption and market penetration of MySQL , MySQL forks and MySQL storage engines .
Now , that 's from the version 1.1 , dated October 11 , that they posted today .
But that is n't the only submission they have made .
They suggested to the EU Commission in a questionnaire submitted by an August 13th deadline that the license on MySQL be changed to the Apache License .
It was sent to me , along with others in the press , to educate us on the issues .
Indeed , I found it very educational .
Even in the submission made public today , you 'll notice on page 21 they mention the BSD and the Apache licenses , after trashing the GPL : Under such open source licenses as the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) license and the Apache license , proprietary derivatives are legal .
The only obligation might be attribution .
In contrast , on page 20 , they state that the GPL " effectively prevents this from being a commercial opportunity " .
So the bottom line to me is this : some folks want to make money from MySQL , either by allowing proprietary changes to it or by killing it off .
I sincerely hope that the EU Commission looks a bit deeper than this submission 's arguments .
And I hope they notice that there is a Microsoft shadow in this picture .
Let me now try to provide you with more insight by telling you the rest of what I 've learned .
In Richard Stallman 's letter , which mirrors very closely the arguments made in the August submission , leading me to suspect that he also received a copy of it , there is this :
Many other FLOSS software projects are expected to move to GPLv3 , often automatically due to the common use of the " any later version " clause .
Because the current MySQL license lacks that clause , it will remain GPL v2 only and it will not be possible to combine its code with the code of many GPLv3 - covered projects in the future .
Given that forking of the MySQL code base will be particularly dependent on FLOSS community contributions - more so than on in - company development - the lack of a more flexible license for MySQL will present considerable barriers to a new forked development path for MySQL .
" A more flexible license " ?
Like what ?
How about GPLv3 , if you want to start tinkering with the license ?
And on what legal basis would anyone have authority to change the license , other than the copyright holder ?
Are you seriously suggesting that a regulatory body decide the license instead of the copyright owner ?
What a reckless idea .
Now , let 's look at the Monty Says materials .
From the press release : Michael ' Monty '
Widenius , the creator of open source database MySQL and founder of the namesake company later acquired by Sun , today suggested Oracle should resolve antitrust concerns over its US $ 7.4 billion acquisition of Sun by committing to sell MySQL to a suitable third party .
The proposed takeover has not yet been consummated because it is being investigated in depth by the European Commission as well as competition authorities in several other jurisdictions .
Widenius , who posted this press release to his blog , believes the EU 's antitrust regulator is " absolutely right to be concerned " and called on Oracle " to be constructive and commit to sell MySQL to a suitable third party , enabling an instant solution instead of letting Sun suffer much longer . " ...
In order to support the regulators ' work on the case , Widenius ' new company , Monty Program Ab , works closely with Florian Mueller , a MySQL and EU affairs expert ....
In August , Mueller authored a position paper that Monty Program provided to the EC along with several other submissions .
The latest version of the document was published today on the Internet .
It must , however , be pointed out that also on Monty 's blog is his acceptance of the role as advisor to Microsoft 's new Codeplex Foundation and on his blog he tells why he thinks it 's swell .
Microsoft opposes the Oracle - Sun deal , I might add .
His reasons include : Microsoft is already contributing quite a lot of Open Source code into many projects , including the Linux kernel .
Being a big public company with a lot of lawyers creates a lot of bureaucracy and it becomes very hard for a developer in the company to participate in an Open Source project because of the many different contributor agreements / licenses / project policies that exits .
( I can easily relate to this after seeing how hard it was to do release something as Open Source even at Sun ) .
I suspect many other software companies have similar issues .
Personally , I believe it was in order to solve the above that Microsoft created the CodePlex Foundation .
By having a single independent entity , verified and approved by the Microsoft lawyers , to which to donate code , the whole process of being involved with Open Source projects becomes so much easier for Microsoft developers .
CodePlex allows Microsoft developers to more easily participate in Open Source projects , without a lot of red tape .
There are many developers at Microsoft that are very pro Open Source , and would like to participate more than they are able to at present .
Note that since CodePlex supports all relevant Open Source licenses , there is nothing hindering contributions to CodePlex to find its way into projects elsewhere in the FOSS ecosystem from there .
But why should Microsoft be trusted to have good intentions with the CodePlex Foundation ?
Simply , I believe that it's in Microsoft 's direct interest that the CodePlex foundations becomes a success .
Of course , we all know that Microsoft will primarily ensure that the Open Source projects in which they participate will run better on Windows and with Microsoft products .
But this does n't change the fact that this is a still a great thing for Open Source software .
Of course , people will continue to worry about Microsoft 's intents and maybe that is understandable .
In my experience , Microsoft as a big company seems to be a " company divided , " with some segments appearing to understand and embrace Open Source , and others acting against these understandings .
( In fact , this is another thing I can relate to from my personal history . )
But now we have an opportunity to see Microsoft at their best as regards Open Source and Free Software , and even help them out in the effort .
This is , indeed , an unusual opportunity .
Clearly developers and users of software , be it Open Source or proprietary , benefit from Microsoft 's benevolence toward and understanding of the Open Source ecosystem .
Is he kidding ?
Naive ?
Misinformed ?
Or something else ?
Well , maybe developers like Monty will benefit from Microsoft 's benevolence , but I doubt I ever will .
And Microsoft contributed to the kernel because it had to .
The GPL forced it to .
As for Florian , he 's the guy who delayed adoption of Linux by Munich by pulling a PR stunt and then bragged about it , if you recall :
In the book , No Lobbyists As Such , published on Tuesday , Mueller tells the story of how anti-patent campaigners successfully fought against the software patent directive , which was eventually rejected by the European Parliament in July 2005 .
Anti-patent campaigners initially struggled to attract much press attention around the software patent directive , so decided to take drastic action , according to Mueller .
" If the media had n't reported much on what had happened so far with respect to software patents , then we had to make something happen that they would report on .
We had to provoke a real crisis .
Right away , " he claims .
Mueller , along with a few others , came up with the idea of the Green Party drafting written questions to the mayor of Munich , to ask about software patents and their impact on the Munich 's Linux migration project , known as LiMux .
Mueller helped the Green Party draft the questions , which were then put to the mayor of Munich at the end of July .
A few days later , Mueller was made aware of an email sent to the LiMux project mailing list by Wilhelm Hoegner , the head of the data processing office at the City of Munich .
This email said that due to the questions tabled by the Green party the project has been put on ice .
Mueller publicised this email , which resulted in a lot of press attention , including coverage in mainstream publications , such as Der Spiegel , a German weekly news magazine .
Various members of the free and open source community who were aware of this stunt reportedly criticised Mueller , saying that he had endangered a major implementation of Linux and had raised concerns among customers that using open source software was risky .
But Mueller had no regrets about his actions .
" I understood the concerns that others had , but to me it was obvious that open source would suffer more from the legalisation of software patents than from the LiMux fallout .
It seemed better to draw attention to the issue while it could still be fixed than to remain silent and face the consequences later , " he states in the book .
The end justifies the means kind of guy ?
I do n't trust anyone who would pull a stunt like that .
I hope the EU Commission knows that neither Monty nor Florian represents the community as a whole .
They definitely do n't represent me .
And I have a question for Monty and Florian : who do you have in mind to buy MySQL ?
Anyone ?
Nobody ?
Patent trolls ?
Who ?
Microsoft ?
This latest tips me to believing that , rms notwithstanding , Carlo Piana is right : the community should support Oracle 's bid .
He is now Oracle 's co-counsel and explains his reasons on that page .
I urge you to read it .
In fact , thanks to the CC license , I can put a relevant chunk here :
In my previous blog entry I have briefly discussed that I intended to take actions to help the Sun / Oracle merger to be cleared by the EC Antitrust authorities .
Indeed I have offered my dispassionate help as a Free Software and digital liberties advocate to the legal team assisting Oracle .
They have gladly accepted my offer to help .
It was discussed if I could also take the position of co-counsel to Oracle in the procedure , and so was decided .
This could be perhaps a surprise to casual readers .
I take the opportunity to clarify what my motives are .
It could be regarded as odd that I feel like I have to justify why I am accepting instructions that some of my colleagues would simply kill for .
The point is that  unlike many 
I am not a hired gun for whomever can afford to pay me .
And I am quite fond of saying that I am in a position to refuse cases that are against my beliefs as a Free Software advocate .
Competition problems ?
Look at the alternatives !
Sun is a company that has lately been known for its huge contributions to Free Software .
Indeed one could go as far as saying that amongst the big corporations
Sun has been the most friendly to the community in terms of code released under Free Software licenses and general support .
After cashing in perhaps too quickly a settlement on the same antitrust case against Microsoft that it had initiated in the first place ( the one I have been deeply involved during the last five years ) , Sun has gained again good recognition and trust from the Community .
Sun has four important projects to Free Software and to a healthier and competitive environment in the software market .
I am speaking about Openoffice.org , Java , Open Solaris , MySQL .
Sun is also financially bleeding , and its share price has been considerably dropping over the years .
This , combined with its huge and easily cashable assets , made it a too obvious target for a takeover .
The candidate for it are quite limited .
Friendly takeovers could be made by IBM  who reportedly was involved in acquisition talks  and Oracle .
Hostile takeovers could be made by Microsoft ( subject to huge competition problems in most of the concerned markets ) and by investment funds .
The latter option is the one that frightens me most .
Sun has a huge patent portfolio too .
Some of its patents have been pledged for instance to OASIS not to be asserted against any implementation of ODF .
An investment fund would have no incentive to keep the company as a whole and , absent an overall industrial plan , the easiest cash - in move would be that of arranging an auction , one similar to that where luckily ( the uninvited ) OIN was able to recover the patents ( dumped off by Microsoft ) from the highest bidder .
In other words , Sun or parts of it would become a litigation company , a pain similar to what SCO has been lately , but multiplied n- times .
We do n't need to offer patent trolls any patents that are deeply embedded in core Free Software projects .
We should remove the software patents from the equation , and we would be better off , but the threat is out there and ignoring it would do no good .
Patent trolls , or technology investment companies  as they sometimes define themselves  could simply act on their own accord with the aim to force market players to pay through the nose or  much , much worse  could be a useful instrument to seed more FUD and to raise hurdles to the success of Free Software projects .
To the best of my knowledge , Oracle is not asserting its patents against Free Software projects .
But others could .
I think there is more than one reason to avoid all of that !
What is the sticking point in the investigation ?
It 's MySQL .
The Swedish database company has been acquired by Sun last year for a sum short of one billion euro .
Not bad for a company whose best yearly turnover hardly reaches 50 million euros .
MySQL and Oracle are databases .
This is more or less where the similarity ends .
Their products are significantly dissimilar from each other because they are at the opposite ends of the market .
I happened to speak with people at Ingres recently , and they confirmed that , notwithstanding that they are also Free Software vendors with a business model similar to that of MySQL , they regard themelves as competing with Oracle and PostgreSQL , rather than with MySQL .
but I do n't want to argue that here .
Complainants have sought to present a different view .
The Commission decided that this point shall be further investigated and that 's it .
MySQL is a very successful project in terms of deployment .
I myself have no less than three MySQL instances in place and you are reading this blog from a LAMP installation  where " M " stands for " MySQL " .
It is very important that the project remains Free Software ( it is licensed under a slightly modified GNU GPL V.2 on a dual licensing scheme ) and a lively one .
Yet I fail to see how a disbanded and broken - up Sun would do a better job at it than a company like Oracle .
Here we see the force and how dramatically Free Software departs from the proprietary setting .
A product is very likely to survive despite the fortunes  or even against the will  of its founding company , because everybody is invited to take over or to fork .
Forks are less frequent than one can think only because the simple threat of forking works in the direction of finding consensus among leading developers .
Linux has never been forked .
Samba has been forked ( into Samba - TNG ) , but there is a constructive exchange between the two projects .
Mambo has been forked into Joomla , and Joomla seems to be more successful than Mambo .
More or less the same happened to Xfree86 .
When the developers changed the licensing , a new project suddenly was born  X.org  and in six months it has swept away Xfree86 from the entirety of the GNU / Linux distributions out there .
Nothing substantially prevents the success of forks , apart from the success of the original product .
We could say that the licensing reduces the barriers to entry in the market for that individual product , allowing third parties not only to take it as it is distributed by the project leaders , but to depart from it and make it  or parts of it  even an entirely different project .
This is a terrific democracy - enforcer .
The lack of democracy issue in the MySQL project has been latent for quite a long time , this is why a fork has already happened , into MariaDB , and if things get worse in the core development team of MySQL , it is easy to predict that the fork will have better chances to replace it  as it is drop - in replacement to the forked project .
Nature abhors a vacuum .
If Oracle were hypothetically to bend the project away from competition in the high end or simply make it a stale project , it is clear to me that the declining fortunes of the original work would leave room ( and disgruntled developers ) to further the success of the fork (s ) .
Another misconception is that a Free Software project cannot succeed without a strong corporation as its proponent .
All the evidence is to the opposite .
Openoffice.org lives out a very lively and diverse community : while it has roots deep into Sun , many corporate users ( including IBM ) heavily contribute to its development .
Linux prospers thanks to a wide community where no single company is relevant , leave alone dominant .
Gnome and KDE the same .
Again this is the strength of Free Software , that it permits many different development models , including the " bazaar " .
Dual license is a moot problem
If I understand the point correctly , the objections on what I have just said is that  because MySQL is a dual - licensed product  a fork only relying on the GNU GPL licensing of the code would miss the revenues and investments coming from the proprietary licensing , which is out of reach of the fork .
This is absolutely frivolous , and it reflects a misconception of how the forces in the Free Software space work .
It is not that a successful dual licensing enables a successful Free Software project , it is a successful Free Software project that permits to a dual licensing strategy to survive .
The idea behind a dual licensing scheme is twofold .
First you spread around a software application that becomes widely adopted , distributed , and where developers hurry up to develop for .
And you offer it under the most restrictive copyleft license .
Second , you offer a separate deal to all those who want to use the code but they are not willing to embed it into their products because they would be derivatives of the GPL 'ed product , thus GPL themselves .
While dual licensing is often portrayed as the only successful business model for Free Software , this assertion is consistently disproved .
And interestingly , this assertion comes from proprietary - intense ( or proprietary - only ) software makers .
Its underlying assumption is that one can only make money out of selling licenses .
So if somebody makes money out of Free Software , they must be offering proprietary licenses too .
This misunderstanding results in frequent incorrect statements , such as  this is absolutely the most widespread myth  that Red Hat sells " commercial licenses " of its operating system .
This is the problem with Free Software : it changes any common - sense reference , it requires a change in the mindset .
2+2 = +∞ !
Dual licensing is hardly a viable model per se .
MySQL
Ab's revenues are pitiful in comparison with the market adoption of its project , and a considerable part of its turnover comes from other sources than licensing .
MySQL is so good that it can be used via a lot of interoperability tools and via network without suffering big loss of performances , therefore the incentives to use a proprietary version come from the licensing issues of the very limited cases when a derivative product is to be distributed on proprietary terms .
A proprietary standalone version of MySQL has no appeal compared to the Free Software licensed one .
But in general , I know of very few cases of companies keeping a healthy dual licensed scheme ( the only one I know for sure is Funambol ) .
Dual licensing is very complicated to maintain , it requires copyright assignment , and this assignment is very hard to obtain from developers ( this is at least my experience in drafting assignment agreements for clients ) .
Dual licensing is irrelevant in the success of the variety of Free Software business propositions , its fortunes will decline even more , and it can be seen at best as an interim setting to legal migrations from proprietary to Free Software .
Guess who 's complaining Oddly enough , the main complainants are two companies whose interest collide against the persistence of a competitive pressure coming from Sun .
This is entirely appropriate , of course .
Only , one could question how true the grounds are to complain of at least one of them , the one which competes directly with MySQL .
It bugs me that they now portray themselves as advocates for the success of MySQL .
They are quite likely afraid that the Sun acquisition will reinvigorate MySQL to compete with them for instance in the SME 's space , which is not Oracles strength .
Another reason for them to fight against the Oracle / Sun merger is the resulting increased competitive pressure in the high - end part of the IT market .
Especially that of large database installations for the cloud , a sector where it is no mystery Microsoft is trying to find a new expansion area , and which could be a very good sector where Oracle +
Sun Solaris +
Java could set the goalpost , while establishing a platform - diversity , under - the - hood interoperable ecosystem , with Oracle and Google and IBM on the upper hand , as well as benefiting the overall industry with huge Free Software spillovers .
The bitter end Persistent delay as to the final clearance is sucking the breath from Sun , and rumors of people leaving are spreading .
This can not last .
Continuing uncertainty damages
Sun 's developement teams .
I have the pleasure to know a number of executives in Sun and  if perhaps they are not delighted by the prospect acquisition  they realize that it must be passed through as soon as possible , or the company will die .
And with it , some of the good development teams that have considerably contributed to the success of Free Software .
It is time to take sides , and I know perfectly well where to stand .
Me too .
I stand with Carlo and Oracle on this one .
Because something smells very , very wrong in this picture .
Update : I see Matt Asay has jumped on board the antiGPL FUD too .
Folks , there is no difference between Sun owning MySQL and Oracle , as far as forking rights .
Duh .
What is this ?
An elaborate Microsoft production by proxy ?
Update 2 : Kirk Wylie has some interesting information on Monty and Oracle : First of all , let 's get the obvious out of the way : Oracle bought BerkeleyDB , and continued to enhance it ; Oracle bought InnoDB , and continued to enhance it .
At no point did they crush them to drive Oracle database revenues , or change the licenses , or stop forward momentum .
So when you look at the actual track record of the company , they 're in the clear .
But they might do , because they 're an evil , scary corporation that MySQL turned down once before ( from the Stallman piece ) :
Oracle made an earlier effort to buy MySQL in 2006 , but the management rejected Oracle 's offer , in part because Oracle would not disclose its plan for MySQL , and some members of the MySQL management team were concerned that Oracle was only acquiring MySQL to curb its advances in the marketplace .
I know a number of people involved with MySQL when it was an independent organization .
While there were people who worried about that fact , senior management was n't .
More importantly , Monty was willing to sell MySQL to Oracle in 2006 for the right price .
The use of the words " in part " there are telling , because the primary consideration that MySQL 's senior management had was n't some happy - clappy love for the Libre Software Movement , it was money .
I 'm sorry , but I fail to see what 's changed in between 2006 and 2009 except that Monty is a whole heck of a lot richer .
Why in 2005 and 2006 were offers ultimately rejected from Oracle based primarily on money , but now Oracle is an evil corporation that can't be trusted with MySQL ?
Larry 's the same guy he was then , Oracle has bought BEA but they do n't compete in any way with MySQL , it 's the same company .
Why would Monty trust Oracle back in 2006 but not now ?
Get the picture ?
He makes a list of who would have the money to buy MySQL .
Guess who is number one on the list ?
Microsoft .
Update 3 : For completeness , here is former MySQL CEO Mårten Mickos ' letter to the EU Commission , in support of Oracle .
By all means read the entire letter , but note in particular the reasons that motivated him to write :
The impetus to write this letter comes from my concern with the talented teams of the MySQL business unit and of Sun Microsystems in general .
I am also troubled by certain factual distortions about a subject matter that I am intimately familiar with : MySQL and its business model .
Open - source business models are complicated and quite different , and it took many years to fully understand and shape the one of MySQL ....
In this discussion , the term " MySQL " refers to two things .
On the one hand , there is the huge phenomenon MySQL - - an estimated 12 million active installations under a free and open - source software license , millions , if not tens of millions , of skilled users and developers , and tens of thousands of corporations who use MySQL one way or the other .
On the other hand , there is the business of MySQL , which is growing rapidly , thus rewarding the owners of the assets ( currently Sun Microsystems ) .
Those two meanings of the term " MySQL " stand in a close mutually beneficial interaction with each other .
But most importantly , this interaction is voluntary and cannot be directly controlled by the vendor .
What I mean is that the vast and free installed base of MySQL is using it of their own free choice , unencumbered by the vendor and under no obligation or restraint .
That is the nature of open source .
And conversely , the MySQL business is supporting the free installed base of MySQL ( by improving the product ) voluntarily and in the hope of deriving benefit from the installed base .
This is the paradox of an open - source business , and it took me a long time to truly understand how powerful a force it is .
It is unlike any traditional business .
The key point is that both the users and the vendors of open source are engaged in a powerful free - market dynamic that cannot be contained by any single entity .
That would include Oracle .
Incidentally , Groklaw uses MySQL , the Free version , so I am very , very interested in what happens to it .
AN INTRIGUING detail in Bertie Ahern ’s autobiography , mentioned in passing , is that one of his most famous fellow Socialists – Lenin – spoke English with a Dublin accent .
A “ Rathmines accent ” , to be precise .
The claim is attributed to Roddy Connolly , son of the executed 1916 leader , who , according to Ahern , also claimed to be responsible for teaching it to the Russian leader , writes FRANK MCNALLY
The last bit , at least , appears to be an exaggeration .
In a 1976 profile in this newspaper , Connolly jnr claimed no responsibility for the way Lenin spoke English , which predated their first meeting in Petrograd in 1920 ( when they were introduced by John Reed , author of Ten Days That Shook the World ) .
Connolly is indeed quoted as saying that Lenin had a “ Rathmines accent ” , but that this was “ the product of his Irish tutor , who had lived in Leinster Road ” .
The question of what exactly a Rathmines accent is , or was , arises here .
As the latter - day capital of Dublin ’s flatland , the suburb has long been a melting pot of accents from all over Ireland and the world .
During my own few years there , I do n’t recall meeting many natives , if they existed at all .
But I certainly was n’t aware of there being a way of speaking locally that was indigenous to Rathmines alone , as opposed to – say – Rathgar or Harolds Cross .
Again , The Irish Timesarchives may throw some light on the subject .
From the very few references to the term , the Rathmines accent seems to have been no ordinary accent , nor was it confined to Rathmines .
It may even have been a forerunner of that modern - day scourge , the Dart accent , which arose from nowhere about the same time as the eponymous light rail service and has been annoying people with sensitive ears ever since .
At any rate , here is the Irishman ’s Diarist ( who else ? ) complaining about the phenomenon in 1949 .
“ Many of the Radio Éireann announcers are guilty of frequent lapses into the genteel , mincing manner of speaking known as the Rathmines accent .
One announcer keeps referring to Pakistan as ‘ Pawkistan ’ , several of them talk about ‘ fawther ’ , [ for ‘ father ’ ] ‘ curless ’ for ‘ careless ’ , and worst of all ‘ infearm ’ for ‘ infirm ’ . ”
Perhaps it is because he was speaking in this strange manner that , according to his wife Nadezhda Krupskaya , Lenin had difficulty making himself understood in London during his time there .
Although she does n’t mention Rathmines , her memoirs do offer some indirect support for Connolly ’s claim .
They also note that both she and Lenin could speak English as early as 1902 ; or at least that they thought they could : “ When we arrived in London we found we could not understand a thing , nor could anybody understand us [...]
It amused Vladimir Ilyich , but at the same time put him on his mettle .
He tackled English in earnest .
We started going to all kinds of meetings , getting as close as we could to the speaker and carefully watching his mouth .
We went fairly often to Hyde Park at the beginning .
Speakers there harangue the strolling crowds on all kinds of subjects [...]
We particularly liked one such speaker – he had an Irish accent , which we were better able to understand . ”
So there you have it .
It could be that , even in 1902 , Lenin ’s English was delivered in the style of a future RTÉ announcer , and that consequently nobody in England ( and few people in Ireland ) could follow a word of it .
Not that Roddy Connolly seems to have had any trouble .
But I wonder if , when he expressed his admiration for Connolly snr , Lenin referred to him as the young man ’s “ fawther ” .
Maybe the Christian Brothers got to the great revolutionary too , somewhere , during his travels .
Or some missionary Jesuits , even .
This might explain his variation on the latter order ’s famous motto : “ Give us the child for eight years and it will be a Bolshevik forever ” .
And it would also explain the story about the atheist Lenin blessing himself on the night he and Trotsky unleashed their revolution from Petrograd ’s Smolny Institute .
AJP Taylor describes the dramatic moment in his introduction to Reed ’s book : “ At two o’clock in the morning of 7 November , Trotsky pulled out his watch and said : ‘ It ’s begun ’ .
Lenin said : ‘ From being on the run to supreme power – that ’s too much .
It makes me dizzy ’ , and he made the sign of the cross .
Then the two men lay down on the hard office floor with a rug over them , while they waited for the news which , they hoped , would change the face of the world . ”
It ’s tempting to hear the father of Russian communism delivering his part of dialogue in Rathmines English .
Unfortunately that did n’t happen .
According to Trotsky ’s version , which is slightly less dramatic than Taylor ’s , although it also mentions the sign of the cross , Lenin made the last remark in German .
At the very top of the show she announced :
We can report exclusively tonight , that two major power brokers on the left have told MSNBC that they are encouraging a Senate strategy now , in which the leadership would revoke chairmanships and other leadership positions from any Democrat who sides with a Republican filibuster to block a vote on health reform .
Who might these " major power brokers " be ?
Maddow would n't reveal her sources , but my judgment , having watched her show a lot , is that she 's generally not the type to tease this sort of thing lightly .
If she says she 's got sources , she 's got them .
She goes on :
Regardless of how individual senators would vote ultimately on the bill , committee chairmen or subcommittee chairmen who allowed Republicans to force a 60 - vote requirement for passing health care ... under this type of strategy would be in danger of losing their chairmanships .
Messing with chairmanships ai n't a small thing in the Senate .
As Rachel put it :
That would be the Senate equivalent of busting a Lieutenant Colonel down to Private .
Her take on this ?
This is cracking heads time in the Democratic Party right now .
This is arm - twisting , vote - counting , " are you a real Dem " time for the proponents of health reform .
Could this actually be true ?
Could Senate Dems , who so cravenly allowed Lieberman back into the fold , be prepared to remove committee chairmanships from any Dem who refused to oppose a Republican filibuster ?
If it were anyone other than Maddow reporting this , I 'd have considerably more skepticism .
Is it actually possible that Harry " I cave at the office " Reid would get behind something like this ?
Who are the " power brokers " ?
Rahm ?
Reid ?
I still reserve the right to be skeptical until I see this strategy in action , but there are lots worse sources than Rachel Maddow out there .
Here 's the segment in its entirety .
Judge for yourself :
ADDED : A big shout - out to Superribbie for pointing out the following :
Britain's main safety regulator threw the government 's energy plans into chaos tonight by damning the nuclear industry 's leading designs for new plants .
The Health and Safety Executive said it could not recommend plans for new reactors because of wide - ranging concerns about their safety .
The leading French and American reactors are central to plans for a nuclear renaissance aimed at keeping the lights on and helping to cut carbon emissions .
The government needs to build a number of nuclear power stations in the next 10 years to replace old atomic and coal plants .
But the HSE has to approve the safety of the designs before they can be built .
" We have identified a significant number of issues with the safety features of the design that would first have to be progressed .
If these are not progressed satisfactorily then we would not issue a design acceptance confirmation , " the agency concluded following a study of the latest French EPR and US AP1000 reactor designs .
Kevin Allars , director of new build at the HSE , admitted frustration that the design assessment process was already behind schedule owing to insufficient information from the companies promoting the reactors and a lack of enough trained staff in his own directorate .
The HSE 's public report expresses " significant concerns " about the lack of separation between the safety protection and control systems on the EPR reactor design promoted by Areva and EDF of France .
The safety body says another part of the reactor is " not entirely in alignment with international good practice " .
The report says it has raised a number of issues with EDF and Areva relating to the structural integrity of the EPR and it concludes : " It is too early to say whether they can be resolved solely with additional safety case changes or whether they may result in design modifications being necessary . "
The design put forward by Westinghouse , the American firm now owned by Toshiba of Japan , is also criticised , with the HSE saying the safety case on internal hazards has " significant shortfalls " .
It criticises the company for a " lack of detailed claims and arguments " to support various assertions , while questioning aspects of the civil and mechanical engineering plans as well as the structural integrity and " human factors " .
It also complains that the reactor design was submitted in feet and inches rather than metric figures .
Industry experts said the HSE was in a pivotal position to make or break the government 's wider plans because it could delay the planned reactors from coming on stream from 2017 .
That is the time that ministers fear an " energy crunch " because most existing reactors will have been retired , many coal plants shut down and renewable power insufficiently advanced to take over .
John Large , a leading nuclear consultant , said : " The HSE as an independent agency will come under tremendous pressure to push through these designs .
But if it stands up to [ the ] government and stops or delays these designs for two or three years until it is satisfied then developers could lose interest and we could fall behind in the queue of countries waiting to build nuclear . "
Allars said he had not received any pressure so far from the government .
While he had beefed up his staff and hoped to quicken the speed of his work , he insisted it was not his problem to worry ultimately about delays .
" I am independent of government , and independent of industry and I will do what I need to protect society from any dangers of nuclear power .
I will only be in a position to agree a generic design assessment if I get the right information [ in future ] to do that , " he said .
The HSE said it might allow so - called exclusions over some of its concerns under which it would allow construction to proceed on the understanding that the problems would be addressed later .
Jean McSorley , consultant to Greenpeace 's nuclear campaign , said it was highly likely reactor designs would not be ready for final sign - off at the end of the design process .
" This could leave the utilities and construction companies with real problems finishing projects , and that 's very risky for them financially .
Investment companies will also want to delay putting money into these projects until it is decided who takes responsibility for any potential cost overruns and delays , " she said .
Areva shrugged off the concerns raised by the HSE .
" It is important to emphasise that this is a normal part of what is a very transparent process and that it is entirely expected , as part of the design assessment process in the UK , for issues to be identified and resolved prior to licensing and construction , " it said .
Les banques ont - elles poussé le bouchon un peu trop loin ?
A force d'annoncer des profits trimestriels record , un an seulement après avoir été sauvées de la faillite par des aides d'Etat , à force de claironner qu'elles mettent de côté des dizaines de milliards de dollars et d'euros pour verser des bonus à leurs traders , elles finissent par mettre à mal la patience des gouvernements .
Ces derniers étant eux - mêmes à la recherche désespérée de recettes fiscales pour combler les déficits budgétaires , la tentation est grande d'aller chercher l'argent là où il se trouve et de taxer un secteur financier redevenu hyperprofitable , malgré la persistance de la crise économique .
En France , dans un entretien aux Echos , publié lundi 19 octobre , la ministre de l'économie , Christine Lagarde , s'est dite opposée au principe d'une imposition supplémentaire des banques .
La commission des finances de l'Assemblée nationale avait adopté , le 14 octobre , un amendement de son président Didier Migaud ( PS ) prévoyant une taxe additionnelle de 10 % à l'impôt sur les sociétés sur les établissements financiers .
" Il n'est pas question de prendre une mesure à caractère national qui plomberait le système bancaire français , qui s'est bien comporté pendant la crise " , explique Mme Lagarde , qui souligne qu'elle pénaliserait " l'attractivité de la place financière de Paris " .
En revanche , laministre estime qu'" il serait logique de demander à la profession d'assumer les frais liés à la supervision (…)
Je réfléchis aux moyens de mettre à leur charge le coût d'une supervision bancaire renforcée et d'une meilleure protection des usagers des banques " .
" IL FAUT QUE MAINTENANT LES BANQUES PAIENT POUR LA CRISE "
Mettant en avant des arguments à la fois moraux et financiers , plusieurs pays d'Europe ont décidé de passer à l'acte .
C'est le cas de la Belgique .
" Il faut que maintenant les banques paient pour la crise qu'elles ont provoquée " , a expliqué , il y a quelques jours , la vice - premier ministre socialiste , Laurette Onkelinx .
Selon les arbitrages budgétaires du gouvernement fédéral présentés au Parlement , le secteur financier belge devrait verser à l'Etat 540 millions d'euros par an à partir de 2012 .
" La crise financière a démontré le rôle fondamental de l'Etat comme garant de dernier ressort des établissements financiers " , a expliqué le ministère belge des finances dans un communiqué .
L'Etat fédéral a injecté au total 15,2 milliards d'euros , une somme représentant 4,5 % du produit intérieur brut belge ( PIB ) .
En incluant l'aide des régions , le montant global est 20 iards d'euros , soit 6 % du PIB .
Au Royaume - Uni , le gouvernement s'apprêterait à lancer un " raid " fiscal sur les bénéfices des banques , selon les informations publiées dimanche 18 octobre par le Sunday Telegraph .
" Les ministres du cabinet et les hauts responsables à Downing street souhaitent que le ministre des finances , Alistair Darling , dévoile cette offensive fiscale contre les banques dans son pré-budget qui doit ê tre présenté au Parlement dans les six semaines " , écrit le journal .
L'hebdomadaire précise que même les banques n'ayant pas perçu de fonds publics seraient concernées par ce super - impôt .
Le gouvernement estime en effet , selon le Sunday Telegraph , que c'est le secteur tout entier qui a bénéficié des aides de l'Etat et que ce sont donc tous les établissements qui doivent récompenser les contribuables pour leurs efforts .
Le journal rappelle qu'un tel raid fiscal avait été opéré en 1981 par le gouvernement conservateur de Margaret Thatcher .
Au - delà de cette opération unique , qui rapporterait plusieurs centaines de millions de livres , le gouvernement travailliste songerait aussi à modifier , toujours selon le Sunday Telegraph , le système d'impôts sur les sociétés pour les banques qui leur permet actuellement de compenser leurs pertes sur plusieurs années fiscales .
Le premier ministre britannique Gordon Brown a affirmé , samedi , qu'il était " déterminé à mettre un terme aux pratiques bancaires imprudentes " , promettant que son gouvernement prendrait " des actions d'ampleur pour réformer l'ensemble de la culture du secteur financier " .
Le Sunday Telegraph , citant une source gouvernementale , signale que M. Brown serait entré dans une " colère noire " à l'annonce de profits et de bonus très élevés dans plusieurs banques .
Selon le Sunday Times , Royal Bank of Scotland , sauvée in extremis de la faillite en octobre 2008 et nationalisée à 70 % , prévoit de verser 4 milliards de livres ( 4,39 milliards d'euros ) de bonus aux salariés de sa banque d'investissement .

She ’s 97 years old and homeless .
Bessie Mae Berger has her two boys , and that ’s about all .
She and sons Larry Wilkerson , 60 , and Charlie Wilkerson , 62 , live in a 1973 Chevrolet Suburban they park each night on a busy Venice street .
For the most part , it ’s a lonely life -- days spent passing the time away in public parks , parking lots and shopping centers around the Westside .
Occasionally , when they need cash , Bessie sits by the side of the road and seeks handouts .
She holds a cardboard sign in her lap : “ I am 97 years old .
Homeless .
Broke .
Need help please . ”

This has attracted attention -- both wanted and unwanted .
Randall Zook , a Culver City TV advertising producer , pulled over on a recent day when he saw her holding the sign in front of a Costco on Washington Boulevard .
“ This little lady hit me deeply .
I said I have to do something .
I just ca n’t pass by her , ” Zook said .
“ I went over and talked to her and was moved by her dignity .
She was n’t begging .
She just asked , ‘ Do you have a home for me ? ’ ”
Zook did n’t , but he gave her “ more money than I ’ve ever given anyone . ”

For everyone who gives , there are many others who just drive by or simply stare .
“ It makes me feel like I ’m a bum , ” Bessie said .
“ I do n’t mind living at the mercy of the public because some of the public is good -- they ’re nice to me .
But there are some that are nasty .
Some of them laugh at me and my sign .
They say they do n’t think I ’m 97 years old . ”
Reaching slowly into a pocket , she pulls out a laminated California state identification card that shows her date of birth : March 2 , 1912 .
Los Angeles police have warned her not to beg .
And some passersby have turned to her sons , questioning why they cannot properly care for her .

“ They ask why we are n’t able to get her off the street .
But we can ’t .
I have no income whatsoever , ” Larry Wilkerson said .
“ A few days ago , my mother was sitting out with a sign over at Lincoln and Olympic .
We were sitting four hours and she was doing pretty good .
But then a police officer came along and said , ‘ You ca n’t do this ’ and ordered us off . ”
Nighttime is the most uncomfortable part of their lives .
About 8:30 p.m. , when Bessie tries to fall asleep , they use magnets to stretch a thin blue blanket over their SUV ’s windshield to block the streetlights .

Charlie and Larry listen to a battery - operated portable radio - TV ( the television does n’t work ) or chat quietly until about 10 , when they try to doze off .
They sleep fitfully against the backdrop of cars roaring down Venice Boulevard and the distinctive screech of MTA buses .
Bessie spends the night hunched over and wrapped in blankets .
Larry curls up in the back seat and Charlie folds himself into the rear of the Suburban , moving aside a tool box , a gas can , piles of clothing and boxes holding food and other possessions .
The largest items are stacked outside .

They awaken about 7 , when the morning commuter rush is beginning and the sun is starting to peek through the trees that shade the neighborhood near the Venice Public Library .
After reloading the Suburban , they drive to a nearby Albertsons supermarket .
There , they wash up in a restroom in the back of the store .
On their way out , they buy bananas and small containers of yogurt or cottage cheese for Bessie , and sandwich fixings -- often sliced turkey -- and grapes and other fruit for Charlie and Larry .
They eat inside the Suburban , Larry behind the wheel on the worn front seat and his mother at his side .
Charlie sits on the back seat .

During the day , they make short trips in the battered vehicle , which they have spray - painted a flat black .
The Suburban gets about six miles to the gallon , so they try to stick to Venice as they hunt for inconspicuous places to park for a few hours .
Weekdays , they pull into a Venice Beach parking lot , where they can enter for free with their disabled parking tag .
They spend afternoons there , watching the sun set and hoping that circling sea gulls do n’t bomb the Suburban with sticky white droppings .
“ We talk to other homeless people , ” Charlie said .
The three use the Westside Center for Independent Living in Venice as the mailing address for their monthly Social Security and disability checks .

Once a week they drive to Hollywood , where free showers are available at a drop - in center .
Sometimes , free hot meals are served from a food truck .
Last week they had a spaghetti dinner .
During this week ’s trip there , they encountered actor - comedian Kevin Nealon at a gas station .
He bought gas for them and introduced them to Laugh Factory owner Jamie Masada , who gave them pizza for dinner and said he may attempt to organize a fundraising show for them .
They live mostly on Bessie ’s $ 375 monthly Social Security check , Charlie ’s $ 637 disability payments , Larry ’s $ 300 food stamp allocation and cash from bottles and cans they collect and recycle .
Bessie can add a few more dollars to the budget by panhandling .
When she leaves the Suburban ’s front seat , her two sons ease her into a fold - up wheelchair they carry in the back .

Bessie was born in the Bay Area city of Richmond six weeks before the Titanic sank .
“ My mother carried my oldest brother through the earthquake and fire in San Francisco , ” she said .
“ I ’ve seen all the wars from World War I on down to the last one . ”
Bessie spent her young adulthood in Northern California and worked as a packer for the National Biscuit Co. until she was in her 60s .
She gave birth to 11 children , eight of whom are still living .
She remains in contact only with Charlie and Larry , who were both born in San Francisco , grew up in Santa Rosa and have high school educations .
Their father , who had worked in San Francisco - area shipyards and as a Hollywood stunt driver , died in 1966 .
In all , Bessie has outlived three husbands .
Charlie has been married four times , and Larry was briefly married once .
Neither has children .

Charlie worked in construction and as a painter before becoming disabled by degenerative arthritis .
Larry was a cook before compressed discs in the back and a damaged neck nerve put an end to it .
Twenty - six years ago , he began working as a full - time caregiver for his mother through the state ’s In - Home Supportive Services program .
That ended about four years ago , when the owner of a Palm Springs home where they lived had to sell the place .
At the same time , the state dropped Larry and his mother from the support program , he said .
The three have tried at various times since to get government - subsidized housing .
But they have failed , in part because they insist on living together .
They say they have driven the Suburban around the state looking for a housing program that will accommodate them .
They have been in Los Angeles about eight months , following a stint in the Concord area .

They thought Bessie had finally qualified for federal Section 8 housing -- she had been promised a rental voucher , they say .
But then she needed surgery to replace a pacemaker and spent three months in a recovery center .
Housing authorities in Northern California awarded the voucher to someone else during her absence , according to her sons .
Living in the front seat is miserable , she said .
Still , she is glad to at least have that .
The Suburban is a constant source of headaches for the three .
It is riddled with rust , and a tailgate window is permanently stuck open .
During a recent trip to a storage unit they rent in Palm Springs , the Suburban ’s rear axle broke .
It cost them $ 600 to replace , they said .
As the season ’s first rainstorm approached , they purchased a large piece of plastic to duct - tape over the vehicle ’s rear window .

They would like to find a way to stay together in a house or apartment .
Bessie qualifies for government - paid senior citizen assistance , but her two sons are too young .
“ There ’s a million empty homes here in California , but they ca n’t seem to find one we can live in , ” Larry said .
But help still might be available , said Shirley Christensen , assistant to the director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services .
Larry might qualify for Social Security disability benefits without having to sell the Suburban , as he had feared , if the old SUV is considered to have no resale value , she said .
He and his brother might both qualify for general relief benefits .
Advertisement
At 97 , Bessie is eligible for a referral to the county ’s Department of Adult Protective Services , Christensen said .
But that might not lead to a housing arrangement that will keep her and her sons together , officials acknowledged .
“ Housing is really tough in L.A. County right now , but there are programs that provide housing assistance , ” said Mary Sanders , community liaison with the office that handles hotline screening for Adult Protective Services .
“ I ’m not sure that would be with her and her sons . ”
If nothing else , a protective services caseworker could help the three determine whether they ’re receiving all of the benefits they are entitled to .
Advertisement
Told this , Larry took the protective services agency ’s phone number and said he would call .
The three were at Venice Beach , where Larry cursed at the swooping gulls that were splotching the Suburban with droppings .
Earlier this day , the three had spent $ 40 on a money order to pay for a Northern California storage unit and $ 52 to replace their pre-paid cellphone after it was accidentally doused with coffee .
They use the phone for emergencies , to keep tabs on their storage spaces and to call the facility where they get their mail .
Larry watched a passerby glance with apparent disdain at Bessie ’s cardboard sign , which was taped to the Suburban ’s passenger - side window .

“ They think we ’re liars , ” he said .
Bessie sat alone inside the vehicle as the blue blanket over the windshield shaded her from the late - afternoon sun .

As I wrote earlier this year , one of the sticking points I encounter in conversation is when someone challenges me that America does not have , as I allege , a military empire .
However , they never seem to be able to rattle off any facts or statistics to the contrary .
This updated article is my attempt to document those facts .
The Department of Defense last issued information on troop deployment in March 2009 . ( photo )
The DoD report reveals :
America has military personnel in 150 countries .
There are 194 states in the world , so therefore we have troops in 77 % of all countries on the planet .
The size of America 's armed forces is 1,412,529 soldiers .
380,011 of these troops , or 27 % are stationed on land overseas .
( Included in this figure is an estimate 25,000 in South Korea . ) 16 % of our troops are engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan .
54,043 soldiers are based in Germany , although WWII ended 64 years ago .
34,544 soldiers are based in Japan , although WWII ended 64 years ago .
Although figures were not available ( and reported as zero ) , 24,655 soldiers were reported last quarter as based in South Korea as technically this “ police action ” that resulted in the deaths of 36,516 Americans and the wounding of 92,134 .
In my opinion , the greatest barrier to peace with North Korea is the presence of these soldiers .
We have only 15 troops and 0 bases in Vietnam , and get along with their nation fairly well , considering 58,159 were killed and 303,635 wounded during that “ police action . ”
The 2008 DoD military “ Base Structure Report ” reveals :
America 's DoD is “ one of the world 's largest “ landlords ” possessing 545,714 buildings , 5,429 bases , spanning 29.8 million acres of land .
( p3/205 )
761 bases , or 14 % , are located on foreign soil .
( p23/205 )
12 of the 111 bases designated as “ large ” are located on foreign soil .
( p33/205 )
However , reading the remainder of the report reveals that bases in countries such as Afghanistan , Iraq , and Israel are not listed , so both number of bases and “ large ” bases are too low .
Over 5,100 soldiers have died in Iraq and Afghanistan for the War of Terror. ( source )
Furthermore , CBS and the military revealed that 18 veterans commit suicide per day during the 8 - year Global War on Terror , resulting in an estimated 46,000 deaths .
( source )
Time Magazine asked several days ago “ Why Are Army Recruiters Killing Themselves ? “
The DoD stated its total spending in 2009 will be $ 620 Billion .
( p7/26 ) The data put together by War Resisters League appears to be closer to reality .
They demonstrate that America will spend $ 1,449 Billion on our military during 2009 .
They estimate the War of Terror has cost $ 990 Billion .
However , the numbers placed together by Dr. Robert Higgs are perhaps the best estimate of our military budget , at over $ 1 trillion annually .
Keep these facts in mind when “ supporting our troops . ”
My conclusion is the best way to do this is for all major deployments should return to US soil as soon as possible .
There is absolutely no reason not to immediately begin returning the troops from Germany , Japan , and even South Korea .
Without a state of war declared , there is no constitutional reason to have these troops based abroad , other than to support the military empire .
Restore the Republic or Pay for a Bankrupt Military Empire , this is the current generation 's choice .

The Justice Department has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for allegedly misleading Congress about the Bush administration ’s warrantless eavesdropping program .
The decision was first disclosed yesterday by reporter Murray Waas in a little - noticed posting on the blog of New York Magazine .
The magazine cited public court records and federal law enforcement officials as its sources .
ADVERTISEMENT
Although Gonzales remains under investigation by the Justice Department for two other matters , it had been allegations that he gave false or purposely misleading testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the warrantless eavesdropping program that placed him by far in the greatest legal jeopardy .
In not bringing criminal charges , however , investigators for the Department ’s Inspector General , which conducted the investigation , hardly let Gonzales off the hook completely .
They concluded that Gonzales testimony before Congress about the eavesdropping program was “ confusing , ” “ incomplete ’ and had the “ effect of misleading ” both Congress and the public .
A major reason that Gonzales escaped criminal charges , according to people close to the investigation , was that he was willing to do something that he had steadfastly refused to even contemplate before : admit that many of his most controversial decisions , first as White House counsel , and later , as Attorney General , in authorizing , overseeing , and concealing the eavesdropping program were done at the specific directive of former President Bush .
In other instances , Gonzales and his attorneys argued to the Justice Department that Gonzales ’ actions were done in furtherance of Bush administration ’s policies , and thus he did not act with personal intent to do wrong .
“ He was willing to be lightning rod in the past for the President , ” one legal source close to the investigation told reporter Waas for his New York magazine post , “ He has done that during the entire course of his career .
But it was pressed upon him that that was not going to work in this instance — and he did what he had to do . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
As Waas explained in the article :
Ironically , in finally talking to investigators about the president , Gonzales might actually have been protecting his old boss , as well as himself .
A senior Bush - administration official familiar with the matter told me that Fred Fielding , the White House counsel in the closing days of the Bush presidency , feared that the Justice Department ’s probe of Gonzales ’s misleading testimony might morph into a special prosecutor ’s investigation not only of Gonzales , but also of the conduct of others in the Bush White House — including perhaps Bush himself .
( The Justice Department can refer an investigation to the attorney general for a criminal or special prosecutor to take over . )
Fielding quietly counseled Gonzales ’s cooperation , and Gonzales ’s legal team , headed by George J. Terwilliger III , a deputy attorney general during the presidency of the first President Bush , made an early decision to fully cooperate with the inspector general .
The internal Justice Department watchdog agency , the department ’s Inspector General , which conducted the investigation , has no prosecutorial powers of its own , Waas wrote
If during the course of an investigation , however , the Inspector General can seek to have a criminal prosecutor or even a special prosecutor take over its investigation to determine if criminal charges are warranted – as was the case in regards to an Inspector General ’s investigation of the firings by the Bush administration of some nine U.S. Attorneys .
A federal criminal prosecutor is currently examining the role of former White House aide Karl Rove and various other Bush administration officials in regards to the firings .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the instance of Gonzales ’ testimony regarding the eavesdropping program , however , that was not the case .
And in the meantime , Gonzales continues to be under investigation by a second Justice Department oversight agency , the Office of Professional Responsibility , for his role in authorizing , as White House counsel , and then overseeing , as Attorney General , Bush ’s warantless surveillance program .
Both Bush and Gon zales took heat for attempting to shut down the investigation by refusing to provide security clearances for investigators– even though they had come to know that the probe would scrutinize their own conduct .
Gonzales later said that Bush himself made the decision not to grant the clearances .
When it was learned that Bush himself was responsible , congressional pressure led to the investigators being allowed to obtain the clearances and conduct their investigation .
There is no word as to when that probe might be over .
ADVERTISEMENT
And , meanwhile , an investigation of Rove ’s role by the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility in the Dan Siegelman prosecution is continuing .
Rove ’s attorney has claimed that Rove has been cooperating with that investigation .
The results of that investigation will not be known for at least several more months .
Prosecutors have not indicated when that investigation might be completed .
There is a somewhat little known department here at Microsoft called the Applied Science Group and they do some truly incredible work .

After he demo-ed the keyboard for me he showed off some of the winning applications made for it from the User Interface Software & Technology Conference .
Absolutely Innovative !
This is one application that can literally blow away anyone ’s mind .
It takes the world of Photoshop to the Next Level .
All you have to do is draw a rough sketch with labels , it will try to replace those with images from the Internet with the closest match using Sophisticated Image - recognition algorithms .
A true Internet image Montage .
Here is an example :
PhotoSketch is an internet - based Cloud application that can take the rough , labeled sketch on the left and magically turn it into the REAL on the right .
Seems unbelievable watch the video :
The basic how - it - works , is presented in a research paper [ pdf ] .
Here is the summary :
Step 1 .
Draw the outlines of the figures you want in your picture – anything from seagulls to a Mercedes , whatever tickles your fancy , Step 2 .
Add labels for each of the items , as well as for the background .
Step 3 . PhotoSketch will then find real - life images to match your doodles and put them together in a Photoshopped image that will make your jaw drop .
PhotoSketch ’s blending algorithm analyzes each of these images , compares them with each other , and decides which are better for the blending process .
It automatically traces and places them into a single photograph , matching the scene , and adding shadows .
Of course , the results are less than perfect , but they are good enough :
I tired this yesterday and it was like one of the most innovative technologies i`ve seen in my life .
If you want to try this out , you ’ll probably have to wait .
It became so popular within hours of the release that the load on their servers has taken their site down .

Talk show host and one - man media empire Glenn Beck has lost his bid to shut down the glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com domain name .
We 've covered the strange circumstances of the case before : a Gilbert Gottfried comedy routine ( NSFW ) about Bob Saget raping and murdering a teenaged girl made its way to the Fark forums , where commenters quickly adapted it for use with Glenn Beck .
The idea is to force someone to explain away completely baseless charges made by insinuation alone ; since Beck already has a reputation for doing this , the joke was supposed to give Beck a taste of his own medicine .
But when one Isaac Eiland - Hall turned the joke into a website , Beck 's lawyers went after it , claiming that it infringed on Beck 's trademarked name and should be turned over to Beck immediately .
Eiland - Hall enlisted lawyer Marc Randazza to draft one of the oddest World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) domain name arbitration responses we 've ever read , but Randazza announced on his blog last Friday that the filling had paid off — WIPO 's arbiter ruled against Beck ( PDF , via TechDirt ) .
While agreeing that the site included Beck 's trademark , the arbiter noted that " even a ' moron in a hurry ' would not likely conclude that Complainant sponsored , endorsed , or was affiliated with the website addressed by the disputed domain name . "
But the bigger question was whether Beck 's trademark was being used in a legitimate way , or whether it had been registered in bad faith .
( The decision cites , as an example of bad faith , a case in which an auto parts company targeted its competition with a [ competitor ] sucks.com website that sent traffic to the first company . )
" Respondent appears to the Panel to be engaged in a parody of the style or methodology that Respondent appears genuinely to believe is employed by Complainant in the provision of political commentary , " says the decision , " and for that reason Respondent can be said to be making a political statement .
This constitutes a legitimate noncommercial use of Complainant 's mark . "
While WIPO refused to turn over the domain name to Beck , the arbiter did note that he was taking no position on whether the domain name or the site contents might be " defamation . "
That decision can only be made by a US court , though Beck 's lawyers have not so far sought to push the question .
After winning the WIPO dispute , Eiland - Hall decided to poke the beehive one last time .
He issued a public letter ( PDF ) to Glenn Beck which opens by noting that " I have prevailed in the WIPO action that you filed against me .
I write now to voluntarily relinquish the disputed domain to you , even though you did not win the case . "
The letter goes on to critique Beck 's willingness to " pander to the fears and insecurities of your audience , " the fact that he " denigrated the letter of First Amendment law , " and the way his lawyers attracted even more attention to the site by filing the WIPO complaint .
The letter ends by providing the domain username and password to Beck 's lawyers , and the domain name is currently dead .
Not that Eiland - Hall actually pulled the plug on his parody ; it 's still up and running at GB1990.com , where Eiland - Hall touts the fact that " WE WON ! " and then wishes Beck a speedy recovery from his recent bout of appendicitis .

Britain is one of the world 's main arms exporters UK - based arms dealers may have been selling former Soviet weapons from Ukraine to blacklisted countries , a cross-party group of MPs has warned .
The MPs said they were " extremely concerned " the UK government had not been aware of a list of arms dealers licensed by the Ukrainian authorities .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband has ordered an investigation into the alleged transactions .
The MPs are calling for tougher restrictions on arms exports .
The MPs - known as the Committees on Arms Export Controls - describe how they alerted Mr Miliband to a list of UK dealers granted licences to export small arms from the Soviet weapons stockpile .
They say this information was handed to them by Ukraine 's deputy foreign minister on a fact - finding trip to Kiev .
" We were alarmed to see that the end users on the list included countries for which there are Foreign and Commonwealth Office restrictions on the export of strategic goods , " the MPs write .
BIGGEST ARMS EXPORTERS 1 . USA - $ 12.8bn 2 . Russia - $ 7.4bn 3 . France - $ 6.2bn 4 . Israel - $ 4.4bn 5 . UK - $ 4.1 bn Source : Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .
Figures are for 2007 and exclude China , which does not release data on the value of its arms exports .
The list did not say whether the arms were exported directly from Ukraine to the end users or whether they were shipped via the UK first - and did not indicate the value or type of weapons .
But the MPs said there were ongoing concerns about ex-Soviet weapons " ending up in undesirable locations " .
Mr Miliband wrote to the MPs to say HM Revenue and Customs and the Export Control Organisation had launched an investigation but asked them not to publish details of the Ukrainian list " as it would alert the companies to the fact that we are investigating , and might lead those who have committed an offence to try and cover their tracks " .
The MPs are calling for British embassies in major arms - exporting countries to obtain better information on Britons involved in the trade .
' Responsibility '
The report says all UK residents and British citizens overseas should obtain licences before trading any goods featured on the " military list " of weapons and equipment .
Committees chairman , Labour MP Roger Berry , said : " The UK has a responsibility to ensure that its arms export industry , and individual UK citizens working overseas , are not engaging in the illegal arms trade . "
The government shares the committees ' concerns regarding military exports fuelling conflict in countries such as Sri Lanka
Foreign Office
The MPs welcomed Mr Miliband 's decision earlier this year to revoke export licences to Israel .
The revoked licences are reported to cover spare parts for Israeli boats which allegedly fired missiles and artillery shells into Palestinian territory during the invasion of Gaza last year .
In their report , the MPs said the government must do more to ensure equipment is not being used against civilians in war zones and highlighted concerns arms exported from the UK have been used against civilians in Sri Lanka 's civil war .
Britain and other EU countries are reported to have sold arms to the country 's government in the final three years of its conflict with the Tamil Tigers .
The MPs say they are concerned weapons and equipment exported to the country during a ceasefire may have been used against civilians when hostilities escalated in 2006 .
' Full review '
The MPs say applications for licences for arms exports to Israel and Sri Lanka should continue to be assessed case - by - case .
Britain , which is one of the world 's biggest arms exporters , has been involved in efforts to set up a global arms sales treaty and since December has been subject to an EU - wide agreement , although campaigners say it is ineffective as enforcement is down to individual countries .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " The government shares the committees ' concerns regarding military exports fuelling conflict in countries such as Sri Lanka .
" As a result of the intensified fighting in Sri Lanka earlier this year , the government launched a full review of export licensing decisions to Sri Lanka .
In particular , whether there was a need to revoke any licences that were now in breach of the criteria governing export controls .
" This review is nearing completion , and the outcome will be reported to Parliament . "
He added : " Overall , we are pleased that the committees endorse our policy of case - by - case assessment for assessing export licences . "
The Committees on Arms Export Controls is made up of members of four different select committees : business and enterprise , defence , foreign affairs and international development .

Coal mines , like this one in China , could be taxed ( Image : China Photos / Getty )
Goods should be taxed to reflect the damage they do to the planet , with revenues redistributed to society .
CONSIDER this injustice .
Governments tax labour and profit , the engines of prosperity , while pollution and the depletion of resources – arguably the greatest threats to our economic well - being – remain largely untouched .
So while we ’re thinking about how to rebuild our broken economies , here ’s a plea for a new cornerstone : a universal carbon tax .
The world needs to put a price on carbon , that much is agreed .
The Kyoto protocol involves a very different mechanism , known as cap and trade .
Permits to emit carbon are distributed among polluters up to a total , or “ cap ” , equivalent to existing levels of carbon emissions .
Those who do n’t use all their permits can sell them to those who exceed their allocation .
Over time , the number of permits is reduced , raising their price and encouraging people to reduce emissions .
That ’s the theory , but the reality has not lived up to expectations .
The world ’s largest cap - and - trade scheme , the European Union ’s Emissions Trading System , saw emissions rise 2 per cent in its first trading period from 2005 to 2007 .
Too many permits were distributed , and after tripling in value in the first six months of trading , their price rapidly collapsed to virtually nothing .
Tweaks introduced for the scheme ’s second phase might make it more effective , but there are some weaknesses to cap and trade that will never be eradicated .
In particular , it is open to manipulation and political influence , and if not properly managed just shifts pollution around rather than reducing …

BBC News , Sesame Street
Before you are introduced to the characters from Sesame Street you are handed a list of rules and suggestions - the sort of thing you are given before meeting members of a royal family .
Some of the puppet protocol is obvious enough - you are politely discouraged from attempting to establish if Bert and Ernie are gay - but some is a little more subtle .
When you meet Elmo for example - you must remember that he is only three years old .
So questions about the significance of Sesame Street 's 40th anniversary or the challenges of adapting it for any of the 120 foreign markets in which it is now established are out .
They are as meaningless to Elmo as they would be to any three - year - old child .
Why Britain fell out of love with Sesame Street
If you want to see what happens when someone ignores the rules take a look at the encounter between Ricky Gervais and Elmo which you can find on YouTube .
It begins with the comedian establishing his own version of the puppet etiquette - no talk about drugs , child abuse or the Holocaust .
And it proceeds - via a mention of necrophilia , surely something of a first on Sesame Street - to a discussion of why Elmo goes around naked all day in his natural red fur but then puts on pyjamas before going to bed .
Elmo takes it all in his stride .
" It 's called acting , Mr Gervais . ACTING , " he declaims grandly .
The journalists who are being invited to meet Elmo to mark the programme 's anniversary probably tend to be a bit less challenging than that - I certainly was .
But of course , while we would tend to stick rigidly to the rules , there is no guarantee that Elmo will .
HAVE YOUR SAY
My favourite characters were Cookie Monster , The Count and Grover .
My heroes even today !
Maria , Leicester Bundle of love
In fact , in the hands of Kevin Clash , the brilliant puppeteer who is always on hand whenever Elmo appears in public , the rules tend to go out the window .
Elmo is a bright - red bundle of love , curiosity , innocence and energy in the show - and in person he is extraordinarily compelling .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He seems so real , for want of a better word , that the producer working on the story with me instinctively pointed the microphone at the puppet 's mouth , not at Kevin Clash .
Happens all the time apparently .
I gamely applied the rules - as best I could - asking Elmo such age - appropriate questions as the name of his best friend .
Elmo , of course , is bound by no such rules and is thus able to run rings around his interviewers - or at least , this interviewer .
Having established where I lived in the US , Elmo was able to recommend the oysters in a local Cajun restaurant - not quite what you would expect from a three - year - old .
Nor was his explanation of why he does not have eyebrows - a taste for very hot wasabi , it seems .
Kevin Clash - apart from having a mischievous sense of humour - infuses Elmo with life .
When you are in the character 's company he seems as real as you seem yourself and his co-stars , Rosita and the Telly Monster exude a similar , life - like charisma .
Powerful tool Telly Monster is meant to be only five but in the hands of Martin P Robinson , his human alter ego , he radiates the sort of amused world - weariness you would associate with a stand - up comedian from the days of vaudeville .
Sesame
St has adapted to foreign markets with local puppets Rosita - played by Carmen Osbahr - has a mildly flirtatious quality which I must confess to finding rather attractive .
And if you think that sounds ridiculous , you will just have to take my word for it that when you are in the company of the puppets , it is easy to find yourself captivated by them .
And of course that is precisely what makes Sesame Street such a powerful tool for teaching - not for nothing is it known as the world 's greatest informal educator .
Children are spellbound by the characters and are drawn into a world where it seems somehow natural to absorb their letters and numbers as they watch .
In the episode we saw being filmed for example , the letter " I " goes missing - stolen by a dog .
Telly and Elmo do eventually get it back of course , but as they do there is plenty of discussion about how the letter is able to make two distinct sounds .
" I " is for ice cream of course , but it also starts the word " iguana " too it is a painless way for children to embark on the path to literacy and numeracy .
And of course , there is more to education than simply learning your numbers and letters .
Sesame Street has an explicit social purpose too - lessons about the importance of learning to share , and about tolerance , are part of the mix as well .
Rosita , for example , is an immigrant from Mexico - one of her jobs is to teach the audience a word of Spanish every day - and the manner in which she is accepted by the other characters teaches young Americans an important subliminal message about inclusion and social cohesion .
Lessons taught The Sesame Street formula is powerful and flexible .
The format has been exported to about 120 countries where it is fine - tuned to take account of local circumstances .
The South African version , for example , includes a character called Kami who is HIV positive and whose mother died of HIV\AIDS .
The use of a puppet in a children 's TV series to teach lessons about tolerance and bereavement is proof that Sesame Street is flourishing as it reaches its 40th birthday and still finding new worlds to conquer .
Inevitably , as Sesame Street 's anniversary approaches , you will hear lots of facts and figures about the scope and scale of its reach - foreign markets conquered , number of episodes taped , total weeks that its hit songs ( Rubber Ducky ) have spent on the charts that type of thing .
But the things that really matter cannot be counted - the number of hearts that have been lifted and the number of imaginations that have been fired over the years .
The Sesame Street mixture of slapstick , artfully disguised education and gentle moralising is a robust one and it seems certain to last many more years - continuing to teach the children of the world not just how to count , but how to become the kind of people who can be counted on .

Ubuntu , Google , and the Future of Linux .
And rsync too .
There 's a provocatively titled article by Robert Strohmeyer over at PC World that professes " The Future of Linux is Google " .
It waxes prophetically about how Google will eventually dominate all that is Linux and Open Source , and that " it 's time for the Linux world to rally " .
It starts off with a nod to Ubuntu , with the author telling us he used to believe Ubuntu ( and Canonical ) was destined to lead Linux into the mainstream .
The reason I can't seem to get this one out of my mind is because of the whole rallying thing ; the idea that Google is now Linux 's great hope and that we should all rally behind Google .
Forget about Ubuntu and the others .
Google is where it's at , even if Chrome does n't officially exist yet .
Seemingly seconds after the article 's publication , Chrome OS because available for download , as if fate were doffing its cap to Google 's power .
It 's interesting reading and I do recommend that you check it out .
But let 's be honest though .
Without Linux , Google might not have grown into the powerhouse you see today .
I 'm not saying it would n't have been a successful company , just not as successful .
It sure as hell would n't be as profitable as it is if its option was to hand out individual license payments to Microsoft for each and every server it deployed .
For the sake of brevity , I wo n't even start on Linux 's obvious superiority as a server OS when compared to Windows .
Conservative estimates from Wikipedia suggest that Google has more than 450.000 servers in its global supermegagigantic cluster .
Meanwhile , an article over at Pandia quotes a Gartner Invest estimate of 1 million servers ; with multicore instances and virtual machines taken into account , that number is apparently closer to 3 million .
With Google deploying an additional 100,000 servers per quarter , and given that this last article is from July 2007 , I can extrapolate and say that Google now has some 2 million servers , not counting all those cores and virtual machines .
Running Linux .
Whatever the real number is ( Google 's not saying ) , one fact is indisputable .
Running Linux and open source has saved Google an enormous amount of cash .
Running Linux has allowed Google the means to create custom , finely tuned systems , optimized for its business and technological needs .
It has also given Google the power to develop , and play with , many different applications from which to increase its already considerable * ahem * monetary assets .
Building your business around Linux and Open Source software is n't just about saving on license costs either .
In doing so , Google can take advantage of a formidable army of enormously talented and dedicated developers in the FOSS community at large ( a pause while I acknowledge that the FOSS community also benefits from Google 's largesse , so there is most definitely give and take . )
Those applications , by the way , just keep coming .
Gmail .
Google Maps .
Google Calendar .
Google Earth .
Android on cell phones and other mobile devices .
The nascent Chrome OS is yet another example of Google using Linux to provide the next generation of cloud - based applications and power future netbooks .
The real truth here is that Linux is the future of Google , along with its present , and its past .
Linux has helped Google , in part at least , to become the powerhouse we both love and fear .
So where does that leave Ubuntu ?
Right where it is with all the potential is already has .
Same for the other Linux vendors .
Chrome OS is a cloud - based application delivery platform , built for a very specific purpose , namely those little netbooks .
Your data and the heart of the applications in Chrome OS live in Google 's cloud .
A lot of people will be very happy with that .
There are , however , countless other applications that are n't suited to the cloud - based model .
Applications that can only realistically live on the desktop ( at least for the foreseeable future ) .
Desktop Linux , and Ubuntu by extension , will continue to thrive there and to evolve into something even greater than what it is today .
Chrome competes with Microsoft where Microsoft is , er , softest .
The cloud .
On the desktop , Ubuntu ( along with other Linux distributions ) , is still the best alternative to the expensive , proprietary , virus - infested , patent - laden , troublesome operating system that currently controls the vast majority of desktops .
Oops , that last part was supposed to be my inside voice .
Okay , enough Google .
Backups .
Last week , I told you about my NAS purchase , and my desire to explore desktop applications for backing up your Ubuntu computer .
From the administrative interface of my Buffalo NAS , I created a network share that I could access with the different systems in my office .
It 's an SMB share so that it can also be accessed from Windows if needs arise .
I then permanently mount those shares as network file systems ( though not NFS ) on my Kubuntu Karmic system .
This I do from the command line ; actually , it runs from my rc.local boot script .
/ bin/ mount -t cifs -o uid=marcel , gid=marcel -o username=marcel , password=secretpassword //bvault/ marcel /mnt/ vault
Because I am mounting a cifs type filesystem , I previously had to install the smbfs package ( sudo apt - get install smbfs ) .
The uid and gid flags give the mounted file systems permissions that allow me to store creation and modification time information , useful for a backup .
I can have , and in fact do have , several mounted shares depending on whether this is for backups , or for storing music or videos .
In this case , vault just happens to be the name I give to the folder where I store my backups .
The first application I want to share with you is actually a command line application , though what I actually want to do is show off some of the friendlier graphical applications ( and I will do that starting next week ) .
Since most of them will use rsync , I 'll spend this week giving you a quick overview of how rsync works .
rsync - av local_folder remote_folder
Using my own data vault to back up my Ubuntu User folder , I might see something like this .
$rsync - av Issue3 / mnt / vault / ubuntu_user sending incremental file list Issue3 / Issue3 / Issue 3 Remote Control.odt Issue3 / Issue 3 Remote Control.txt Issue3/Remote_Desktop_Preferences.png
Issue3/create_invitation.png Issue3/email_invitation.png Issue3/gnome_clients_connected.png Issue3/gnome_from_kde.png Issue3/kde_from_gnome.png
Issue3/krdc_options.png Issue3/krdc_viewing_gnome.png Issue3/krfb_configure.png Issue3/krfb_incoming.png Issue3/nx_configure.png Issue3/nx_connect.png Issue3/nx_remote_centos.png Issue3/personal_invitation.png Issue3/recursive_gnome.png Issue3/remote_menu.png Issue3/view_desktop_allow.png Issue3/vinaigre_authenticate.png Issue3/vinaigre_connect.png Issue3/vinaigre_start.png sent 5232421 bytes received 434 bytes 1162856.67 bytes /sec total size is 5230173 speedup is 1.00
Easy .
For rsync to be a really useful engine though , it should be able to delete files .
After all , if you are mirroring a folder ( or folders ) , it stands to reason that you want the mirror to represent exactly what is on the original .
If files have been deleted , you want them deleted on the backup as well .
We make this magic happen with the - - delete flag .
I 'll start by deleting the image for vinaigre_start.png from the local folder .
$rsync - av -- delete Issue3 / mnt / vault / ubuntu_user sending incremental file list Issue3 / deleting Issue3/vinaigre_start.png sent 699 bytes received 16 bytes 1430.00 bytes/sec
That 's it .
Both folders , including my local folder and the remotely mounted folder , are in sync .
Next week , I 'll get graphical on you .
Promise .
Feel free to try this at home .
Until next time . . .
Knut Hamsun
Dreamer and Dissenter

Knut Hamsun
The Dark Side of Literary Brilliance
Monika { Zcaron}agar
University of Washington Press : 344 pp. , $ 30 paper
In the spring of 1891 , 31 - year - old Knut Hamsun , penniless and hounded by debtors , embarked on a lecture tour of his native Norway .
He had recently published his first successful novel , “ Hunger ” ; now , he hoped to bolster his reputation with a public assault on the old guard of Norwegian writers , including playwright Henrik Ibsen .
Hamsun padded lecture halls with friendly artists and publishers , and in Oslo , at the majestic Hals Brothers auditorium , he gave Ibsen a front row seat .
“ We have grown so used to believing what the Germans say about Ibsen that we read him assuming we will find words of wisdom , ” Hamsun said in Oslo , looking directly at his chosen target .
In fact , Hamsun continued , Ibsen had never offered any insight into the modern condition ; he was a writer of the most shallow social drama , hobbled by an “ indefensibly coarse and artificial psychology . ”
The playwright sat impassively through the tirade .
But as Ingar Sletten Kolloen writes in his incisive new biography , “ Knut Hamsun : Dreamer and Dissenter , ” he may have been threatened by the young upstart , and for good reason .
Hamsun , the coarse son of a shareholder , represented everything that Ibsen did not .
He had no use for what he termed the “ rigidity ” of Ibsen ’s writing , and he sought to establish a new literature , sharpened by anger , political turbulence and existential unrest -- a literature , in short , to match the realities of the modern age .
“ Hunger , ” based in part on Hamsun ’s experiences , traces a man ’s descent into a madness that is religious in ardor ; the man wishes to prostrate himself on the floor of the world .
He ponders suicide .
He wanders around the streets of Oslo .
He starves .
He attempts to chew off his own finger and then , a few hundred pages later , he leaves without explanation on a ship bound for foreign shores .
There is nothing in the book but madness -- Hamsun skips the periods when his protagonist has food and comfort .
In an 1890 essay , Hamsun wrote that a true portrait of the human spirit could never be conceived linearly or politely .
Life was not a story , but a scattershot series of episodic flashes , fast - burning and painful to remember .
To thrive , an artist must leave the city for the rough living of the country .
He must immerse himself in “ the unpredictable chaos of perception , the delicate life of the imagination held under the microscope ; the meanderings of these thoughts and feelings in the blue , trackless , traceless journeys of the heart and mind , curious workings of the psyche , the whisperings of the blood , prayers of the bone , the entire unconscious life of the mind . ”
In his prime , Hamsun always wrote like this -- beautifully , poetically and savagely .
Within a decade of the Oslo speech , he had finished two additional novels , the naturalist ode “ Pan ” and the disorienting “ Mysteries , ” which , together with “ Hunger , ” count as cornerstones of contemporary literature .
“ The whole school of fiction in the 20th century stems from Hamsun , ” Isaac Bashevis Singer once proclaimed , and it is no stretch to say that there would never have been Kafka ’s “ A Hunger Artist ” without “ Hunger . ”
And yet Hamsun , personally and politically , was a monster .
He berated his friends and cheated on his wives ; he could be horrible to his children .
He was possessed from an early age by a rage he never managed to shake , which came from fears of inadequacy -- fiscal , sociological and above all intellectual -- and the certainty that he was misunderstood .
Famously , he was a fascist .
Less famously , he was a career racist , who called blacks in America , which he visited in the 1880s , “ a people without a history , without traditions , without a brain . ”
He allied himself early with the Nazis .
He met with Adolf Hitler and shipped his 1920 Nobel Prize for Literature to Joseph Goebbels as a tribute .
He saw salvation in the Third Reich , which would finally unite , “ in kinship and blood , ” the people of Northern Europe .
Meanwhile , Hamsun was happy to ignore the means .
“ If the [ German ] government have gone so far as to set up concentration camps , ” he wrote in a letter to the organization War Resisters International , “ then you and the world have to understand it must be for good reason . ”
When the war ended , he was found guilty of crimes against Norway ; he remained , to the end , scathingly unrepentant .
He wrote one more book , “ On Overgrown Paths , ” in which he reprinted the entirety of his defense speech to a civilian court , and died in 1952 , at 92 , deaf , near - blind and dressed in rags .
What to make of such a man ?
The answer is by no means clear .
This year marks the 150th anniversary of Hamsun ’s birth , and in Norway , a yearlong national commemoration is underway .
A six - story Hamsun Center has been unveiled , along with a 7 - foot - tall statue of the man , dressed dapperly in a top hat ; the queen of Norway even appeared publicly with the remnants of the Hamsun clan .
Clemency for Hamsun has n’t come quickly .
It ’s taken decades -- and the fading memory of the post - war years -- and still , not everyone is on board .
In February , a former member of the Norwegian parliament told the New York Times that Hamsun ’s work “ is completely overshadowed by his behavior as a Hitler lackey . ”
The great strength of “ Knut Hamsun : Dreamer and Dissenter ” is Kolloen ’s willingness to tackle the Hamsun paradox .
He details , often at excruciating length , the vitriol Hamsun continually spewed and ably navigates the excuses that have been made for the disgraced Nobel Laureate .
In the end , Kolloen presents a nuanced , dynamic analysis : Hamsun had a lifelong hatred of England ; he believed in the primacy of the Germanic people ; he delighted in provocation ; and he was enchanted with the anti-intellectual spirit of Nazism , which also ran deeply through his work .
Strangely , for the first of the modern novelists , Hamsun , like Wagner , “ succeeded in arousing antipathy towards the ideals and values of modernity , as well as a yearning for a return to the earth and a natural way of life , ” Kolloen writes .
“ The dream of a golden age .
A paradise . ”
Koellen never forgives Hamsun -- for either his anger or his irrational fear .
Instead , he shows how the author ’s prejudices aligned with , and made him perfectly susceptible to , the “ Nazi ideal . ”
It ’s an intriguing explanation for a set of choices that have long seemed inexplicable , and the scholar Monika { Zcaron}agar explores it further in her superb new academic study , “ Knut Hamsun : The Dark Side of Literary Brilliance . ”
Unlike Kolloen , { Zcaron}agar takes a circuitous approach to her subject -- each chapter filters Hamsun ’s work through a different lens , from his obsession with race to his 1947 trial .
“ My study is offered as a corrective to studies that treat Hamsun ’s Nazi support as a peripheral and unimportant detail in an otherwise literary life of achievement , ” she explains .
Here , one imagines , { Zcaron}agar is pointing not to Kolloen , who does n’t shy away from Hamsun ’s most dangerous impulses , but to the type of critic who has sought to pry the accomplishments of “ Hunger ” from the moral failings of its creator .
The same impulse can be found in recent writings on Ezra Pound and Louis - Ferdinand Celine : a separation undertaken not necessarily in the name of postmodernism -- the “ reclaiming ” of the text -- but simply because it makes it easier on the reader .
Such a strategy belies the challenges of any of these writers : to see them whole , their lives and work as part of the same continuum , which makes for an uncomfortably complicated moral and aesthetic response .
In this way , “ The Dark Side of Literary Brilliance ” and “ Dreamer and Dissenter ” are daring , frightening books .
What if instead of attempting to separate Hamsun ’s politics and his art , Kolloen and { Zcaron}agar seem to be hinting , we took it for granted that the two were inextricably intertwined -- that one would never have been possible without the other ?
Where would we be then ?
Shaer writes regularly about books for the Washington Post and Bookforum , among other publications .
Officials said the new plates , dubbed Empire Bold , would help safeguard the streets , as well as the state ’s pocketbook .
“ Not every plate is worn down , but many of them are after years of usage , ” said Matt Anderson , a spokesman for the governor ’s budget office .
“ If a cop sees old plates , they know the person has n’t reregistered and also that they do n’t have new auto insurance . ”

But some officials in upstate New York , which lacks the mass transit options of New York City , say they are being forced to shoulder a disproportionate share of the state ’s money problems .
“ It was the last straw , to be honest with you , ” said Patricia Ritchie , president of the New York State Association of County Clerks and the founder of NoNewPlates.com , a Web site that she says has attracted 56,000 visitors in less than a month .
Ms. Ritchie , who administers license plates in St. Lawrence County , said upstate residents had no choice about owning cars , unlike their downstate counterparts .
“ We need cars to get to schools , doctor ’s appointments , grocery stores , ” she said .
“ There ’s no other way to get around .
A car is our livelihood . ”
The outcry has wound its way to Albany , where a state senator from Poughkeepsie , Stephen M. Saland , started his own online petition , complete with an image of a plate created by Photoshop that reads “ A FIASCO . ”
He declined to comment on Tuesday .
Last week , Gov. David A. Paterson acknowledged the anger over the issue in a radio interview , but pointed out that the state “ needed the revenues . ”
He said that , like other parts of the budget , he would be willing to entertain alternatives as long as the state made up its deficit .
These pics facinated me when I saw the for the firts time , I realized that they do n’t just look like something out of a fairy tale , but the experience on these surreal boats is nothing less than fantacy - like .
India is home to the unique houseboats called Kettuvalloms .
These boats were the historic method for transporting rice and other trade through the aqeous centre of Kerala to the ports on the coast at Kollam , Aleppey and Cochin .
Original Kettuvalloms were recreated into houseboats and are now a major tourist attraction .
A house boat is about 67 to 95 feet feet in length and has a width of around 13 feet to in the middle .
The materials that go into the making are all local and eco friendly bamboo poles , wood , coconut fiber ropes , bamboo mats , coir carpets etc .
The house boats have fully furnished single , double , triple and five bedrooms with sundeck , private balcony with comfortable chairs , kitchen and a bathroom .
Each house boat boasts a private chef , driver and cabin assistants .
While on the boat you can feast on a traditional Kerala cuisine .
While cruising you will see memorable sights such as ancient temples and ruins , oppulant rice fields , water lillies , local villages and coconut groves , A cruise along the palm - fringed waterways of Kerala in a luxury houseboat is the most enchanting holiday experience in India today .

Over the course of four years in the 1970s , artist G. C. Haymes sent approximately 500 letters to a wide - ranging selection of high profile people as part of a project entitled Skymail .
Enclosed alongside the letters were return postcards , upon which the recipients were asked to ‘ describe the sky ’ .
Below is the original letter and two of the 28 replies Haymes received , chosen due to the brilliantly contrasting tone and content of each .
They were written by authors Isaac Asimov and Jerzy Kosinski .

An inverted blue ( sometimes black ) semisphere , in which , when blue , a yellow circle is pasted , and to which , when black , some thousand of tiny sparks are affixed .
There is also a dim yellow circle more noticable against the black , but sometimes seen against the blue which changes shape and is sometimes round , sometimes crescent , and sometimes in between .
Often the semisphere is obscured by moving white or gray clouds .

Tage lang haben Wissenschaftler an der Universität Hamburg ihre Forschungsarbeiten über alltägliche Überwachungspraktiken diskutiert .
Das gastgebende Institut für Volkskunde selbst beschäftigt sich im Rahmen der " Kulturwissenschaftlichen Technikforschung " mit der Frage , ob Überwachungstechnik den Alltag sicherer macht oder ob es sich bei Überwachungstechnik um symbolische Installationen handelt , die Sicherheit demonstrieren sollen und bestenfalls im Nachhinein zur Aufklärung von Straftaten geeignet sind .
Ausgerechnet im Hamburg , wo " erfolgreich " eingesetzte Videokameras abgebaut werden sollen und entsprechend heftig über Videokameras diskutiert wird .
Auf europäischer Ebene gibt es Bestrebungen , mit Entwicklungsplänen wie dem Stockholmer Programm neue interoperable Datenverbundnetze zu installieren .
Diese nennt Eric Töpfer vom Berliner Zentrum für Technik und Gesellschaft einen " europäischen Datenwaschsalon " .
Nicht nur Datenschützer haben hier große Bedenken , sondern auch Wissenschaftler wie Töpfer .
Problematisch erscheint ihnen dabei die Tendenz , immer größere Datenbestände für den Zugriff durch alle anzulegen , mit denen national gefasste Bürgerrechte ausgehebelt würden , wie zum Beispiel die Überlegungen der EU zum neuen Visum - Auskunftssystem VIS .
Dabei landen die kompletten Fingerabdrucke aller Visa - Antragsteller in einer zentralen europäischen Datenbank .
Dabei scheint unklar , was Politiker überhaupt mit Zugewinn an Sicherheit meinen .
Das hat Inga Klein durch eine Analyse von Bundestagsprotokollen und Pressemitteilungen des Innenministeriums aus den Jahren 2001 bis 2007 herausgefunden , mit denen die Einführung der ersten beiden Generationen biometrischer Reisepässe begründet wurde .
Die Kriminologin Gaby Temme macht in ihrem Vortrag über Kriminalstatistiken darüber hinaus deutlich , wie problematisch die Zahlensammlungen sind , aus denen Lagebilder entstehen .
Ihre Kollegin Alke Glet fasste die internationale Forschung über den Einsatz von Videoüberwachung zusammen und kam zu dem Schluss : Möglicherweise kann Videoüberwachung einen Einfluss auf die Kriminalrate haben , doch können die bisherigen Untersuchungen die Effektivität von Videoüberwachungen nicht belegen .
Mit der Frage , wie der Bürger über Überwachung denkt , beschäftigen sich Christian Lüdemann und Christina Schepper vom Hamburger Institut für Sicherheits - und Präventionsforschung .
Durch Auswertung einer repräsentativen telefonischen Befragung wollen sie herausfinden , was die Bevölkerung von biometrischen Ausweispapieren , Kontendatenabrufen , Vorratsdatenspeicherung und Online - Durchsuchung hält .
Daneben werden Experten befragt und die Drucksachen der Gesetzgebungsverfahren analysiert .
Die Ergebnisse der Forscher sollen Ende 2011 vorliegen .
Doch nicht nur von staatlicher Seite oder von Unternehmen geht Überwachung aus .
Oliver Bidlo vom Bochumer Lehrstuhl für Kriminologien beschäftigte sich mit der Aktion einer deutschen Boulevardzeitung , ihre Leser als Leser - Reporter einzusetzen .
Die Meldung und Aufzeichnung von " aufregenden , peinlichen oder gefährlichen " Situationen führe zu einer neuen Form der " nachbarschaftlichen " Kontrolle .
Projekte wie Internet Eyes , bei denen man spielerisch Täter auf Überwachungsvideos finden muss oder das mittlerweile wieder eingestellte Nachbarschaftsprojekt Shoreditch zeigten Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten zum Panopticon an .
Zum wenig beachteten Aspekt der Krankheitsprävention arbeitet Peter Ulrich von der eingestellten Initiative Leipziger Kamera .
Indem Menschen aufgefordert werden , ihren Körper im Rahmen von Vorsorgeprogrammen zu kontrollieren , werden sie zu Überwachern gesellschaftlicher Normalität , die " Dicke " oder " Raucher " in einem Prozess der Entsolidarisierung aussondert .
Wissenschaftler der Uni Frankfurt kümmern sich im Rahmen einer Sozialstrukturanalyse des Frankfurter Bahnhofsviertels ebenfalls um einen kaum beachteten Aspekt privater Überwachung .
In dem Viertel , in dem die Polizei selbst auf Dauerpräsenz und nicht auf Videoüberwachung setzt , verfügen alle 25 " Laufhäuser " über eigene Videoüberwachungsanlagen .
Die Kameras sorgen dafür , dass rechtzeitig Personen zur Stelle sind , um Streitereien außerpolizeilich zu regeln .
Der Laufhausbesitzer überwacht den sauberen Gang der Geschäfte und lässt sich das von den Prostituierten gut bezahlen : Jeder Druck auf den Alarmknopf ist kostenpflichtig .

' Dishonest ' Blair and Straw accused over secret plan for multicultural UK
Jack Straw and Tony Blair ' dishonestly ' concealed a plan to allow in more immigrants and make Britain more multi-cultural because they feared a public backlash if it was made public , it has been claimed .
The allegation was made after a former Labour adviser said the Government opened up UK borders partly to humiliate Right - wing opponents of immigration .
Andrew Neather , who worked for Mr Straw when he was Home Secretary , and as a speech writer for Mr Blair , claimed a secret Government report in 2000 called for mass immigration to change Britain 's cultural make - up forever .
Jack Straw and Tony Blair ' covered up plan to let more immigrants in for political reasons '
It also emerged that :
Home Office Minister Barbara Roche , who pioneered the open - door policy , wanted to restore her Labour reputation after being attacked by Left - wingers for condemning begging by immigrants as ' vile ' .
Civil servant Jonathan Portes , who wrote the immigration report , was a speechwriter for Gordon Brown and is now a senior aide to Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell .
Labour chiefs decided to brand Tory leaders William Hague and Michael Howard as racists to deter them from criticising the covert initiative .
Mr Neather said there was a ' driving political purpose ' behind Labour 's decision to allow in hundreds of thousands of migrants to plug gaps in the labour market .
He said the stance was foreshadowed by a report by Mr Blair 's Performance and Innovation Unit ( PIU ) think - tank , which said the nation would benefit from more migrants .
Mr Neather claimed that earlier , unpublished versions of the report made clear that one aim was to make Britain more multi-cultural for political reasons .
' I remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended - even if this was n't its main purpose - to rub the Right 's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date , ' he said .
The report , entitled Research , Development And Statistics Occasional Paper No67 - Migration : An Economic And Social Analysis , was published in January 2001 by the Home Office , then run by Mr Straw .
Most of its key statistics came from a PIU team led by Mr Portes .
The report paints a rosy picture of mass immigration , stating : ' There is little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration .
The broader fiscal impact is likely to be positive because a greater proportion of migrants are of working age and migrants have higher average wages than natives . '
It goes on : ' Most British regard immigration as having a positive effect on British culture . '
Mr Portes remains an enthusiastic advocate of the benefits of immigration .
He wrote a report for the Department of Work and Pensions last year rejecting claims that Eastern European workers had stolen the jobs of British counterparts , arguing Britons lacked the skills and motivation .
A former Government adviser told The Mail on Sunday : ' If the Government had been prepared to have an open debate about immigration , we would not have had the problems we have seen with the BNP .
But it did not want immigration policy discussed .
' It is not a very honest Government .
They knew immigration was a hot issue and they did not want to get into a fight on it . '
The source said Labour deliberately targeted William Hague and Michael Howard when they called for tougher immigration controls .
Mr Hague was accused of ' playing the race card ' in 2001 when he said Mr Blair was turning Britain into a ' foreign land ' .
Michael Howard was called a ' racist ' in 2004 after he went to BNP stronghold Burnley , in Lancashire , to denounce Labour 's stance on asylum seekers .
A Labour insider suggested Mrs Roche relaxed immigration controls partly in response to the outcry she faced after criticising begging Romanian mothers .
' She was called a scumbag , ' said the source .
' She wanted to show she was a genuine liberal . '
Well , whaddya know .

The US threatened to derail a deal on global climate change today in a public showdown with China by expressing deep opposition to the existing Kyoto protocol .
The US team also urged other rich countries to join it in setting up a new legal agreement which would , unlike Kyoto , force all countries to reduce emissions .
In a further development , the EU sided strongly with the US in seeking a new agreement , but said that it hoped the best elements of Kyoto could be kept .
China and many developing countries immediately hit back stating that the protocol , the world 's only legally binding commitment to get countries to reduce emissions , was " not negotiable " .
With only a few days of formal UN negotiations remaining before the crunch Copenhagen meeting in December , and the world 's two largest emitters refusing to give ground , a third way may now have to be found to secure a climate change agreement .
Last night it emerged that lawyers for the EU are in talks with the US delegation urgently seeking a way out of the impasse that now threatens a strong climate deal .
In a day of high international rhetoric , chief US negotiator Jonathan Pershing said the US had moved significantly in the last year .
" There has been a startling change in the US position .
There is now engagement .
We have had a 10 - fold increase finance from the US .
We have put $ 80 bn into a green economic stimulus package .
One year ago there was no commitment to a global agreement . "
But he forcefully outlined America 's opposition to the Kyoto protocol .
" We are not going to be in the Kyoto protocol .
We are not going to be part of an agreement that we cannot meet .
We say a new agreement has to [ be signed ] by all countries .
Things have changed since Kyoto .
Where countries were in 1990 and today is very different .
We can not be stuck with an agreement 20 years old .
We want action from all countries . "
Yu Qingtai , China 's special representative on climate talks , said rich countries should not desert the Kyoto agreement , which all industrialised countries except the US signed up to and was ratified in 2002 after many years of negotiations .
It contains no requirement for developing countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions , as both their current and historical emissions are low in most cases .
However , China , with its surging economy and rapidly expanding population is now the world 's biggest polluter .
" The Kyoto protocol is not negotiable .
We want [ it ] to be strengthened .
We do n't want to kill Kyoto .
We really want a revival , a strengthening of the treaty .
That can only be done by Annex I [ industrialised ] countries having a target of 40 % cuts by 2020 , " said Yu .
" We have an agreement .
If you take that away [ you remove ] the basis of negotiations .
There are specific provisions for parties [ like the US ] who are not signed up to the Kyoto protocol . "
China was backed strongly by the G77 group of 130 countries and the Alliance of Small Island States ( Aosis ) , made up of Caribbean and Pacific countries which expect to be made uninhabitable in the next few generations if a strong climate agreement is not secured .
" We face an emergency .
We want commitments .
We did not create the problem .
Any mechanism currently in use is one we want to maintain .
National actions are important but they are no substitutes for an international framework , " said Dessima Williams , a Grenadian spokeswoman for Aosis .
The EU , today sided openly with the US for the first time .
" We look at the Kyoto protocol , but since it came into force we have seen emissions increase .
It has not decreased emissions .
It 's not enough and we need more , " said spokesman Karl Falkenberg .
" We are very unlikely to see the US join Kyoto , but we are working with the US to find a legal framework to allow the US to participate and which will allow large emitters [ such as China ] to participate . "
The difference between the sides is now considered to threaten the success of the talks .
In essence , the US is insisting on a completely new agreement , with all countries signed up and all countries free to choose and set their own targets and timetable .
Most other countries want to keep the existing agreement as a basis for negotiations , to ensure that rich countries are held by international law to agreed cuts .
China in particular wants cuts calculated on a per capita basis .
Diplomats last night suggested that the only way out could be for the US to be asked to sign a separate agreement acceptable to developing countries , which would see it cutting emissions at a comparable speed to other countries .
The G77 countries are meeting to consider their oppositions .
One diplomat said : " They are very angry .
People have talked of walking out . "
However , lawyers said it would be difficult to terminate the Kyoto protocol because all parties have to formally agree by consensus to end it .
In addition , if no further commitment periods after 2012 are established for rich countries , it would be a breach of their own legal agreements .

Laptops : Comparing Apples to Apples
Anyone looking to go out and purchase a new laptop is almost certainly interested in a couple things : how much does it cost , and what sort of battery life can you expect ?
Answering those questions for any specific laptop is simple enough , provided we can get a sample unit for testing .
However , it becomes more difficult to answer these questions when you 're looking at the big picture -- i.e. AMD vs. Intel laptops .
The pricing question is easier : laptops using AMD platforms are ( usually ) cheaper than equivalent Intel platform laptops .
That 's simple enough : you 're paying more for the Intel brand .
But what about battery life ?
We have long tried to answer that question , but the best we could do up until this point was to compare " similar " laptops .
Getting the same LCD , hard drive , optical drive , and most importantly battery has been very difficult -- so difficult that we have not been able to do it .
A few manufacturers offer competing AMD and Intel laptops with very similar specifications , but no one seemed willing to send their AMD - based system .
Were they afraid of cannibalizing sales of their more expensive laptops ?
Did they just think that an AMD - based laptop would n't stand up well in our testing ?
We do n't know for sure , but what we do know is that Gateway has stepped up to the plate and sent us two all but identical laptops .
We 've been busy the past week or two putting the laptops through our test regimen , and we will have the full review shortly .
In the meantime , we thought you might be particularly interested in the battery life you can expect .
Here 's a quick look at the two laptops .
On top is the AMD - based Gateway NV52 , and below it is the Intel - based Gateway NV58 .
Here 's a second look , focusing on the keyboards .
Once again , AMD is above and Intel is below .
The chassis are identical from the outside , and everything else is the same as well other than the motherboard , chipset , and processor .
Both come with 4GB DDR2 memory , a 15.6 " 1366x768 LED backlit LCD , 320 GB 5400 RPM hard drive , and a DVDRW .
Both also include Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n WiFi ( Intel WiFi Link 5100 for the NV58 and Atheros AR928X for the NV52 ) .
In fact , even the CPUs have the same 2.1 GHz clock speed -- not that CPU clock speed matters -- as well as 35 W TDP ratings -- not that that matters either , as we 'll soon see .
On the AMD side , we have the QL - 64 ( 65 nm , 2.1GHz , 2x512K L2 , 3600MHz HyperTransport bus ) , and on the Intel laptop we have the T6500 ( 45nm , 2.1GHz , 2MB shared L2 , 800MHz FSB ) .
We should also mention that the NV58 costs more than the NV52 , $ 500 for the NV52 and $ 580 for the NV58 .
What does the extra $ 80 buy you ?
We will have performance numbers in our upcoming full review , but considering this is a match between AMD 's old dual - core Athlon 64 X2 ( K8 architecture ) and Intel 's Core 2 Duo , you can probably already guess the results .
Intel is quite a bit faster in all of the CPU benchmarks .
On the other hand , the AMD platform comes with much better integrated graphics , so if you would like to do a bit of 3D gaming on occasion ( at low to medium detail levels ) AMD easily wins the graphics benchmarks .
Now let 's look at battery life .
On today 's episode of the Search Engine podcast , Jesse Brown talks to Konrad von Finckenstein , Canada 's chief telecoms regulator — the man who brought down the recent ruling allowing Canadian ISPs to throttle their users .
In the interview , Commissioner von Finckenstein arrogantly dismisses Canadians who are threatened by this ruling as " Internet hogs " and pretends that he has n't heard any of the research that shows Canada is badly lagging the rest of the developed world in Internet access , paying far more to get far less than others , despite the enormous public subsidy Canada 's ISPs have received in the form of exclusive rights - of - way and access to taxpayer - built infrastructure .
He also purports to know nothing of the existing abusive policies used by Canada 's big ISPs .
If this is the man running Canada 's Internet policy , it 's no wonder that Canada 's net is in such sorry shape .

FACEBOOK FACELIFT - HOME , PROFILES & PUBLISHERSEPTEMBER
2009
The Facebook Facelift is a self initiated project to challenge the form and functionality of Facebook .
It 's streamlined , structured and linear interface is more comprehendible , enhancing the user experience and absorbability of content .
The home page features many new benefits : the publisher toolbar enables users to post content from any page within facebook , saving time in navigating needlessly through profiles ; the streams ' two - tiered filter ( content type & content contributers ) also creates a more coherent structure with the core elements retaining their position throughout most of the site ; and the live feed displays a constant stream of all content posted in a users network , which expands upon mouse over .
Profiles also integrate with the system more seamlessly .
Just as friend lists filter the stream by a select number of people , user profiles simply filter content to a single person , creating a clearer and more comprehendible layout .
The Facebook Publisher subsite is designed to support the growing use of Facebook as a primary form of contact as email once was .
The separate address , publisher .
facebook.com , would be permitted in businesses where Facebook is banned , allowing users to send messages without the distractions of user generated content .
The interface is a mirror of the publisher toolbar ensuring a consistent interface .
SkimmerI openly accept that components of this were inspired by the beautiful Skimmer but I think there is more than enough individuality in this project to not call it a copy .
I 've never understood making things different just for the sake of it , it is a method of progression .
From using Skimmer I found that the feed layout and expanded view were useful , and tried to improve these aspects through further simplification and clarity .
Advertising
As this is a concept , I intentionally omitted banner advertising .
However the layout has been designed to accommodate ads to the right , user content would simply scale to make space .
It 's no different to a concept car leaving out , say ... the engine .- - - View all images on Flickr .

Here ’s what Ken Kesey had to say about Wendell Berry :
“ Wendell Berry is the Sargeant York charging unnatural odds across our no - man ’s - land of ecology .
Conveying the same limber innocence of young Gary Cooper , Wendell advances on the current crop of Krauts armed with naught but his pen and his mythic ridgerunner righteousness .
One after the other he picks them off , from the flying bridges of their pleasure boats as they roar through his native Kentucky rivers , from beneath the hard hats in the Hazard county strip mines , from the swivel chairs in the Pentagon where they weigh the various ways to wage war on all forms of enemy life beyond the end of their own friendly chin .
He ’s a crackshot essayist and , for those given to capture , a genial and captivating poet .
He boasts a formidable arsenal of novels , speeches , articles , stories and poems from his outpost in one of the world ’s most ravaged battlefields where he writes the good fight and tends his family and his honeybees .
Consider him an ally . ”
The thing is , Kesey said this in 1971 .
That was nearly forty years ago .
And I realized , after reading another Berry essay collection a couple of weeks ago ( in this case , The Way of Ignorance and Other Essays ) , that Berry has been pounding away at the same themes for at least that long .
And nothing that he has expressed concerns , not to mention deep dismay , about — the increasing power of agribusiness , our increased disconnection from the land , the abandonment of local economies and communities , our collective disregard of the concept of stewardship — has gotten better .
In fact , one could argue that everything of concern to Berry has gotten worse .
And this is tragic , because current trends , particularly in agriculture , but also in the relentless suburbanization of American life , where no one actually really knows how to do anything , are probably unsustainable .
The result will be , well , who knows what , but it might not be pleasant .
And who will have the kind of wisdom and local knowledge that is central to Berry ’s worldview then ?
Berry is fond of throwing out nuggets like the following :
Nobody has a right to destroy anything , and everybody has an obligation to defend as much as he or she possibly can .
But sooner or later you ’ll have to choose .
You ca n’t defend everything , even though everybody has an obligation to be as aware as possible , and as effective as possible , in preserving the things that need to be preserved everywhere .
But I ’ve argued over and over again that the fullest responsibility has to be exercised at home , where you have some chance to come to a competent and just understanding of what ’s involved , and where you have some chance of being really effective .
And :
Rome destroyed itself by undervaluing the country people , too .
And :
My approach to education would be like my approach to everything else .
I ’d change the standard .
I would make the standard that of community health rather than the career of the student .
You see , if you make the standard the health of the community , that would change everything .
Once you begin to ask what would be the best thing for our community , what ’s the best thing that we can do here for our community , you ca n’t rule out any kind of knowledge .
You need to know everything you possibly can know .
So , once you raise that standard of the health of the community , all the departmental walls fall down , because you can no longer feel that it ’s safe not to know something .
And then you begin to see that these supposedly discreet and separate disciplines , these “ specializations , ” are n’t separate at all , but are connected .
And of course our mistakes , over and over again , show us what the connections are , or show us that connections exist .
And :
There is no time in history , since white occupation began in America , that any sane and thoughtful person would want to go back to , because that history so far has been unsatisfactory .
It has been unsatisfactory for the simple reason that we have n’t produced stable communities well adapted to their places .
What I ’m talking about in my work is the hope that it might be possible to produce stable , locally adapted communities in America , even though we have n’t done it .
The idea of a healthy community is an indispensable measure , just as the idea of a healthy child , if you ’re a parent , is an indispensable measure .
You ca n’t operate without it .
Berry is the philosopher of the local and what , specifically , being local entails .
America has inflicted a number of wounds on itself the past several decades in the name of “ free markets , ” still clinging to the myth that there is actually such a thing .
Berry is n’t much of a fan of these , actually .
What he is a fan of is the dignity of work ( remember that ? ) , and the notion that we should take care of ourselves , particularly how we care for the land that supports us .
And that we should have local knowledge–about the land , of course , but also about how to do the things we need to do to occupy the land–how to maintain and sustain it in particular .
Well , at a time when externalities are catching up with us rapidly in any number of areas ( global warming being the most obvious ) , we really need to pay more attention to what Berry is saying .
And that means a return to the local .
Berry has a number of mantras — the most recent is “ Eat responsibly . ”
And by this means not just know what your food is , and whether it ’s good for you or not — but where it comes from , how it was produced , under what conditions , and subsidized by whom ?
Sounds easy , but in modern America , and increasingly here in the UK , this is getting harder and harder to do .
I ’ve been reading Berry for decades now , and his place in modern American thought is still a bit of a mystery .
He ’s written one of the best American novels of the century ( A Place on Earth ) and a number of volumes of pretty good poetry ( particularly Farming : A Hand Book ) .
He honed his craft at the Creative Writing Program at Stanford University , where he hung out with Kesey , Robert Stone , and Larry McMurtry .
Most importantly , he has produced a series of essays over the years that stand as a testament to sound judgment .
In many ways , conservative judgment as well — because Berry wants to conserve things .
This has led to many fun and enlightening exchanges within the conservative and libertarian blogging community .
When did Berry , the arch - Luddite opponent of modern agribusiness , militarism and word processors , become a crunchy - conservative icon ?
Pretty recently , judging by some of the commentary I see occasionally on blogs like the ones cited above .
And hardly a week goes by over at Front Porch Republic that someone does n’t make a specific reference to Berry .
I think this is great .
And where are the liberals on Berry ?
Generally , not to be found , which is a pity .
Have liberals become so entwined on the wrong side of the globalization debate that they ’ve lost all perspective ?
I ’m way over - generalizing here , of course , but still , I seldom see anyone on the Democratic side speaking up for localism .
Instead , we get Larry Summers and Bob Rubin , and Obama , for all his many virtues , still behaving like a farm state senator .
But if liberals really want to pursue a more just society , the place to do it as at the local level .
The far right understands this better than the left — hence the attacks on ACORN , which is essentially local political action .
Look , you want better schools ?
Run for the school board .
You want better food ?
Get on the planning board and make sure that the last local farmland is n’t being ploughed under for yet another housing development .
You want better communities ?
Run for the city council , or whatever it is you ’ve got .
That Think Globally , Act Locally bumper sticker that we seldom see any more had it about right .
As Bill Kauffman has noted , “ Among the tragedies of contemporary politics is that Wendell Berry , as a man of place , has no place in a national political discussion that is framed by Gannett and Clear Channel . ”
This may be changing .
For one thing , Berry is still writing , and more and more people keep reading .
I do n’t think there ’s a single book in his back catalogue that has ever gone out of print — pretty impressive for a writing career than spans over four decades .
For another , Berry , bless his heart , just wo n’t shut up .
Here ’s Berry and long time co-author Wes Jackson in The New York Times earlier this year :
Agriculture has too often involved an insupportable abuse and waste of soil , ever since the first farmers took away the soil - saving cover and roots of perennial plants .
Civilizations have destroyed themselves by destroying their farmland .
This irremediable loss , never enough noticed , has been made worse by the huge monocultures and continuous soil - exposure of the agriculture we now practice .
To the problem of soil loss , the industrialization of agriculture has added pollution by toxic chemicals , now universally present in our farmlands and streams .
Some of this toxicity is associated with the widely acclaimed method of minimum tillage .
We should not poison our soils to save them .
Industrial agricultural has made our food supply entirely dependent on fossil fuels and , by substituting technological “ solutions ” for human work and care , has virtually destroyed the cultures of husbandry ( imperfect as they may have been ) once indigenous to family farms and farming neighborhoods .
Clearly , our present ways of agriculture are not sustainable , and so our food supply is not sustainable .
We must restore ecological health to our agricultural landscapes , as well as economic and cultural stability to our rural communities .
For 50 or 60 years , we have let ourselves believe that as long as we have money we will have food .
That is a mistake .
If we continue our offenses against the land and the labor by which we are fed , the food supply will decline , and we will have a problem far more complex than the failure of our paper economy .
The government will bring forth no food by providing hundreds of billions of dollars to the agribusiness corporations .
And then the kicker — we do n’t get a bunch of starry - eyed idealism , but a bunch of necessary , practical and achievable measures to take to redress these problems :
Any restorations will require , above all else , a substantial increase in the acreages of perennial plants .
The most immediately practicable way of doing this is to go back to crop rotations that include hay , pasture and grazing animals .
But a more radical response is necessary if we are to keep eating and preserve our land at the same time .
In fact , research in Canada , Australia , China and the United States over the last 30 years suggests that perennialization of the major grain crops like wheat , rice , sorghum and sunflowers can be developed in the foreseeable future .
By increasing the use of mixtures of grain - bearing perennials , we can better protect the soil and substantially reduce greenhouse gases , fossil - fuel use and toxic pollution .
Carbon sequestration would increase , and the husbandry of water and soil nutrients would become much more efficient .
And with an increase in the use of perennial plants and grazing animals would come more employment opportunities in agriculture — provided , of course , that farmers would be paid justly for their work and their goods .
Thoughtful farmers and consumers everywhere are already making many necessary changes in the production and marketing of food .
But we also need a national agricultural policy that is based upon ecological principles .
We need a 50 - year farm bill that addresses forthrightly the problems of soil loss and degradation , toxic pollution , fossil - fuel dependency and the destruction of rural communities .
No wonder most Reagan conservatives can’t stand the guy .
A 50 - year farm bill ?
But that may be how long it takes to re-capture the kind of localism that will provide us with a sustainable agricultural system .
But Russell Kirk would probably take a look around at the mess we ’ve made , and agree .
Did I mention Berry is a poet as well ?
The Mad Farmer poems in particular are worth a look .
Let ’s close with “ The Farmer and the Sea ” ( initially published in Farming : A Hand Book ) :
The sea always arriving ,
hissing in pebbles , is breaking
its edge where the landsman
squats on his rock .
The dark
of the earth is familiar to him ,
close mystery of his source
and end , always flowering
in the light and always
fading .
But the dark of the sea
is perfect and strange , the absence of any place , immensity on the loose .
Still , he sees it as another
keeper of he land , caretaker
shaking the earth , breaking it , clicking the pieces , but somewhere
holding deep fields yet to rise ,
shedding its richness on them
silently as snow , keeper and maker
of places wholly dark .
And in him
Something dark applauds .
To learn more , this is a pretty good place to start .
Ockham 's Razor and its Improper Use
Authors : Dieter Gernert
" Ockham 's razor " is a methodical principle , due to the medieval philosopher William of Ockham , who mainly opposed an unjustified creation of new terms in philosophy .
Since this principle and its later versions are frequently quoted in discussions about anomalies , it will be studied here in some detail .
After a short look on the historical roots , the principal modern formulations are summarized .
It will be shown that a demand for " simplicity " cannot be generally maintained .
Rather , striving for simplicity can conflict with other essentials of scientific method .
Ockham 's principle - no matter whether in its original or in a modified version - cannot be helpful in a rational decision between competing explanations for the same empirical facts .
An incorrect use of Ockham 's razor only leads to a perpetuation and corroboration of existing prejudice , and this principle should not be used to easily get rid of unwelcome data or concepts .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama 's decision on the future of the eight - year - old war , a defense official said Tuesday .
Obama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday .
A Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president 's decision .
But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving , the official said .
Obama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban , the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001 .
The president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent , ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested .
McChrystal was among those who took part in Monday 's conference with Obama and other top advisers , which broke up at 10 p.m .
Vice President Joe Biden , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry , the U.S. ambassador in Kabul , were among the other senior officials in the meeting .
Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been " comprehensive and extremely useful . "
" It 's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there , you 've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts , " he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
The military has planning under way to send these units : three U.S. Army brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 ; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops , according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations .
CNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon .
The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces , where much of the recent fighting has taken place .
Currently , brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy .
About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan , along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance .
Two U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted .
The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance 's headquarters in Brussels , Belgium .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers , but he said NATO would be asked for additional help .
" Clearly , if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan , there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces , " Morrell said .
U.S. - led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network 's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington .
The invasion overthrew the Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory , but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught .
Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan , battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other .
Al Qaeda 's top leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region .
The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan .
Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision , with 49 percent opposed .
The poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly , up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March .
Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent , with 52 percent opposed .
i Reporters sound off ; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan
Afghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday .
Singh said the international community needs " to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan , to help it emerge as a modern state . "
" The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated , " he said .
" President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism . "
India is one Afghanistan 's biggest international donors , contributing $ 1.2 billion in aid .
That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan , India 's nuclear rival in South Asia .
But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support .
In addition , several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades - old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders , giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier .
" I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week , " Nicholas Burns , a former State Department official , said on CNN's " American Morning . "
U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly " on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups . "
" The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India , but we can quietly , behind the scenes , push them to reduce their problems , " Burns said .
CNN 's Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report .

New signs at a Mormon church - owned plaza in downtown Salt Lake City put visitors on notice :
Anyone can be asked to leave for any reason .
The change follows a much - publicized incident this summer in which two men were cited with trespassing on the plaza after sharing a kiss .
City prosecutors did not pursue the charges , saying signs at the plaza failed to adequately warn the couple they were entering private property .
FAITH & REASON : When is a kiss not just a kiss ?
When it 's a gay protest Church spokesman Scott Trotter says the new signs include extra text at the suggestion of the Salt Lake City prosecutor 's office .
They now say the church reserves the right to refuse access to anyone .
City prosecutor Sim Gill says the new signs provide clarity .
He says with the new signs in place , visitors who refuse to leave could be prosecuted for trespassing .

Los Angeles ’ ban on new medical marijuana dispensaries is invalid , a Superior Court judge said Monday in a decision that undermines the city ’s 4 - month - old drive to shut down hundreds of the stores .
The judge issued an injunction banning enforcement of the moratorium against Green Oasis , a dispensary in Playa Vista that had challenged the ban .
But city officials acknowledged the ruling would effectively block current efforts to enforce the ban against other dispensaries .
The decision came on the day the Obama administration issued guidelines that limit federal prosecution of medical marijuana users and dispensaries .
A Justice Department memo makes official a policy change that the president adopted earlier this year -- one that inadvertently contributed to the city ’s dizzying dispensary boom .
Those actions cheered supporters of medical marijuana , but Los Angeles officials insisted they were committed to closing down and prosecuting dispensaries .
The city attorney and the district attorney maintain that most are selling marijuana for profit in violation of state law .
Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley did not back off that position Monday .
“ A collaboration of numerous agencies , including federal , state and local police agencies , county and city prosecutors , will combat the proliferation of illegal medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles City and County , ” he said .
Several City Council members said the ruling will force them to take quick action to pass an ordinance that could lead to law enforcement raids to close dispensaries that opened after the moratorium was adopted in August 2007 .
“ Anyone who does n’t comply is going to be taken down , ” warned Councilman Dennis Zine , who initiated the council ’s consideration of dispensaries more than four years ago .
“ Once we take a few down and some publicity comes about , those who are in it for the cash business will say it ’s too hot , let ’s get out of it . ”
David Berger , a special assistant to City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich , said a new draft of the ordinance would be submitted to the council today .
Berger also acknowledged the moratorium had been extended improperly and said the city would not appeal .
At Monday ’s hearing , Judge James C. Chalfant said he had hoped to learn that the council had adopted a permanent ordinance .
“ I thought you would come in and tell me this was all moot , ” he said .
“ This is the city of Los Angeles , ” replied Assistant City Atty .
Jeri Burge .
“ Sometimes it goes slowly . ”
City Councilman Greig Smith , who heads the Public Safety Committee , said he may send the proposed ordinance to the full council for emergency consideration so it could be approved immediately .
The measure has been debated for more than two years in the planning committee and was recently sent to Smith ’s panel .
Chalfant ’s decision dismayed community activists , who have pleaded with the council to crack down on dispensaries that have opened up throughout the city but are heavily concentrated in some neighborhoods .
“ It looks like not only will the ones that are open continue to operate , but there will be more that open also , and the whole business will start expanding exponentially , I think , knowing that L.A. city is completely inept at handling control on these , ” said Michael Larsen , the public safety director for the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council .
In his decision , Chalfant concluded that the city had failed to follow state requirements when it extended its initial moratorium .
“ The city can not rely on an expired ordinance , ” he said .
Burge warned , “ You ’re going to open the floodgates . ”
In a court filing , the city said an injunction would cause “ grave irreparable harm . ”
“ This lawsuit is not just about one ‘ bad apple . ’
It is about illegally dealing marijuana , ” the city argued .
“ Hundreds of unlawful marijuana stores have cropped up throughout the city and will likely attempt to bootstrap their illegal operation on the outcome of this action . ”
Chalfant dismissed that claim , saying the city had other means to shut down dispensaries .
“ That ’s so clearly in your hands , ” he said , noting that some cities have adopted outright bans .
Robert A. Kahn , Green Oasis ’ attorney , said the city was trying to punish dispensaries for a situation that arose from the council ’s own failures .
“ They clearly blew it , they blew the way they are supposed to be handling these ordinances , ” he said .
“ The Compassionate Use Act was passed in 1996 .
What have they been doing for the last 13 years ? ”
The council started to look at the issue in 2005 , when Zine asked the Police Department for a report on dispensaries .
The moratorium took effect Sept. 14 , 2007 , and allowed 186 dispensaries to remain in business .
The City Council extended the moratorium to last for two years .
It adopted a second moratorium to last through mid-March .
In court Monday , the city argued that the council did not need to comply with a state law that requires certain steps to extend a zoning moratorium .
Burge argued that it was a public safety , rather than a zoning , moratorium .
Zoning moratoriums cannot be extended beyond 24 months .
Chalfant quickly dispensed with that theory .
“ Although there may be overtones of public safety , ” he said , “ this is a zoning issue . ”
Besides failing to adhere to state law when it extended the ban , the city also failed to enforce it .
Hundreds of dispensaries filed applications for hardship exemptions from the moratorium , and many opened without permission .
The City Council began to deny those requests this summer , which allowed city officials to file civil or criminal charges .
None have been filed , however , and Berger said the city attorney ’s office now will not file charges until there is a permanent ordinance .
Green Oasis , which is on Jefferson Boulevard just west of the 405 Freeway , sought a hardship exemption in April and opened in May , without waiting for the City Council to act on the request .
In July , the City Council denied the exemption .
The city attorney ’s office notified Green Oasis that its operators faced civil and criminal violations , including a $ 1,000 fine and six months in jail .
The dispensary sued last month .
Dan Lutz , a co-owner of Green Oasis , said he was relieved by the decision but wished he was not in an adversarial stance with the city .
“ A lot of the collectives out there are wanting to do a good job and provide a valuable service for the community , and we ’re actually surprised that we ’re in this position in L.A. , ” he said .
Lutz ’s dispensary was in the city ’s sights even before he filed suit .
An undercover narcotics officer visited at least twice , according to a declaration Officer Brent Olsen filed with the court .
On Sept. 2 , he said he handed over his identification and doctor ’s recommendation and filled out a form .
Buzzed into an interior room , he said he was told there were 60 strains available .
He paid $ 58 for one - eighth of an ounce of marijuana .
On Sept. 10 , he paid $ 55 for another eighth .
“ It is my opinion that the dispensary is being used to sell marijuana , ” Olsen said in the declaration .
He noted that he had not participated as a member of a collective or in any collective cultivation .
Lutz could also be in jeopardy on other grounds .
The city attorney ’s office says the dispensary failed to obtain a building permit or a certificate of occupancy .
“ They could come after us for many things , ” Lutz said .
“ What can we do ? ”

A 21 - year - old Australian man has admitted creating what is thought to be the first virus to infect Apple iPhones .
The virus , which can spread from phone to phone , changes the iPhone 's wallpaper to a photograph of 1980s singer Rick Astley - best known for his hit Never Gonna Give You Up .
The wallpaper features the words " Ikee is never gonna give you up " .
However , the virus can only infect phones which have been jailbroken by their owners .
Jailbreaking allows the owners to run non-Apple approved applications on their phones .
Ashley Towns , a 21 - year - old TAFE student who lives with his family in Wollongong , south of Sydney , told ABC News Online he created the virus to raise the issue of security .
" When people jailbreak their phone , it allows them to install a service on their phone called SSH , " he said .
" Generally you should always change your password after setting up on the iPhone as all iPhones use the same password .
" This virus pretty much exploits people 's laziness to change their password . "
He says his efforts prove that anyone could easily hack into an iPhone .
" I think to raise awareness for one , somebody with more malicious intent could have done anything - read your SMSs , go through your emails , view your contacts , photos - anything , " he said .
Mr Towns says he is unaware if he is breaking any law by starting the virus .
" I 've been informed that I may have broken some , but not being a lawyer I do not know , " he said .
" The virus itself is not malicious and is not out to hurt people .
It 's just poking fun and hoping waking people up a little . "
He says it is the first virus of its kind .
" Yes , especially the first that spreads from phone to phone , " he said .
Mr Towns says he does not know how many people the virus could affect .
" Due to the nature of it , it 's kind of hard to tell , I know my phone hit about 100 alone but from there I have no idea , " he said .
But he says apart from changing the wallpaper on a user 's phone , the virus is not harmful and quite easy to get rid of .
" [ It does ] nothing malicious at all , it basically only changes their wallpaper to Rick Astley , " he said .
He says it takes a couple of minutes to remove by simply changing the phone 's password and deleting a few files from the phone .
Mr Towns says he can prove that he created the virus by postings on Twitter made by him under the same name that was in the source code .
He says the original source code also had his email in it , but Google code removed it .

Extreme weather is straining poorer countries ' finances , the bank says
Climate change will be a serious barrier to growth in poorer nations and must be curbed , says the World Bank .
The bank 's World Development Report ( WDR ) urges a rapid scaling - up of spending on clean energy research and protection for poorer countries .
Even a warming of 2C ( 3.6 F ) - the G8's target - could reduce GDP in poor nations , the report concludes .
The bank urges governments to conclude an " equitable deal " at December 's UN climate summit in Copenhagen .
That " equitable deal " should involve industrialised countries paying for the damage that their historical emissions have caused and will cause in poorer parts of the world , it suggests .
Development will get harder , not easier , with climate change
World Development Report 2010 : Development and Climate Change Kyoto's ' do or die ' summit
" Developing countries are disproportionately affected by climate change - a crisis that is not of their making and for which they are the least prepared , " said World Bank president Robert Zoellick .
" For that reason , an equitable deal in Copenhagen is vitally important . "
Part of that deal , the report says , involves industrialised countries making rapid cuts in their greenhouse gas output , creating " emissions space " to allow for rising fossil fuel use in poorer societies .
Developing problem
The acceptance of " historical responsibility " found resonance among organisations that campaign for the relief of developing world poverty .
" A broad coalition from Bolivian President Evo Morales to the World Bank is united in saying that past emissions matter , and that rich countries have to confront this rather than avoid it , " noted Tom Sherman , head of climate change with the charity ActionAid .
Water scarcity is a projected climate impact in many parts of the world
The report concludes that policy " cannot be framed as a choice between growth and climate change " .
In fact , it says , " climate - smart policies are those that enhance development , reduce vulnerability and finance the transition to low - carbon economic growth " .
The bank notes that some developing countries ' outlay on coping with weather emergencies is already rising .
Poor countries in Africa and Asia could see their GDP fall by about 5 % under a global warming of 2C - the target adopted by the G8 and a number of important developing countries during their summit in Italy in July .
" Grappling with climate shocks that are already hampering development will not be easy , " said Rosina Bierbaum , co-director of the WDR and dean of the University of Michigan 's School of Natural Resources and Environment .
" But promising new energy technologies can vastly reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and prevent catastrophic climate change . "
Cash costs
The full financing package that the bank believes is likely to be needed annually by 2030 includes : $ 75 bn to help poorer nations adapt to , or protect themselves against , climate impacts
$ 400bn for mitigation - reducing emissions - in the developing world
hundreds of billions for energy research and development
And the vast majority , it concludes , must come from nations that have already industrialised through intensive fossil fuel use .
The bank 's explicit conclusions - that climate change has to be curbed to aid development , and that richer countries have to pay - will harden the case that developing countries are making for more cash in the lead up to Copenhagen .
It parts company with some observers who argue that climate change should only be addressed once societies have become rich enough to solve it painlessly : " Development will get harder , not easier , with climate change " .

Most people play Quake with a computer mouse , but researchers in David Tank ’s lab at Princeton have done it with a living mouse , AND they are recording the intracellular activity of individual neurons of the mouse during the gaming session .
As reported in Intracellular dynamics of hippocampal place cells during virtual navigation , the virtual reality environment of the video game was sufficiently realistic to generate place cell activity in the mouse ’s hippocampus .
Place cells modulate their activity dependent on the location the mouse is at .
They have mostly been identified with extracellular recordings in freely moving mice .
Extracellular recording only permits the detection of the rates of action potential firing , rather then the subtle intracellular voltage changes that could help explain the mechanism of place cell activity generation .
A few pioneers , such as Albert “ my greatest strength is a tremendous capacity for boredom ” Lee , have recorded intracellularly in freely moving animals , but these experiments are fiendishly difficult , as the motion of the animal ’s head tends to break the seal on the recorded neuron .
Only a few cells have been recorded in that manner for more than a few minutes , though the success rate has been improving recently .
In Chris Harvey ’s technique , they fix the head of the mouse to a bar and let the mouse walk on a floating ball , while a virtual reality screen is projected in the mouse ’s field of view .
The motion of the ball controls the motion on the screen .
The head never moves , so intracellular recordings can be made relatively easily and held for long periods of time .
The authors find three characteristics of place cell activity that could explain their generation and function .
“ An asymmetric ramp - like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential , an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations , and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm . ”
These could be used to explain how place cells remap their selectivity when a mouse ( or a human ) moves into a new environment .
This also could be used to do more in depth studies of the mental replay of place locations that has been previously recorded in the activity patterns of the hippocampus .
The technique itself is about as sexy as neuroscience gets .
Unfortunately , this paper also provides an additional piece of evidence for Karel to use in motivating lab post - docs , “ Look at Chris , he left the lab after you got here and already has a Nature article … ” ‘

Pope Benedict XVI opened a special meeting of clerics about Africa today by praising the continent as a font of spirituality but lamenting that it is afflicted by materialism and religious fundamentalism .
A Congolese choir , with bongo drums , electric guitars and swaying , ululating singers , filled St Peter 's Basilica with African hymns as the pope formally opened the synod , a three - week gathering of some 300 prelates to discuss the church 's problems in Africa .
Benedict praised Africa 's rich cultural and spiritual treasures , saying they were the " spiritual lung " for a world increasingly in a crisis of faith and hope .
But he said Africa had also been afflicted by materialism – the " toxic spiritual garbage " exported by developed countries .
" In this sense , colonialism – while finished in the political sphere – has n't really ended , " he said , adding that as a result Africa was also at risk of another " virus " : religious fundamentalism .
Groups claiming to be from religious backgrounds are spreading across the continent .
" They are doing so in the name of God , but with a logic that is opposed to divine logic : teaching and working not with love and respect for freedom , but with intolerance and violence , " he said .
He urged the Catholic Church in Africa to be a voice of reconciliation , justice and peace among the continent 's various ethnic and religious groups .
The church is growing enormously in Africa ; between 1978 and 2007 , the number of Catholics nearly trebled , from 55 million to 146 million .
Vatican statistics show that more than 17 % of Africa 's population is Catholic .
But at the same time , the region 's poverty , conflicts and Aids have posed challenges .
Among the thorny issues bishops may raise at the synod is the Vatican 's ban on condom use .
Many say condoms could help prevent the spread of Aids .
In a reminder of Africa 's many conflicts , Benedict issued a special appeal for reconciliation and dialogue in Guinea , where soldiers fired at a pro-democracy rally last week , reportedly killing 157 people .
The victims were participating in a protest against Captain Moussa Dadis Camara , who seized power last December .

Amateur footage shows the moment the 7.6 - magnitude quake struck Sumatra on Wednesday .
The quake struck close to the city of Padang , the capital of West Sumatra province , bringing scores of buildings crashing to the ground .
What may be the most thorough study ever of a single organism has produced a beta code for life 's essential subroutines , and shown that even the simplest creatures are more complex than scientists suspected .
The analysis combined information about gene regulation , protein production and cell structure in Mycoplasma pneumoniae , one of the simplest self - sustaining microbes .
It 's far closer to a " blueprint " than a mere genome readout , and reveals processes " that are much more subtle and intricate than were previously considered possible in bacteria , " wrote University of Arizona biologists Howard Ochman and Rahul Raghavan in a commentary accompanying the findings , which were published last Thursday in Science .
M. pneumoniae has just one - fifth as many genes as E. coli , the traditional single - cell model organism .
That makes it an ideal target for systems biologists who want to understand how cells function .
To them , genome scans are just a first step .
They do n't explain when or why genes are turned on and off , or how different genes interact at different times , or how cellular " machines " use proteins produced by gene instructions .
In the new studies , German and Spanish researchers documented almost every single protein used by M. pneumoniae .
They looked up the known functions of each of its genes , and made recordings of gene activity .
They documented all the chemical reactions inside M. pneumoniae and mapped its physical structure .
Then they put all this together .
What emerged was a picture of surprising complexity .
M. pneumoniae needs just eight gene " switches " to control its molecular activities , compared to 50 in E. coli — a number so low that it implies other , as - yet - unknown regulatory processes .
Groups of genes thought to work in unison did so only intermittently .
At other times they worked in isolation , or in unexpected configurations .
The findings also showed that chromosome topography — the actual , three - dimensional arrangement of an operating genome , rather than its linear laboratory readout — plays an important part in determining how genes interact .
In short , there was a lot going on in lowly , supposedly simple M. pneumoniae , and much of it is beyond the grasp of what 's now known about cell function .
Eventually , the thorough analytical approach used to study M. pneumoniae could be applied to other microbes .
The findings could also be used by synthetic biologists trying to synthesize microbial life .
But for now , they show just how much work remains to be done before life 's essential processes are understood .
" Linear mapping of genes to function rarely considers how a cell actually accomplishes the processes , " wrote Ochman and Raghavan .
" There is no such thing as a ' simple ' bacterium . "

Brandon Keim's Twitter stream and reportorial outtakes ; Wired Science on Twitter .
Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
In the first video showing the auroras above the northern latitudes of Saturn , Cassini has spotted the tallest known " northern lights " in the solar system , flickering in shape and brightness high above the ringed planet .
The new video reveals changes in Saturn 's aurora every few minutes , in high resolution , with three dimensions .
The images show a previously unseen vertical profile to the auroras , which ripple in the video like tall curtains .
These curtains reach more than 1,200 kilometers ( 750 miles ) above the edge of the planet 's northern hemisphere .
The new video and still images are online at : http://www.nasa.gov/cassini , http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://ciclops.org .
Auroras occur on Earth , Jupiter , Saturn and a few other planets , and the new images will help scientists better understand how they are generated .
" The auroras have put on a dazzling show , shape - shifting rapidly and exposing curtains that we suspected were there , but had n't seen on Saturn before , " said Andrew Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , who is a member of the Cassini imaging team that processed the new video .
" Seeing these things on another planet helps us understand them a little better when we see them on Earth . "
Auroras appear mostly in the high latitudes near a planet 's magnetic poles .
When charged particles from the magnetosphere -- the magnetic bubble surrounding a planet -- plunge into the planet 's upper atmosphere , they cause the atmosphere to glow .
The curtain shapes show the paths that these charged particles take as they flow along the lines of the magnetic field between the magnetosphere and the uppermost part of the atmosphere .
The height of the curtains on Saturn exposes a key difference between Saturn 's atmosphere and our own , Ingersoll said .
While Earth 's atmosphere has a lot of oxygen and nitrogen , Saturn 's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen .
Because hydrogen is very light , the atmosphere and auroras reach far out from Saturn .
Earth 's auroras tend to flare only about 100 to 500 kilometers ( 60 to 300 miles ) above the surface .
The speed of the auroral changes in the video is comparable to some of those on Earth , but scientists are still working to understand the processes that produce these rapid changes .
The height will also help them learn how much energy is required to light up auroras .
" I was wowed when I saw these images and the curtain , " said Tamas Gombosi of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , who chairs Cassini 's magnetosphere and plasma science working group .
" Put this together with the other data Cassini has collected on the auroras so far , and you really get a new science . "
Ultraviolet and infrared instruments on Cassini have captured images of and data from Saturn 's auroras before , but in these latest images , Cassini 's narrow - angle camera was able to capture the northern lights in the visible part of the light spectrum , in higher resolution .
The movie was assembled from nearly 500 still pictures spanning 81 hours between Oct. 5 and Oct. 8 , 2009 .
Each picture had an exposure time of two or three minutes .
The camera shot pictures from the night side of Saturn .
The images were originally obtained in black and white , and the imaging team highlighted the auroras in false - color orange .
The oxygen and nitrogen in Earth 's upper atmosphere contribute to the colorful flashes of green , red and even purple in our auroras .
But scientists are still working to determine the true color of the auroras at Saturn , whose atmosphere lacks those chemicals .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute , Boulder , Colo .
“ Absolutely damn ridiculous .
I could not believe [ it ] …
Shame on the host and the other judges for trying to act like this performance was acceptable in any part of the world …
I 'm too disgusted to write any more , ” she wrote .
The Guardian newspaper called the skit “ mind - boggling ” and host Daryl Somers 's apology at the end of the show “ a somewhat unconvincing epiphany . ”
Guardian readers were similarly unimpressed .
“ Oz really is the Land that Time Forgot ... no wonder so many white racists seem to choose to move to Oz , they probably feel at home there , ” wrote one reader .
New York - based gossip website Gawker.com lashed out at the Hey Hey audience for cheering the performance and booing when US singer Harry Connick jnr gave the team a zero score .
“ So , in 20 years , we 've gone from this offensive form of comedy being wildly popular to being still popular … Australia must be really messed up . ”
David Schmader from Seattle - based site The Stranger posted a video of Connick jnr 's reaction to the sketch on the blog , adding : “ Good for him .
If I were a voter heading into the ballot booth … I would pull the lever for him . ”
Most of the replies to Schmader 's post have criticised Australia as being racist .
“ It 's true that racism exists in all countries ( the usual Australian apologists ' excuse ) , but Australia are the world champions , ” wrote one reader .
“ The casual racism of a lot of Australians beggars belief .
They 're thirty years behind us in some ways , ” wrote a reader on The Stranger .
“ And you still hear , here : 'oh , we 're just taking the piss , mate , we do it to everyone . '
It 's absolutely grotesque . ”
Discussion on many sites turned to Australia 's treatment of its own black population .
“ The majority of Australians turn a blind eye to the horrendous living conditions of Aboriginal people in the outback , never even consider Aboriginal deaths in custody , and when things like the Stolen Generation are mentioned , think .
' Get over it , that was forty years ago ' , ” wrote Christo on Chicago Now .
The Nine Network said in a statement today : " It was never intended to offend and we regret any offence the Red Faces act caused . "
Hey Hey It 's Saturday publicist Terry Stuart said : “ At the time of the actual event no one really thought much of it .
It was only after Harry 's comments that the whole thing really snowballed . "
He later added : " There 's an audition process and if any group is getting vilified or denigrated then that would be something but that was n't the case in this example . "
The Nine Network said that last night 's show was a ratings triumph , snagging 2.73 million people at its peak .
THE DEPROLIFERATOR —
Sometimes it seems as if neither the United States nor Russia got the message that the Cold War ended almost two decades ago .
Previously I wrote about the Dooomsday Device , a back - up defense system that Russia developed in the 80s .
In the aftermath of a nuclear attack , it ensures that , even if no civilian and military leaders are still around to issue the command , a retaliatory nuclear attack will still be launched .
Depending on your point of view , it ’s either the ultimate in deterrence or the most senseless act of revenge ever .
which the United States could mount a nuclear attack , secure in the knowledge that Russia ’s retaliatory warheads would , in effect , be just rain falling on an umbrella .
Like missile defense , Dead Hand , as the Russians call their Doomsday Device , exists to this day .
Except theirs actually works .
If Russia clings to a Cold War mentality in other ways as well , who can blame it ?
The era combined the best of both worlds :
1. Stability , for those who believed in the illusion of deterrence , and .
. .
2 . Life on the edge , for those who knew the true extent to which the United States and the Soviet Union were actually at each other ’s throats during the Eisenhower , Kennedy , and Reagan administrations .
Recently discussions were held in Moscow between Russian foreign ministry officials and representatives of Global Zero , the disarmament group that comprises former heads of state , foreign ministers , defense ministers , national security advisors , and military commanders .
But it turns out Russia ’s not ready for a new round of disarmament talks ( at least not with those out of power ) .
The AP reports :
[ Ground Zero member Richard ]
Burt said Russian officials appear to be concerned that steep cuts in their nuclear arsenal will leave them vulnerable to military threats .
“ There is I think a feeling in certain circles in the Russian defense establishment that their conventional forces are rundown and as a result they ’re going to have to rely more on their nuclear forces , ” Burt said .
Has n’t that rationale informed many of Russia ’s defense policies — as well as those of the United States at times — since the dawn of the nuclear age ?
According to a 2003 Nonproliferation Review article by Harold Feiveson and Ernst Jan Hogendoorn :
For Russia , the end of the Cold War did impact the country ’s no - first - use policy — but in an unexpected direction .
In 1993 — facing a precipitous drop in conventional military strength — Russia renounced the 1982 policy of no first use , and changed its declaratory policy to maintaining the option to use nuclear weapons against any nuclear armed aggressor , including non-nuclear states allied with a nuclear weapons state .
Today , not only is Russia dragging its feet on disarmament , but , as Simon Saradzhyan reports for Zurich ’s International Relations and Security Network : [ Russia ’s ] 2000 Military Doctrine asserts that Russia “ reserves the right ” to use nuclear weapons first “ in response to large - scale aggression using conventional weapons in situations [ such as ] regional war . ”
Not only is Russia dragging its feet on disarmament by continuing to retain the right to first use — in a regional war , no less — but , “ Changes in the [ follow - up ] to the 2000 document include [ allowing ] use of nuclear weapons when repelling an aggression [ in ] even a local war . ”
Bear in mind that Russia ’s “ pledge to use nuclear weapons to defend itself and its allies failed to deter Russia ’s foes ” in the regional conflicts that it ’s faced thus far in Chechnya and South Ossetia ( not to mention Georgia ) .
[ Emphasis added . ]
In fact , Saradzhyan quotes a retired Russian general who “ argued that the new doctrine looks ‘ detached from reality ’ . ”
Worst of all , he writes , “ The planned expansion of the use of nuclear weapons will raise a lot of questions on how it conforms with ” President Medvedev ’s May 2009 commitment to Global Zero , which , five months later , looks like a passing fancy on his part .
First Strike Culpability
If you believe that nuclear weapons provide a sound deterrent , it ’s likely you assume that first - strike capability is the backbone of deterrence .
A policy of no - first - use would remove a weight from your pan of the scale that monitors nuclear balance and deposit it in that of your designated enemy ’s .
In other words , if the United States declared no - first - use , its foe might jump to the conclusion that , should push come to shove , a red carpet has been laid out for it to strike first .
Since U.S. nuclear installations are prime targets , the ability of the United States to retaliate would be severely compromised .
As Feiveson and Hogendoorn explain in their Nonproliferation Review article , it was the Eisenhower administration that first adopted first - use as national security policy .
One of its directives read : “ In the event of hostilities , the United States will consider nuclear weapons to be available for use as other munitions . ”
[ Emphasis added . ]
Here we have as clear a depiction as one could want of how the military views nuclear weapons :
There ’s no qualitative difference between them and conventional weapons .
To the military , nuclear weapons do n’t constitute a fundamental break in the weapons continuum nor do they invoke visions of the apocalypse and evoke elemental ethical questions .
They ’re just an inevitable development in the history of bombs .
Of course , in recent years , because of the constraints on their use , the Pentagon has grown less enamored of nuclear weapons .
Forty years later , not much had changed .
Of the Bush administration , the authors write : “. . . the United States was diplomatically disavowing the use of nuclear weapons except in certain extreme circumstances , and yet at the same time , hedging the disavowal to allow the greatest possible latitude for the use of nuclear weapons . ”
Despite what many think , hedging does n’t imply straddling two domains .
Just the opposite in fact , it ’s defined as planting a barrier to protect your own .
Either way , it ’s effect is to muddy the waters .
For example , does a state ’s first - use policy apply only to other nuclear states , or to non-nuclear states as well ?
What could possibly drive a nuclear state to attack a non-nuclear state with nuclear weapons ?
The nuclear state might feel that the non-nuclear state is acting with impunity because it ’s protected by another nuclear state .
More likely the nuclear state is operating under the assumption that the non-nuclear state is about to launch an attack with either the B or the C team of weapons of mass destruction — Biological and Chemical weapons .
Never mind that , a policy of first use against WMD runs the risk of watering down the concept of deterrence by diverting it into streams other than the nuclear .
Meanwhile , above the fray — though not exactly occupying the moral high ground because it ’s got nuclear weapons , too — stands China .
Feiveson and Hogendoorn write :
China . . . remains the only declared nuclear weapons state that has maintained a largely unhedged no - first - use policy , and in 1995 reiterated its commitment that “ China undertakes not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any circumstances . ”
During the U.N. Security Council meeting on disarmament that President Obama convened in September , as the Guardian reported . . .
China pushed to have a clause included in today ’s resolution calling on weapons states to emulate its own “ no first use ” policy , but the US has long resisted such an undertaking , reserving the right to carry out a pre-emptive strike .
But Obama is pressing the Pentagon to consider radical changes to US doctrine to downgrade the role of nuclear weapons .
One would hope that our next nuclear posture review disavows first use of nuclear weapons .
Unless nuclear states can shed the Cold War mentality once and for all , it ’s hard to be optimistic about the long - terms prospects for disarmament .

Adele Cabot and her husband used to dine out three or four times a week , regularly spending $ 75 to $ 100 at a sushi bar sampling rainbow rolls and yellowtail nigiri sushi .
But that changed after Cabot , an adjunct professor of theater at UCLA , had to take a 6 % salary cut .
The couple now eat out half as much and frequent less expensive Mexican and Italian places .
“ I just do n’t want to spend the money to eat out a lot , ” Cabot said .
With Thanksgiving this week and Christmas next month , restaurants are eager to win back customers such as Cabot who seemed to disappear amid a brutal summer for the nation ’s eateries .
Restaurant owners are worried that tight corporate entertainment budgets , cash - conscious consumers and greater competition from price - cutting supermarkets will make for another dreary Christmas .
The number of people visiting restaurants has plunged for four consecutive quarters , according to NPD Group , a market research firm .
Companies as small as Tender Greens , with just three restaurants , and as huge as the Denny ’s chain are braced for another difficult year .
“ Until the economy gets through these unemployment and foreclosure issues , we are going to have a tough time , ” said Nelson Marchioli , chief executive of Denny ’s Corp. of Spartanburg , S.C. “ The economy has really put our customers in a tough position . ”
Marchioli is talking about people such as Harry Browne of Mount Washington .
Browne lost his job in information technology and wo n’t be buying anything more than “ a value meal from a fast - food restaurant ” these holidays .
“ I am on my last extension of unemployment benefits , so I have to really watch my spending , ” he said .
To reach those consumers , Denny ’s plans a television advertising blitz during key NFL and college football games as well as the Macy ’s Thanksgiving Day parade .
It is n’t only mid-priced family restaurants that people are avoiding .
Upscale chains such as McCormick & Schmick ’s , the seafood house , and Morton ’s , the steak purveyor , saw same - store sales , or sales at restaurants open at least a year , fall 18.8 % and 16.8 % , respectively , in the third quarter compared with a year earlier , according to Bellwether Food Group , a food industry consulting firm .
Bellwether does n’t project an industry rebound to pre- recession levels until 2012 .
The recession has taught consumers to eat out less often and to order less -- skipping alcoholic beverages , appetizers and desserts -- when they do , Bellwether said .
That ’s made easier by supermarkets , which have cut prices and expanded their selection of prepared food and takeout entrees .
“ We used to eat out a lot and buy just some things at the supermarket , ” said Grant Cramer , who owns a small television and film production company in Los Angeles .
Now he ’s cooking at home more and finds himself stocking up at the grocery store and farmers markets .
“ I had a couple of projects that crashed with the economy .
We had to tighten up , ” Cramer said .
Christmas - season spending at bars and restaurants this year will be about $ 7.8 billion , according to IbisWorld Inc. , a market analysis firm in Santa Monica .
That ’s one of the rosier industry estimates -- up almost 6 % from a year ago , but that ’s only because last Christmas was so lousy , the company said .
It is still down 11 % from the pre-recession level of $ 8.8 billion in 2007 .
“ I think it will only get tougher .
People are still losing their jobs , credit is still tight , and we could see another wave of foreclosures , ” said Erik Oberholtzer , co-owner of Tender Greens , a group of three restaurants based in Culver City that emphasizes locally grown food .
Restaurants are redoubling their efforts to prevent as poor a holiday season as last year ’s .
In particular , they are focusing on catering private parties and hosting business gatherings -- a vital source of income this time of year .
“ We called back a lot of people this year who canceled on us after the economy collapsed last October , ” said Joachim Splichal , chef and founder of Patina Restaurant Group , which owns Patina , Cafe Pinot and Nick & Stef ’s Steakhouse , among other upscale eateries .
Splichal found that many companies wanted to do parties for their workers if for no other reason than to celebrate surviving a tough year that often included wage freezes and layoffs .
“ They were all on a tight budget , ” Splichal said .
So to close deals , he offered a 10 % discount for early bookings and then came up with all - inclusive plans , such as $ 60 for a three - course dinner , wine , tax and tip .
The hope is that customers will upgrade -- for example , picking more expensive wines or making other add - ons -- during the event , he said .
But he also found that many clients who still want to celebrate are downgrading from a formal dinner to a cocktail party .
Cache Restaurant & Lounge , an independent restaurant in Santa Monica , has knocked 10 % off the price of private - party bookings .
“ The holiday season will be decent but not great , and who is to say what is right around the corner in this economy ? ” said Josiah Citrin , who also owns Melisse in Santa Monica .
Wilshire Restaurant hopes to entice private parties by offering $ 100 gift certificates with a private - party booking .
Like many independent restaurants , Wilshire also is pushing heavily into social media to create a buzz for the establishment .
It has a Facebook page and is part of OpenTable , an online reservations network .
Messages sent out over its
Twitter account periodically announce half - price wine nights and $ 1 martini specials .
California Pizza Kitchen also is looking to gain more family - and office - event business by offering a catering menu that bundles entrees to make it easier to order for groups .
It also is giving an extra $ 20 gift card for every $ 100 worth purchased .
The Yard House chain has a lower threshold , offering a $ 10 gift card for every $ 50 worth purchased .
It also is expanding hours at some restaurants .
Previously , all of its restaurants closed on Christmas .
This year its L.A. Live location in downtown Los Angeles as well as its Waikiki establishment in Honolulu will be open Christmas Day .
Denny ’s , which saw same - store sales at company - owned restaurants fall 6.6 % in the third quarter , plans to “ look for ways to market our strengths , ” CEO Marchioli said .
That means pitching the chain ’s Grand Slam budget breakfasts , which start at $ 3.99 , and launching a 6.6 - ounce grilled hamburger for $ 6.99 to try to build lunch and dinner traffic .
But even those initiatives will leave the 1,500 - restaurant chain still battling economic head winds .
Research firm NPD does n’t expect an industry turnaround any time soon .
“ It is not a pretty picture , ” said Bonnie Riggs , a restaurant industry analyst with NPD in Chicago .
“ Consumers have pulled back so much . ”
In 33 years of tracking restaurant traffic , NPD “ has never seen this type of a weakness for this long of a period , ” Riggs said .
“ The industry really has its work cut out for it . ”

Amen , Amen , Amen : Memoir of a Girl Who Could n’t Stop Praying ( Among Other Things )
by Abby Sher
( Simon & Schuster , October 20 , 2009 )
How does an eleven - year - old girl cope with the trauma of losing both her favorite aunt and her beloved father in the span of one calendar year ?
She may pray to God daily to ask Him to protect her loved ones .
But what happens when prayer becomes more than just a comfort ?
What happens when it becomes a compulsion ?
This question is at the heart of Abby Sher ’s memoir Amen , Amen , Amen : Memoir of a Girl Who Could n’t Stop Praying ( Among Other Things ) .
The power of prayer has been the subject of much debate and research , with studies claiming that prayer can help heal the sick , even when the sick person has no relation to the people offering the curative incantation , or that person does n’t know that he or she is being prayed for .
There are other studies that show people who pray experience feelings of relief : it makes sense that prayer could benefit those for whom religion is personally significant .
If it ’s good for people , even if it ’s not provably efficacious , what ’s the harm ?
Bizarre or Faithful ?
Abby
Sher ’s compulsions began when she was a small child — from tearing up paper napkins at the dinner table to tracing the wallpaper on her bedroom walls until her finger bruised .
The impulses grew more invasive as Sher grew older and calamity became a fixture in her life .
An emotionally fragile , pre-adolescent Abby identified herself as the one to blame for the unexpected deaths in her family , and turned to God for help .
But her sense of consolation was quickly overshadowed by a consuming fear of causing death and danger .
Abby became convinced that giving herself fully to God and doing
His protective bidding was the only way to ensure that no one else would meet an untimely , tragic fate .
For all the benefits that prayer might offer , it does not offer safety from disaster .
When an ambulance passes , the repeated mumbling of a self - created supplication like “ I hope you get there in time ” fifty times wo n’t guarantee anything .
But Abby was certain the lives of others were her responsibility and hinged on her pact with God .
She imagined in vivid detail the terrible deaths that were a result of her betrayal of God ’s love — betrayals as benign as kissing a boy ( proving that her affections and desires were not entirely sacred ) .
To Abby , the balance of the world rested squarely on her shoulders , and the slightest misstep on her part set in motion scenarios with disastrous consequences .
No doubt this manner of irrational thinking will sound strange to most people , religious or not , and Sher does a good job of allowing the reader an insider ’s view of the logic behind her delusions .
Much of her behavior fell within the bounds of the normal , especially in a devoutly Jewish context .
On the surface , Abby appeared to be a staunch , if somewhat peculiar , follower of God .
It is only when we learn what was going on in her head that Sher ’s actions read as bizarre instead of faithful .
Ascetics throughout history have gotten into trouble for exhibiting behaviors far more extreme than Sher ’s ; the difference between mystical devotion and mental illness can be hard to construe .
It is primarily though a lens of psychoanalysis that compulsive ritual begins to be regarded as illegitimate or destructive .
In Sher ’s case , even when she began seeing a therapist , her faith served to reinforce some of her more ritualistic actions , like daily fasting — a behavior that , when decontextualized , was revealed as severe anorexia .
From OCD to Atheist
While some of Sher ’s obsessive behaviors would come and go ( such as collecting thumbtacks , candy wrappers , and paper clips from the ground then meticulously hoarding the pile of “ life - threatening trash ” in a dresser drawer for months ) , it was the religiously - rooted habits that persisted .
To me , this continuity makes sense .
When religious teachings tell us that we have a greater purpose in life , a calling to which we are meant to give ourselves wholly , we can use these beliefs to justify almost anything .
Sher ’s compulsions were not arbitrary , they were created from pieces of information she gleaned from religious teachings as well as from the world around her : trash can be perilous ; loving God is pure and good ;
God will ruthlessly punish sinners .
Ultimately , Sher decides , though tentatively , that her faith is not legitimate .
As a reader it frustrated me that there was no critique through most of the narrative of Sher ’s excessive religiosity , either from herself or those around her .
Sher ’s family and friends seemed to collude with her by ignoring , sometimes even promoting , mental and behavioral compulsions that were the lynchpin of her illness .
I found myself wondering if her placating mother and best friend were co-conspirators , co-dependent , or an amazing source of strength and support — although in truth they were probably all three .
By the time Abby meets her savior — an atheist man who helped her see her conduct as the result of self - loathing and delusion — I was glad to let go of my knee - jerk feminist disapproval of the knight in shining armor fable .
I was glad to see Sher finally getting the professional help she so desperately needed to end the myriad self - mutilating behaviors that had been allowed to spiral out of control .
Amen , Amen , Amen is a painful yet revelatory read that had this nonbeliever sending a healing mantra into the universe for Sher and others like her who live with a form of obsessive compulsive disorder masked by religion .
In another time or place , Sher might have entered a hermitage .
Today she will have to settle for appearances on TV talk shows .

SAN FRANCISCO 
These are heady times for advocates of legalized marijuana in California  and only in small part because of the newly relaxed approach of the federal government toward medical marijuana .
State lawmakers are holding a hearing on Wednesday on the effects of a bill that would legalize , tax and regulate the drug  in what would be the first such law in the United States .
Tax officials estimate the legislation could bring the struggling state about $ 1.4 billion a year , and though the bill ’s fate in the Legislature is uncertain , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has indicated he would be open to a “ robust debate ” on the issue .
California voters are also taking up legalization .
Three separate initiatives are being circulated for signatures to appear on the ballot next year , all of which would permit adults to possess marijuana for personal use and allow local governments to tax it .
Even opponents of legalization suggest that an initiative is likely to qualify for a statewide vote .
“ All of us in the movement have had the feeling that we ’ve been running into the wind for years , ” said James P. Gray , a retired judge in Orange County who has been outspoken in support of legalization .
“ Now we sense we are running with the wind . ”
Robert M. Morgenthau , the Manhattan district attorney , said 27 of the 29 people named in the indictment had been arrested ; the other two remain at large .
Those indicted include bosses and associates of the Luchese family , officials of four corporations , real estate officials and the six building inspectors .

The Buildings Department has a history of corruption scandals , including notable ones under the Bloomberg administration .
In 2002 , 19 of the city ’s 24 plumbing inspectors  including the chief inspector and the top supervisors in the Bronx , Brooklyn , Manhattan and Queens  were charged with extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars to approve projects throughout the city .
Last year , two crane collapses in Manhattan , which killed nine people , led to investigations by Mr. Morgenthau ’s office and the Department of Investigation that exposed corruption and incompetence in the building agency ’s Cranes and Derricks Division and resulted in several arrests .
Amid the problems , Patricia J. Lancaster resigned last year as buildings commissioner , the first commissioner to leave the Bloomberg administration under a cloud of controversy .
Her replacement , Robert D. LiMandri , said on Thursday that he was outraged by the charges , and he sought to assure New Yorkers that their safety had not been compromised .
“ As a precaution , the department has visited all of the buildings associated with the investigation to ensure safety , and we expect to complete all reinspection work soon , ” Mr. LiMandri said .
“ These former inspectors are accused of betraying the public and this department for their own selfish gain , and they should be prosecuted to the full extent under the law . ”
October 26 , 2009 – Dr. Anklesnap
Yesterday it was being reported that Charles Barkley of , getting DUI ’s on the way to meet hookers fame NBA on TNT fame , is making a public pitch for his services as a General Manager of an NBA franchise .
In classic ‘ Chuck ’ fashion , Barkley knocks the NBA GM ’s league wide in stating his case :
“ It ’s time for me to be a general manager , ’’ said Barkley , who has been at TNT for eight years .
“ I think everybody around me knows it ’s time for me to take a different challenge .
“ I always want to keep going as a person .
I love my job .
I love the people I work with .
But now it ’s time for me to take on another challenge as a man .
I need to grow as a person and it ’s time for me .
“ And certainly I can do a better job than some of these guys have been doing . ’’
I ’m not sure if it ’s a longing to be a General Manager or if it ’s just another chance to compete with his longtime friend and rival Michael Jordan , as MJ is a co-owner and executive with the Charlotte Bobcats .
Chuck says he wants to ‘ grow as a person ’ , but personally I think the managing of a basketball team is best left to those that are equipped to handle the in ’s and out ’s of contract negotiations .
Charles may be better suited to act as a scout or marketing representative for a ball club .
Or maybe i’m just bitter that if CB gets a job as a GM he wo n’t have enough time to entertain us all at half - time and post - game as an analyst .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan Airlines
Corp shares slid 12 percent to a record low on Friday as investors suggested bankruptcy may be an option for Asia ’s biggest airline by revenue , even as the government again pledged to support the troubled carrier .

“ There ’s increasing concern about the future of the company and whether it ’s heading for a GM - style bankruptcy or not , ” said Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management .
The airline , plagued with high costs in a severe industry downturn , has asked creditors for 600 billion yen ( $ 6.6 billion ) in financial aid , including 300 billion yen in debt waivers and debt - for - equity swaps , as part of a restructuring plan , according to two sources familiar with the matter .
JAL shares fell to 100 yen , their lowest since they were re-listed in 2002 .
By the close , the stock was quoted at 101 yen , down more than 11 percent .
The shares have lost a quarter of their value this week .
Last month , JAL proposed a plan under which it pledged to cut 6,800 jobs , eliminate 50 routes and lower its operating costs by 30 percent , but it was forced back to the drawing board after the government said the steps were not enough .
The airline is now working with a government - appointed task force on a new plan to put to the transport ministry within two weeks .
Transport Minister Seiji Maehara on Friday pledged his support for the airline while that process is underway .
“ From I can see in the pre-draft plan I received the other day from JAL and its task force , I am confident that work on the plan is progressing smoothly , ” said Maehara , adding there was no change in the government ’s stance to support the airline .
But the lack of a clear growth plan for JAL is fuelling market concern that a rescue package may be throwing good money after bad , some investors said , leaving creditors such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( MUFG ) and Mizuho Financial Group out in the cold .
MUFG , JAL ’s No.2 creditor behind the state - owned Development Bank of Japan , is owed about 50 billion yen ( $ 551 million ) .
Kyodo news agency reported JAL was reconsidering a plan to sell shares in its group firms , suggesting that restructuring efforts needed to turn the company around might be slow to come .
“ Even if they do get the funds , where ’s the prospect of growth ?
I do n’t see it , ” said a portfolio manager at a Japanese asset management firm , who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to comment on individual stocks .
“ In some ways , bankruptcy might be the better option -- it would allow the firm to restart from a clean slate . ”
JAL has put on hold separate talks with Delta Air Lines and AMR Corp ’s American Airlines for a capital infusion and business ties , aiming to focus first on its own revival plan , Kyodo reported last week .
Ratings agency Moody ’s downgraded Japan Airlines International Co Ltd and put the JAL unit on review for a further possible downgrade .

After leaping over a fence at D.C. 's National Zoo , a small deer evaded capture by two hungry lions , drawing elated cheers and joyous tears from hundreds of onlookers .
And then , they read the tale 's horrible conclusion in today 's Washington Post .
The incident began when the little deer " ran between people " and leaped into the lion pit , then was attacked and toyed with by a pair of bloodthirsty beasts for " as much as 20 minutes . "
Then , as is depicted in the below video , the little deer broke free !
And escaped to the relative safety of a body of water .
The crowd shrieked , gasped , cheered , and caught it all on video .
When zoo personnel finally broke up the crowd to rescue the nimble survivor , the harrowing tale reached its happy ending ...
OR SO IT SEEMED .
For there , in The Washington Post 's Monday Metro section , was the tale 's true , tragic conclusion :
Alerted , zoo personnel sent visitors away and brought the lions indoors .
With the enclosure empty , the deer left the moat on its own .
It was anesthetized and taken for evaluation by specialists .
...
Baker - Masson said the examination indicated that in addition to head and neck scratches , the deer had a serious wound on its belly .
...
They found it " pretty evident " that the deer " would not survive , " and it was euthanized , Baker - Masson said .
And thus concludes the sad story of the Deer That Almost Lived , the saddest viral video ever uploaded to the internet , in retrospect .
Even sadder than Bambi's mom and the Lion King 's dad , because this one is real , and must have caused at least one 5 - year - old to wet his pants out of terror that day at the zoo .
Word to would - be assailants :
Do n’t scream anti-gay epithets at your assailants , or you ’re on the hook for a hate crime .
We ’re talking to you Robert Bellamy Jr. ( and your two accomplices ) , who ’s suspected of attacking two men on Halloween .
While there ’s no official confirmation either victims are LGBT , one was dressed in drag , which is enough for New York cops to investigate the Long Island attack — punching the victims in the faces and knocking them to the ground , in order to steal $ 7 — as a hate crime .
As Ballamy told police , according to court records : “ God made me hate gay people . ”
Well , maybe his religious beliefs will help him get off !
As I suspected when this story broke , the minor problem for the AGW alarmists was dealing with the Roman and Medieval Warm Periods .
The big headache was the warm period prior to 1960 , which we can see in the CRU data was equal to or higher than today .
This warm period in the first half of the last century is a real problem for the theory of CO2 driven , man -made warming .
What we see time and time again is one of two ‘ tricks ’ used by the alarmists to exaggerate or manufacture runaway warming .
One is the application of ‘ corrections ’ which shove down the pre 1960 warm periods and raise up the most recent temperatures ( see here and here ) .
The other ‘ trick ’ is to cherry pick data that supports the AGW fiction and discard data that contradicts that meme .
Over at WUWT Warwick Hughes ( original link ) has discovered another smoking gun , showing how CRU selected stations and only used post 1950 data to create their fictional warming .
When you use ALL the data , the myth of global warming magically disappears !
Imagine that , selecting data to create the story of global warming so you can keep getting millions of dollars in tax payer money .
Whodathunkit ?
Well , we seem to have plenty of evidence of data manipulation , covering up real data , violations of FOI statutes , persecution of opposing scientists and censorship of opposing science .
Let the public investigations begin , and we shall see if the science can hold up to real scrutiny .
Germany Has a Gay Minister —
Yäwn !
For more than 50 years , the tabloid daily Bild — currently Europe ’s best - selling newspaper — has served as both a reliable barometer of Germany ’s conservative movement and a steady vent of its populist id .
The editors have never felt compelled to question their winning formula :
The conservative parties ’ current talking points go above the fold , the naked " Page One Girl " below it .
The self - appointed guarantors of all that is traditionally Deutsch are n’t much interested in the finer points of sensitivity training .
And in that way , the tabloid might have been expected at some point this week to express ambivalence , if not disapproval , of the fact that the country ’s newly elected vice - chancellor and foreign minister , Guido Westerwelle , is gay .
Instead , though , Bild waved a white flag on one of the fronts of the country ’s decades - long culture war .
As part of its gleeful coverage of the victory of the country ’s two main conservative parties in Sunday ’s election , the newspaper paid its respect to Westerwelle in the form of a sentimental page - one profile of his boyfriend , complete with a trashy headline : " His Boyfriend Makes Him Strong ! "
Taking its cues from voters , Bild ‘s editors did n’t wring their hands over Westerwelle ’s sexual orientation , nor did they sensationalize it as a novelty .
For one thing , it was n’t news :
The chairman of the FDP , the free market Free Democratic Party , had n’t hidden his sexual orientation during the campaign — his partner , event manager Michael Mronz , was often on stage with him at his rallies — and no one he encountered on the trail seemed inclined to make an issue of it .
Being a gay politician in Germany , it seems , is well on its way to being utterly normal , even banal .
Germany ’s ready public acceptance of homosexuality is the product of recent sea changes both in the character of society and in the letter of national law .
For much of western Germany ’s history , neither the CDU , the Catholic - dominated Christian Democratic Union , nor the opposition Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , with its focus on the industrial working class , had much interest in setting up protections for gays .
In eastern Germany , the ruling communist party dismissed homosexuality as " contrary to the healthy mores of the people . "
Nazi-era laws that criminalized homosexuality remained in force in East Germany until 1958 and in West Germany until as late as 1969 .
Change did n’t come easy .
The gay - rights movement that began organizing in earnest in West Germany in the 1960s — part of the student - driven backlash that wanted to interrogate and overcome the country ’s Nazi past — elicited strong conservative resistance .
For decades , the polarized camps faced off in homes , universities , and city streets in a tense stalemate .
When Helmut Kohl took office as chancellor in 1982 at the head of a " black - yellow " coalition between the CDU and the FDP , he promised a " moral - spiritual revolution " that would return the country to its traditional understanding of public morality and decorum .
What that amounted to , during his 16 years at the head of German government , was periodic populist agitation against politically correct cultural liberals in the arts and academia .
Certainly , it was unthinkable that a gay man would gain a major portfolio in the Kohl - led coalition that governed until 1998 .
( Westerwelle , as a high - ranking FDP official , was involved in the Kohl government , but did n’t come out of the closet until 2004 . )
How , then , has the tide turned so dramatically in Germany in favor of acceptance of homosexuality ?
On the legal and political side , the gay - rights movement was fortunate to have found an amenable political home in the late 1970s in the fledgling Green Party .
Although dismissed by the establishment in their early years , the Greens came into power in 1999 , together with the SPD , with a clear and focused agenda to update German law to better reflect society ’s present - day values .
In addition to reform of immigration and citizenship statutes , the Greens pushed through a law recognizing same - sex partnerships and also rooted out the final remnants of legalized discrimination against gays in the German military .
These efforts were passed with the support of the left - leaning SPD and Westerwelle ’s free market , culturally liberal FDP .
Westerwelle , for his part , blasted the Catholic Church for its " 19th - century worldview " in response to a call by the Vatican to campaign against the gay - marriage law .
Germany ’s religious landscape also factors into the relative serenity with which its society addresses homosexuality .
In a country where 30 percent of the population considers itself atheist , it is hard to drum up fervor against sexual orientation :
To that extent , reunification with East Germany — which was predominantly atheist , according to communist ideology — has made the country , as a whole , a friendlier place for gays .
Moreover , Germany ’s institutionalized Lutheran Protestant church , to which another 30 percent of the country adheres , is considerably more liberal than most evangelical Protestant denominations in the United States .
Germany ’s Lutheran church allows gays to become priests , and in some instances , blesses same - sex marriages .
Even the CDU , the traditionally Catholic mainstay of conservative West Germany , is n’t as obeisant to Rome as it once was .
Chancellor Angela Merkel — head of the CDU , albeit one who was raised by a Protestant pastor in East Germany — did not hesitate to criticize German - born Pope Benedict XVI when he reinstated excommunicated bishops who had denied the Holocaust .
No one in the CDU felt inclined to agitate against fellow party member Ole von Beust when he outed himself during his first term as mayor of Hamburg .
And the last CDU candidate to run for mayor of Cologne saw no contradiction in referring to himself both as a gay man and a " serious Catholic . "
Indeed , once politicians come out of the closet , German voters tend to be concerned less about their private lives than about their other personal qualities .
It ’s no coincidence that those who have unabashedly staked claim to their sexual preferences have usually earned bonus points among the public .
" When a politician deals openly with his homosexuality , he comes across as more authentic , " says Werner Patzelt , a political science professor at Dresden Technical University .
There ’s still a city - country divide in Germany when it comes to acceptance of homosexuality .
Gays still have a harder time in Bavaria , where traditional adherence to the Catholic Church in small towns is very strong .
It ’s not surprising then that the first major public official to come out of the closet was Klaus Wowereit , the mayor of Berlin , the city where Germany ’s live - and - let - live ethos is strongest .
Wowereit did n’t mince words in his unabashed 2001 coming out .
" I ’m gay , " he declared , " and that ’s a good thing ! "
He has also earned admirers for the way he has managed to fend off political rivals who have tried to make an issue of his homosexuality .
When his latest CDU challenger , Friedbert Pflüger , suggested Berlin deserves to have " a first lady , " Wowereit shot back that at least he was in a steady relationship , whereas Pflüger was in the midst of a divorce .
It ’s not for nothing that , after charming the capital city , Wowereit is being handled as the potential next chancellor candidate from the SPD .
Bild , of course , likely wo n’t be extending him an endorsement .
But , it wo n’t be his sexual orientation that ’s standing in the way — just the fact that he ’s a Social Democrat .
Menacing Bird at Large Raven Detained for Stalking Woman Escapes Police

Social media has become an integral part of modern society .
There are general social networks with user bases larger than the population of most countries .
There are niche sites for virtually every special interest out there .
There are sites to share photos , videos , status updates , sites for meeting new people and sites to connect with old friends .
It seems there are social solutions to just about every need .
In this article , we ’ll review the history and evolution of social media from its humble beginnings to the present day .
Precursors to Social Media
Usernets
Usenet systems were first conceived of in 1979 by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis .
Usenets let users post articles or posts ( referred to as “ news ” ) to newsgroups .
Usenets have no centralized server or dedicated administrator , setting them apart from most BBSs and forums .
Usenets are mostly responsible for the development of newsreader clients , which are the precursor to RSS feed readers so commonly used to follow blogs and news sites today .
Group sites such as Google Groups and Yahoo !
Groups use many of the conventions established by the original usenet systems .
BBSs ( Bulletin Board Systems )
The first BBSs came online in the late 70s .
Originally these were primarily hosted on personal computers and users had to dial in through the host computer ’s modem .
Only one person at a time could gain access to the BBS .
While there were legitimate BBSs , most were at least somewhat involved in illicit , illegal , or other shady practices .
Adult material , virus code , information and instructions for hacking and phreaking ( phone hacking ) , and materials like The Anarchist ’s Cookbook were commonly hosted on BBSs .
But BBSs were the first type of sites that allowed users to log on and interact with one another , albeit in a much slower fashion than we currently do .
Online Services
After BBSs came “ online services ” like CompuServe and Prodigy .
These were the first real “ corporate ” attempts at accessing the Internet .
CompuServe was the first company to incorporate a chat program into their service .
Prodigy was responsible for making online service more affordable ( CompuServe had been prohibitively expensive for many , with charges of $ 6 / hour plug long - distance fees that often made the service run $ 30 / hour or more ) .
Genie was an early online service created by a General Electric subsidiary ( GEIS ) in 1985 .
It ran through 1999 and was one of the earliest services available .
It was a text - based service , and considered the first viable commercial competition to CompuServe .
The service was created to make use of idle time - sharing mainframes after normal U.S. business hours .
GEnie offered games , shopping , mail , and forums ( called RoundTables ) .
There was even a print magazine associated with the service at one time .
AOL started as an online service too and made great strides at making the Internet more universally accessible in the U.S .
IRC , ICQ , and Instant Messaging
IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) was developed in 1988 and used for file sharing , link sharing and otherwise keeping in touch .
It was really the father of instant messaging as we know it today .
IRC was mostly UNIX - based though , limiting access to most people .
ICQ was developed in the mid-90s and was the first instant messaging program for PCs .
It was at least partly responsible for the adoption of avatars , abbreviations ( LOL , BRB ) and emoticons .
Other IM clients soon followed .
Early Social Networks
Dating Sites
Dating sites are sometimes considered the first social networks .
The first dating sites started cropping up almost as soon as people started going online .
They allowed users to create profiles ( usually with photos ) and to contact other users .
Forums
Online forums also played a large part in the evolution of the social web .
These were really descendents of the BBSs popular in the 70s and 80s , but usually came with a more user - friendly interface , making them easier for non-technical visitors to use .
Various forum platforms , including vBulletin and phpBB , were developed , many of which are still used for forums .
Forums remain a popular part of online culture , and many have made strides to add more social networking - type features ( like profiles ) .
While many people consider dating sites or sites like Classmates.com to be the first social networks , they do n’t really fit the definition .
Dating sites rarely allowed you to keep a friends list , neither did Classmates in its early years ( and profiles were severely limited ) .
The following sites were the first true social networks .
Six Degrees
Six Degrees was launched in 1997 and was the first modern social network .
It allowed users to create a profile and to become friends with other users .
While the site is no longer functional , at one time it was actually quite popular and had around a million members at its peak .
In 2000 it was purchased for $ 125 million and in 2001 it was shut down .
AsianAvenue , MiGente , BlackPlanet
These sites cropped up in the years following SixDegrees ’ launch , between 1997 and 2001 .
They allowed users to create profiles and add friends ( generally without needing approval to add people ) .
Users could create professional , personal and dating profiles on these sites .
While they were some of the earliest social networks , there were few innovations among them .
LiveJournal
LiveJournal started in 1999 and took a different approach to social networking .
While Six Degrees allowed users to create a basically - static profile , LiveJournal was a social network built around constantly - updated blogs .
LiveJournal encouraged its users to follow one another and to create groups and otherwise interact .
It was really the precursor to the live updates we see in social networks currently .
World of Warcraft / MMORPGS
MMORPGS ( Massively multiplayer online role - playing games ) have become social networks in their own right .
The most famous of these is World of Warcraft , where players interact both in the game world and on related forums and community sites .
Social interaction within the games ranges from teams set up specifically for tactical reasons within the game to friendships to romances .
MMORPGS became popular in the early 2000s , though there were other online role - playing and other games prior to that .
Major Advances in Social Networking
The early 2000s brought some huge developments in social networking and social media .
Friendster
Friendster was really the first modern , general social network .
Founded in 2002 , Friendster is still a very active social network , with over 90 million registered users and 60 + million unique visitors each month .
Most of Friendster ’s traffic comes from Asia ( 90 % of it ) .
Friendster operated by allowing people to discover their friends and then friends - of - friends , and so on to expand their networks .
Its goal was to be a safer place to meet new people than in real - life , as well as being faster .
Friendster was , in part , a new kind of dating site .
Instead of matching complete strangers based on shared interests , it operated on the assumption that people with shared friends and acquaintances would have a better chance than those who had no shared connection .
Friendster was most popular with three different groups : gay men , attendess of Burning Man and bloggers .
Hi5
Hi5 is another major social network , established in 2003 and currently boasting more than 60 million active members according to their own claims .
Profile privacy works a bit differently on Hi5 , where a user ’s network consists of not only their own contacts , but also second ( friends of friends ) and third ( friends of friends of friends ) degree contacts .
Users can set their profiles to be seen only by their network members or by Hi5 users in general .
While Hi5 is not particalarly popular in the U.S. , it has a large user base in parts of Asia , Latin America and Central Africa .
LinkedIn
LinkedIn was founded in 2003 and was one of the first mainstream social networks devoted to business .
Originally , LinkedIn allowed users to post a profile ( basically a resume ) and to interact through private messaging .
They also work on the assumption that you should personally know the people you connect with on the site .
Gradually , other features have been added , including groups , question and answer forums , and advanced profile features , including real - time updates .
MySpace
MySpace was founded in 2003 and by 2006 had grown to be the most popular social network in the world .
MySpace differentiated itself from competitors by allowing users to completely customize the look of their profiles .
Users could also post music from artists on MySpace and embed videos from other sites on their profiles .
Originally MySpace allowed communication through private messages , public comments posted to a user ’s profile , and bulletins sent out to all of your friends .
Blogs are also a big part of MySpace profiles , with each member automatically getting a blog .
In 2006 MySpace introduced MySpace IM , an instant messaging client that lets users chat with their friends .
Other recent additions to MySpace ’s functionality include the addition of real - time status updates and a news feed showing friend activity .
Facebook
While Facebook started out as a Harvard - only social network back in 2004 , it quickly expanded to other schools , then to high schools , businesses and eventually everyone ( by 2006 ) .
In 2008 Facebook became the most popular social networking site , surpassing MySpace , and continues to grow .
Facebook does n’t allow the same kind of customization that MySpace does .
Facebook does , however , allow users to post photos , videos and otherwise customize their profile content , if not the design .
Facebook has added a number of features over the past few years , including instant messaging / chat and apps ( and their developer platform ) .
Users have a few different methods of communicating with one another .
Private messaging is available as well as writing on another user ’s wall .
Wall posts are visible to that user ’s friends , but usually not to the general public .
Users can easily change their privacy settings to allow different users to see different parts of their profile , based on any existing relationships ( the basic privacy settings are “ only friends ” , “ friends of friends ” , and “ everyone ” ) .
Users can post notes that are visible to all of their friends .
Users can also comment on or , more recently , “ like ” the posts of their friends , and conversations often occur within the comment sections among multiple people .
Other Major Social Networks
Multiply , a “ family - friendly ” social network and media sharing site was established in 2004 and puts much more emphasis on security and privacy than many other networks .
Multiply users have the option to set security levels on each item they post , making things public , network - only , or invite - only .
Orkut , launched in January 2004 , is Google ’s social network , and while it ’s not particularly popular in the U.S. , it ’s very popular in Brazil and India , with more than 65 million users .
Orkut lets users share media , status updates , and communicate through IM .
Kontain , which launched in 2008 , works a bit differently than many social networks , putting the focus on usability and allowing users to follow each other through photos , videos , and music , rather than just simple status updates .
They also actively recruit businesses to sign up , promotin their service as a way to connect with customers .
Niche Social Networks
As social networking grew , niche sites began cropping up for specific interest groups .
There are now social networks for virtually every hobby , passion , interest , industry and group that you could imagine .
Ning
Ning is a platform for creating niche social networks .
Networks are hosted by Ning but can take on their own personality and can even pay to have their own branding instead of the Ning brand .
New users can either create social networks for any niche they choose or join any of more than 1.5 million existing networks .
Ning was the first widely - used social networking platform .
It ’s biggest advantage in the market was that it made it incredibly simple for even non-technical users to set up their own social network .
While most other social networking platforms required coding and programming knowledge , Ning required neither of those .
Company - Sponsored Social Networks
A number of niche social networking sites have been developed by corporations in all sorts of industries .
Authonomy is one example ; it ’s a writers ’ network hosted by the UK division of Harper Collins that has attracted thousands of hopeful writers from all over the globe , but plenty of other companies have created their own networks .
While some of these have active groups , many do not , and end up being shut down due to a lack of activity .
Media Sharing
Social media is n’t just limited to social networking sites .
Sharing photos , videos , and other multimedia content is also a popular social media activity .
Photobucket
Photobucket was the first major photo sharing site , launched in 2003 .
Photobucket allows users to share photos publically or in password - protected albums .
They allow users 500MB of storage ( lowered from 1GB in August of 2009 ) .
Pro accounts get 10 GB of storage ( lowered from 100 GB to 25 GB in July of ’08 and then to 10 GB in August of ’ 09 ) .
Photobucket also hosts video content .
In 2007 , Photobucket was purchased by Fox Interactive Media ( a News Corporation subsidiary ) .
It was rumored to have sold for as much as $ 250 million , though terms of the sale were never disclosed .
Flickr
Flickr has become a social network in its own right in recent years .
They claim to host more than 3.6 billion images as of June 2009 .
Flickr also has groups , photo pools , and allows users to create profiles , add friends , and organize images and video into photo sets / albums .
One of Flickr ’s major advantages is that they allow users to license their photos through Creative Commons , as well as retaining all copyrights .
Flickr has also recently launched a collection called “ The Commons ” , which features archived photos and images from a variety of museums and other institutions under a “ no known restrictions ” license ( basically meaning the photos are believed to be in the public domain ) .
YouTube
YouTube was the first major video hosting and sharing site , launched in 2005 .
Users can upload videos up to 10 minutes long and share them through YouTube or by embedding them on other websites ( social networks , blogs , forums , etc. ) .
YouTube now allows users to upload HD videos and recently launched a service to provide TV shows and movies under license from their copyright holders .
YouTube ’s major social features include ratings , comments , and the option to subscribe to the channels of a user ’s favorite video creators .
Revver
Revver took a slightly different approach to video hosting and sharing .
While YouTube , Metacafe , and most other video sharing sites let you post videos for free and did n’t pay content creators for any advertising revenues their videos generated , Revver has been sharing revenue from the start .
Revver splits the revenue generated by a video 50/50 with that video ’s creator .
Some other video sharing and hosting sites are moving in the direction of revenue sharing , but Revver still remains the primary one that does it with all content on the site .
Social News and Bookmarking
Sharing photos and videos was n’t is n’t the only kind of information sharing happening with social media .
The advent of social news and bookmarking sites in the mid-2000 ’s brought about a whole new way of see what ’s going on in the world and discovering interesting content .
News became more widely available thanks to sites like Delicious , Digg , and Reddit , who allowed users to share any news or other content they found interesting with a much wider audience than they might have otherwise had .
Delicious
Delicious ( aka , Del.icio.us ) is a social bookmarking site founded in 2003 .
It allows its users to bookmark any content they find online , tag that content , and then share it with other users .
Users can search for bookmarks or browse for them via tags .
Delicious also allows users to view the most popular content among other users , as well as up - and - coming content , not unlike most social news sites .
Digg
Digg was founded in 2004 by Kevin Rose , Ron Gorodetzky , Jay Adelson , and Owen Byrne .
Digg users can share links to anything online and other users can vote that content up ( “ dig ” ) or down ( “ bury ” ) .
Users can also comment on content posted by others and keep a friends list .
Digg has undergone a lot of controversy in its day , including criticism about the power the top 100 Digg users have over what becomes popular on the site .
The “ Digg Effect ” — when content makes it to the front page , thereby sending a huge influx of traffic to that site , often overloading its servers — is also well - known and often frustrating to those unprepared for the sudden popularity .
Reddit
Reddit is another social news site founded in 2005 .
Reddit operates in a similar fashion to Digg , allowing users to vote content up or down .
Users can view popular items , new items , and “ controversial ” items ( presumably those items that have received a lot of both up and down votes ) .
Reddit , like Digg , also allows users to comment on posted items .
Real Time Updates
Real - time updates have become the new norm in social media .
With the advent of Twitter in 2006 , status updates have become the new norm in social networking .
Virtually all major social networks now allow real - time updates .
Twitter
Twitter was founded in 2006 and gained a lot of popularity during the 2007 SxSW ( South by Southwest ) conference .
Tweets trippled during the conference , from 20 k per day to 60 k .
Twitter has developed a cult - like following and has a number of famous users ( Ashton Kutcher , Demi Moore , Soleil Moon Frye , MC Hammer , Oprah , Martha Stewart , and many , many more ) .
Twitter has also spawned a number of third - party sites and apps , turning it into more of a platform than a single service .
There are Twitter clients for updating and managing followers ; services that track Twitter trends ; and services for posting photos and videos directly to Twitter .
Posterous
Posterous is the newest major microblogging application , started by Y Combinator in May 2009 .
Users post content via email .
Emails can include attached photos , MP3s and other file types that are also posted .
No initial signup is needed , setting it apart from most other social media services .
Tumblr
Tumblr is sort of a cross between a lifestreaming application and a microblogging platform .
Tumblr was founded in 2007 and had around 75,000 tumblebloggers switch to the service immediately .
The site lets users post photos , video , text , audio , links , conversations , and other content on blog - like sites .
There are mobile applications available for posting to Tumblr , making it ideal for lifestreaming .
Tumblr is also very easy to use , making it well - suited to less technical users .
It ’s similar to Twitter and other microblogging platforms in the way that it lets you follow other Tumblr users and see their updates in a specialized dashboard feed .
Users can also “ heart ” ( favorite ) other Tumblr users ’ content and reblog posts from other users , keeping the original credit intact .
Other Services Adopt Real - Time Updates
As mentioned before , virtually every social networking site now allows for status updates .
Facebook has incorporated status updates into their interface for years .
MySpace adopted the practice more than a year ago .
And most recently , LinkedIn has started to allow users to update their status .
Real - time updates allow users to stay connected to their friends and family on a constant basis and often improve relationships between people .
When you constantly know what ’s going on with friends and family , it ’s easier to discover shared interests , activities , and other information that might never have come out in real - life conversations .
This can lead to stronger relationships offline .
The iPhone ’s Role in Real - Time Updates
The iPhone can be largely credited for the rise in popularity of real - time updates .
Prior to the iPhone ’s launch , mobile browsers were clunky at best , and virtually unusable at worst .
But the iPhone made it easy and even fun to browse the web from a mobile device .
Add apps for virtually every social network to the mix and it became possible for users to update anytime , from anywhere .
Other phones have followed suit and there are now mutliple devices available that let users easily update their status on the go ( including posting photos and video updates ) .
The iPhone has taken such a huge role in social media that there are now social networks only available on the iPhone .
iRovr is a social networking app specifically for the iPhone / iPod Touch .
It allows users to post photos , updates , links ( including to YouTube videos ) , create polls , subscribe to RSS feeds and more .
It was launched in 2007 and is still going strong two years later .
Lifestreaming and Lifecasting
Real - time updates have led to an increase in the number of people who are now lifecasting or lifestreaming virtually everything they do .
While some opt to lifestream by aggregating their online activities in a single place ( such as with FriendFeed ) .
Ustream.tv
Ustream was founded in the summer of 2006 and has become the streaming video host of choice for celebrities like Ashton Kutcher and Soleil Moon Frye .
While most Ustream users only go live occasionally , there are channels that are live around the clock ( mostly security cameras , animal cameras , traffic cameras , and other stationary feeds ) .
Ustream allows viewers to post comments and ask questions directly to the feed host during live broadcasts , and this interactivity often engages users to a greater extent than other video sites where videos are posted after they ’ve been filmed instead of being streamed live .
Justin.tv
Justin.tv is a streaming video host founded in October 2006 that lets lifecasters and live show creators to broadcast to hundreds or thousands of Internet users .
iJustine is probably Justin.tv ’s most public user , lifecasting practically her entire life on the site at one time ( she appears to be lifecasting a bit less recently , though she ’s still very active on the site ) .
There are more than 400,000 channels on Justin.tv , and they get more than 41 million unique visitors each month .
FriendFeed
FriendFeed , which launched in 2007 and was recently purchased by Facebook , allows you to integrate most of your online activities in one place ( Twitter , RSS feeds , and Flickr , among others ) .
It ’s also a social network in its own right , with the ability to create friends lists , post updates , and otherwise communicate .
Other Lifestreaming Sites
There are a number of other lifestreaming sites out there that people are using .
Most can be integrated into your blog or website to show your visitors all of your activities around the web .
There are even some dedicated blog plugins for lifestreaming .
WP Lifestream is one such plugin , specifically for WordPress .
It lets you integrate your profiles from Facebook , Flickr , Last.fm and Wordie right out of the box , and you can add additional modules for integrating more feeds .
Profilactic.com is another lifestreaming application that lets you integrate feeds from 190 different websites , including Blippr , Delicious , Digg , deviantART , Dopplr , Facebook , Flickr , Last.fm , LiveJournal , MySpace , Pandora , Revver , StumbleUpon , Twitter , Tumblr , and more .
Sweetcron is a similar app , though it ’s opensource and you host it on your own servers .
Social Everything
It seems that nowadays there are social and user - generated sites for just about every activity you can imagine .
There are social shopping sites .
Social financial planning sites .
Sites for getting book , movie , app , and other reviews .
Sites to share your goals and meet like - minded people .
Sites to plan your travels and share them with others .
And sites to help you make decisions on just about anything .
Social media has become a huge part of the lives of millions of people worldwide .
Whether it ’s something as simple as looking up reviews of movies from real , live people ( instead of professional movie reviewers ) or getting advice on major life decisions , there are social sites out there to provide you with the information you seek .
Even on general - purpose social networks and social media sites like Twitter there are thousands of ways to get input on just about anything .
Instead of using Google the next time you have a question about something , try asking on Twitter .
A lot of the time you get better information from the crowd there in less time than pouring over pages of search results .
Social Media Concerns and Criticism
As social media has grown in popularity and become mainstream , it has been faced with growing controversy and criticism .
The main criticisms seem to fall along a few lines : Social media can be used by stalkers ; Social media can be used by child predators ; and , Social media sites open up privacy and security concerns .
While there is only so much social media sites can do about the first two , there is a growing trend among many sites to bolster the privacy policies and make users feel more secure .
Social Media Used by Stalkers
Facebook and other social media sites have come under attack for making it easier for stalkers to track their victims or even to find new ones .
This kind of accusation is not entirely unfounded .
Many social media users do n’t take advantage of privacy settings and leave their entire profiles public .
While this is often a good idea for professional profiles where you want to make connections with people you do n’t necessarily know , personal profiles can benefit from hiding some information from public display .
Social networks make these privacy settings available to users to help prevent stalkers and predators from being able to see their updates .
But they ca n’t force users to use them , so in the end much of the responsibility falls to the individual users , not the networks themselves .
Social Media Used by Child Predators
MySpace is the most publically attacked social networks accused of being a haven for child molesters and pornographers , but the site , and other social networks , have made great strides in protecting the identities and information of minors using their sites .
Again , this is one of those situations where much of the problem came from users not making their profiles private .
MySpace took a major step to prevent predators from friending underage teens by requiring friend requesters to know the email address or another personal identifier in order to send a friend request to a minor .
They also require the profiles of teens under the age of 16 to be private , not allowing non-friend users to view them .
Other sites have taken similar steps .
Privacy Concerns
Facebook recently came under attack for changes to its privacy policy that were worded ambiguously enough to effectively grant rights to Facebook to use any of your content , private or public , for their own purposes ( such as advertising ) even after you ’d delected your profile .
While the company maintains that was never their intent and it was simply unfortunate wording , the backlash was severe enough that Facebook changed their privacy policy back to its previous version and then solicited user input for revisions .
It was a harsh lesson in how concerned many users are about the information they provide online .
When you consider that many people post information about all aspects of their lives online , mostly on social media sites , it ’s no wonder many are concerned about what companies can do with that information .
Social networks and other sites have to rapidly respond to user concerns over privacy and security .
With the information in an average social media profile , it would not be inconceivable for a hacker to illegally gain enough information about a person to steal their identity or otherwise cause problems .
Security concerns have also cropped up as average people have found their profiles hacked and embarrassing information posted about them .
While this type of thing was once relatively confined to celebrities and well - known people ( or people who had a personal vendetta against them ) , it has become more widespread and it ’s not unheard of for regular people to be targeted ( such as this woman on Facebook recently ) .
The Role of Social Media in Pop Culture
Social media has , in the past year or two , become a mainstream online activity .
In 2007 , social media activities overtook pornography as the most popular online activity in the U.S. ( the two industries continue to battle it out , alternately gaining or losing ground on a monthly basis ) .
Celebrities now use Twitter , Facebook , and other social networks on a regular basis .
And it ’s not just their publicists — stars are updating their status themselves and interacting with fans on a daily basis .
It ’s not uncommon to see Twitter - inspired t- shirts , and there has been at least one “ fail - whale ” tattoo ( I ’m sure there are more out there ) .
When Twitter and Facebook both suffered a DDOS attack in early August ’ 09 , there was a real sense of loss among many users until the sites were back up .
Social media has become an integral part of how people communicate , stay in touch , keep on top of new developments , and otherwise connect with the world around them .
The Evolution of Social Media
Social media has come a long way since the days of BBSs and IRC chats .
And social media continues to evolve on a daily basis .
With major social networks and social media sites making changes and improvements on an almost daily basis , it ’s sure to keep evolving in coming years .
The one thing we can be pretty sure of at this point is that social media is not just a phase , and likely wo n’t go away any time soon … at least until something better comes along .

The CRTC has denied an appeal from a group of internet providers to force Bell Canada to stop its internet traffic management , otherwise known as throttling .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission on Thursday threw out a " review and vary " request from the Canadian Association of Internet Providers , a group of smaller companies that rents portions of Bell 's network , on a decision the regulator made last year .
In its previous decision , the CRTC found that Bell was within its right to extend the throttling — which it applies to customers using peer - to - peer software — to its wholesale companies .
Bell said it needed to throttle because peer - to - peer traffic was causing congestion on its network .
The smaller ISPs appealed to the CRTC and said Bell had not proven that congestion .
The CRTC 's decision on Thursday reaffirmed its earlier order .
" The commission determines that the applications by CAIP et al. … do not raise substantial doubt about the correctness of the determination in [ last year 's decision ] , " it said .
" The commission also determines that the applications do not raise substantial doubt about the correctness of [ the previous decision ] with respect to the completeness of the record used to make that decision or to the fettering of the commission 's discretion . "
By Scott Lincicome
The world is moving on without the United States .
Our trading partners have decided that they can no longer wait for the White House to emerge from its self - induced ObamaCare coma .
They are moving on , and both the United States and the global economy are worse off for it .
It 's no longer a secret that , after charting an aggressive trade liberalization plan last spring , the Obama administration has since eliminated all tangible support for free trade in a wrongheaded attempt to ensure support for health care " reform " and climate change legislation .
Indeed , administration officials have openly admitted that they 've shelved the Mexican trucking dispute and pending FTAs until these domestic priorities are achieved .
Other issues , such as a Doha negotiating mandate , Buy American and Section 421 , have been similarly sacrificed on the mantle of domestic politics .
The effects of the White House 's political strategy are being felt on both the multilateral and bilateral levels .
On the multilateral front , I 've already documented the blowback : first , the EU and Brazil have openly fretted about the United States ' failure to establish firm negotiating positions in the WTO 's Doha Round , and they implored us to get in the game or else they'd be forced to move the process along without American input ; second , our trading partners essentially blew off very public US demands on " sectoral " tariff elimination agreements and services liberalization .
As I said the other day , we 're quickly becoming a " WTO backbencher . "
On the bilateral front , our failure to ratify pending FTAs with Colombia , South Korea and Panama is producing equally distressing results .
I freely admit that I 'm not a huge fan of bilateral FTAs and strongly prefer unilateral or multilateral liberalization , but I also understand that politics and a comatose Doha round often make bilateral FTAs the only option for significant market opening .
So the fact that our trading partners are completing such deals right and left while we sit on agreements that were signed years ago is a problem .
Consider just a few examples :
* On October 15 , South Korea completed a massive ( ~$ 28 billion ) FTA with the EU that should enter into force in late 2010 .
The agreement , which will seriously disadvantage US businesses in the Korean and European markets vis a vis their European / Korean competitors , actually used the Korea - US FTA ( KORUS ) as a template to speed completion of the complex negotiations .
Moreover , the EU showed real backbone by completing the agreement despite significant resistance from its domestic automakers - the exact same type of resistance that has stopped feckless American politicians from considering and passing KORUS .
Indeed , KORUS is actually stronger on autos than the EU agreement , because it contains a " snapback " provision that would re-establish US tariffs on Korean automobiles in the case of a dispute over the agreement .
The EU agreement has no such provision .
So even though the United States completed KORUS more than two years ( June 30 , 2007 ) before the EU - Korea deal , it is very likely that the latter will enter into force long before the former .
And American exporters will pay the price .
Embarrassing .
* South Korea is also negotiating bilateral FTAs with Canada , Mexico , India , New Zealand , China , Colombia , Peru , the Gulf Cooperation Council , and Japan ; and Seoul is exploring deals with Mercosur , Malaysia , Turkey , and possibly Israel .
All the while , the completed KORUS agreement collects dust .
* Panama and Colombia are following in the Koreans ' footsteps , albeit on a smaller scale .
On August 11 , 2009 , Panama and Canada completed FTA negotiations , and Panama announced recently that it has begun bilateral negotiations with the EU and several Caribbean nations .
( A Chile - Panama FTA is already in force . )
Since the US - Colombia FTA was signed in November 2006 , the Colombians have completed bilateral trade agreements with Canada , the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) , and the " Northern Triangle countries " ( El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras ) .
These bilateral examples closely parallel the aforementioned multilateral problems and make clear that US trading partners are not sitting on their hands while the White House plays political footsie with their economic futures .
Optimistic free traders like AEI 's Claude Barfield hope that other nations ' bilateral moves will push the United States to get its free trade act together in order to avoid harming our ability to compete in key markets .
One can only hope , although I 'm not so sure that anything will change until the domestic political dynamic shifts significantly - whether that 's through the passage or failure of ObamaCare and cap - and - trade or a GOP rout in the 2010 elections .
However , if Barfield and others are right and the extracurricular activities of Korea , Colombia and Panama ( most notably implementation of EU - Korea FTA ) force the White House to advance the pending FTAs regardless of domestic politics , the irony will be as thick as it is depressing .
The United States initiated these ( and other ) trade agreements pursuant to " competitive liberalization , " under which we entered into bilateral / regional FTA negotiations with several countries in order to get them to compete for access to the US market and thus offer greater concessions at a faster pace .
Supporters ( like former USTR Robert Zoellick ) also claimed that competitive liberalization would motivate WTO Members to complete the Doha Round , as the US FTAs would provide preferential access to only a select few nations .
If the United States is forced to pass FTAs with Colombia , Korea and Panama in order to keep pace in their markets , America will have become the target of competitive liberalization , rather than its champion .
Should this " bizarro competitive liberalization " come to pass , I think it would be safe at that point to officially conclude that that the United States no longer leads on free trade but instead is forced to pursue it as a last resort .
And that would be a shame .

A horror story that takes place in the Japan countryside , which includes a visit from an unexpected ghostly guest : a yuurei ( 幽霊 ) .
These Japanese ghosts are known for having unfinished business when haunting in the earthly plane .
I had been living in the Japan countryside for nearly three months .
Instead of staying in a traditional apartment , I was able to rent a small home in an area where neighbors were scattered somewhat far apart .
Each night I slept very well , but one night I had an unexpected presence visit me .
I could sense him at the foot of my bed .
A Yuurei ; a human ghost walking the Earth had entered my home .
I used to be afraid of ghosts , but there was something about Japan that made spirits almost seem second nature to me .
The Yuurei spoke to me in Japanese .
“ What would you wish of me ? ”
I paused for a moment , remembering that wishes from the spirit world are never what they are cracked up to be , so I instead responded , “ May I serve you a cup of tea ? ”
After a brief moment of silence , the Yuurei began to walk out of my room and I followed him into the kitchen area where there were three chairs and a table .
I turned toward the Yuurei as I entered the kitchen .
“ Since it is rather late in the evening , I will serve you Houjicha . ” I then began preparing the hot water on the stove .
Houjicha is a very light baked tea leaf that has minimal caffeine and is a popular tea for the evening .
I hoped it would be acceptable to the Yuurei guest .
I could feel the Yuurei watching me make the tea as he sat in the chair farthest from the kitchen , closer to the bedroom .
I brought my small green tea set out , filled it with the now piping hot boiled water and added the tea leaves .
I set the tea on the table and began to serve my ghostly guest .
The Yuurei politely took the tea and began to drink .
“ What would you wish of me ? ” he began again .
I thought for a moment and decided it would be better for me to treat the Yuurei as a guest and play the part of the gracious hostess , rather than truly answer what my wish would be .
“ You are guest in my house .
I could not make a wish from a guest in my house .
What would you wish of me as my guest ? ”
The Yuurei paused for a short moment and then asked me , “ Will you come with me to the forest ? ” I was taken aback by the question , and finally my fear began to kick in .
I was fearful what would await me on the way to the forest or even in the forest itself .
Still being the polite hostess , I answered him .
“ Well , you see , it is late now .
I would have no protection against the things that wander in the night .
I am afraid that the outside night can be a little scary for me alone . ”
This somehow seemed to make the Yuurei sit upright , as though he were surprised .
He then smiled at me and said , “ Well then , in gratitude to my hostess , I will grant you that wish .
You will have protection in the night from this night forward . ”
A little frightened and worried since I did not intend that to come across as a wish ; I thanked the Yuurei for his thoughtfulness , but insisted he did not need to be so generous since he was a guest .
What he said next though , truly caught my curiosity .
“ There are children of the wilderness that I know well .
They will always watch after you , in the night or in the day .
They can sense when you need them .
This is not my gift to you , but their gift to you .
I am as a father to them . ”
My curiosity overcame my fear and after finishing our tea , I grabbed my coat and accompanied the Yuurei outside .
We walked a short ways and suddenly I felt a shiver of cold overwhelm me .
The fear tingled all the way through my spine and made me want to run back to the house as quickly as possible .
Suddenly , I was approached by a fox - like animal that was a little taller than my knees .
Surprised by being approached for the first time by a wild animal of this size , I stopped for a moment .
The fox seemed unafraid of me and looked right into my eyes .
I turned toward the Yuurei and he slightly bowed his head at me , as though telling me the fox was his gift .
I continued to walk and the fox walked alongside me .
We were nearing the forest and I began to fear again what awaited me within the shadows of the trees .
In that moment , two tanuki that looked like raccoons approached me .
I began to realize these must be the children of the wilderness of which the Yuurei spoke .
I felt less alone with the tanuki and fox on either side of me and continued into the forest .
It was pitch black as I entered .
It was like walking into a dense fog or mist without seeing anything in front of me .
Anyone with instincts would think to turn away from darkness like this , but somehow I felt safe and unafraid .
There was a small glowing object deep into the forest .
The Yuurei was clearly walking towards it .
The animals clamored next to my legs , stopping me from walking for a moment .
I could not tell why until I took another step and noticed the ground was much lower and I would have tripped and fallen .
Walking at pace with the Yuurei , the glowing object became larger as I approached it .
Finally I reached it and could see that it was a small shrine with fireflies floating around it .
Atop the shrine was a small , chipped tea cup similar to the ones I had just served at my table .
The Yuurei turned towards me .
“ Do you remember when you came here ? ” the Yuurei asked .
“ I have not been here before . ” I answered in a low voice almost speaking to myself .
“ You came here once before and offered me tea , yet you did not make a wish .
I would like to hear your wish . ”
Unsure how a teacup similar to mine made it all the way out into the forest , I decided to inspect it .
I picked up the teacup and suddenly felt a chill down my spine .
I could see that the teacup perfectly matched the ones in my set , yet I was sure I was not missing any cups .
“ I do n’t understand how this got here .
I do n’t even remember leaving it here . ”
I continued to inspect the teacup .
“ When did this get here ? ”
“ You brought it to me when you were alive , but I was unable to ask your wish before your death . ”
The air escaped my body just as the teacup crashed against the shrine after my hands lost their grip .
I stared into the Yuurei ’s face in utter disbelief and raced back to the house .
Shaking and frightened at the impossible idea of my being a ghost , I raced inside the house only to find myself lying on the kitchen floor with the tea leaves and cold water scattered on the ground .

From his Oct 10 column :
The truth is that the falling dollar is good news .
For one thing , it ’s mainly the result of rising confidence : the dollar rose at the height of the financial crisis as panicked investors sought safe haven in America , and it ’s falling again now that the fear is subsiding .
The dollar is falling because of reckless economic policies like those Krugman advocates .
Yet he actually thinks it ’s falling because of confidence ?
It ’s the exact opposite .
Foreign banks are dumping dollars because they have no confidence in us .
They ’re switching to Euros , gold , and other currencies .
New foreign reserves were 63 % dollars in 1999 .
Today that number has fallen to 37 % ( see bottom ) .
We are losing our status as the world ’s reserve , and it is most certainly not a good thing .
Having the dollar as the world ’s reserve brings extraordinary benefits .
And we ’re giving them all up , just to save bankers butts ’ and attempt to stimulate our way to prosperity .
Consider this Bloomberg article : Dollar Reaches Breaking Point As Banks Shift Reserve .
Unless we change course immediately , the dollar will keep falling .
Krugman does n’t get it .
He continues to advocate horrible fiscal policy .
Excerpt from Bloomberg piece :
and now for something completely ridiculous
If you 've ever entertained the thought of going to a homeopathic doctor , just consider the asinine things they 're taught before making your decision .
I know that by now the video in which optometrist Charlene Werner does such awful things to equations used by physicists , these poor formulas would need to use puppets to explain what happened to them in court , has been briefly covered by PZ Myers and in plenty of detail by Orac .
However , this is a video that may well have broken my brain if not for my built - up tolerance to the kind of sheer , unadulterated stupid it contains , so it took me a while to properly reply to the kinds of unholy things Werner did to physics .
In the interests of saving your brain cells , I ’m only linking to this terrifying video rather than embedding it on this blog .
You ’re welcome .
Probably one of the most amusing things about Dr. Werner ( and I use the term “ amusing ” very loosely ) , is her method of lecturing .
Almost everything she says ends up with a question mark , even the answers to her own questions .
And those questions boldly plunge into inanity almost immediately with this quote …
You know that when light is energy , right ?
Ok .
And [ Einstein ] gave us the theory that energy equals mass times the speed of light .
E equals mc squared .
Ok .
So if we take that formula , and we think that there ’s a lot of mass , right ?
On a technicality , I ’m going to give her grammatically mangled statement about light a pass .
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and it does carry energy .
However , when it comes to mass - energy equivalence , the theory is n’t just the formula and it says nothing about how much mass there is in any specific object .
Instead , Einstein ’s paper said that mass and energy were essentially interchangeable and when you take away some of the object ’s stored energy , you ’re taking away its mass and vice versa .
It ’s basically an elaboration of mass and energy conservation laws .
But Dr. Werner obviously thinks it means something completely different .
Well , the whole universal mass can be consolidated down into the size of a bowling ball .
That ’s all there is in the whole universe .
Okay .
Good luck with cramming 3 × 1055 grams of the visible universe stretching across 14 billion light years into the size of a bowling ball .
Really .
She ’s going to need it .
But just to see how that ’s likely to go for her , we ’ll do a little back of the envelope math here to figure out what will happen if we squeeze the 25 billion galaxies in this estimate to the density of the core of a neutron star , about as densely as you could compress matter until you overcome the degeneracy pressure and create a black hole .
volume of the hyper- dense universe : 3 × 1055 g / 8 × 1020 g/m3 = 3.75 × 1034 m3
its radius : r = √( 3.75 × 1034 m3 / 4/3π ) = √( 8.95 × 1033 ) = 9.46 × 1016 cm = 9.46 × 1010 km
Wow !
We ’re dealing with a 117.6 billion mile wide bowling ball .
To put that in perspective , we ’re talking about a sphere that would reach deep into the Inner Oort Cloud , more than 600 times farther away from the Sun than we are .
And considering that a regulation bowling ball has a maximum diameter of 8.59 inches , we see that Dr. Warner is off by oh… roughly a factor of 867 trillion .
As far as degrees of wrong go , I ’m pretty sure this may be some sort of a record .
Or at least an honorable mention .
But hold on folks , we ’re not done yet .
So if you take that formula , e=mc2 , you can almost cross out mass .
So the formula ends up being energy = the speed of light .
Err… what in the hell ?
You ca n’t “ pretty much cross out mass ” because that would pretty much violate the laws of physics .
Einstein did n’t just throw an equal sign into his equations because he thought it looked cool or he had an equal sign fetish of some kind .
If you cross out mass , you also cross out energy .
That ’s what the word equivalence in “ mass - energy equivalence ” means !
And as for losing an exponent , I ’m willing to grant that she misspoke , but then again , it ’s sort of like excusing someone who just stabbed you in the stomach for having garlic breath .
And in case you were wondering , yes , the stream of blather from Werner gets even worse and to properly correct all her ridiculous assertions would take an entire chapter of a book .
So Instead , I ’m just going to skip ahead to her big thesis ( again , please keep in mind that the word usage is very generous on my part ) , which she spends half of her attempt at a lecture obfuscating .
So the whole body has an infinitesimal amount of mass , but what is the remainder ?
Energy .
So , I am energy ; you are energy . [… ]
So what happens now when that energy is released ?
It destroys something .
It changes its energetic state .
Well , that ’s what we can do with homeopathy .
We take substances and we put them in solution and we succuss it just like a bomb , we throw the bomb to release its energy into this liquid .
And then we take these little white pellets , we sprinkle them with that solution , and guess what we just made ?
An energetic substance to be used when we choose to use it .
Like the classic meanderings of Deepak Chopra , this is just random noise arranged in words and mimicking the sounds of the English language .
It ’s meaningless , useless technobabble that goes well beyond being not even wrong .
But lets pretend for a minute that after suffering repeated impacts into a brick wall , I decided that she ’s right and my body is almost all energy , all 166 lbs or 75 kg of it , and use her favorite equation to see just how much power that is .
e = mc2 = 75 kg × 299,792,4582 m/sec = 75 kg × 8.99 × 1016 = 6.74 × 1018 J or 6.74 EJ
So if my body was pretty much just energy , I would put out 6.74 exajoules , which is roughly equivalent to a 1.6 gigaton blast .
Compared to my body ’s output , even the biggest nuclear bombs would be firecrackers and the effect I would have on the planet would be best compared to the impact of a meteor as big as a skyscraper .
If humans were mostly energy as Werner claims , we would ’ve vaporized the planet many , many times over .
And when she compares homeopathic medicine to a bomb , a light bulb should go off somewhere in the ether of her empty head and give her the wild and crazy idea of actually using the equation she verbally violates like it ’s going out of style , plug in some numbers and see what happens like I ’ve done here .
Physics is like the iPhone of science .
If you want to see whether your idea will work , there ’s a formula for that .
The funny thing is that Dr. Werner is introduced as being the the right person to give a “ homeopathic lecture . ”
If you happen recall the post of mine featuring Mitchell and Webb ’s parody of homeopathy , you may be aware of what a homeopathic lager is .
And it seems that Werner accomplished a similar feat to turning tap water into beer with a few drops .
Her eight minute desecration of a century worth of basic dynamics and cosmology will give her infamy in the science blogosphere for years to come .
A tiny dose of intensely concentrated inanity has spread her message across the world .
Though the world ’s reaction may not be what she hoped for …
Renault have been given a two - year suspended ban from Formula 1 for their role in fixing last year 's Singapore Grand Prix .
The team were called before governing body the FIA to answer charges they had asked driver Nelson Piquet Jr to crash to help team - mate Fernando Alonso win .
Former team boss Flavio Briatore has been banned from FIA - sanctioned events for an unlimited period .
Ex-engineering director Pat Symonds has also been excluded for five years .
Briatore and Symonds parted company with Renault last week at the same time as the French car giant said they would not contest the charges .
The FIA agreed not to pursue action against Piquet in return for his role in uncovering the details of the scandal .
We apologise unreservedly to the F1 community in relation to this unacceptable behaviour
Renault team statement Alonso , who attended the hearing in Paris , was also cleared of any involvement in the race - fixing scheme and the FIA thanked him for " cooperating with enquiries " .
The World Motor Sport Council ruled that Renault was guilty of breaking its sporting code , finding ; " breaches relating to the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to be of unparalleled severity .
" They not only compromised the integrity of the sport but also endangered the lives of spectators , officials , other competitors and Nelson Piquet Jr. himself .
" The WMSC considers that offences of this severity merit permanent disqualification from the FIA Formula One World Championship .

" However , in particular the steps taken by Renault F1 to identify and address the failings within its team and condemn the actions of the individuals involved , the WMSC has decided to suspend Renault F1 's disqualification until the end of the 2011 season . "
FIA president Max Mosley said : " The penalty for Renault is disqualification , but suspended for two years , which means if they do n't do something silly in the next two years , they do n't have any problems . "
He added : " The blame has been placed where it should be placed and it's the right decision .
" The penalty that we 've imposed is the harshest one we can but because Renault have demonstrated that they have no moral responsibility for what took place , it would be wrong in the circumstances to impose an immediate penalty . "

Piquet clearly regrets what he did , it 's just a shame he did not see things as clearly at the time
The hearing was an attempt to attribute responsibility for the Singapore scandal despite the departure of Briatore and Symonds .
Renault explained that its internal investigation found that Briatore , Symonds and Piquet Jr had conspired to cause the crash with no other team member involved .
After conducting its own investigation , the FIA agreed with Renault 's findings and decided to hand the French team a more lenient suspended sentence .
Renault , who will pay the cost of the FIA investigation , as well as contributing to its safety - related projects , said it accepted the council 's decision .

" We are very sad to find ourselves in front of the World Motor Sport Council , " a team statement said .
" We apologise unreservedly to the F1 community in relation to this unacceptable behaviour .
" We sincerely hope that we can soon put this matter behind us and focus constructively on the future .
We will issue further information in the next few days . "
The FIA imposed further sanctions on Briatore , who ended his nine - year reign as Renault team principal last week in the wake of the scandal .
The Italian has been banned indefinitely from attending any FIA events .
A route back into F1 was made more difficult for Briatore as the FIA declared it would not grant a licence to any team he was involved with or renew an F1 Superlicence granted to any driver associated with him .
Renault 's double world champion Alonso and Red Bull 's Mark Webber are both managed by Briatore while McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen also has ties with the Italian .

Symonds was banned from all FIA events for five years but the FIA noted his communication to the hearing " that it was to his ' eternal regret and shame ' that he had participated in the conspiracy " .
The fateful conspiracy was brought to light by Piquet after he was sacked by Renault following July 's Hungarian GP .
The 24 - year - old Brazilian said after the hearing : " I bitterly regret my actions to follow the orders I was given .
I wish every day that I had not done it . "
During last year 's Singapore night race Piquet crashed on lap 14 , two laps after Alonso had stopped for fuel and tyres , and a safety car was deployed to control the field while the debris from the accident was removed from the track .
Having already pitted in the race , the timing of the safety car - necessary while Piquet 's wrecked car was removed from the track - was critical to Alonso 's victory in Singapore .
It meant that when the safety car came out , he was alone among the front - runners in not having to stop for fuel and tyres and it promoted him into a position from which he was able to win .
The FIA 's ruling on the race - fixing behind the Spaniard 's victory has been reached in the same week that Formula 1 returns to Singapore for this season 's race , with first practice at 1100 BST on Friday , 25 September .

While the majority of the Renault team flew out to Singapore over the weekend , the long - term future of the French team remains in doubt .
The team 's main sponsor , Dutch bank ING , had already decided to withdraw its support at the end of the season while Renault itself reported losses as a result of falling car sales in the first half of the year .
Two major car manufacturers have pulled out of F1 in the last nine months , with Honda quitting last December and BMW announcing in July they would stop at the end of the year .
There have long been rumours that both Renault and Toyota , who have said it will not sign off its 2010 F1 budget until November , could follow them out of the sport .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
If Renault and Toyota pulled out , the only two car companies left in F1 would be Mercedes and Fiat through its Ferrari brand .
As the car companies supply engines to the entire grid this year , that could be a major problem , notwithstanding the return of privateer engine company Cosworth next season as supplier to the new teams Lotus , US F1 , Campos and Manor .
" Formula 1 ca n't afford another major manufacturer with such a proud history to walk away , " said the BBC's James Munro in Paris .
" So some may accuse the FIA of that having influenced their decision . "

Clayton Weatherston 's lack of remorse for the shocking murder of his ex-girlfriend was reflected in the judge 's comments at his sentencing today , Women 's Refuge says .
Clayton Weatherston has been jailed for 18 years minimum non-parole in prison for Sophie Elliott 's murder on January 9 last year .
The sentence equates to one month for each of the 216 wounds he inflicted on the Dunedin woman .
Sentencing him at the High Court in Christchurch , Justice Judith Potter said Weatherston 's crime had an impact on the whole of the New Zealand community .
" Sophie Elliott 's death was a tragedy in every sense of the word , " she said .
She noted medical evidence that excess medication taken by Weatherston would have played a part , leading to decreased sleep and irritability .
There was no evidence of major mental illness .
She seriously doubted that his personality disorder contributed to diminished intellectual capacity at the time of the offending , but it may have contributed to a diminished understanding of the crime .
National Collective of Independent Women 's Refuges chief executive Heather Henare said Justice Potter 's comments sent a message that violence was unacceptable and inexcusable .
" In this trial , we saw the defendant on the stand and we all saw , as the jury did , that he felt justified in his actions and sought to blame his victim , " Ms Henare said .
" No sentence could ever return Sophie Elliott to her family , but we do we feel the judge 's statements go some way towards acknowledging their loss . "
Ms Henare said Justice Potter 's dismissal of Weatherston 's defence argument on the grounds of his mental condition was particularly heartening .
" Weatherston 's tactics and refusal to take responsibility for his actions were not unusual , but were a classic example of the justifications used by perpetrators of violence every day , " she said .
" Of course , this was a particularly horrific killing , but what was really unusual about this case was that Clayton Weatherston took the stand .
The jury , and indeed the whole country , witnessed his self - righteous lack of remorse . "
Ms Henare said on average , 14 women were killed every year at the hands of their partners , or ex-partners .
" We can not let this go on .
It is time to really invest in change .
New Zealand just cannot afford the social and economic cost of domestic violence any more , " she said .
" As a country , we must recognise the urgency of this issue and strive for the elimination of violence towards our women , our children and our families . "
NO SENTENCE ENOUGH
No sentence for the murderer of Sophie Elliott will ever be enough , friends and family say .
Sophie 's father Gil said the verdict was realistic , but could never be enough to compensate for their loss .
" I would n't have minded more , it should have been more , '' he said .
" It could have been 25 years , but 18 is better than 12 . ''
A close friend of Lesley Elliott , Noelene Oliver , said 20 years " would have been good ' ' .
" But it does n't change anything , he 's got 18 years , but it 's just an enormous gap in the family 's lives , '' she said .
Oliver said there was never any real closure for the family who were left with constant reminders of what had happened .
It would be nice to think Weatherston could be rehabilitated , but she wondered whether that was true .
Another friend , Anne , who did not want her last name used , said it seemed unfair that Weatherston 's family could still visit him in prison while the Elliott 's were left with just photos and memories .
" At the end of the day he 's still got his life and that 's hard , '' she said .
Sensible Sentencing
Trust spokesman Garth McVicar said he would have liked to see the judge " step out of her comfort zone and put the victims first , '' but felt that did not happen .
" I think this is a classic case of where it should have been a true life sentence so the victims can really put this behind them . ''
National Collective of Independent Women 's Refuges chief executive Heather Henare said Justice Potter 's comments during the sentencing sent a message that violence was unacceptable and inexcusable .
" In this trial , we saw the defendant on the stand and we all saw , as the jury did , that he felt justified in his actions and sought to blame his victim , " Ms Henare said .
" No sentence could ever return Sophie Elliott to her family , but we do we feel the judge 's statements go some way towards acknowledging their loss . "
FIVE -WEEK TRIAL
Weatherston , who was Elliott 's economics lecturer at Otago University , was convicted of her murder in July after a five - week trial .
He had stabbed her 216 times and mutilated parts of her body .
Justice Potter this afternoon told the High Court in Christchurch that the crime ranked among " the very worst murders " .
" I am in no doubt that this murder was committed with a high degree of callousness and brutality , " Potter said .
She said some degree of planning in the murder was clear and Weatherston 's evidence of regularly carrying a knife in his laptop bag was " fanciful " .
" I consider it entirely relevant and appropriate to take in to account the prisoners actions .. in continuing the attack after she was dead , including the deliberate and gross mutilation of her body , " Potter said .
It was an " appalling attack " where Weatherston had used a knife and a pair of scissors .
" The continuing attack was very much part of the circumstances of her death , " Potter said .
Potter quoted an earlier judgement responding to the defence , which said : " I must be frank and say they sounded somewhat unreal . "
The Crown earlier asked for a minimum non-parole period of 19 years and the defence for 12 to 14 years .
Potter said she seriously doubted that Weatherston 's mental condition had any part to play in the murder .
WEATHERSTON 'SORRY '
Earlier today his lawyer Judith Ablett Kerr has told the High Court in Christchurch that Weatherston had told her he understood people did not see he was remorseful .
" He said to me ' They do n't see me at two in the morning when I think about the horrendous thing that occurred ' .
" He tells me he is sorry , that he saw no point in saying it himself because it would appear contrived . "
Weatherston stood by the evidence that he gave at trial and still believed that he was provoked , Ablett Kerr said .
VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS
This morning Sophie Elliott 's father told Weatherston he was " the epitome of evil " .
Gilbert Elliott ended a victim impact statement this morning eye - balling his daughter 's killer .
Elliott said Weatherston had destroyed his daugher 's life " in the cruelest way imaginable . "
" Her death would have been so awful and so excruciating , it is beyond imaginable , " Elliott said .
Gil Elliott told Weatherston it appeared he was envious of his daughter .
He said his daughter 's death was " simply heartbreaking " .
“ Never in a million years had I thought something could have happened to our darling daughter , " Elliott said .
After his daughter died , police had advised the family should not visit their daughter 's body .
" Can you imagine what it feels like that she was so badly mutiltaed that people were advising us that we did n’t want to see her , " Elliott said .
Lesley Elliott , who witnessed the murder , said she yearned for a hug and a pat on the shoulder from her daughter .
“ Our house is quiet now , " Lesley Elliott said .
" It ’s hard to come to terms with the ugliness of her death .
Everyone knows as I do , she wo n’t come back . "
Elliott said she cried herself to sleep every night since her daughter was killed .
" Clayton Weatherston , … this is what you have done to us .
I will never forgive you , " she said .
" I hope that her screams of agony ring in your ears as they do in mine . "
Weatherston 's father , Roger , told the court he " never thought for one minute " that his son could ever be capable of what he had done .
" As a father , I know he is a very truthful person and I still believe this , " Roger Weatherston said .
" I hope that Clayton will find it within himself to publicaly show remorse .
" We will always love and support our son but of course our thoughts are also with the Elliotts for the terrible loss of someone so special to them . "

WASHINGTON | More than 1 million people will run out of unemployment benefits in January unless Congress quickly extends federal emergency aid , a nonprofit group said Wednesday .
States typically provide 26 weeks of unemployment insurance for those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own , with weekly checks averaging about $ 300 .
Congress on Nov. 6 extended coverage for the fourth time since the recession began , granting 14 to 20 more weeks to try to keep about 1.3 million people who have been jobless for well over a year from running out of benefits before the end of 2009 .
That boosted the total number of weeks a person could collect unemployment to as much as 99 in the hardest - hit states .
But that legislation did n’t address an underlying problem :
The emergency unemployment compensation program , including all 73 additional weeks , expires at the end of this year .
If the program is n’t renewed , after Jan. 1 recipients who have used up their 26 weeks of state benefits wo n’t get any extra coverage .
The National Employment Law Project estimated Wednesday that 450,000 people will fall into that category in January .
An additional 600,000 will run out of extended coverage that month , the NELP estimates .
Since the extra federal benefits are provided in stages , recipients wo n’t be able to continue to the next one after Jan. 1 , unless the emergency program is reinstated .
Under the most recent extension , all states received 14 extra weeks .
States with unemployment rates of 8.5 percent or above received six more weeks on top of that — 20 in total .
But a group of state agencies that administer the benefits noted this week that few , if any , recipients will be able to access those additional six weeks if the program ends Dec. 31 .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , said Tuesday that Congress would consider continuing the federal emergency program and other benefits included in the stimulus package as part of a bill focused on jobs .
But Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has said the Senate will finish work on health care before taking up a jobs bill , which could mean that it wo n’t act until next year .
Congress could face opposition over the cost of extending the program into 2010 , especially with a proposed health care overhaul bill carrying an $ 849 billion price tag .
Business groups estimate that extending the stimulus package ’s benefits for another year could cost $ 70 billion .
But advocates warn that letting the program end or delaying an extension would create uncertainty for millions of recipients and potentially long gaps between benefit checks , making it difficult for many to make mortgage or rent payments .
About 9 million people are receiving unemployment insurance , 5 million on the state programs and 4.1 million on the federal extensions .
Maurice Ensellem , the NELP ’s policy co-director , said state agencies will start notifying recipients next month that their benefits will run out , unless Congress acts .
“ That ’s going to create a lot of anxiety , ” Ensellem said .
“ Every interruption in benefits creates real chaos . ”

Researchers Regrow Functional Penis in Rabbits
New research on rabbits could benefit men with damaged erectile tissue .
Nov. 9 , 2009  --
Rabbits may be the last animals that come to mind when it comes to sexual dysfunction , but if they ever need help in that area , they have it now -- and humans could be next .
Using tissue engineering techniques , researchers at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston - Salem , N.C. constructed a fully functional rabbit penis that enabled the animals to mate and produce offspring .
The process could someday allow normal penile function in men with damaged erectile tissue .
" The major challenge is that the penis is a solid organ , " said Dr. Anthony Atala , director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest .
" With this project , it was also a challenge to determine the ideal mix of smooth muscle and endothelial cells that would allow for normal function . "
The research , which resulted in the most functional erectile tissue replacement reported to date , was published today in online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
On a collagen scaffold , which provided the organ structure , Atala and his group grew smooth muscle and endothelial cells , the same cells that make up blood vessels , harvested from rabbit erectile tissue .
The scaffold and cells were implanted into 12 rabbits , where the tissue continued to develop .
But part of what makes erectile tissue so complex is the structure , a honeycomblike arrangement with spaces between the cells that fill with blood upon erection .
In the rabbits , engineering the proper cellular configuration , along with having sufficient blood flow , allowed normal sexual function .
" This tissue has a unique structure , which the [ scaffold ] allowed us to replicate , " Atala said .
Earlier research by Atala 's group replacing portions of the erectile tissue returned about 50 percent of normal erectile function but the researchers hoped to improve upon those results .
Do Rabbits Have Performance Anxiety ?
And even in rabbits , lacking proper sexual function may make it difficult to try and mate .
The study showed that rabbits with bioengineered organs attempted to copulate with a female within one minute of introduction , whereas the control rabbits , who either had scaffold implants with no erectile tissue or no implants at all , made no such attempts .
Sex Drive Is Still Hard to Measure
However , Dr. Atala said it would be difficult to measure whether there is a cognitive component regarding the drive to mate and if it could be linked to functional erectile tissue .
And sexual function is complex , said Dr. Paul Turek , director of the Turek Clinic , a San Francisco - based male reproductive health clinic , involving anatomy , physiology , hormones , nerves and emotions .
" This [ research ] does not solve sexual function , " he said .
" It [ could ] solve problems of faulty sexual anatomy . "
However , such advances are not the answer for infertility .
Rather , regenerated , individualized and functional erectile tissue has more potential to help those born with dysfunctional erectile tissue , who have suffered trauma , have penile cancer and , in some cases , those with erectile dysfunction .
" If you lack erections , it 's difficult to reproduce the old - fashioned way , but it 's still possible , " said Dr. Michael O'Leary , senior urologic surgeon at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , Mass .
" This particular technology is trying to treat erectile dysfunctions . "
Men With Destroyed Erectile Tissue Face Problems
According to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study , a two - year survey of 1,290 men between the ages of 40 and 70 , self - reported incidence of erectile dysfunction , ranging from mild to severe , occurred in 52 percent of respondents .
While there are plenty of treatments for older men who lose normal erectile function , including medications and prosthetic implants , men who are born with a defective organ -- one that is very small or nonexistent , for example -- have few options .
" Particularly for patients who have congenital abnormalities , that is those who are born with conditions that render them with a dysfunctional organ , there 's almost nothing to offer them , " Dr. O'Leary said .
Moderate Dems are running out of reasons to oppose a robust public option .
The CBO , which deficit hawks like Kent Conrad and various House Blue Dogs esteem as a demi-god , says the robust public option saves money , according to preliminary reports .
The CBO will release the analysis today .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office projects that the House Democrats ' health care plan that includes a public option would cost $ 871 billion over 10 years , according to two Democratic sources .
CBO also found that the Democrats ' bill reduces the deficit in the first 10 years .
This new CBO estimate , which aides caution is not final , is significantly less than the $ 1.1 trillion price tag of the original House bill that passed out of three committees this summer .
More importantly , it comes under the $ 900 billion cap set by President Obama in his joint address to Congress last month .
CBO analyzed what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls a " more robust " public option -- one that ties reimbursement rates for doctors to current Medicare rates , plus a 5 percent increase .
Deficit reduction .
Suck on that , Kent Conrad .
But the bill does even more , by covering " 96 percent of all Americans , providing greater bang for each federal dollar spent . "
The new numbers have Pelosi renewing her push for votes .
The Congressional Progressive Caucus has been tallying support for a public insurance option tied to Medicare reimbursement rates over the last several weeks .
According to people in the room Tuesday night , Pelosi told her members that the caucus is close to the 218 votes needed to pass the bill .
She went on to say that the few remaining undecideds - or undeclareds - needed to let Majority Whip Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) know by Wednesday where they stand .
The caucus will meet again Wednesday evening to retake the Democratic temperature .
If the 218 votes are there , the party will plow forward and go to conference committee negotiations with a strong hand .
The last report from the House had the whip count at " about 200 , " this news , and some strong leaning on the part of leadership , should round up those remaining votes .
A robust public option -- that scores almost as well as the Finance bill while covering more people -- in the House bill will give Reid needed leverage in his negotiations .
If he 'll use it , and if he has White House backing .
At this point , there 's no common sense reason for any Dem to oppose the House bill with a strong public option .
It meets the White House 's fiscal target and gets more people covered , ostensibly the goal of this whole project .
The majority of Americans support it , the Democratic base is energized by it ( and will be equally de-energized come next November if Dems fail on this ) , and even the CBO likes it .
It sure looks like a win -win for Dems from where I 'm sitting .
The Club of Rome was created to address the multiple crises facing humanity and the planet .
Drawing on the unique , collective know - how of our 100 members – notable scientists , economists , business leaders and former politicians – we seek to define comprehensive solutions to the complex , interconnected challenges of our world .
Decades of exponential consumption and population growth have come to imperil the earth ’s climate and life - supporting systems , while reinforcing social and economic inequalities and impoverishing billions globally .
As a network of thought leaders from a rich diversity of expertise , our members are committed to facilitating the difficult conversations and the bold actions required to confront the planetary emergency facing humanity and our common home .
Our goal is to actively advocate for paradigm and systems shifts which will enable society to emerge from our current crises , by promoting a new way of being human , within a more resilient biosphere .
Drawing on thorough scientific analysis , the Club of Rome makes holistic proposals to address these immense , interconnected problems .
It does so through research , concrete policy proposals and the convening of high - level meetings , debates , conferences , lectures and other events .
It also publishes a limited number of peer - reviewed “ Reports to the Club of Rome ” .
Its seminal , best - selling 1972 report , The Limits to Growth , alerted the world to the consequences of the interactions between human systems and the health of our planet .
Since then , more than 45 Reports have reinforced and expanded that intellectual foundation .
Recently , the Club has prioritised five key areas of impact : Climate - Planetary Emergency , Reclaiming and Reframing Economics ; Rethinking Finance ; Emerging New Civilization (s ) ; Youth Leadership .
The efforts of our members are supported by the International Secretariat in Winterthur ( Switzerland ) a satellite office in Brussels ( Belgium ) and National Associations in more than 30 countries .
History
Most influential organizations begin with the meeting of a few like minds .
In 1965 , Aurelio Peccei , an Italian industrialist , made a speech that proved inspirational to Alexander King , the Scottish Head of Science at the OECD .
The two found that they shared a profound concern for the long - term future of humanity and the planet , what they termed the modern ‘ predicament of mankind ’ .
Three years later , King and Peccei convened a meeting of European scientists in Rome .
Although this first attempt failed to achieve unity , a core group of like - minded thinkers emerged .
Their goal : to advance three core ideas that still define the Club of Rome today : a global and a long - term perspective , and the concept of “ problematique ” , a cluster of intertwined global problems , be they economic , environmental , political or social .
At the group ’s first major gathering in 1970 , Jay Forrester , a systems professor at MIT , offered to use computer models he had developed to study the complex problems which concerned the group more rigorously .
An international team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began a study of the implications of unbridled exponential growth .
They examined the five basic factors that determine and , in their interactions , ultimately limit growth on this planet – population , agricultural production , non-renewable resource depletion , industrial output and pollution .
In 1972 , the Club ’s first major Report , The Limits to Growth was published .
It sold millions of copies worldwide , creating media controversy and also impetus for the global sustainability movement .
This call for objective , scientific assessment of the impact of humanity ’s behavior and use of resources , still defines the Club of Rome today .
While Limits had many messages , it fundamentally confronted the unchallenged paradigm of continuous material growth and the pursuit of endless economic expansion .
Fifty years later , there is no doubt that the ecological footprint of humanity substantially exceeds its natural limits every year .
The concerns of the Club of Rome have not lost their relevance .
Today , the Club continues to be at the forefront of challenging and controversial global issues .
Propelled by a new mission and organisational structure , which today includes 35 National Associations , the Club of Rome has now published over 45 Reports .
They continue to challenge established paradigms and advocate for policies that can practically address the many emergencies facing society and the planet today .
The Club remains true to its historical intent , while it attempts to lay the foundations for long - term systemic shifts in global social , environmental and economic systems .
In short , it is an established , respected , international think - tank positioned to face the core challenges of the 21st Century .
The organization includes around 100 active full members with a full - time secretariat in Winterthur , Switzerland with a satellite office in Brussels , Belgium .
RDF 2 Wishlist October 30 , 2009
Here ’s what I think should be standardized at some point , soon , in the Semantic Web infrastructure .
These items are at various levels of maturity ; some are probably ready for a W3C Working Group right now , while others are in need of research .
They are mostly orthogonal and most can be handled in independent efforts .
( I would lean against forming a single RDF Working Group to handle all of this ; that would be slower , I think . )
To be clear , when I say “ RDF 2 ” I mean it like OWL 2 : an important step forward , but still compatible with version 1 .
I ’m not interested in breaking any existing RDF systems , or even in causing their users significant annoyance .
In some traditions , where the major version number is only incremented for incompatible changes , this would be called a 1.1 release .
In contrast , at W3C we normally signal a major , incompatible change by changing the name , not the version number .
( And we rarely do that : the closest I can think of is CSS -> XSL , PICS -> POWDER , and HTML -> XHTML ) .
The nice thing about using a different name is it makes clear that users each decide whether to switch , and the older design might live on and even win in the end .
So if you want to make deep , incompatible changes to RDF , please pick a new name for what you ’re proposing , and do n’t assume everyone will switch .
This is partially a trip report for ISWC , because the presentations and especially the hallway and lounge conversations helped me think about all this .
Note that although I work for W3C , this is certainly not a statement of what W3C will do next .
It ’s not my decision , and even if it were , there would be a lot of community discussion first .
This is just my own opinion , subject to change after a little more sleep .
Formally the decisions about how to allocate W3C resources among the different possible standards efforts are made by W3C management guided by the the folks who provide those resources , via their representatives on the Advisory Committee ( AC ) .
If the direction of the W3C is important to you or your business , it may be worthwhile to join and participate in that process .
1. RDF and XML interoperation
There ’s a pretty big divide between RDF and XML in the real world .
It ’s a bit like any divide between different programming languages or different operating systems : users have to pick which technology family to adopt and invest in .
It ’s hard to switch , later , because of all the investment in tools , built systems , educations , and even socially networks .
( People who use some technology build social and professional relationships other people who use the same technology .
Thus we have an XML community , an RDF community , etc .
Few people are motivated to be in both communities . )
I think we should have better tools for bridging the gap , technologically , so that when data is published in XML , it ’s easy for RDF consumers to use it , and when the data is published in RDF , it ’s easy for XML consumers to use it .
The leading W3C answer is GRDDL , which I think is pretty good , but could use some love .
I ’d like to see support for the transforms being in Javascript , which I think is probably the dominant language these days for writing code that ’s going to run on someone else ’s computer .
It certainly has a bigger community than XSLT .
I ’d probably support Java bytecode , too .
I would also like to see some way to support third - party GRDDL , where the transform is provided by someone not associated with either the data provider or data consumer .
Nova Spivack gave a keynote where he talked about this feature of T2 .
They ’re focused on HTML not XML , but the solution is probably the same .
Beyond GRDDL , I think there ’s room for a special data format that bridges the gap .
I ’ve called it “ rigid rdf ” or “ type - tagged xml ” in the past : it ’s a sub- language of RDF / XML , or a style of writing XML , which can be read by RDF / XML parsers and is also amenable to validation and processing using XML schemas .
Basically you take away all choices one has in serializing RDF / XML .
I note the The Cambridge Communiqué is ten years old , this month .
It proposed schema annotation as an approach , and that ’s not a bad one , either .
I have n’t heard of anyone working on it recently , but maybe that will change if the XML community starts to see more need to export RDF .
Amusingly , while I was talking to Gary Katz from MarkLogic about this , he mentioned XSPARQL as a possible solution , and I pointed out Axel Polleres ( xsparql project leader ) was sitting right next to us .
So , they got to talk about it .
XSPARQL does n’t excite me , personally , because I do n’t use either SPARQL or XQuery , but objectively , yes , it might solve the problem for some significant userbase .
2. Linked Data Inference
For me , an essential element of a working Linked Data ecosystem is automatic translation of data between vocabularies .
If you provide data about the migration of frogs in one vocabulary , and my tools are looking for it in another one , the infrastructure should ( in many cases ) be able to translate for us .
We need this because we ca n’t possibly agree on one vocabulary ( for any given domain ) that we ’ll all use for all time .
Even if we can agree for now , we ’ll want this so that we can migrate to another vocabulary some time in the future .
Inference using OWL ( and its subsets like RDFS ) provides some of this , but I do n’t think it ’s enough .
RIF fills in some more , but the WG did not think much about this use case , and there ’s might be some glue missing .
Maybe we can get WG
Note out of RIF to help this along .
I ’d like us to be clear about first principles : when you ’re given an RDF graph , and you ’re looking for more information that might be useful , you should dereference the predicate IRIs to learn about what kinds of inference you ’re entitled to do .
And then , given resources and suitable reasoners , you should do it .
That is , the use of particular IRIs as predicates implies certain things , as defined by the IRI ’s owner .
The graph is invoking certain logics by using those IRIs .
( Of course you can always infer things that were not implied , but as among humans , those “ inferences ” are really just guesses you are making .
They have quite a different status from true implications . )
If this is put together properly , and the logics are constructed in the right form , I think we ’ll get the dynamic , on demand translation I ’m looking for .
I imagine RIF could be very useful for this , but reasoner plugins written in Javascript of Java bytecode could be a better solution in some cases .
Some of my thinking here is in my workshop keynote slides , but later conversations with various folks , especially Pat Hayes and TimBL , helped it along .
There ’s more work to do here .
I think it ’s pretty small , but crucial .
3. Presentation Syntaxes
RDF , OWL , and RIF all have hideous primary exchange syntaxes and some decent not -W3C - recommended alternative serializations .
I ’m not really sure what can practically be done here that has n’t been done .
At very least , I ’d like to see a nice RDF - friendly presentation syntax for RIF .
A bit like N3 , I suppose .
I did some work on this ; maybe I can finish it up , and / or someone else can run with it .
OWL 2 has 3+n syntaxes , where n is the number of RDF syntaxes we have .
Exactly one of those syntaxes is required of all consumers , for interchange .
I ’ll be interested to see how this plays out in the market .
4. Multi-Graph Syntax
Most systems that work with RDF handle multiple graphs at the same time .
Sometimes they do this by storing the triples in a quad store , with the fourth entry being a graph identifier .
This works pretty well , and SPARQL supports querying such things .
We do n’t have a way to exchange multiple graphs in the same document , however .
N3 has graph literals ( originally called contexts ) , and there was some work under the term named graphs , which is kind of the opposite approach .
Personally , I do n’t yet understand the use case for interchanging multiple graphs in one document , so I ’m not sure where to go with this .
Hmmm .
I guess RIF could be used for this .
You can write RDF triples as RIF frame facts , and the rif : Document format allows multiple rulesets , each with an optional IRI identifier , in the same document .
ETA : RIF also gives you an exchange syntax where you can syntactically put literals in the subject and use bnodes as predicates , if you want .
But now you ’re technically exchanging RIF Frames instead of RDF Triples .
5. RDF Graph Validation
When writing software that operates on RDF data , it ’s really nice to know the shape of the data you ’ll find .
It ’s even nicer , if software can check to see if that ’s actually what you got .
And if reasoners can work to fill in any missing peices .
I do n’t exactly understand how important or unimportant this is .
It ’s closely related to the Duck Typing debate .
Whatever mechanisms make duck typing work ( eg exception handling , reflection , side - effect - free programming ) probably help folks be okay without graph validation .
But I think folks trained on C++/ Java or XML Schema would be much happier with RDF if it had this
The easiest solution might be using rigid RDF .
One could probably also do it with SPARQL , essentially publishing the graph patterns that will match the data in the expected graphs .
The most interesting and weird approach is to use OWL .
Of course , OWL is generally used to express knowledge and reason about some application domain , like books , genes , or battleships .
But it ’s possible to use OWL to express knowledge about RDF graphs about the application domain .
In the first case , you say every book has one or more authors , who are humans .
In the second case , you say every book - node - in - a - valid - graph has one or more author links to a human - node in the same graph .
At least that ’s the general idea .
I do n’t know if this can actually be made to work , and even if it can , it risks confusing new OWL users about one of the subjects they ’re already seriously prone to get wrong .
6. Editorial Issues
Finally , I ’d like some portions of the 2004 RDF spec rewritten , to better explain what ’s really going on and guide people who are n’t heavily involved in the community .
This could just be a Second Edition — no need for RDF 2 — because no implementations changes would be involved .
I ’d like us to include some practical advice about when / how to use List / Seq / Bag / Alt , and reification , maybe going so far as to deprecate some of them ( IMHO , all but List ) .
Maybe bring in some of the best - practice stuff on publishing and n-ary relations .
I understand Pat Hayes would like to explain blank nodes differently , explicitly introducing the notion of “ surfaces ” ( what I would call knowledge bases , probably ) .
Personally , I ’d love to go one step farther and get rid of all “ graph ” terminology , instead just using N - Triples as the underlying formalism , but I might a minority of one on that .
ETA : Of course we should also change “ URI - Reference ” to “ IRI ” , and stuff like that .
Okay , that ’s my list .
What ’s yours ?
( For long replies , I suggest doing it on your own blog , and using trackback or posting a link here to that posting . )
Discussion on semantic-web@w3.org is fine , too .
This past Saturday , I - along with some good friends - ventured over to DC ’s newest ( and greatest ) beer haven , ChurchKey , to enjoy a few brews and hang out with Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head .
Aside from the awesomeness of just being there , Sam brought along a firkin of Black Thai - usually a rare brewpub exclusive .
The bar was packed , but we were lucky enough to get a booth for the tapping .
The Venue
ChurchKey is the newest venture by the Neighborhood Restaurant Group .
[ Full disclosure : ChurchKey is also my current place of employment , so this review may be a tad biased ]
Featuring 50 ever - changing taps , 5 cask ‘ real ales ’ , and ~500 bottles at any given time , it is a beer - lovers playground .
And unlike some other DC establishments , ChurchKey does a pretty good job of actually having everything on their list .
Aside from the best beer list this side of - well , anywhere , ChurchKey has some pretty fantastic bar food as well .
We treated ourselves to some fried risotto balls , sweetbread poppers , a BLT flatbread , and the highlight of the night , Fig , Prosciutto & Gorgonzola pizza .
ChurchKey ( and it ’s downstairs little sister , Birch & Barley ) has received enough press in the last month , so I wo n’t go too into detail .
If you ’re in the DC area and interested , check out The Washington Post ’s writeup , or some of the stellar BeerAdvocate reviews .
Anyway , let ’s talk beer .
The Style
Black
Thai is a 9 % ABV imperial stout brewed with edamame , Thai basil , and blackberries .
I wrote about basic Imperial Stouts in my Ten Fidy review , but to call this simply a stout is to compare aged smoked gouda to Kraft singles .
Aside from the rather unique additives , Black Thai is fermented with lager yeast ( instead of ale yeast , which stouts are typically brewed with ) .
I wo n’t go into detail , but you can read about the differences between Ale & Lager here .
Finally , if a soy - basil - blackberry - imperial - stout was n’t off the wall - excuse me , ‘ Off - Centered ’ - enough for you , the beer was served from a cask .
What this means is that it was unfiltered , unpasteurized , and naturally - carbonated ( as opposed to the forced - carbonation that normally comes from kegs ) .
This is also known as Real Ale .
What you get from cask - conditioning is a beer that ’s a bit warmer , a bit thicker on the mouth , and a whole lot more complex .
The Tasting
After having the description above bouncing around in my head for the better part of a week , anticipation was high as the 7 pm tapping rolled around .
I can only imagine everyone else in the bar felt the same , since it seemed that the entire cask was consumed in about 30 minutes .
Pours a creamy - opaque brown , with about one finger of tannish head .
This looks like no beer I ’ve ever seen before , more like a Starbucks ’ mocha than anything else .
Aroma is big and spicy with a definite basil foreground .
There ’s also a very faint medicinal smell , increasing as the beer warms .
The first thing I taste is coffee , followed by a thick tart fruit , then a very herbal finish .
A slight soy aftertaste .
Something of an iodine bitterness towards the end as well .
Very low bitterness , practically non-existent hops .
The blackberries take over where I imagine hops should be , which creates an interesting fruity tart / sourness to offset the sweetness .
Flavor fills the mouth .
It ’s quite full - bodied , but not thick or syrupy as high - abv beers tend to get .
While the aftertaste lasts a very long time , the beer itself washes down fairly smooth .
Not very drinkable .
One pint was interesting , but two would be hard to swallow .
I do n’t necessarily agree , but the rest of the table felt that the beer tasted like some kind of weird New - Agey health drink .
This beer tastes exactly like an aggregate of it ’s ingredients , each one lined up right after the other .
There is n’t much blending , much to my dismay .
It ’s complex , but not incredibly nuanced .
Interesting , but not great .
The best thing I can say about Black Thai is that it ’s an incredibly inventive and challenging beer , which I absolutely love .
I wish I could speak as well to the flavor .
6.9/10
As far as I know , only one cask of Black Thai has ever existed , and it met it ’s makers on Saturday .
So , unless you were at ChurchKey last weekend , you ’re out of luck .
Fortunately , the regular keg version will be available at Dogfish Head ’s Rehoboth , DE brewpub for a ( probably very limited ) while .
Also imbibed
- Weihenstephan 1809 Berliner Weisse - fantastic sour wheat ale .
Lemony and grassy .
Super refreshing and clean finish .
8.8/10
- Uerige Doppelsticke - Raisiny sweet dark Altbier .
Decent .
7.5/10
-de Regenboog Vuuve - Unfiltered hazy weiss , with just a hint of citrus tartness .
Crisp , coriander , herbs .
I did n’t think much initially , but upon a second tasting I really warmed up to this beer .
9/10
- Ola Dubh Special 18 Reserve ( cask ) - Old Ale aged in 18 - year Scotch barrels , served ‘ real ’ from the cask .
Sadly , a bit of a disappointment .
Tasted like a slightly earthy stout .
Far too light in body .
Metallic , tin-can bitterness .
Strange brew .
Perhaps it could use some more aging .
6/10
- BrewDog Padadox Isle of Arran ( cask ) - ( read about the Paradox series ) Imperial stout aged in single - malt whisky barrels from the Isle of Arran distillery .
Huge , thick , sticky .
Fantastic feel , and the full flavor to back it up .
Dark malty stout , with some serious smokey oaky ( did n’t mean to rhyme ) character .
A ton of chocolate espresso up - front , but plenty of subtlety from the barrels .
Wood , vanilla , smoke , earth .
This is what I expected Ola Dubh to taste like .

A free , standalone version of Unreal Engine 3 has been released by Epic Games , giving aspiring developers and professionals alike the chance to use Epic 's 3D engine technology for free .
The Unreal Development Kit can be downloaded by anyone and gives users access to the game engine technology , Unreal Editor , Unreal Content Browser , UnrealScript and other tools ( a full feature - set is listed on the website ) .
The software will be free for non-commercial and educational users , although terms will apply to developers making games commercially .
" I 'm excited about the possibilities the Unreal Development Kit opens to those who are looking to get into the game business but do n't otherwise have the means to acquire world - class technology and tools like ours , " said Mark Rein , VP of Epic .
" UDK is Unreal Engine 3 , which has been used to create games in a wide range of genres , as well as military simulations , 3D architectural walkthroughs , animated movies and more .
Users are only limited by their imaginations . "
Epic will support the software with regular upgraded builds .
While the kit is initially only for use on PC , the company says console support is under consideration .
The SEC has some news in SCO 's latest 8 K : Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers On October 14 , 2009 , The SCO Group , Inc. , ( SCO  , us , weor the  Company ) announced that the Company has eliminated the Chief Executive Officer and President positions and consequently terminated Darl McBride .
The current management team comprised of Chief Operating Officer , Jeff Hunsaker , Chief Financial Officer , Ken Nielsen and General Counsel , Ryan Tibbitts , along with the rest of the management team will continue to work closely with the Chapter 11 Trustee and his advisors .
Item 8.01 Other Material Events SCO also announced a restructuring plan following an analysis of the company 's operations and cost structure undertaken by Chapter 11 Trustee , Edward Cahn and his advisors .
The Company is also looking to raise additional funding and sell non-core assets to bolster working capital .
I wonder how the Chapter 11 Trustee defines " non-core " ?
Other than Darl , I mean .
ars technica says the litigation will continue :
In a statement issued by SCO 's new leadership , the company indicates that it plans to continue its litigation efforts and will move forward with the appeals process .
The company also says that it plans to continue supporting its UNIX products .
This potentially indicates that SCO has given up on trying to unload its UnixWare assets , a plan that has fallen through several times now as various proposed deals have evaporated .
" These actions , while difficult , are essential to SCO becoming a more agile and efficient company , not just for this year , but for years to come , " said Hunsaker in a statement .
" This restructuring plan reinforces SCO 's ability to continue to sell and support its products while servicing the needs of our customers and partners on a worldwide basis through the stabilization of our financial situation . "
Sad when getting rid of you is deemed essential for a company 's survival .
But I doubt this is the end of the Cowboy .
He has reportedly said that there could be a shareholder revolt and litigation against the Chapter 11 Trustee .
And none of the above tells us what the folks who have backed SCO from day one will do .
If you recall , in the Pelican Equity complaint , other defendants with McBride allegedly called him their puppet .
So ... who is the puppet master ?
There is another allegation in footnote 2 on page 12 of the First Amended Complaint [ PDF ] : 2 McBride met Norris while he was working for AIP .
The conclusion of the venture to take control of SCO Group bore similarities to that of the stock loan business .
Norris , McBride , and Brazell took the opportunity for themselves to the exclusion of Robbins .
After Norris and Robbins established a joint venture to purchase SCO out of bankruptcy with McBride 's assistance , Norris and Brazell excluded Robbins ' company from that entity and replaced it with Brazell 's company , Gulf Capital Partners , LLC .
Not coincidentally , Bryan Cave also represented Gulf Capital Partners .
In connection with that endeavor , McBride unlawfully made a $ 100,000 payment to Norris , which he obtained through a home equity loan that he bragged was fraudulent , to make up for fees that the bankruptcy judge had forbidden SCO to pay Norris .
Now , this is an allegation , not evidence .
You can say whatever you want in a complaint , and it 's only later in litigation that you find out who is telling the truth or who is in the right .
Both McBride and Bryan Cave have filed motions to dismiss the complaint , which are pending .
But while it 's important to caution about not jumping to conclusions , the fact that such incendiary allegations are out there now in public could be at least part of what may be happening behind the scenes , I would imagine .
I find it hard , I guess , to understand the reasoning behind firing McBride and then continuing the litigation unless there is some other factor .
Litigation is his best skill , in my view .
But then , SCO never did take my advice .
Think how much trouble they could have saved themselves , and the rest of us , if they only had .
P.S. SCO 's litigation will eventually fail , in my view , because of the GPL .
They released their Linux products under the GPL .
It 's the fundamental flaw that will sink that ship no matter what else they are able to do .
I 've been saying that since Groklaw began , and it 's still my opinion .
Here 's the SCO statement in full , attached to the 8 K as Exhibit 99 - 1 : THE SCO GROUP ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC PLAN AND MANAGEMENT CHANGE Lindon , Utah , October 16 , 2009  The SCO Group , Inc. , ( Pink Sheets : SCOXQ ) a leading provider of UNIX ® software technology , today announced a restructuring plan following an analysis of the company 's operations and cost structure undertaken by Chapter 11 Trustee , Edward Cahn and his advisors .
The company expects to finalize details of the restructuring and to reach cash flow breakeven for core operations within the next month .
The savings are a combination of non-workforce related changes and a modest reduction in SCOs workforce .
As part of the restructuring , the company has eliminated the Chief Executive Officer and President positions and consequently terminated Darl McBride .
The current management team comprised of Chief Operating Officer , Jeff Hunsaker , Chief Financial Officer , Ken Nielsen and General Counsel , Ryan Tibbitts , will continue to work closely with the Chapter 11 Trustee and his advisors to implement the restructuring plan , move the intellectual property litigation forward with Boies , Schiller & Flexner , LLP and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
The company is also looking to raise additional funding and sell non-core assets to bolster working capital .
These actions will allow the Trustee to preserve cash and the value of the business while enabling the Company to proceed with asset sales , pursue litigation against , among others , IBM and Novell , and to continue supporting SCOs loyal UNIX customer base .
 These actions , while difficult , are essential to SCO becoming a more agile and efficient company , not just for this year , but for years to come ,  said Mr. Hunsaker .
 This restructuring plan reinforces SCOs ability to continue to sell and support its products while servicing the needs of our customers and partners on a worldwide basis through the stabilization of our financial situation . 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements contained in this press release regarding ( 1 ) the Companys plan of reorganization and ( 2 ) the Companys financing efforts are forward - looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 .
These statements are based on managements current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties .
We wish to advise readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated in such forward - looking statements .
These factors include , but are not limited to , outcomes and developments of our restructuring plan , outcomes and developments of our Chapter 11 case , court rulings in our bankruptcy proceedings , the impact of the bankruptcy proceedings on our other pending litigation , and our cash balances and available cash .
These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated are discussed in more detail in the Companys periodic and current filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , including the Companys Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended October 31 , 2008 , as amended , and future filings with the SEC .
These forward - looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made , and the Company undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after such date .
I gather the Chapter 11 Trustee thinks there is a way to keep the company in business .
And he also thinks , so far , that the litigation is worth pursuing .
Or he'd like IBM to think so .
I see he is looking for money , and SCO has always had the fantasy that at some point IBM would pay them to go away .
But then , he 's new .
Perhaps , more rationally , he just hopes to attract investors who might be more attracted if McBride was n't part of the investment .
And firing McBride indicates to me that while the litigation will continue , it wo n't be pursued in the same manner as under McBride 's leadership .
What about SCOsource ?
That , according to Heise , is what caused SCO 's financial troubles in the first place .
An English translation by computer : Under the direction of McBride ensured the company with an aggressive Unix campaign for attention , which culminated in the unjustified demand that all companies , which use Linux would have to buy intellectual protection licenses of SCO .
This campaign was accompanied by a high - altitude flight of the SCO share .
I love that .
High - altitude flight .
Like Icarus .
Too bad the SEC was n't wire tapping back then .
Here it is in German : Unter der Leitung von McBride sorgte die Firma mit einer aggressiven Unix - Kampagne für Aufsehen , die in dem Ansinnen gipfelte , dass alle Firmen , die Linux einsetzen , intellektuelle Schutz - Lizenzen von der SCO kaufen müssten .
Diese Kampagne wurde von einem Höhenflug der SCO - Aktie begleitet .
Update : Heise has done its own English translation now : Under McBride 's stewardship , the company made headlines for its aggressive UNIX campaign which culminated in the demand that every company using Linux should purchase an IP license from SCO .
The campaign was accompanied by a soaring SCO share price .
The boom was short - lived .
SCO shares are now worth one penny , and the company has been forced to file for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of US insolvency legislation .
In a hearing before the bankruptcy court McBride recently claimed that he was in negotiations with four potential purchasers over the future of the SCO Group .
Steven J. Vaughan - Nichols realizes that this is not The End : Does this mean that we can finally make funeral arrangements for SCO ?
I wish !
But I do think this means that SCO 's anti-Linux lawsuits are dead .
Yet the question of who actually owns Unix 's intellectual property  SCO or Novell  was recently reopened .
Since that 's the only thing SCO might own that would have real value , I can see Cahn keeping SCO 's doors cracked open long enough for that issue to be resolved .
That all this means is that I think SCO will stagger on into 2010 .
Sigh .
The right to license is SCO 's already .
So what would they need copyrights for , if not to sue folks ?
Some may not have noticed what the original SCOsource plan ultimately entailed , a SCOsource license to run AIX .
Note this testimony from Chris Sontag in the SCO v. Novell trial last year : Q. Now , if you could take a look at that e-mail on the second page , in the middle of the page , it 's an e-mail from Jeff Hunsaker at SCO to yourself , Mr. McBride and others at SCO .
And it 's sent on July 31 , 2003 , correct ?
A. Yes .
Q. And what was Mr. Hunsaker 's position -- his position at SCO was Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing , right ?
A. I believe that to be the case .
Q. And Mr. Hunsaker currently is the president and CEO of SCO , right ?
A . I think at least the president of SCO Operations or something like that .
I 'm not sure what his exact title is now .
Q. And what he said in the middle of 2003 , this e-mail followed a conference call about this SCOsource licensing program , right ?
A. Yes .
Q. And the subject line there is : SCOsource issues and buyoff , correct ?
A. Yes .
Q. And he wrote Darl , Chris , Kim and Kevin , correct ?
A. Yes .
Q. And then he wrote : During our SCOsource con call today , we discussed and would like to propose the following .
The official name of this program will be the SCO UNIX IP Compliance License Program .
Correct ?
A. Yes .
Q . And that 's the name that was eventually used for this program of these contracts that we have just been through , right ?
A. Yes , at least for a period of time .
Q. And then he wrote ...
This is not a Unixware 7.13 SKU , right ?
A. Yes .
Q. And then he wrote :
The license is called a SCO UNIX IP license for Linux .
The only rights that this license provide is for Linux binary runtime copies .
When we are ready to issue a similar license for AIX , it will be called the SCO UNIX license for AIX .
That was the dream , and I believe it still is .
It would explain being willing to keep trying to get those copyrights .
IBM has deep pockets , and that tends to inspire litigation .
But if you bother to sue one , why not Linux too , if you have the copyrights and can prove infringement , neither of which I consider possible .
But if they do , they may decide it 's worth continuing to reach for the brass ring .
And I notice Mr. Hunsaker , who composed that email , is n't terminated .
So anyone who thinks this is over probably has n't been paying close enough attention to the background stories .
Darl is now , I would opine , the fall guy .
So ... I wonder what McBride will put on his resume ?
Update : I just noticed the date of the termination was October 14 .
So when Maureen O'Gara wrote , in an article dated October 16 , that Darl " expects to get fired any minute " ...?
Well , what can I say ?
The perfect ending . [ http://in.sys-con.com/node/1147274]
Update 2 : Not so fast , m'hearties .
According to the Salt Lake Tribune , McBride did n't find out until today : McBride , who learned of his ouster on the Internet Monday morning , also said in an interview it appears to him that the trustee is looking to lay off employees or cut pay as part of an attempt to wind down the company and settle the lawsuits .
" I think what they are heading for is either the business gets wound down and sold off and then what 's left is the litigation , " McBride said .
" At that point , what it appears they are angling for is to settle the litigation for what I think are pennies - on - the - dollar type of numbers . "
This may be why he is n't the CEO any more , talking still about IBM and Novell paying SCO instead of the other way around .
Anyway , McBride says he is rustling up some money , maybe from Cerberus Capital Management of New York , and that he and 50 % of the shareholders will present a different plan , while Cahn sticks with Norris .
Say , what ?
Yes .
That is what it says : McBride said his status as a shareholder gives him the ability to act in bankruptcy court .
He said he has the backing of around 50 percent of shareholders for what might turn out to be an alternative plan to exit bankruptcy that could include new investment , perhaps from Cerberus or others .
" I 'm putting together an alternative plan ... that will ultimately get SCO its day in court , " he said .
Novell and IBM also declined to comment .
The SCO statement indicates that Cahn might follow a previously proposed plan that would sell the Unix business to a company formed by Stephen Norris , the head of a private equity firm , Gulf Cap Partners , and a London - based entity .
So Norris dumped McBride too ?
What is going on ?
Surely it can't be believed that the bankruptcy judge , having appointed the Chapter 11 Trustee , seeing that he has ousted McBride , would then go with McBride 's plan over the Trustee's ?
Ah , but this is the SCO soap opera , and you have to tune in tomorrow .
Update : An 8 K on Hunsaker leaving : On November 13 , 2009 , Jeff F. Hunsaker , President and Chief Operating Officer , SCO Operations , Inc. ( SCO ) announced that he will be transitioning out of the company , effective immediately , to pursue other opportunities .
Mr. Hunsaker will act as a consultant , subject to bankruptcy court approval , to SCO over the next several months in order to assist the company with its UNIX business opportunities .
Senior management personnel of SCO , including Ken Nielsen , Chief Financial Officer , Alan Raymond , Vice President of Worldwide Sales , Andy Nagle , Senior Director of Engineering and Hans Bayer , Vice President of International Operations will collectively assume Mr. Hunsakers duties and will continue to manage the business and to serve SCOs UNIX customers in conjunction with the Chapter 11 Trustee , Edward Cahn , and his advisors .
Ryan Tibbitts , General Counsel , will continue to work with Mr. Cahn in directing and pursuing the companys legal claims .
For Raj Rajaratnam , the billionaire hedge fund manager charged with trading on inside information , legal problems are nothing new .
In 2005 , he paid $ 20 million in back taxes , penalties and interest to settle a federal investigation into a sham tax shelter that he used , according to a previously undisclosed lawsuit .
His Galleon Group funds were entangled in an earlier fraud case , and were found to have violated Securities and Exchange Commission rules .
Now federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged Mr. Rajaratnam and five other people with insider trading .
They have wiretaps and a cooperating witness to support their case .
But both the case against Mr. Rajaratnam and the man himself are more complex than they may first appear .
Mr. Rajaratnam and Galleon trade assets rapidly , gather information rapaciously and focus on short - term gains .
But those tactics are not illegal .
The credibility of a crucial witness against him has already been seared , and Mr. Rajaratnam ’s fund actually lost money on the trades outlined in the complaint against him .
A massive structural beam from the World Trade Center 's south tower was used in the ship 's construction
A ship built of salvaged steel from the World Trade Center is to be reunited with the city it was named after .
The USS New York embarked on its maiden voyage on Tuesday from Louisiana , where it was built , and is set to arrive in New York harbour on 2 November .
The warship will be welcomed by a formal ceremony to honour those killed in the 11 September 2001 attacks , which destroyed the World Trade Center .
Celebrations end on 7 November with the US Navy 's commissioning of the ship .
The warship got a patriotic send - off as it sailed down the Mississippi
The bow of the boat contains 7.5 tonnes of melted steel from the fallen buildings .
The ship 's crest includes images of the Twin Towers and features the colours of the city departments which first responded to the terrorist attack that killed nearly 3,000 people .
Dedicated work Thousands of workers helped build the ship at Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding 's yard in Avondale , Louisiana .
Deputy project manager Doug Lounsberry said the vessel was important to the builders , not only because it honours those killed in the terrorist attacks , but because workers were hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 during the early phases of construction .
" It 's like raising a kid , " Mr Lounsberry said .
" We 're sending this one off to college .
But after they leave , they remain near and dear to your heart . "
Two other ships , the Arlington and the Somerset , which are still under construction , will join the USS New York as 9/11 tributes , said a company spokesman .

The Scottish star 's manager has criticised MySpace and Warner Music for not allowing the singer to stream A Girl Like
You , claiming he did n't own the copyright
Edwyn Collins has been barred from streaming his own song through MySpace .
Management for the former Orange Juice frontman have been unable to convince the website that they own the rights to A Girl Like
You , despite the fact that they , er , do .
" MySpace are not equipped to deal with the notion that anyone other than a major [ label ] can claim a copyright , " complained Grace Maxwell , Collins 's wife and manager .
Maxwell made the unpleasant discovery after trying to upload A Girl Like
You , the singer 's 1994 hit , to his own MySpace page .
" Lo and behold , " she wrote in a blog , " it would not upload .
I was told Edwyn was attempting to breach a copyright and he was sent to the Orwellian MySpace copyright re-education page .
Quite chilling , actually . "
The trouble with accusing Collins of copyright infringement is that he 's not infringing .
" He owns the copyright , " Maxwell underlined , " as he does for most of the music he 's recorded in his life ( preferring to go it alone than have his music trapped ' in perpetuity ' to use the contract language of the major record company ) . "
" I naturally blew my stack and wrote to MySpace on his behalf demanding to know who the hell was claiming copyright of Edwyn 's track ?
...
Eventually , after HUGE difficulty , I was told Warner Music Group were claiming it .
I found a nice lawyer guy at Warners , very apologetic , promised to get it sorted , but all these months later it is n't . "
For Maxwell , this has been emblematic of everything that 's wrong with the music industry .
" [ We are ] aware of who the biggest bootleggers are , " she said .
" It 's not the filesharers . "
While Collins has worked to make A Girl Like
You freely available to his fans , she alleges that the same track is sold illegally " all over the internet " .
" Not by Edwyn , [ but ] by all sorts of respectable major labels whose licence to sell it ran out years ago and who do not account to him . "
" Attempting to make them cease and desist would use up the rest of my life .
Because this is what they do and what they 've always done .
And it 's not just majors .
If I had a fiver for all the dodgy indie labels we 've been involved with I 'd have £ 35 or thereabouts .
( Exceptions : Heavenly and Domino ) . "
Maxwell , however , believes a different kind of digital music service could save the industry .
" Now let 's get on with working out a wonderful new way for music lovers to enjoy music for free or for a small subscription that makes it legal and easy to hear ANYTHING and allows the artist to reap the rewards of such freedom of access , " she wrote .
" Viva la revolucion ! "
The Lolita Cover Contest has ended and I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who took the plunge and participated .
Your efforts made it so intriguing !
In all , 105 entrants from 34 countries submitted a total of 155 entries ( multiple entries being allowed ) .
After the US and the UK , Poland and India had the most submissions with five each .
This was an extremely difficult exercise .
There were interesting submissions on many different levels and it was quite wonderful to simultaneously review them all .
In retrospect , however , I would not have limited the contest to one winner .
I realized perhaps too late the inevitable arbitrary nature of this exercise and , forced to choose between conceptually different entries of equal merit , I developed my own rules in order to decide between them .
My personal bias leans towards simple , elegant , graphically strong designs and typeface is important but remember that I am not a graphic designer .
In judging the submissions I tended to avoid lingerie , lollipops , roses , hearts , lipstick prints , butterflies , heart shaped sunglasses , and overtly sexual poses ( as well as the unexpected recurring themes of swings and Rorschach blots ) which by now have been indelibly linked to the cultural concept “ Lolita ” if not the novel itself .
It ’s important to keep in mind that the novel may be considered a love story , but it ’s not Lolita who is in love .
And , of course , well beyond that one can explore the brutality and humor of the novel , the beauty of the prose and the cleverness of the wordplay .
This is a tall order for a book cover , and of necessity draconian choices must be made .
I was able to narrow my selection to fifteen or so covers , from which I chose four that were conceptually quite different but all excellent .
Keep in mind that any of these could have been first place covers .
The first prize goes to Lyuba Haleva of Bulgaria for her wonderfully lyrical submission .
Although arguably anachronistic in its imagery and typeface , the use of Lolita ( and Annabel ? ) as Humbert ’s wings perfectly communicate the novel ’s poetry and Humbert ’s high - minded yet deluded pursuit of fantasy and art .
Since I felt this was a crucial component of the novel it ultimately edged out others that leaned towards a darker reading .
As runners up I chose covers by Aleksander Bak of Poland , Derek McCalla of the United States , and Egor Krasnoperov of Russia ( click on each cover for a larger image ) .
This reductive exercise by Aleksander Bak is sad , lurid , even funny .
The lone unmoored pink scrunchy manages to be a potent symbol : surrounded by black , it ’s s a memento mori representing Humbert ’s loss of Lolita and the tragedy of the novel in general .
Inevitably , of course , it ’s also a stand in for an orifice ( you decide whose and which one ) .
The tension between the base and the sublime is wonderful and the composition is wonderful .
Derek McCalla ’s image is shocking , almost radical .
I see it as a witness to Humbert ’s destruction of Lolita ’s childhood through narcissistic acts of manipulation .
In many ways it ’s a grim book ( let ’s not forget that practically everyone dies ) .
Interestingly , Chris Pritchett , McCalla ’s instructor at Virginia
Tech used this contest as an exercise for his screenprinting class which is offered through the university ’s architecture department and populated by first - year though fifth - year architecture students .
I asked Pritchett why he had chosen to use this as an assignment :
“ I felt this was a good project for architecture students because as a graphic exercise they are forced to convey a wide range of emotion through one image . ”
Egor Krasnoperov cleverly and humorously gives us a triple - entendre , at least the way I see this .
First of course , there is the lollipop theme , present in all its banality , but rendered here beautifully and naively ; then the circle that censors Lolita ’s crotch , and , finally , the hypnotic vortex into which Humbert has fallen and which , quite literally , centers on Lolita ’s sexuality .
Pretty wonderful for such a minimal image .
John Gall , vice president and art director at Vintage / Anchor Books and designer of the latest cover of Lolita ( see samples of his work here ) , kindly agreed to review the submissions and picked his own top choices .
His favorite is by Suzene Ang of Singapore :
“ It takes a second before you see what is going on .
It ’s abstract enough to keep it metaphorical , yet literal enough to imply a sense of story .
I love the tease of having the type run up the leg .
Elegant , with a sense of humor . ”
He also liked the Aleksander Bak cover that was one of my top choices :
“ For second place I like the simplicity of the hair scrunchy design .
Nice double entendre .
I worry though , that it might be too much of a contemporary reference . ”
Gall made a point a few times of stressing the difficulty of the task :
“ This is a tough assignment .
So many clichéd images to either avoid or make new .
Not an easy task .
I teach a cover design class and would n’t give this as an assignment in a million years ! ”
I also asked Barbara Bloom to weigh in , an artist whose Nabokov - themed work has involved the use of existing Lolita book covers in addition to designing her own , not only for Lolita , but also much of the Nabokov ouevre :
“ As a matter of principle , I rejected all of the : ( sucking ) lollypop remakes , lurid images of young girls , underwear , heart shaped anythings .
I have chosen a few covers not so much for their style of rendering , or excellence in typographic or design strategies .
These are covers that seem to have a more complex and psychological reading of the text . ”
She selected as her favorite an entry by Lucie Lebaz of the UK ( in fact she liked three by Lebaz ) :
“ Like that they form ONE body together .
And LOVE the pink triangle . ”
Above is Bloom ’s own cover .
Susan Tallman , in her essay in the artist ’s monograph , writes :
“ Most remarkable , however , is the absurdly apropos silhouette BB found for the cover of Lolita : the pompous ( and paunchy ) Nabokovian male at the lectern , the saucy stance of the little girl ( the word ‘ minx ’ seems almost unavoidable ) who thrusts her hip at his tendentious fingers .
One does wonder what other purpose the image could ever have served . ”
Addendum : Bloom also listed Aleksander Bak ’s scrunchy cover among her favorites .
Since we all liked his fantastic cover he will be awarded a special prize .

Now , shall we make this an annual contest ?
Let me know …
On Tuesday of this week , my six - year - old son came home from school and announced to my wife , “ The president talked to us on the TV !
He told me not to give up ! ”
He obviously thought it was pretty amazing .
After all , the president usually just gives these incomprehensible speeches about stuff that no kid cares about .
But on this day , the president of the United States had taken time out of his schedule to talk to kids .
My wife , who ’d been worried that our son would n’t get to watch the president ’s speech because of the public furor surrounding it , smiled delightedly and asked what else the president had said to him .
He did n’t respond with something like the following : “ The president wants me to convince you that a public option is essential for effective health care reform . ”
Nor did he say , “ President Obama thinks the government should control everything , and he wants me to help make that happen ! ”
What my son said was this : “ Umm … if you do n’t have any money , you can work really hard and still get a good education . ”
The speech was full of these sorts of things .
Work hard .
Take responsibility for your education .
Do n’t give up , since even those with challenges can make it if they take advantage of the opportunities this country offers .
In short , it was utterly uncontroversial , just as the Obama administration had promised it would be .
And yet , in the week leading up to the speech , the dominant attitude where I live ( in Oklahoma ) seemed to be one of moral outrage .
How dare he use his office to indoctrinate our children !
How dare he make kids into pawns in the pursuit of his socialist agenda !
This is like Nazi Germany all over again !
How exactly did the promise of a welcome - back - to - school pep talk become the occasion for such fear and anger ?
What made it possible ?
Back in the early 1990s , when the first President Bush gave a similar speech to schoolchildren , there were some partisan grumblings from Democratic politicos ( albeit far milder — no mention of Nazi Germany ) .
But these grumblings did n’t stick .
There was no national controversy .
Parents were n’t inundating administrators with phone calls threatening to pull their kids from school in order to protect them from Bush ’s efforts at political indoctrination .
But this time that ’s exactly what happened .
And in response to the controversy and the barrage of outraged parental phone calls , many school systems decided it was safest not to air the speech at all .
Others required that alternative activities be arranged for children whose parents refused to permit their kids to be subjected to an encouraging presidential pep talk .
The evening after the talk , the local news station I was watching aired a report on the event , complete with footage of a school assembly hall where teenagers were gathered to watch the speech ; and where many were yawning , side - talking , and even nodding off .
Apparently they were n’t as excited about it as my son was .
Not surprising , since the president ’s message was one they ’d probably been hearing from teachers and parents and civic leaders since they were in the first grade .
But the most memorable part of the news segment was a brief interview with one mother who , after confronting the uncontroversial character of the speech , declared that this is how indoctrination starts : subtly at first , lulling us into a false sense of security .
Apparently , she was under the impression that Obama is planning regular addresses to our kids , and that this was just the sneaky warm up to a full - throttle socialist propaganda campaign in schools across the country .
Who ’s Indoctrinating Whom ?
Of course , no such thing is in the works .
But the mother in the news report had been so effectively steeped in a message of paranoia and hostility that even the most benign speech could n’t dislodge her moral outrage .
In part , the difference in how the nation responded to the Bush and Obama school speeches lies in important developments within the mass media .
In Bush ’s day , there was n’t a 24 - hour news station devoted largely to explicitly criticizing the sitting president , nor was there a blogger - riddled Internet through which the banners of “ propaganda ” and “ indoctrination ” could be taken up .
But the fact is that even given access to these new media outlets , Obama ’s right - wing critics would n’t have achieved their aim without a sufficiently receptive audience .
Somehow the decision to use the office of the presidency in one of the most benign ways imaginable — to encourage our kids to study hard and stay in school — was represented as a dire threat to our children .
And people bought it .
The patently absurd idea that Obama would use the opportunity to indoctrinate kids into his “ socialist agenda ” was swallowed by a number of conservative parents across the country .
Elsewhere , I ’ve argued that it ’s unlikely that those who deliberately fuelled the outrage really thought he ’d try to sell controversial policy ideas to school kids .
Instead , it ’s far more likely that part of their worry was precisely the fact that the speech was almost certainly going to be uncontroversial .
So uncontroversial , in fact , that Obama would come off as a leader who shares many of the same values as everyone else , and who genuinely cares about the success of the next generation .
The speech would be , in effect , an opportunity for Obama to stake out common ground across political divides , and affirm in front of the whole nation that no matter how serious our differences about health care reform and foreign policy may be , there are crucial things that we all agree on , a base of solidarity on which we can build ; such as the importance of working hard and getting a good education .
In short , America would be presented with an image of Obama that could not realistically be identified with the sinister portrait of him that the extreme right wing of our country is trying to paint .
Likewise , America would be presented with an image of itself at odds with the stark polarization , the irreconcilable “ blue state / red state ” dichotomy that only serves the interests of extremists .
And so we might say that these extremists were worried that their own attempts at indoctrinating their constituencies might be compromised .
Fear Sells .
But Why ?
Who ’s Buying ?
And so it is no surprise that the agitators did what they did .
The real question is why so many were swept up in the paranoid vision that these agitators offered them .
What is the lure of such a vision , and why does it take hold ?
With respect to such questions , I think it is impossible not to consider the influence of religion .
Religion is an important influence on culture , and so has the power both to facilitate and to counteract the kind of paranoid hysteria that greeted Obama ’s speech .
In my philosophical work on religion I ’ve argued , following Plutarch ’s lead , that there are two dominant models of religion ( with actual religious communities tending to be a paradoxical mix of both ) .
Plutarch actually reserved the term “ religion ” only for one of the models , calling the other “ superstition . ”
But in our contemporary setting , it may be more helpful to refer to them as the religion of hope and the religion of fear .
The religion of hope is beautifully embodied in the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , and is concisely expressed in his conviction that “ beneath the harsh appearances of the world there is a benign power ” — that is , a transcendent benevolence that cares about the good and supports those who work for justice .
A key feature of the religion of hope is that , because the root of creation is good , no existing thing is essentially bad or evil .
Most significantly , this means that every person is a product of a benevolent creator and so not only has inherent value and dignity , but has the capacity within them for moral goodness .
No one is irredeemably evil .
No one is so far gone that they have been rendered incapable of compassion ; even if , as may be the case , this capacity has been buried beneath layers of prejudice and fear .
Because all of us are products of the same divine benevolence , and because our divine creator is a real power moving within all of us to nurture what is good , we can enter conflicts in the hope that we can reach and connect with our opponents ’ best selves , that fundamental part of who they are that is responsive to the needs of others .
This is not to say that evil systems and forces are n’t real , and that people do not become deeply entangled with them ; nor that injustices can be overcome without struggle , or that there will never be a need to apprehend and incapacitate dangerous people ; nor that our duties to protect those in our care will never call us to harm an aggressor in their defense .
But it does mean that even our most dangerous opponents will be seen as fellow human beings with a capacity to care about the good .
Those who live by the religion of hope are therefore more inclined to pursue reconciliation even when there are risks , and more likely to forgive even when a past wrong is truly grave .
And when and where the religion of hope prevails , it is difficult to foster an attitude of paranoid hysteria .
Even when threats and injustices are real , those who live by the religion of hope look for ways to overcome those threats and injustices by building and recognizing connections of common humanity .
They are not easily convinced by those who fabricate dangers out of thin air , and they are not likely to view an occasion for staking out common ground and shared values as itself a danger from which our children must be shielded .
On the other hand there is the religion of fear , Plutarch ’s “ superstition , ” which he takes to be fundamentally about appeasing dangerous supernatural powers .
On this view of religion , when things go wrong the ultimate explanation is that someone somewhere has angered the divine power that reigns over the world like the ultimate tyrant .
God ’s inscrutable will must be obeyed on pain of harsh retribution .
And this retribution does not merely strike the guilty .
If things go badly for the nation , if terror strikes down the Twin Towers or a hurricane batters the coast of New Orleans , or if a tornado sweeps through Minneapolis and blows out the windows of the Electric Fetus music store , it is because God is displeased .
Someone has done something wrong : perhaps the gays or their allies , or the feminists , or the ACLU , or others whom Jerry Falwell famously implicated in the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
And the misbehavior of these enemies of God is a threat to the welfare of all .
God withdraws
His favor and protection from a nation that fails to be sufficiently obedient .
And so we must become a God- fearing nation , with a common vision of what God desires , or our country will fall into ruin .
And so the religion of fear leads to the idea that the enemies of God must be identified and defeated .
In the United States , the political arena has come to be seen as one of the key battlefields : God ’s enemies must be voted out of office .
If not , the nation itself is in dire jeopardy .
In this way , then , the religion of fear becomes a powerful tool for motivating people to serve partisan political agendas .
If one party or faction represents the will of God , then appeasing God requires religious communities to throw themselves into politics with the aim of ensuring that the right faction wins .
And if the wrong faction wins , it ’s a disaster .
The enemies of God have won .
The divine tyrant will withdraw His favor .
And all manner of evils and horrors will begin to take hold .
When and where the religion of fear dominates , party politics can become a template onto which stark in - group / out - group ideologies can be imposed .
And the stakes of political contests can be represented as monumental :
The fate of the world depends on the right side winning .
And if the wrong side achieves ascendancy , the message is clear : Be afraid .
Be very afraid .
The wrong side is not populated by decent human beings like the rest of us , but by sinister characters in the grip of evil .
And so if the wrong side gains the presidency , and then the president decides he wants to speak to our children , it only makes sense to be afraid .
It only makes sense to keep our children home .
No good can come of this enemy of God currying favor with the most impressionable among us .
Who knows ?
This man may lure our own children over to the other side !
So , are these the forces that were at work last week , when a presidential back - to - school address was turned into an occasion for national controversy and widespread fear ?
It may not be the whole story , but I suspect it ’s a big part of it .
Hold me , I feel like puking after watching this video from the top of the Burj Dubai , the tallest man-made point on earth .
The shaking ?
That 's because the tower 's wobbling .
Vertigo , uggghhhhh .

So now America ’s biggest business lobby and late - night comic David Letterman have something in common :
They have really , really embarrassed themselves .
Of course , there are significant differences between Letterman ’s womanizing and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s backward - looking opposition to climate - change legislation , which is causing the chamber to lose members , prestige and , worst of all , clout .
For one thing , the chamber ’s blunder was entirely unnecessary .
For another , the chamber has yet to apologize .
But the bottom line is that the chamber is embarrassed , or should be .
It has lost a number of high profile members -- utility companies Exelon , PG&E and PNM Resources and , most recently , Apple , whose image as a forward - looking company left the chamber looking stuck in the past .
( One clever headline put it , Apple , citing climate , tells U.S. Chamber iQuit ) A Nike executive resigned from the chamber board .
Tuesday ’s New York Times and Washington
Post featured full - page ads from big companies and environmentalists calling upon the U.S. Senate to “ pass clean energy legislation with a cap on greenhouse gas emissions this year . ”
The ads were signed by , among others , Dow , Exelon , United Technologies , Duke Energy , GE , Weyerhauser , Constellation Energy , Interface , PSEG , Deutsche Bank , Entergy , Johnson Controls and NRG .
That was a direct slap at the chamber , too .
{related_content}Chamber CEO
Tom Donahue can’t say he was n’t warned .
Consider the fact that more than two - and - a - half years ago -- on January 22 , 2007 , to be precise -- the CEOS of some of the chamber ’s most important , high - profile members -- GE ’s Jeff Immelt , DuPont ’s Chad Holliday , Duke Energy ’s Jim Rogers , among them -- stood besides some of America ’s most important environmentalists , including Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund and Jonathan Lash of the World Resources Institute , to declare that anthropogenic global warming is a problem and
" to call on the federal government to enact legislation requiring significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions . "
True , there were n’t a lot of policy details when the U.S. Climate Action Partnership was launched but the message was clear : Big Business , or at least a significant number of big businesses , wanted mandatory U.S. government regulation to curb global warming .
Since then , U.S. CAP , as it ’s known , has attracted new members , including AES , Chrysler , ConocoPhillips , Deere & Company , Dow Chemical , Exelon , Ford , General Motors , Johnson & Johnson , NRG Energy , PepsiCo , Rio Tinto , Shell , and Siemens .
Not a list you ’d want to ignore .
But the chamber , for reasons that remain unclear , continued to oppose -- and not just oppose , propagandize against -- any climate legislation with a real chance of passage .
In other words , the association did what no smart association should do :
It ignored some of its most powerful members .
Starting last year , the problem became glaringly evident .
Environmentalists ( led by Pete Altman of NRDC ) and reporters were putting the spotlight on the gap between the chamber ’s position and the position of some of its most visible members .
I wrote a column called Climate Change Schizophrenia that ran on Slate ’s The Big Money back in April and asked , Why do corporations support regulating greenhouse gases but fund a lobby that opposes it ?
Sources tell me that a delegation from companies that belong to U.S. CAP went to see Donahue the chamber ’s CEO to talk about climate policy , and they got the brushoff .
To be sure , the chamber , which calls itself “ the voice of business ” and spent about $ 62 million lobbying Congress last year , also has lots of members from the oil , coal and energy - intensive industries who oppose federal regulation of greenhouse gases .
Its 122 - member board includes executives from Consol Energy , Massey Energy , Peabody Energy and the Southern Co .
The smart thing for the chamber to do would be to stay neutral -- to admit that business is divided on the issue and to leave lobbying up to individual companies .
Instead , some chamber officials offered up reasonable arguments against the bills pending in Congress and others went off the deep end .
In a remark that was ill - advised at best and downright dumb at worst , William Kovacs , the chamber ’s senior vice president for environment , technology and regulatory affairs , called for a public trial about climate science that he said would be “ the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century . ”
That was n’t an isolated remark .
In comments filed with the EPA when the agency said it would regulate carbon emissions , the chamber argued that maybe global warming was n’t so bad after all .
As Kate Sheppard reported for Mother Jones , the chamber submitted a document called “ Detailed Review of EPA ’s Health and Welfare Scientific Evidence , ” that says :
" Humans have become less susceptible to the effects of heat due to a combination of adaptations , particularly air conditioning .
The availability of air conditioning is expected to continue to increase . "
And :
" Overall , there is strong evidence that populations can acclimatize to warmer climates via a range of behavioral , physiological , and technological adaptations . "
And finally :
" [ T ] he scientific evidence is clear that cold is a more potent hazard than heat . "
This is a little nutty , and it ’s hard to know why the chamber would venture so far outside of the mainstream .
Maybe ideological blinders ?
It ’s long been more friendly to Republicans and opposed to government regulation .
Maybe conflicts of interest .
In a provocative blogpost , Pete Altman argued that Donahue , who sits on the board of the Union Pacific Railroad , has a personal interest in the issue–he ’s been paid more than $ 1.1 million by the railroad , and given another $ 3.8 milion in stock -- because the railroad is a major shipper of coal .
In the end , it does n’t matter much .
What matters is that the chamber ca n’t any longer pretend to be the voice of business on the climate change issue -- the biggest business controversy of the decade .
Now that ’s embarassing .

After his widow died , in 1941 , the house stood empty until Mr. Wood and his wife came upon it .
The story , Mr. Wood said , is that Mr. Wharton ’s three sons disliked one another so much , they could n’t agree on who to sell it to .
“ I think they only sold it to me because I was a relative , ” he added .
Every spring for a decade or so after the sale , Mr. Wood said , he cursed “ this albatross , ” his roofless , windowless , floorless , powerless , waterless house .
Wrangling what had been a rich man ’s plaything , attended by servants and even its own shipyard , into a working couple ’s weekend getaway turned out to be much more than a working couple could handle .
Eventually , though , as the Woods mustered the talents of their friends , Clingstone and its maintenance evolved into a communal lifestyle , and ultimately a kind of religion .
Mr. Wood is now as proud as any parent of his house , and keeps a fat scrapbook of photographs and newspaper clippings that document its best moments .
He has been known to buttonhole strangers on planes who express a knowledge of Rhode Island and say , ‘ I think you know my house , ’ and then fall silent , waiting for them to exclaim :
The house on the rock !
Once , he persuaded an airline pilot on a commuter flight from New York City to Boston to alter course to the east so the plane would fly directly over Clingstone .
To get to this point , Mr. Wood became an expert scavenger , a deft barterer and an experienced arm - twister .
“ The number of things I ’ve gotten for free , ” he said happily , ticking off the 60 black porcelain doorknobs salvaged from houses that were being torn down in Boston ’s South End ; the overhead factory lights that came from a slaughterhouse in lower Roxbury ; the lumber plucked from an old Boston - area supermarket and strung with netting to make the railing that runs around the stairwell on the second floor .
( There are still no banisters on the wide , twisting main staircase , though the father of a man who was married here carved the banister posts for the back stairs . )
In those first years , friends came to work and camped for weeks .
The biggest worry , Mr. Wood said , was that there was n’t any way to lock up : “ We lost a lot of tools , and one brass bed . ”
One year Mr. Wood put an ad in The Harvard Crimson : “ Island occupant wanted to live in 23 - room house .
No charges .
No duties .
Ready now . ”
Somehow , The Crimson printed that last line as “ Leaky now . ”
Still , Mr. Wood was able to “ hire ” his first caretakers , a doctoral student and his wife , who would stay at Clingstone during the week and head back to Boston when Mr. and Mrs .
Wood arrived on the weekends with their three young sons : Paul , now 45 and an employment discrimination lawyer in Boston ; Josh , 41 , an architect there ; and Dan 38 , an artist and printer living in Providence , R.I .
If you ’re looking for reasons to puff out your chest and take pride in being American , then take note that the first six Nobel Prize winners announced this week are U.S. citizens .
Here ’s something else you should know :
Four of those winners were born outside the U.S .
That dynamic neatly summarizes the current state of our innovation economy .
We are increasingly dependent on brainpower from overseas that migrates here to drive the research and discoveries we need to power economic growth .
Silicon Valley has been a bigger beneficiary of this influx of brains and talent than perhaps any other region in the U.S .
And that means we have more to lose when the debate about immigration turns to demagoguery .
However you feel about the H - 1B visas that our tech companies hunger for , or the swarms of bodies crossing our borders to pick our crops , these hot - button topics obscure the reality :
We need these immigrants to renew our economy and to prosper .
Our demonization of them is shameful .
Instead , we should celebrate the presence of people like Elizabeth Blackburn , professor at the University of California - San Francisco .
Blackburn was born in Australia and moved to the U.S. in 1975 .
On Monday , she and two other researchers learned they would receive the Nobel Prize for medicine and split the $ 1.4 million it brings .
That money should more than make up for the 5 percent pay cut and furlough Blackburn ( and most other University of California employees ) received courtesy of the sad , sickly state of California .
I wonder how many other Nobel winners took pay cuts just before receiving the award ?
When Blackburn came here in the 1970s , it was clear that the U.S. was the undisputed center of the universe when it came to research .
But that advantage is slipping away , as Blackburn noted that she sees exciting work being done in many other regions .
Given the growing options for new researchers , erecting barriers to them coming to and staying in the U.S. seems ill - advised .
“ I ’m a big proponent that the flow of intellectual ideas is crucial , ” Blackburn said .
“ To have borders for it seems counterproductive . ”
Such walls hurt our country and our economy far in excess of whatever benefits they produce .
We need to recognize the enormous contributions immigrants are making to the innovation economy .
According to statistics from the National Science Foundation released in February , foreign - born science and engineering students in 2003 earned one - third of all Ph.D.s awarded in the U.S.
And the study noted that “ those who do decide to finish advanced study in the United States overwhelmingly choose to stay in the country after earning their advanced degrees . ”
Thank goodness .
In addition to Blackburn , the other foreign - born Nobel winners over the past two days included :
Charles Kao , who was born in Shanghai , and has both U.K. and U.S. citizenship .
William Boyle , of Bell Laboratories , was born in Nova Scotia and holds dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship .
There is some argument over whether the image is actually of George Harrison , rather than Ringo .
Harrison is quoted as saying “ Life is like a raindrop on a lotus leaf ” , when talking about his battle with throat cancer .
My son Matt with our pet emu who we raised from an egg .
We live at Hay in Western NSW .
Tim the emu is very quiet and comes and goes as he pleases , he may hang around the house looking in the windows or helping with maintenance jobs or disappear down the paddock .
He loves flowers and can eat hundreds if he puts his mind to it .

As the federal government ’s copyright consultations roll through the summer , with more and more perspectives being added to the mix , one wonders how ministers Tony Clement and James Moore plan to take this process from the consultation phase to the construction of public policy .
Certainly , the fact that these consultations are being held is a small victory for those wishing to move forward on copyright reform .
One of the most leveled criticisms of Ottawa ’s earlier attempt at a copyright bill , Bill C - 61 , was that there was a lack of stakeholder input .
Still , while giving credit where credit is due , these consultations must move beyond rhetoric and division .
In a July 27 op - ed , “ Will the Conservatives get the message on copyright reform ? ” , NDP critic for digital issues Charlie Angus correctly notes many of the pitfalls of Bill C - 61 and suggests a balance between creators and users is needed in the digital age .
Indeed , the time has come to move beyond commonly repeated rhetoric that either inaccurately describes so - called pirates who “ steal ” media or else falsely advocates for free copyright and performance - based business models .
The issue of copyright extends much farther than this rhetoric and deserves focused attention .
In fact , even distinctions between creators and users fail to reflect an accurate picture of the nature of innovation .
In the digital age of blogs and remixes , the lines between creators and users have become even more blurred .
Thus far , no political party has offered a positive vision on copyright .
Such a vision must reflect simple truths .
Information - sharing technologies are here to stay .
These technologies are beneficial to all sectors of the economy .
A thriving information commons is one that yields sustainable artistic innovation .
From these truths a principled approach to copyright emerges :
User rights must be defined and extended through a flexible fair - dealing mechanism ;
Current laws on Crown copyright and public domain must be reformed to build a healthy information commons ; and
Protection and compensation for creators must be ensured through a statutory - damages provision based on reasonably demonstrated loss .
Indeed , for the Greens , this principled approach to copyright is not an isolated issue but part of our vision .
As we work to reduce our environmental footprint without sacrificing jobs or income , economic development must occur in knowledge - based areas .
A healthy green economy requires fair treatment of both creators and users , fostering their ability to interact and build on each other ’s contributions .
It is important that public policy generated from these consultations does not stifle creativity through excessive restrictions nor render it unprofitable through lack of protections .
What is at stake during these consultations is the very manner in which the future economy and culture of arts operates .
If we want this information age to function appropriately , copyright law must have future generations of creators and users in mind .
The absence of these groups at the consultation means it is time to shed divisive rhetoric and work towards a principled approach to copyright .
Elizabeth May is the leader of the Green Party of Canada .
Griffin Carpenter is the party ’s youth and education critic .
In 2006 , just as global cooling was beginning to make things uncomfortable for people who believed that manmade CO2 was warming the earth , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ran a documentary that was meant to bring an increasingly skeptical public back on board with the idea of manmade global warming .
Airing on The Fifth Estate , an influential and respected investigative journalism program , " The Denial Machine " attempted to throw mud at any scientist who dared to question the so - called ' consensus ' on manmade global warming by implying all such scientists were secretly funded by oil companies .
As the recent exposure of the UK's Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) and its decidedly unscientific research demonstrates , the truth is almost exactly the opposite .
Rather than a vast , oil company - funded conspiracy , skepticism about climate fearmongering appears to have been quite correct : the CRU 's bluster was hiding the fact that even they could n't understand their own climate models or data .
However , as their internal documents show , they were being well - funded for making up scare stories about the CO2 - induced end of the world .
This was part of a process where public grants would routinely go to the researcher with the most dire predictions about the ravages of global warming .
Call it The Alarmist Machine .
The archive of emails and documents leaked out from behind the academic Berlin wall of the highly - secretive CRU sheds light on the vast sums of money these researchers were playing with .
As this hacked spreadsheet demonstrates CRU Director Phil Jones himself received a mind - boggling 22 million dollars in grants for his work over the past 20 years .
Sadly , the leaked data also shows just how willing these scientists were to lie and cheat in the pursuit of those funds .
One of the most outrageous emails ( 1056478635 ) features one CRU scientist openly advising a colleague to cook the books from their last research grant in order to receive more money from the NOAA ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) : " Ninh
NOAA want to give us more money for the El Nino work with IGCN .
How much do we have left from the last budget ?
I reckon most has been spent but we need to show some left to cover the costs of the trip Roger did n't make and also the fees / equipment / computer money we have n't spent otherwise NOAA will be suspicious .
Politically this money may have to go through Simon 's institute but there overhead rate is high so maybe not !
Best wishes
Mick "
The contempt shown for the taxpayers who are funding and supporting these research efforts through institutions like the NOAA is appalling .
Certainly any researchers who are found to have participated in such duplicity should never receive another cent of taxpayer money again .
But the chicanery does not end there .
In a well - researched article on American Thinker , Marc Sheppard points out that while the alarmists imply that the skeptics are being secretly funded , it is in fact the climate scientists who are being funded by the energy companies .
The fact that CRU members received significant funding from renewable energy companies , however , and not Big Oil , presumably puts their motives beyond reproach .
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW
Of course , this is not to say that these practices are confined to a few ' bad apples ' in the scientific community .
As skeptical scientists have been pointing out for years , scientific studies about doomsdays and catastrophes — no matter how unlikely the predictions or how shakey the underlying assumptions — tend to get greater funding and grant money than studies that show there is no such disaster on the horizon .
This is the inherent bias toward alarmist science and the inherent danger of The Alarmist Machine : not that there is some vast , secret conspiracy funding these alarmist scientists , but that this is a natural and predictable result of the funding process itself .
Even rational people can be stampeded into throwing money hand over fist at a team of scientists who are promising to save the world from disaster , especially when those rational people are blatantly misled by an unquestioning media that unproblematically reports on highly problematic science .
And all the while the scientific economy is shifted until the entire process becomes one of scientists competing to come up with the most panic - inducing findings .
As someone who spent his entire scientific career fighting the alarmists — first the ones who were whipping up hysteria over the coming ice age and then the ones ( sometimes the same ones ) who were whipping up hysteria over global warming —
Dr. Tim Ball is no stranger to the " Denial Machine " smear .
In fact , he was one of the scientists singled out in the CBC documentary .
He does n't tow the global warming line , therefore he must be funded by Big Oil .
It does n't seem to bother the producers of the documentary that they offer not one shred of evidence for that assertion : the logic of the situation demands it , so it must be true .
For someone who supposedly receives secret backdoor money from the Exxon bigwigs , Dr. Ball lives a remarkably low - key life .
When I met him for an interview in Victoria earlier this year , he was neither lighting cigars with Big Oil - supplied $ 100 bills nor driving a gas - guzzling SUV .
Instead he was on foot and he took me on a walking tour of the beautiful B.C. capital , regaling me with stories about the town 's history and demonstrating a genuine enthusiasm for the local tradition and culture of his adopted hometown .
We passed several hours talking about the history and philosophy of science , and what strikes one about him when engaged in such a conversation is that he has read , researched , and retained a voluminous amount of material , not just on his specialty of climatology , but of scientific history generally .
It is not surprise , then , that his take on the climategate scandal is one of the most thoughtful ( and damning ) yet :
It is still too early to say what the ultimate fallout from this scandal will be , but unless the scientists who have been implicated in this stop dismissing all criticism as out of context and start addressing the real issues raised in these documents , the backlash is likely to be massive .
And as Dr. Ball points out , that backlash ( rightly or wrongly ) will not be merely directed at this group of researchers , but on the very scientific processes and institutions that they have so shamefully abused .
From their private expressions of doubt over science that they publicly touted as unassailable to their use of data that they themselves did not seem to understand to their collusion to keep skeptics out of the peer reviewed literature , how can the public simply put blind faith in blanket statements about ' scientific consensus ' and ' listening to the experts ' again , especially when there are literally trillions of dollars hinging on the science skewing towards the alarmists ?
" The Denial Machine " ends with the words : " Not everything in life is about politics . "
If only that were the case .
When the death of Michael Jackson dominated the national airwaves a few months ago , for what felt like days and weeks on end , it seemed that journalism standards for what passes for news could n't sink any lower .
Then , on Thursday , October 15 , the mainstream media managed to outdo themselves .
With record home foreclosures , the announcement that seniors would receive no cost - of - living increase in Social Security ( the first time since 1975 ) , and an Arctic ice cap now forecast to be completely melted in ten to twenty years , there was plenty to talk about .
Instead , the lead story on most of the network and cable news shows was about a " balloon boy . "
There was nonstop coverage about a runaway helium balloon in Colorado which was thought to be carrying a little boy , a claim which later proved to be false .
The most up - to - date reports suggest the whole incident was nothing more than a badly staged publicity stunt .
With the continuous reporting devoted to this complete non-story , viewers would never know our country was in the midst of two wars and a series of economic and environmental catastrophes .
What should have been one of the day 's lead stories , the record number of home foreclosures , was instead relegated to a ten - second spot in the last segment of one of the major network 's national newscasts .
Watching the mainstream news has become like viewing a poor rendition of Alice in Wonderland .
Up is down ; black is white .
No news to report ; nothing to see here .
If it 's not on the national news , it did n't happen .
Meanwhile , real people in America are hurting , and their situation grows worse each day .
Americans would benefit from in - depth news reporting covering real issues so that they could better understand what is happening to themselves and in the world .
Instead , stories are cherry - picked and covered at the convenience of the corporations who control the media puppet strings .
The only time the Afghanistan war is trotted out , for example , is when the government wants to drum up support for escalation .
Wall Street 's record rally is paraded across the airwaves , touted as a sign that the economy is rebounding , while continued job losses are lucky to receive as much as a footnote .
Those discouraged workers who have given up looking and are no longer counted ?
They simply do n't exist .
Forget about reporting on the spiraling inflation of the dollar , or reports that Saudi Arabia is calling for the dollar to cease being the world 's currency .
Do n't expect to see any stories on network television about countries that are weathering the economy far better than the United States because they have policies in place that protect their citizens .
The list of stories that go unreported goes on and on .
The purpose of today 's mainstream media is not to inform , but to filter and control content in order to keep Americans distracted from the real issues .
Whether corporations or government or both are complicit , real journalism and real news reporting has been all but discarded .
Five constitutional experts testified at a Senate hearing Tuesday that President Obama ’s extensive use of policy “ czars ” is legal -- as long as the officials do not overstep their authority .
In a city where power is carefully hoarded and monitored , Obama has drawn complaints from Congress about his use of the so - called czars , officials he has appointed to coordinate environmental , health and other policy areas among various departments .
Lawmakers in both parties have sent letters to the White House saying the czar appointments skirt Congress ’ authority to confirm top executive branch officials and subject them to oversight hearings .
But the panel of constitutional experts testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s subcommittee on the Constitution did not support the complaints .

Called together by Sen. Russell D. Feingold ( D - Wis. ) , who had written to Obama asking for more information about the czars , the panel concluded that Obama had the right to appoint independent advisors .
The experts said the principle had been established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
“ The president ’s personal staff are independently responsible only to the president -- and in the end he is the only czar that is , ” said Bradley H. Patterson , a presidential scholar .
“ And he is accountable to the American electorate . ”
John Harrison , a University of Virginia law professor , compared the czars to the position of White House chief of staff , saying both hold great influence and can speak for the president , but their legal powers are limited .
Their “ practical authority . . . is not legal authority , and as long as the distinction is rigorously maintained there will be no legal problem , ” Harrison said in his written testimony .
Advertisement
Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) , who had also written Obama questioning the czars , said in a statement the issue was not dead .
The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , where she is the ranking member , will hold a similar hearing next week .
“ The appointments of so many czars have muddied the waters , causing confusion and risking miscommunication going forward , ” Collins said .
Obama ’s czars include Nancy - Ann DeParle , who coordinates healthcare issues within the White House ; Carol Browner , who coordinates energy and environmental issues ; Adolfo Carrion Jr. , who works on urban affairs ; and Lynn Rosenthal , who works on domestic violence and sexual assault issues .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , ranking member of the Constitution subcommittee , said at the hearing that he was worried in particular about the actions of Obama ’s “ pay czar , ” Kenneth Feinberg , who has been criticized by lawmakers for taking the lead on crafting executive pay limits without enough oversight .
The expert panel , however , said it found no constitutional violation .
Advertisement
White House Counsel Gregory Craig defended the Obama administration ’s appointments in a letter to Feingold .
“ Neither the purpose nor the effect of these new positions is to supplant or replace existing federal agencies or departments , ” Craig wrote .
The experts also agreed that Congress had limited options if it chooses to rein in these positions .
T.J. Halstead of the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service testified that the most effective answer for Congress is persistent oversight .

Petrobras ' average oil production in Brazil in September , 2,003,940 barrels per day , set a monthly record , surpassing the previous mark set in March 2009 by 12,000 barrels .
This mark was 5.6 % higher than a year ago and 1.2 % more than August 2009 .
The 24,000 - barrel difference , compared to August , resulted from the resumption of activities on Platform FPSO Cidade de São Vicente , in the Tupi area , in the pre-salt area of the Santos Basin , and on platform P - 19 , in the Marlim Field , in the Campos Basin .
Other factors that figured - in were a well going on stream at the Piranema Platform , in the Sergipe sea , and increased production at the wells interconnected to the P - 48 ( Caratinga ) and P - 51 ( Marlim Sul ) platforms , in the Campos Basin .
Petrobras ’ average oil and gas production in Brazil , in September , topped out at 2,326,969 barrels of oil equivalent per day , 4.5 % more than a year ago and 1.3 % above last month ’s mark .
The volume of oil and gas coming from countries where Petrobras has operations reached 245,263 barrels of oil equivalent per day ( boed ) , 10 % more than in September 2008 .
This surge resulted from production going on stream in the Agbami and Akpo fields , both in Nigeria .
Compared to last August , the rise was 4.7 % resulting from production normalization in the Austral Basin , in Argentina , after the the labor strike that took place in that country was wrapped - up .
Adding the fields in Brazil and abroad , the total average oil and natural gas production was 2,572,232 barrels of oil equivalent ( boed ) in September , 5 % more than a year ago and 1.6 % more than last August .
Natural gas production in the domestic fields was 51,358,000 cubic meters , the same as that produced last month and in September 2008 .
Natural gas production abroad was 16,311,000 cubic meters per day , 9.9 % more than in August .
This result is the outcome of production normalization at the Austral Basin , in Argentina , after the end of the labor strike in August .
Happy Post - Memorial Day , Everyone !
Sorry for such a long delay !
You might be reading this after the 4 - day weekend , still buzzing from the unsuspecting sunny weather and the first real welcome to the glorious summer .
This season is always hot , wet , and sleazy in NYC … much like this particular blog posting , which is a favorite among you readers .
So , thanks !
This week I wanted to take a break from kitten crushing and other animal antics .
Remember last week when I spoke about bug crushing – that tasty little phenomenon celebrated in Europe and Asia ?
Well , something I learned is that bug - crushing fetishists enjoy something so small and helpless be annihilated by a gargantuan woman ( in comparison ) .
Other fetishes also rely on growth to stimulate their own desires .
Giantess fetish , otherwise known as Macrophilia , is one that involves , well , giants of course .
The object of desire is commonly a woman who grows to enormous lengths , ripping off her normal - sized clothes in the instance .
Other fantasies could include other people being shrunken down to a smaller size , making the object of desire look larger in comparison .
Films like Attack of the 50 - FT .
Woman or Honey , I shrunk the Kids may cater to a part of you that wants to super - size your sex .
And , as Salon.com points out , the sheer dominance of a large woman evokes a breakthrough ot the frail - looking and fragile nymphet that ’s mostly celebrated .
Here , the dominance is physically displayed !
Gainers are part of a larger subculture in fat fetishism .
This term refers to those who aim to gain weight by feeding themselves .
Gainer and feedee are most often used interchangeably , although one difference may be that feedees may enjoy being fed by feeders .
Feeders are aroused by serving a gainer ( or feedee ) food and watch their partner gain weight .
There are many other participants in this community who may encourage others to gain weight .
One particularly fun activity is stuffing .
The gainer or feedee is fed until their bellies are bloated .
This act could also be titilating to a maiesiophile , one who is aroused by the appearance of pregnancy .
Unfortunately , there are no 600 - FT tall amazons on a murderous rampage in America , or else giant fetishists would be living in paradise .
However , creativity and technology somehow birthed out materials of all kinds that can easily stimulate a big fan of big women .
GiantessGirls and GiantessIsland feature beautiful women the size of Chrysler buildings .
Erotic literature , movies , and magazines cultivate this fantasy .
Fat fetishism presents a double - standard .
While it celebrates body image , some might perceive it as a negative objectification of one ’s weight , and also encourages unhealthy weight gain .
But , to indulge every now and then ca n’t be a bad thing .
If I had someone feeding me Haagan - Daas until I puked , then I would n’t say I had a bad night .
What I love most is the absurdity of these fetishes .
But , that ’s what makes them fun !
Of course , certain fantasies are taken more seriously than others .
They might require costumes , scripts , and props .
Others … well , what do you have in your fridge ?
Next time , we ’ll explore all of the gooey , messy , wet fun we can have !

John Mayer : Just Half of My Heart
Seven - time Grammy Award winning musician John Mayer ’s new album Battle Studies was released on Tuesday .
And if Mayer has ever been successful at putting all of his pessimism about romance into a single album , then Battle Studies is the one .
“ It ’s one record about one thing , ” Mayer said .
The underlying emotional tone that runs throughout the songs in the album is one of discomfort with close relationships and a relatively pervasive dark , dysphoric mood .
Most of the songs in his album convey a sense of skepticism about love , lovers and anyone looking and passing judgment from the outside in .
Mayer was interviewed by Steven Daley this week in Details Magazine :
Daley wrote , “ From the opening track , the U2 - redolent Heartbreak Warfare , it ’s clear that the musician who ingratiated his way into the nation ’s heart with soft - serve hits like Your Body Is a Wonderland and Daughters has entered a new phase .
The record revives the spirit of that most maligned of 20th - century art forms , adult - oriented rock , channeling the likes of Peter Gabriel , Sting , and Dire Straits , and reflects how assured Mayer has become .
Battle Studies may well force some of his detractors to admit that the man they used to view as Dave Matthews ’ cocky little nephew has grown up some . ”
Mayer described his own thoughts about having to cope with his public face as a celebrity and with his detractors in the media , as opposed to Mayer the musician : “ What do you think is stronger : a dozen press articles that say I ’m this guy , or a record with 10 songs on it that you enjoy ?
Which has greater staying power ?
At the end of the day , all I owe the world in exchange for my dumb face being in their lives are the 10 songs every couple years that are hopefully of greater magnitude than somebody ’s press story about me . ”

Has the course of History been directed by a small group of people with common interests ?
The paintings and pictures of the great men of the past centuries reveal a common thread which links them together .
Is it a coincidence that many of them hid one of their hands when posing for a portrait ?
It seems unlikely .
We ’ll look at the Masonic origin of the “ hidden hand ” and the powerful men who used the sign in famous portraits .
“ Today ’s thinking toward a democratic world state is neither a new trend nor an accidental circumstance ; the work of setting up the background of knowledge necessary to the establishing of enlightened democracy among all nations has been carried on for many hundreds of years by secret societies . ”
- Manly P. Hall , Secret Destiny of America
Is there a hidden force behind the world events of the past centuries ?
Are the fall of European monarchies , the bringing forth of the Age of Enlightenment and our path towards a world democracy part of a great plan lead by a “ hidden hand ” ?
Before the advent of mass media , portraits depicting their leaders in majestic poses were the only artifacts people had .
Do these portraits have an occult meaning ?
One of those poses is the “ hiding of the hand ” .
I remember my history teacher trying to explain why Napoleon was often shown with a hand inside his shirt .
The common explanation went along these lines :
“ Many theories have been presented as to why Napoleon is traditionally depicted with his hand in his waistcoat .
Some of these theories include : he had a stomach ulcer , he was winding his watch , he had an itchy skin disease , in his era it was impolite to put your hands in your pockets , he had breast cancer , he had a deformed hand , he kept a perfumed sachet in his vest that he ’d sniff surreptitiously , and that painters do n’t like to paint hands ”
- Tom Holmberg
Unless all the individuals discussed in this article had a stomach ulcer or deformed hands , the gesture of hiding one ’s hand simply has to have a specific meaning .
It does .
Most of the people using this sign are proven ( and often enthusiastic ) members of the Freemasons .
Considering the great importance of this gesture in Masonic rituals and the fact that all of the elite were either part of Freemasonry or knew of it , it is simply impossible that the recurrence of this sign could be the result of a coincidence .
The “ hidden hand ” can , in fact , be found in the rituals of the Royal Arch Degree of Freemasonry and the world leaders that use this sign are subtly saying to other initiates of the order : “ This is what I ’m part of , this is what I believe in and this is what I ’m working for ” .
The Royal Arch Degree
The Royal Arch Degree ( the 13th degree of the Scottish Rite or the 7th degree of the York Rite ) is also known as the Mason of the Secret .
During this Degree , initiates are said to receive great Masonic truths .
“ The members of this Degree are denominated companions , and are “ entitled to a full explanation of the mysteries of the Order ” ; whereas in the former Degrees they are recognized by the common , familiar appellation of brothers , and kept in a state of profound ignorance of the sublime secret which is disclosed in this Chapter .
This accords with the custom of Pythagoras , who thus distinguished his pupils .
After a probation of five years , as stated before , they were admitted into the presence of the preceptor , called his companions , and permitted to converse with him freely .
Previous to the expiration of that term he delivered his instructions to them from behind a screen ”
- John Fellows , Fellows ’s Inquiry into the Origin , History , and Purport of Freemasonry
“ If we pass on to the Royal Arch , we receive a wonderful accession of knowledge , and find every thing made perfect ; for this is the nec plus ultra of Masonry , and can never be exceeded by any human institution . ”
- George Oliver , Lectures on Freemasonry
It is during this degree that the initiate learns the sacred name of God .
“ A Degree indescribably more august , sublime , and important than any which precede it , and is , in fact , the summit and perfection of ancient Masonry .
It impresses upon our minds a belief in the being of a God , without beginning of days or end of years , the great and incomprehensible Alpha and Omega , and reminds us of the reverence which is due to His Holy NAME . ”
- George Oliver , Historical Landmarks
This holy name is Jahbulon , a combination of words meaning “ god ” in Syriac , Chaldaic , and Egyptian .
“ JEHOVAH .
Of the varieties of this sacred name in use among the different nations of the earth , three particularly merit the attention of Royal Arch Masons : 1 . JAH .
This name of God is found in the 68th Psalm , v. 4 .
2 . BAAL OR BEL .
This word signifies a lord , master , or possessor , and hence it was applied by many of the nations of the East to denote the Lord of all things , and the Master of the world .
3 . ON .
This was the name by which JEHOVAH was worshiped among the Egyptians . ”
- Malcolm C. Duncan , Duncan ’s Masonic Ritual and Monitor
The initiation ritual to this degree re-enacts the return to Jerusalem of three Most Excellent Masons who were held captive in Babylon .
I wo n’t go through the whole ceremony and symbolism but at one point , the initiate is asked to learn a secret password and a hand sign in order to go through a series of veils .
The following image depicts the hand sign required to go through the second veil , as documented in Duncan ’s Masonic Ritual and Monitor :
“ Master of Second Veil : “ Three Most Excellent Masters you must have been , or thus far you could not have come ; but farther you cannot go without my words , sign , and word of exhortation .
My words are Shem , Japhet , and Adoniram ; my sign is this : ( thrusting his hand in his bosom ) ; it is in imitation of one given by God to Moses , when He commanded him to thrust his hand into his bosom , and , taking it out , it became as leprous as snow .
My word of exhortation is explanatory of this sign , and is found in the writings of Moses , viz. , fourth chapter of Exodus ” : “ And the Lord said unto Moses , Put now thine hand into thy bosom .
And he put his hand into his bosom ; and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow ” .
- Malcolm C. Duncan , Duncan ’s Masonic Ritual and Monitor
As stated above , this hand gesture is said to be inspired by Exodus 4:6 .
In this biblical verse , the heart ( “ bosom ” ) stands for what we are , the hand for what we do .
It can thus be interpreted as : What we are is what we ultimately do .
The symbolic significance of this gesture might explain the reason why it is so widely used by famous Masons .
The hidden hand lets the other initiates know that the individual depicted is part of this secret Brotherhood and that his actions were inspired by the Masonic philosophy and beliefs .
Furthermore , the hand that executes the actions is hidden behind cloth , which can symbolically refer to the covert nature of the Mason ’s actions .
Here are some of the famous men who used this hand signal .
Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon Bonaparte ( 1769 - 1821 ) was a military and political leader of France whose actions shaped European politics in the early 19th century .
He was initiated into Army Philadelphia Lodge in 1798 .
His brothers , Joseph , Lucian , Louis , and Jerome , were also Freemasons .
Five of the six members of Napoleon ’s Grand Counsel of the Empire were Freemasons , as were six of the nine Imperial Officers and 22 of the 30 Marshals of France .
Bonaparte ’s association with Masonry has always been played down in historical records .
Masonic researcher J.E.S. Tuckett addresses the situation :
“ It is strange that evidence in favor of the Great Napoleon ’s membership of the Masonic Brotherhood has never been examined in detail , for the matter is surely one of interest , and – seeing the remarkable part that remarkable men played in the affairs of Europe , at a time when Continental Freemasonry was struggling out of chaos into regular order – it cannot be without an important bearing upon Masonic history ”
In his essay on Napoleon and Masonry , Tuckett claims :
“ There is incontestable evidence that Napoleon was acquainted with the nature , aims and organization of Freemasonry : that he approved of and made use of it to further his own ends ”
- J.E.S. Tuckett , Napoleon I and Freemasonry ( source )
Napoleon was also said to be aided by occult powers .
In 1813 he was defeated at Leipzip and behind him was a “ Cabinet of Curiosities ” in which a Prussian officer discovered his Book of Fate and Oraculum .
Originally this Oraculum was discovered in one of the Royal tombs of Egypt during a French military expedition of 1801 .
The emperor ordered the manuscript to be translated by a famous German scholar and antiquarian .
From that time onward , the Oraculum was one of Napoleon ’s most treasured possessions .
He consulted it on many occasions and it is said to have “ formed a stimulus to his most speculative and most successful enterprises . ”
Karl Marx
Karl Marx is known today to be the founder of modern Communism .
Despite being denied by some Masons , Marx is said to have been a 32nd degree Grand Orient Freemason .
Marx became the spokesman of the atheist and socialist movements of Europe .
He planned the replacement of monarchies with socialist republics , with the next step conversion to communist republics .
George Washington
George Washington was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and is considered to be the “ most important American Mason ” .
Charles Willson Pealed produced this painting when Washington was 52 years old .
Notice the position of Washington ’s feet : they form an oblong square .
The position of the feet is of utmost importance in Masonic symbolism .
Compare this with this excerpt from Duncan ’s Ritual Monitor :
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is considered to be one of the most prolific and influential composers of music ever .
He also was a Freemason and was initiated in the Austrian lodge Zur Zur Wohltatigkeit on Dec. 14th , 1784 .
Mozart ’s creations often incorporated important Masonic elements .
The Magic Flute opera was mainly based on Masonic principles .
“ The music of the Freemasons contained musical phrases and forms that held specific semiotic meanings .
For example , the Masonic initiation ceremony began with the candidate knocking three times at the door to ask admittance .
This is expressed musically as a dotted figure : meanings .
For example ,
This figure appears in Mozart ’s opera The Magic Flute in the overture , suggesting the opening of the Masonic initiation . ”
– Katherine Thompson , The Masonic Thread in Mozart
The musical progression of The Magic Flute was based on the Golden Ratio ( 1,6180 … ) , the proportion of everything that is considered divine by Mystery Schools .
Here are compositions created by Mozart for use in Masonic lodges :
Lied ( song )
“ Gesellenreise , for use at the installation of new journeymen ”
Cantata for tenor and male chorus Die Maurerfreude ( “ The Mason ’s Joy ” )
The Masonic Funeral Music ( Maurerische Trauermusik )
Two songs to celebrate the opening of “ Zur Neugekrönten Hoffnung ”
Cantata for tenor and piano , Die ihr die unermesslichen Weltalls Schöpfer ehrt
The Little Masonic Cantata ( Kleine Freimaurer - Kantate ) entitled Laut verkünde unsre Freude , for soloists , male chorus , and orchestra
Marquis de Lafayette
Marquis de Lafayette was a 33rd degree Freemason .
According to Willam R. Denslow ’s 10,000 Famous Freemasons , Lafayette was a French military officer who was a general in the American Revolutionary War and a leader of the Garde Nationale during the bloody French Revolution .
Lafayette was also made an honorary Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of New York .
More than 75 Masonic bodies in the U.S. have been named after him , including 39 lodges , 18 chapters , 4 councils , 4 commanderies , and 7 Scottish rite bodies .
Salomon Rothschild
Salomon Rothschild was the founder of the Viennese branch of the prominent Mayer Amschel Rothschild family .
The most powerful family in the world has greatly influenced the policies of Germany , France , Italy , and Austria .
The Rothschilds are also the main players behind the creation of Zionism and the state of Israel .
The power of the Rothschilds went way beyond the confines of the Masonic lodge .
They are said to be part of the 13 “ Illuminati Bloodlines ” .
An analysis of the recently built Supreme Court of Israel ( read the article here ) confirms the Rothschild ’s embrace of Masonic symbolism .
Simon Bolivar
Known as “ El Libertador ” ( the Liberator ) , Bolivar is considered to be the “ George Washington of South America ” .
He joined Freemasonry in Cadiz , Spain , received the Scottish Rite degrees in Paris and was knighted in a Commandery of Knights Templar in France in 1807 .
Bolivar founded and served as master of Protectora de las Vertudes Lodge No. 1 in Venezuela .
The country of Bolivia is named after him .
Bolivar also served as the president of Colombia , Peru and Bolivia in the 1820’s .
He belonged to the Order and Liberty Lodge No. 2 in Peru .
Notice in the image above the position of his feet ( oblong square ) and the checkerboard pattern of the floor , also Masonic .
His stance might have been inspired by the Knights of Christian Mark Degree as depicted below in Richardson ’s Monitor of Freemasonry :
Joseph Stalin
Stalin ’s reign of terror in the Soviet Union lead to the deaths of millions of his own countrymen .
He is often shown in pictures using the hidden hand gesture .
No official records have been found that prove Stalin ’s initiation into Masonry .
Of course , dictators such as Stalin tightly controlled all information concerning themselves and their affairs , making it difficult to prove anything one way or the other .
The hiding of his hand , however , provides an initiate ’s clue to his possible allegiance to an occult brotherhood .
In Conclusion
As seen above , thee leaders using the “ hidden hand ” gesture had a great influence on world history and many were confirmed Masons .
This gesture is an obvious yet widely overlooked detail that hints at the leader ’s embrace of occult philosophy .
By understanding this fact and by recognizing the IMMENSE influence these leaders had on the course of history , we can begin to realize the hidden force which is currently steering the world toward international democracy .
Members of these brotherhoods might have maintained different opinions and even adhered to different factions ( communism vs. capitalism ) , but the fundamental philosophy , beliefs , and ultimate goals are still the same : the coming of an “ Age of Reason and Enlightenment ” .
Of course , any serious researcher is already aware of the role of Masonry in the unfolding of world history .
The “ hidden hand ” gesture , so often used by historical figures is simply the outward expression of this little - known fact .
As Confucius said , “ Signs and symbols rule the world , not words nor laws . ”
These people ’s words and policies will eventually be twisted and forgotten , but their image will remain for the ages .
In pictures : Sauce secrets revealed The " original recipes " for Lea and Perrins ( L&P ) Worcestershire sauce may have been found by one the firm 's former employees , a museum has said .
Brian Keogh was the L&P accountant then an archivist on his retirement in 1991 .
The late employee found rough , encoded notes about ingredients for the secret recipe in a skip by the firm 's Midland Road site , Worcester Museum said .
The notes date from the mid 1800s and the museum said it would conduct handwriting analysis to verify them .
Mr Keogh wrote a book called The Secret Sauce and it is believed he used the notes found in the early 1980s as his source material .
' Source of pride '
He collected many items connected with L&P and died in 2006 aged 80 .
His daughter Bonnie Clifford is now working with Worcester Museum to have his collection put on public display .
Sauce ingredients water - 20 1/2 lbs cloves - 2 lbs salt - 10 lbs sugar - 34 lbs soy - 8 gallons fish - 24 lbs vinegar - 18 gallons acetic acid - 2 gallons essence of lemons - 8 oz peppers - 5 lbs tamoraide - 14 lbs pickles - 40 lbs Worcester City Museums collections officer David Nash said : " There has always been a lot of secrecy surrounding the recipes and pride that it is made locally .
" It would be significant to the people of Worcester and maybe even attract national interest if they are proved to be genuine . "
A Heinz spokesman for Lea and Perrins said : " We are delighted to hear that a number of archive items from the history of Lea & Perrins have been found in safe keeping by the daughter of the company 's former archivist . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

The hand - written notes were found in two , leather - bound folios , written in sepia ink in two different people 's handwriting .
A sticker in one of the books confirms it was purchased from a stationer 's at 61 Broad Street , Worcester , next door to the original L&P chemist shop at 63 Broad Street .
Mr Nash said : " Not even the staff knew the whole recipe , only parts of it , which would account for the different handwriting , and some of the ingredients were written in code .
" For example you would see ' add 1lb of bulldog , or bulldog clip , or bull car ' , but even with all the ingredients there is no guarantee you would be able to make the sauce as what makes it distinctive is the way it is made , which is still a secret . "
However , the ingredients were written in plainer English for the accountant to work out their constituent costs .

On Monday , Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will deliver a national apology to the " Forgotten Australians " - some 500,000 children sent to orphanages between 1930 and 1970 .
In 1950 , six - year - old Sandra Anker thought she was being sent to Africa on a wild adventure , but she ended up in Melbourne - " exiled " as she calls it .
It 's been nearly 16 years since Leon Lett taught the world to not touch the ball after a missed field goal .
( Crap , I " m old . )
Sadly , current high school kids were too young to learn that lesson .
A high school football game ended tragically this weekend , when a potential game - winning field by Jericho Mount Mansfield in Vermont — that 's the school , not the kicker 's name — fell very short and into the arms of a waiting Otter Valley player .
Otter Valley had just finished a remarkable comeback to take a 2 - point lead with 16 seconds left and the missed desperation field goal as time expired seemed to seal the deal .

Except the Otter Valley player took the ball on the fly , ran out of the end zone with his arms raised in celebration , then spiked the ball on the ground .
As the former Dallas Cowboy could tell you , the play was not yet dead .
An alert Mount Mansfield player scooped up the ball and ran into the end zone .
Touchdown .
Game over .
Why the coach put two players back to receive the kick may never be known , but we wo n't name him or the player out or respect for their loved ones .

Its Big and its Blinking .
Science Ficrtion , Music , whatever is interesting !
The Bay Bridge reopened this morning , after six long days , but it could close down for a more permanent fix to a cracked eyebar in another few months .
Caltrans officials said this afternoon that the repairs they worked on meticulously for the past six days made the Bay Area 's busiest toll bridge safe .
But they 're investigating a number of other long - term solutions that would require less monitoring and maintenance .
" It is a temporary fix , " said Richard Land , Caltrans ' chief engineer .
" But a long - term solution might be needed .
Right now the plan is not to keep the current ( repair ) in place long term . "
Caltrans engineers are analyzing a number of long - term repairs that people inside and outside the agency have suggested , Land said , including replacement of the cracked eyebar - a major undertaking .
Instead of designing the repairs under time pressure , with the bridge closed and commuters fuming , Caltrans would plan the work and schedule a closure , perhaps in four to five months , he said .
The length of the closure would depend on the type of repair chosen .
The work that crews performed since Tuesday , when a repair to fix to a cracked structural beam came crashing down on the upper deck , allowed Caltrans to reopen the bridge just after 9 a.m. today .
Tests conducted overnight and this morning on an altered version of that repair job showed that the fix was holding , Caltrans spokesman Bart Ney said .
At 9:01 a.m. , a fleet of five California Highway Patrol cars escorted the first private vehicles allowed onto the westbound upper deck since the span was shut down Tuesday evening .
About 10 minutes later , the lower deck reopened for traffic heading to the East Bay .
" We 're happy to be returning the Bay Bridge to public service , " Ney said .
However , hundreds of commuters heeded Caltrans ' warning Sunday that the Bay Bridge would not be open for the morning commute , jamming other Bay Area bridges and crowding on to BART .
BART reported that transbay ridership was up 85 percent this morning .
The agency said that even though the bridge was open , it would run longer trains for the evening commute to accommodate the extra surge in riders .
Overnight , crews were able to " get the geometry " in place with respect to key parts on the bridge and conduct stress tests on the cracked beam , Ney said .
" What changed is we got the steel into alignment , so we were able to go forward with the stressing , " Ney said .
" Safety is our priority , " he said .
" Clearly , we have taken our time with implementing this . "
On Tuesday evening , high winds and heavy traffic created vibrations that loosened a pair of tie rods and a steel bracket installed over the Labor Day weekend to take pressure off a fracture discovered in a structural beam - an eyebar - on the eastern span .
The 5,000 - pound assembly crashed onto the upper deck , damaging three cars but causing no serious injuries .
After fixing the tie-rods and bracket assembly last week , work crews performed a stress test Saturday evening on the repairs to see if the metal parts continued to scrape against each other and weaken the overall assembly .
Halfway through the three - hour test , workers declared the repairs a failure because the tie rods were continuing to scrape together .
After taking a seven - hour break starting about midnight Saturday , work crews spent Sunday realigning the assembly and grinding and smoothing the metal parts .
During stress test late Sunday , workers used a mechanism to pull at the entire assembly , which allows them to measure the amount of strain it can withstand .
Ney said Caltrans would be conducting daily inspections of the repaired area of the span , just east of the S - curve , to ensure it is holding .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Astronomers have seen the furthest back in time ever , measuring light from a star that exploded 13 billion years ago , just after the dawn of the universe .
They traced a gamma-ray burst called GRB 090423 to see the light from the massive star that died 630 million years after the Big Bang that brought the universe into being , they reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday .
Two separate teams measured the redshift of the object at about 8.2 .
Redshift is the distortion of light as it travels across space and time and is often likened to the sound of a train rising and falling as it approaches and passes the listener .
This extreme redshift -- the highest ever recorded -- shows the burst occurred when the universe was less than 5 percent of its current age , Nial Tanvir of Britain ’s University of Leicester and colleagues reported .
“ The redshift measured for GRB 090423 means that the burst occurred at a time when the universe was about nine times smaller than it is today -- putting the timing of the event at about 630 million years after the Big Bang , ” Bing Zhang of the University of Nevada wrote in a commentary .
“ Gamma ray bursts are the most violent explosions in the universe , ” he added .
“ They are believed to be associated with the formation of stellar - sized black holes or rapidly rotating , highly magnetized neutron stars during cataclysmic events such as the collapse of a massive star or the coalescence of two compact stellar objects . ”
In this case , the star ’s death long ago was bright enough to outshine even galaxies and will help scientists understand what happened in the early days of the universe .

If you want to see the devastating effects of regulation , look no further than the New York City housing market .
As a former director in a municipal housing agency , I often wondered why property owners would come into my office ready to sign over their deeds .
As a current property owner and developer , the reason is now all too clear .
Battling all of the regulations imposed upon me , I often wonder , Who owns this property anyway ?
In the Big Apple , there are several agencies having direct jurisdiction over the housing market and several other agencies whose actions impinge upon housing .
These agencies employ several thousand employees whose only job is to " get the landlord . "
Even those programs that seem landlord oriented — rehabilitation financing , for example — are really tenant - oriented programs designed to keep rents low and to exert more bureaucratic control over the market .
" Government intervention in the housing market leads to further and further intervention . "
In NYC , all housing - related matters have been extracted from the NYS Supreme Court and placed under the jurisdiction of Housing Court .
This was done so that more favorable tenant - oriented decisions could be rendered .
It is interesting to note that many Housing Court judges are my former coworkers from the Housing Department .
The administration of Housing Court justice is not exactly blind .
Let us just say that in housing matters , Lady Liberty leans heavily in one direction .
The Historical Setting
During the 1960s and ' 70s , the city 's housing stock was devastated .
Once-viable neighborhoods succumbed to the ills of decay , crime , and abandonment .
As a graduate student at Columbia in the early ' 80s , I can relate to you the shock of traveling from mid-town Manhattan via Broadway to the campus in Morningside Heights .
It was astonishing to believe that I was traveling through the financial capital of the world .
Neighborhoods such as Bedford Stuyvesant , Harlem , and Brownsville became worldwide examples of urban decay .
While doing a market study of East New York , I was dumbfounded to see that virtually every other house was abandoned .
Neighborhoods that I often visited as a child were now desolate and oppressive .
To counter the perception of blight , the agency once devised a plan to board up windows in abandoned buildings using plywood painted with flower pots and curtains .
The idea was to hide this devastated housing from out - of - town commuters traveling to Manhattan via the Cross Bronx Expressway !
Abandonment grew to such an extent that vacancy rates in lower - income neighborhoods hovered around 2 % .
Decent families virtually could not find a place in which to live .
Finding a decent apartment required an " old- boy network " and the ability to pay key money .
I witnessed all of this happening from a key vantage point — my office at the municipal agency that was responsible for preserving and developing housing !
Neighborhood Change
Neighborhoods have life cycles and , as they change , they provide housing opportunities for those lower on the income scale — if the market in these neighborhoods is left to operate freely .
This economic concept is referred to as filtration .
As high - income people vacate a unit to occupy newer , more luxurious housing , the vacated unit becomes available to those of less economic means .
It is a win - win situation for all .
The problem begins when the City requires that landlords maintain the same level of services even though the lower rent received can no longer support it .
As landlords cut back on those nonessential services , the City regulators step up their compliance efforts and begin bombarding the building with violations .
Tenants then file for a rent reduction due to a reduction in services .
Some tenants see the opportunity to withhold rent .
The downward spiral in rent collection begins .
Eventually rents are so reduced and uncollectable that basic services can no longer be provided .
More violations pile up .
The property owner can no longer support the building and it is sold and resold until it winds up in the hands of a speculator who milks the building as best he can before walking away .
This is a common scenario , which I have witnessed hundreds of times during my 15 - year employment with the City of New York .
In fact , abandonment was so great that at one point I supervised the management of over 7,000 units in a City receivership - type program .
This does not include the thousands of units that the City directly owned through tax foreclosure .
Magnify the above scenario thousands of times and you get a full picture of the urban blight that confronted New Yorkers .
Decent tenants would no longer remain in these neighborhoods and the vacant buildings became a heaven for junkies and for all kinds of antisocial behavior .
This is the result of intervention usually pushed by interest groups determined to supplant the landlord .
I once appraised a building whose tenants posted a large sign at the building entrance stating , " Buyers Beware .
This is a City Managed Building . "
The idea was to discourage all potential free - market ownership .
For many years the tactic worked .
A One - Sided Burden
The New York City Housing - Maintenance Code places the burden of repair solely on the landlord .
If a tenant creates a hazardous condition , the owner must repair — no matter what the cost is .
Some tenants became very adept at creating violation - inducing conditions .
I once inspected a building that had just been rehabilitated using City money .
Some tenants were withholding their rents , and the owner was having difficulty repaying the loan .
The reason these tenants were withholding rent was that some tiles in the bathroom had become unglued !
" To counter the perception of blight , the agency once devised a plan to board up windows in abandoned buildings using plywood painted with flower pots and curtains . "
As the legions of Code Enforcement inspectors add on violations , the fines begin to pile up .
Eventually , the case is referred to the Litigation Bureau , where City attorneys institute legal action .
The landlord is fined and forced into a compliance agreement .
If he fails to make repairs , he is held in contempt and subject to imprisonment .
The inability to collect rent is no defense .
Nevertheless , the Court never asks who caused the violation .
Tenants are never fined or required to correct any violation that they created .
Fines can be steep .
The penalty for hot water 1 degree below the legal limit is $ 250 per day until the violation is corrected .
In the meantime , tenants can withhold rent .
The landlord is always at a disadvantage because he must hire an attorney while tenants can use the " impartial " attorneys in the housing agency to press their case .
Legal Expropriation
After so many violations are piled on a building that the landlord is unable to correct them , the City employs one of its most confiscatory tactics — an Article 7A Proceeding .
Article 7A of the NYS Real Property Law authorizes the City to petition the Housing Court for the appointment of an administrator to manage the building in lieu of the owner .
Once the administrator is appointed , the owner cannot enter his building without permission and cannot collect rent .
Of course , he must still pay his property taxes !
Although the administrator is charged with the removal of housing - code violations , it is interesting to note that this is seldom accomplished .
Additionally , once a building is in the 7A Program , Code - Enforcement inspectors are not authorized to issue additional violations unless specifically requested by their supervisors .
If only the property owner had this luxury !
The payment of property taxes is last on the administrator 's list of things to do .
As a result , taxes continue to pile on and eventually the property is subject to in rem proceedings and becomes City owned .
After the building is rehabilitated by the City at the taxpayer 's expense , it is sold to community residents for $ 250 per unit .
The property owner , however , receives no compensation for the loss of his building , and the taxpayer continues to subsidize the property .
The 7A administrator is given a host of special privileges that are never accorded a private owner .
He is not subject to City - sponsored litigation .
He is not fined , and he is not imprisoned for his failure to provide building upkeep .
Tenants seldom bring action against an administrator .
If they do , a representative of the housing agency appears in court to support the administrator .
In fact , a 7A Administrator bears no personal liability while he is acting in his capacity as administrator .
It becomes evident , then , that government intervention in the housing market leads to further and further intervention .
As each tactic fails to cure the problem , more has to be done .
Eventually , all value is stripped from the property and the City becomes the owner .
In the end , the intervention has achieved very little because the property continues to degenerate and tenant living conditions do not improve .
The Inequity of Rent Control
As a real - estate investor , price ceilings do not bother me as much as the forms of regulation described above .
I calculate building value according to the discounted cash flow available .
However , rent control does create a serious problem of equity — something that politicians and bureaucrats are constantly clamoring about .
You can find numerous examples of someone living in a rent - controlled apartment , usually acquired through the right of succession , paying substantially less rent than someone living in a decontrolled or rent - stabilized apartment of the same type in the same building .
Property owners need to charge more for the decontrolled unit to make up for the loss they are taking on the rent - controlled unit .
So once again , government 's efforts to foster equality generate inequality .
I am not arguing in favor of rent control .
In the past , price ceilings have had a devastating effect on the NYC real - estate market .
However , since they affect a smaller percentage of units than do the other forms of regulation , they are no longer as devastating to the market in general .
Every multiple dwelling in the city is subject to housing - code violations , rent reductions , Housing - Court action , and possible City extortion through an Article 7A proceeding .
The Essence of Government Regulation
Why does government continue to interfere in the housing market when the results of that intervention are so devastating ?
The answer is simple : local interest groups organize and pressure City Hall for action .
In NYC there are dozens of community groups that devote a substantial portion of their time to housing matters .
Most of these groups are subsidized by taxpayer dollars .
Even the now - infamous ACORN operated in the city , agitating tenants to organize against building owners guilty of even the slightest infraction — real or imagined .
Most of these housing pressure groups are left - leaning and believe that housing is a fundamental right of all — rent paying or not .
I have often discussed building issues with community group representatives who spoke in terms of the " struggle . "
They were often surprised to find out that I was a supporter of free - market capitalism .
Pressure from these community groups distorted the actions of most local politicians .
These politicians were often allied with these local groups and beholden to them for votes .
Municipal bureaucrats were often allied with these groups to gain favor with the local politician .
The result of this was the intervention in the market and the disastrous consequences that followed .
The Rebirth of the Central Cities
New York City has gone through a spectacular rebirth during the past 20 years .
Neighborhoods like Harlem , Williamsburg , and areas of the Bronx are much sought - after these days .
However , this rebirth is the result of macroeconomic trends set in motion by the Reagan revolution of the ' 80s and carried on by Clinton and Bush — not of the failed regulatory attempts of government .
As the investment climate in the United States improved in the ' 80s , jobs were created and investment capital came into being .
Much of this capital found its way to the real - estate market .
Once - shunned neighborhoods were again the focus of investors and developers .
People from all over the world came to NYC seeking jobs and investment opportunities .
They also occupied the housing units rehabilitated by private developers .
In addition , with the election of Rudy Giuliani as NYC Mayor , many of the regulatory activates of his predecessors were scaled back .
The 7A unit was disbanded , and buildings were no longer taken in rem .
Instead , tax liens were sold to private entities .
This gave landlords a greater opportunity to reclaim their properties through negotiations with the servicer .
The entire inventory of City - owned housing was put on the market and returned to the private sector .
Confidence in the city was restored through these , and other , private sector initiatives .
Mayor Bloomberg for the most part continued the free - market policies of his predecessor .
Even with the current real - estate meltdown , New York City is in better shape than most big cities in the United States .
So for those clamoring for increased government regulation , I have only one piece of advice : take a look at the disastrous consequences of government intervention in the housing market .
The results are bound to change your mind about the effectiveness of government action .
To my mind , this is n't the right year to celebrate Brand Israel , or to demonstrate an ostrich - like
indifference to the realities ( cinematic and otherwise ) of the region , or to pointedly ignore the international
economic boycott campaign against Israel .
Launched by Palestinian NGO 's in 2005 , and since joined by
thousands inside and outside Israel , the campaign is seen as the last hope for forcing Israel to comply with
international law .
By ignoring this boycott , TIFF has emphatically taken sides -- and in the process , forced
every filmmaker and audience member who opposes the occupation to cross a type of picket line .
The emphasis on ' diversity ' in City to City is empty given the absence of Palestinian filmmakers in the program .
Furthermore , what this description does not say is that Tel Aviv is built on destroyed Palestinian villages , and that the city of Jaffa , Palestine ’s main cultural hub until 1948 , was annexed to Tel Aviv after the mass exiling of the Palestinian population .
This program ignores the suffering of thousands of former residents and descendants of the Tel Aviv / Jaffa area who currently live in refugee camps in the Occupied Territories or who have been dispersed to other countries , including Canada .
Looking at modern , sophisticated Tel Aviv without also considering the city ’s past and the realities of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza strip , would be like rhapsodizing about the beauty and elegant lifestyles in white - only Cape Town or Johannesburg during apartheid without acknowledging the corresponding black townships of Khayelitsha and Soweto .
John Greyson 's entirely reasonable decision to protest the Toronto International Film Festival 's City - to - City spotlight on Tel - Aviv ( and the supporting letter from a group of activists , artists and intellectuals such as Naomi Klein , Jane Fonda and Slavoj Zizek ) has been predictably distorted and misrepresented by Israel 's backers .
Greyson cites the war in Gaza ( for which both Hamas and Israel were criticised for human rights abuses by the UN this week ) , the continuation of a long - established apartheid - style policy in the Occupied Territories as reason for his reluctance to allow his film ' Covered ' to be shown at a festival which turns a blind eye to the reality of Israel 's outrageous flouting of decency and international law :
The follow - up collective letter to the TIFF protests the spotlight also , correctly pointing out the uncomfortable fissure between a city such as Tel Aviv , that admittedly has its admirable qualities , and the grim reality of Israeli state policy :
Israel 's supporters have n't been long making their voices heard : Marvin Hier of the Simon Wisenthal Center told a press conference that " Tel Aviv is one of the freest cities in the world , warts and all : a model city of diversity , freedom of expression and tolerance , for Arabs and Jews . "
He added : " It is the height of hypocrisy to single out Tel Aviv .
These protesters cannot masquerade their hatred toward Israel . "
One need only point out the fact that the Tel Aviv distict population is comprised of only 2 % Palestinian Arabs , a shockingly low number for a city built on razed Arab villages , to show Hier 's model of diversity to be the nonsense it is .
Then a number of Hollywood Jews ( their words , not mine ) have signed a letter of counter - protest , employing some breathtaking hyperbole to denounce the anti-Israel protest as ' a blacklist ' , saying that " Blacklisting them [ Israeli films ] only stifles the exchange of cultural knowledge that artists should be the first to defend and protect .
Those who refuse to see these films for themselves or prevent them from being seen by others are violating a cherished right shared by Canada and all democratic countries . "
Let 's go back to what Greyson said in his letter ( my emphasis ) :
Let 's be clear : my protest is n't against the films or filmmakers you 've chosen .
I 've seen brilliant
works of Israeli and Palestinian cinema at past TIFFs , and will again in coming years .
My protest is against
the Spotlight itself , and the smug business - as - usual aura it promotes of a " vibrant metropolis [ and ] dynamic
young city ... commemorating its centennial " , seemingly untroubled by other anniversaries , such as the 42nd
anniversary of the occupation .
Is n't such an uncritical celebration of Tel Aviv right now akin to celebrating
Montgomery buses in 1963 , California grapes in 1969 , Chilean wines in 1973 , Nestles infant formula in
1984 , or South African fruit in 1991 ?
and the collective letter of support ( my emphasis once again ) :
We do not protest the individual Israeli filmmakers included in City to City , nor do we in any way suggest that Israeli films should be unwelcome at TIFF .
However , especially in the wake of this year ’s brutal assault on Gaza , we object to the use of such an important international festival in staging a propaganda campaign on behalf of what South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , former U.S. President Jimmy Carter , and UN General Assembly President Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann have all characterized as an apartheid regime .
Now , call me old - fashioned , but a diligent close reading of those two statements reveals to me no hatred of Israel or its film - makers but rather points out the iniquity of doing what is in effect propaganda work for the Israeli state .
I do n't blame the likes of David Cronenberg , Jerry Seinfeld or Minnie Driver for standing up for Israeli filmmakers and it's quite possible that their knowledge of the controversy was at best flimsy or distorted by the pre-drafted letter of protest they were asked to sign .
One must also bear in mind that the majority of the signatories are American , and in much of the US , on the left as well as the right , criticism of Israel is routinely tarred as anti-semitism .
But all those signatories should at the very least read the two letters as they were actually published .
There is no hatred of Israel nor is there any overly - emotive chest - beating .
As regular readers of this blog will know , I 'm a great admirer of recent Israeli cinema , particularly the films of Avi Mograbi , Ari Folman , Shlomi and Ronit Elkabetz , Eran Riklis , Raphaël Nedjari , Keren Yedaya and Eytan Fox .
Films by some of them were screened in the TIFF .
Israeli films deserve to be seen , not least because they sometimes offer an honest , objective account of Israeli society that is at odds with some of the brow - beating nationalism of right - wing Israelis and their Zionist supporters ( Fox 'sis , ironically , a clear - eyed account of Tel Aviv 's shortcomings as a ' diverse city ' ) .
But Israel , or Tel Aviv , cannot be treated the same as other countries as long as its government continues to flout international law , proceed with policies that border on ethnic cleansing , while at the same time having the gall to accuse those who oppose illegal West Bank settlements of supporting the same .
It is likewise disingenuous of an Israeli filmmaker such as Samuel Maoz to claim he might not have won the Golden Lion at Venice , as he did for his war film , had Jane Fonda or any other signatories been on the jury .
Israeli films get a fair crack of the whip in international film festivals and I know nobody who suggests that they should be boycotted or shunned .
Ken Loach was accused of censoring Tali Shalom Ezer 'sat the Edinburgh Film Festival last year when he called for a boycott .
But his target was not Shalom Ezer or his film , but rather the fact that the organizers had accepted money from the Israeli government to pay for Shalom - Ezer ’s travel costs .
It 's true that boycotts of Israel , be they academic or cultural , should be applied with care and discretion ( I have no qualms whatsoever about applying economic boycotts ) and though they are supported by some on the Israeli left , such as Ilan Pappe and Neve Gordon , they are opposed by others such as Uri Avnery .
It is also true that some of those who take a pro-Palestinian stance are motivated more by hatred of Israel than a sense of justice for Palestinians .
But the calls of protest against the Toronto International Film Festival were nothing but measured and reasonable .
Update
All credit to Roger Ebert , who , having initially condemned the protest , revised his position when presented with more facts .
He said
I 'm writing this the day after first posting this entry .
I now regret it .
The point I make about artists is perfectly valid but I realize I was n't prepared with enough facts about the events leading up to the Festival 's decision to showcase Tel Aviv in the City - to - City section .
I thought of it as an innocent goodwill gesture , but now realize it was part of a deliberate plan to " re- brand " Israel in Toronto , as a pilot for a larger such program .
The Festival should never have agreed to be used like this .
It 's a brave , honest retraction , and one which aims to please neither side of the debate .
It also confirms my suspicions mentioned above that some of the Hollywood figures that signed the condemnation of the protest might not themselves have been fully aware of the situation .
It all underlines the importance of getting information out to combat the hasbara lies .
Even staunch supporters of Israel can view things clearly when they are provided with the truth .
The October 31st holiday that we today know as Halloween has strong roots in paganism and is closely connected with worship of the Enemy of this world , Satan .
It is a holiday that generally glorifies the dark things of this world , rather than the light of Jesus Christ , The Truth .
Have you noticed how costumes and masks are getting generally more bloody , gory , and depraved each year ?
Unfortunately , the gruesome and grotesque and the occult are increasingly glorified in American society , not only on Halloween , but throughout the year in frequent horror movies and television programs .
My family does not celebrate it or participate in it .
We do not believe that our children are “ missing out , ” and neither do they .
Other days are used for costumes and parties .
Happily , all of our children have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior .
We have found that Halloween provides an excellent time to remind our children that , as Christians , we are different , and not of this world ( Heb. 11:13 - 16 ; 1 Pet. 2:11 ) .
What about church “ Harvest Festivals ” held on October 31 ?
Although we understand the rational and good intentions behind them , we do n’t think they are the best approach .
Our family tends to agree with the author of an article called “ Are ‘ Harvest Parties ’ for Christians ? ” ( written by a self - avowed former witch and now active Christian ) .
Harvest parties on October 31 tend to assume that “ our children need something to take the place of Halloween , since they wo n’t be participating in the secular and pagan celebrations .
It suggests our kids are missing out on something .
And indeed they are , if we allow them to spend Halloween in celebration . ”
There are better things to do on Halloween than partying .
Also , we need to teach our children that “ the fight is n’t against occultists , non-Christians , Christians who feel differently than we about Halloween , or institutions that promote Halloween , but ” “ against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this age , against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places ” ( Ephesians 6:12 , NKJV ) .
Relevant Scripture
Are October 31 “ Harvest Parties ” the best alternative for Christians ?
“ What are you doing for Halloween ? ” Ask a Christian parent this question , and be prepared to hear an answer like , “ Nothing !
We do n’t celebrate Halloween . “
Thunder crashes , and you creep away , embarassed for even asking .
“ What are you doing ON Halloween ? ”
Ask the same parent this slightly altered question , and their whole manner and response brightens .
“ Why , ” they begin , as birds begin to sing and sunshine breaks through the cumulus clouds .
“ We ’re all going to the Harvest Party at church ! ” A choir sings .
A trumpet sounds .
You feel privileged just knowing these saints .
Let ’s take a look at the typical Harvest Party .
It is a celebration .
It is chaperoned ( usually ) .
It may have costumes .
Games are played .
Contests are held .
Food abounds .
Music blares .
Everyone enjoys themselves .
Certainly , nothing to get concerned about , right ?
The problem , however , lies in the billing .
The Harvest Party is usually referred to as the Christian alternative to traditional Halloween hijinx .
Alternative , however , implies substitute .
It assumes our children need something to take the place of Halloween , since they wo n’t be participating in the secular and pagan celebrations .
It suggests our kids are missing out on something .
And indeed they are , if we allow them to spend Halloween in celebration .
If we are to train our children to be soldiers in the army of Christ , why would we sign a pass for them to go on leave when the battle is escalating on the front lines ?
As a child of four , I contacted the first of many spirit guides ( read : demons ) while playing with a Kindergarten classmates ’ ouija board at a chaperoned Halloween party .
This spiritual assault ignited an intrigue with the supernatural that culminated in my lifestyle as a practicing witch : divination , necromancy , channeling , astrology , psychic ability , and spell working .
It was n’t until I was twenty that I met the real Jesus Christ , and was released from the trap that Satan had set for this young prisoner of war sixteen years earlier .
There are too many casualities on Halloween and far too few troops fighing the enemy .
Instead of partying on Halloween , teach your children how to fight .
Keep them aware that the fight is n’t against occultists , non-Christians , Christians who feel differently than we about Halloween , or institutions that promote Halloween , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers or darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places ” ( Ephesians 6:12 ) .
How do we teach our children to wrestle spiritually ?
Instead of celebrating , what ’s a Christian to do on Satan ’s feast day ?
PRAY !
Intercession and spiritual warfare should be the first item on our agenda .
It is NOT a last resort !
Join with other families in the church .
Have the pastor announce a night of spiritual battle .
Organize a group of Christians parents and students from your children ’s school or homeschool group .
As a family , designate the seven nights before October 31 as Family Prayer Outreach nights .
Pray for protection .
Pray over both those who engage in prayer warfare and over those who will be out trick - or - treating or at Halloween parties .
October 31 is a prime recruiting time for witches and Satanists … and a time for interested kids to experiment .
Pray that the Lord keeps our kids from falling prey to those who worship the enemy .
Pray for discernment .
Let the Holy Spirit direct you to specific prayer requests .
Pray that the children who are “ out there ” will somehow “ know ” to keep away from certain activities .
Pray that the Lord hinder the occult rituals .
For four years , I lived in a building which over looked a cemetery where occult ceremonial markings were often found .
On certain occult feast days , usually between midnight and 3 a.m. , I would look down into the darkness and kneel at my window binding the demons that controlled the ceremonies .
I ’ll never know this side of heaven what effect my prayers had .
Maybe a potential sacrifice escaped .
Maybe the occultists were n’t successful in summoning their demon .
Maybe a new , young recruit decided that this was not the lifestyle he thought he wanted .
Pray for the salvation of the occultists .
Jesus Christ died for those whom Satan holds captive and deceived , for those who mock Him , who deny His deity or His existence .
He does n’t want them to perish , but to come to Him calling Him Father , Lord .
Pray the veil is lifted from their eyes , the Lord allows them to see clearly their spiritual condition and their only hope lies in Jesus Christ .
Pray also , about whether the Lord would have you take a more active role in bringing the gospel to Satan ’s servants .
Let your children know that this is effective warfare .
They must know their prayers are heard and acted on by our Father .
Let them know they can make a difference .
Come October 31 , they ’ll know they have a job to do .

October 6 , 2009 -- Latin Radical -- Democracy Now !
reporter Andres Corteris , inside the Brazil embassy with President Manuel Zelaya , says there may be a ``light at the end of the tunnel ' ' .
Elements within the military and business community that originally backed the coup are putting pressure on the Micheletti coup regime to negotiate .
Zelaya and his supporters are in good spirits , having just celebrated the birthday of the president 's grandchild .
He sends a gruff ``Saludos '' to community radio in Australia .
But for the people of Honduras the issue now goes far further than reinstating Zelaya .
They are demanding the constitutional reform and determined to defy the suspension of constitutional guarantees that has unleashed a wave of repression .

By Pedro Fuentes , international secretary of the Party of Socialism and Liberty ( PSOL , Brazil )
September 29 , 2009 -- Honduras --
“ Blood of martyrs , seeds of freedom ” was the slogan at the burial of Wendy , who died as a result of tear gas this weekend .
All “ awakening has its price ” and “ Honduras has awoken ” , an activist from a Communist Party background involved in the resistance told me at the ceremony for the comrade , held September 28 at the national cemetery .
Using Marxist terms , the comrade said that in Honduras this awakening has meant that the movement has taken “ a qualitative leap forward ” .
“ This is not the first person we have brought to the cemetery , officially , six comrades have already been buried , but there is a unknown number of people who have disappeared , of people that have been taken away and have not appeared , and people who they say have been killed for being criminals in clashes with the police ” .
On September 28 , the government began applying the state of siege decree .
Radio Globo and Channel 36 were close .
The military entered into their offices and looted them of all equipment .
That same day , the gathering of the resistance , which has been set daily at the Pedagogical University for the morning , was weak .
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that the protest was encircled by troops , there was no sense of vacillation or fear .
On the contrary , the comments had a radicalised tone , that more energetic measures had to be taken , there was even talk in the corridors of the need to move towards more direct actions .
The protest was able to march to STYBS [ the union of beverage workers ] .
It was a reflection of the general sentiment of rejection against the [ repressive ] measures among a broader section of the population , and not just by the great mass that is against the coup , but rather those sections of the middle class that reject the authoritarianism symbolised by the shutdown of the media outlets .
The mass rejection of the regime and the political parties that support it is visible at all times .
People talk about the ``corrupt ones ’’ to your face , a term very commonly used when people refer to politicians .
The procession to the cemetery was short , but the sympathy of the people was enormous ; the cars and trucks , above all else those that were transporting workers , saluted , beeped their horns and stopped to raised their fists in solidarity .
Support for the resistance
The fact is that even though the resistance has not been able to maintain daily and permanent mass mobilisations on the streets , popular support has been increasing .
The eruption of the masses occurred on September 15 , Independence Day .
On that day tens of thousands came out onto the streets .
Moreover , there are permanent strikes by academics and other sectors ; the teachers are on strike two days a week .
Some public buildings were occupied and until today the occupations of the National Agrarian Institute have been maintained , headed by Juan Barahona .
This comrade is one of the most charismatic leaders , together with Carlos H. Reyes , independent candidates for the presidency .
A very large , broad vanguard that has been forged in these 90 days [ since the coup ] , made up of workers , neighbourhood organisations , unions such as those of beverage workers and teachers , and peasant organisations with an important weight and history of struggle in Honduras .
It is a vanguard that has not kneeled down in the face of repression , that has suffered the break up of road blockades , and especially the day that the protest was broken up outside the Brazilian embassy where the repression was savage .
A young motorbike rider , no more than 22 years in age , showed me his back where I could see the marks left by the successive beatings he received in those confrontations , as he stood next to his proud partner .
A nurse with a Liberal Party flag told me how in the first few days she organised a health workers ’ front in Tegucigalpa .
“ We began with 10 nurses , but we spread out to assistants , medical workers and dentists with which we became a large organisation . ”
This organisation has clinic that is at the service of the sick and injured among the resistance .
It is worth recalling that throughout the two decades that followed the revolutionary upsurge of the 1980s , Honduras has been the country where the social movements have been the strongest in leading strikes and struggles .
Together with this vanguard , a radicalised section of President Manuel Zelaya ’s Liberal Party has brought new activists after the coup into the fold .
These are the sectors that make up the Resistance Front [ National Resistance Front Against the Coup ] , which has maintained revolutionary democratic mobilisations for more than 90 days and shows no signs of having been defeated or stepping back .
State of siege
The state of siege decreed by the coup regime has been aimed precisely at heading in the direction of a classic totalitarian regime ( I ’m referring to the dictatorships of the 1970s in Latin America ) in order to hold back the revolutionary democracy mobilisation underway and strengthen the regime .
The institution that appears to be the most intact is the army , which has not given any signs of fissures , it is the one that has remained most intact following the processes experienced in Central America and with a strong relationship with the upper bourgeois and the US Armed Forces .
But coup leader Roberto Micheletti’s decree backfired , because the parliament and all the presidential candidates rejected it .
This plan represented the continuation of Micheletti in power and an end to elections .
During a press conference early on September 28 , Micheletti , together with a group of parliamentarians , had to recognise that they would have to backtrack on this .
This [ does not ] mean that they will not unscrupulously utilise actions such as the shutting down of radio and TV stations and the ban on protests , but as a political strategy it has failed .
Divisions
This situation demonstrated the contradictions and incapacities of the dominant classes and a regime that more than a regime is a conglomerate of sectors with different positions , in the middle of a political crisis .
Even though all of them are against the resistance and the drift by Zelaya towards Bolivarian policies , they are divided in how to confront this .
Their exit strategy is the November elections , but the question is how to get there .
With less than 60 days to go in the election campaign , there is no way how .
The only thing that exists is TV campaigns , but there is no campaign on the streets .
The bourgeoisie has to change this situation , but this impossible via the baton and the state of siege , not only because there will be no possibility of candidate meetings but also because what this has done until now is throw more wood into the fire .
This is not the only problem ; the other and bigger one is that the legitimate president is in the middle of the city of Tegucigalpa in the Brazilian embassy , to which we could add the international isolation of the regime .
Today , all the sectors have begun to talk more forcefully about the necessity of a national dialogue towards the elections .
Dialogue with Zelaya will only be possible if he is reinstated in the presidency .
But this solution is impossible for the bourgeoisie given that its policy has been to break with Zelaya ’s government .
Zelaya talks of dialogue but at the same time talks of “ homeland , restitution or death ” .
In the current context , after more than two weeks in the embassy , [ and ] more than 90 days of mobilisations , one single day of Zelaya in government , in the midst of the absolute fragility of the regime , would be too adventurous for the dominant classes .
Concretely , the possibility of a dictatorship typical of the 1970s and Zelaya ’s return , have been closed off for the bourgeoisie .
Which seems to point towards the fact that the dialogue of which they speak would mean a provisional government of national unity without Zelaya and Micheletti , something which will also be difficult to achieve .
Another important factor is the international isolation of the regime , and the deepening of the economic crisis that has taken the country to the brink of collapse .
Each curfew means more ruin for the people , and especially the middle class and small shop owners who are the ones suffering most .
There are minority sectors of the left who do not understand that the principal demand is the restoration of Zelaya .
The difference between the revolutionaries and the opportunists is that in order to return Zelaya to power it is necessary to continue and deepen the direct action of the people , that is , a consistent democratic struggle that clashes with the regime .
The slogans of the resistance are clear .
No to the elections , restoration of Zelaya and a constituent assembly , which has transformed itself into a slogan of the masses in the face of this crisis .
Mobilisations
The problem for the resistance is that the intense mobilisations undertaken , even if they have fractured the regime and placed it in crisis , have not been intense enough to bring it down and from that provoke a revolutionary democratic way out .
( This is a situation that is very similar to those experienced by the revolutionary processes in Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador , which in any case opened the path later to very progressive solutions via overwhelming electoral victories ) .
The existing accumulation of forces and the deepening of the crisis leaves this possibility open .
As the crisis worsens and becomes unsustainable , the possibility of a more general uprising is on the cards and with it a new Zelaya government in a totally different context of rupture with the old regime , like what has occurred in Bolivia , Venezuela and Ecuador .
In any case , it would be an error to underestimate or not take into consideration the possibilities that the dominant classes will divert this process .
An element that is attempting to break the international isolation has adopted a position that is attempting to reach out to the most right - wing sectors in the continent , included among them the corrupt president of the Brazilian senate , who has come out attacking Brazil ’s president Lula ’s position of support to Zelaya .
He is not the only one .
The meeting of the OAS demonstrated that the US is also changing its position to one of directly attacking Zelaya , Lula and Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez for their adventurism .
The possible plan that they are trying to implement , which will be difficult to arm , is maintaining the status quo with a provisional government of national unity without Zelaya and Micheletti , that maintains the call for elections .
Therein lies the central character of maintaining at all costs the demand for the restoration of Zelaya and support on the international level towards the forces and countries that defend this position .
Revolutionary process
Regardless , it is clear that whatever occurs next , nothing will be the same in Honduras and our continent .
The people have awoken ; they have taken a leap as the comrade from a Communist Party formation said .
The revolutionary process is in march , and if not now , sooner or later , will be expressed in a new political power as has already happened in various countries in our continent .
Not just new leaders have been forged in this resistance , but also a change in the consciousness of the masses and new forms of organisation .
There is a rupture with the old parties .
The Resistance Front and in particular the popular bloc that draws together the most militant sectors have emerged as an alternative for sections of the masses .
All of this has to flow into a new mass revolutionary political organisation .
Various sections that make up the Resistance Front have already proposed this .
It is necessary to ensure that this force be a crucial player in future events .
Latin American militants and anti-imperialist and socialist organisations are faced with the great challenge of collaborating with all of this process .
Honduras today is our political capital in order to advance in the class struggle , and because of this , solidarity is fundamental .
Steny Hoyer claims the “ general welfare ” clause in the constitution grants congress the broad authority to mandate healthcare coverage
If the founders could have looked into the future while they were writing and debating the constitution I believe that there is one phrase , which appears twice in the constitution , that they would have eliminated , or probably more accurately , modified – the “ general welfare ” clause .
Over the years the “ general welfare ” clause has been misconstrued in various ways to implement “ social welfare ” programs , this was not the intent of the “ general welfare ” clause .
The “ general welfare ” clause was tied directly into the “ national defense ” clause .
In Federalist 41 Hamilton argued that the “ general welfare ” clause could not be used to expand the federal government beyond what was intended .
It has been urged and echoed , that the power “ to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States , ” amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare …
But what color can the objection have , when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows , and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon ?
… For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted , if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power ?
Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase , and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars .
But the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning , and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead , is an absurdity
He explains that the “ general welfare ” clause is a general term immediately followed by strict guidelines of federal powers .
Here are the only powers granted to the federal government under national defense and general welfare :
To borrow money on the credit of the United States ;
To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian Tribes ;
To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization , and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States ;
To coin Money , regulate the Value thereof , and of foreign Coin , and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures ;
To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States ;
To establish Post Offices and Post Roads ;
To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ;
To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court ;
To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas , and Offenses against the Law of Nations ;
To declare War , grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal , and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water ;
To raise and support Armies , but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years ;
To provide and maintain a Navy ;
To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces ;
To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union , suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions ;
To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the Militia , and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States , reserving to the States respectively , the Appointment of the Officers , and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ;
To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States , and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be , for the Erection of Forts , Magazines , Arsenals , dock - Yards , and other needful Buildings ; And To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof .
The general statement of “ national defense and general welfare ” was clearly defined right after the statement appears .
Congress was only given 17 clearly defined powers .
But if Hamilton ’s explanation is not enough to convince you I will provide a statement from Madison on the “ general welfare ” clause .
With respect to the words general welfare …
To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
There is no more evidence that needs to be submitted to prove the argument that the “ general welfare ” clause was not meant to provide “ social welfare . ”
The general welfare clause was a vague statement immediately followed by rules that should be followed to ensure the general welfare .
Almost since the adoption of the constitution judges have looked outside the constitution in attempting to interpret the constitution , some have even used the laws of foreign nations to interpret the constitution as they see fit .
If one is to look outside the constitution to interpret what the founders intended than it would seem to me that we should look at the debates and the opinions that the Federalists had while fighting to ratify the constitution .
That is what I have done here and I have proven that the founders did no have the intent to provide “ social welfare ” to citizens of the United States .
But that is exactly what has happened over the years and now House Majority leader Steny Hoyer is claiming that the “ general welfare ” clause grants congress the authority to force all Americans to buy healthcare insurance whether they want to or not .
When he was asked where in the constitution he and congress found the authority to force Americans to purchase insurance he invoked the “ general welfare ” clause .
Well , in promoting the general welfare the Constitution obviously gives broad authority to Congress to effect that end , ” Hoyer said .
“ The end that we ’re trying to effect is to make health care affordable , so I think clearly this is within our constitutional responsibility
Certainly this is a perversion of the “ general welfare ” clause as argued by both Hamilton and Madison .
When asked if the government could force people to buy other products he claimed that eventually the Supreme Court would have to find a limit to government power .
I ’m sure the [ Supreme ]
Court will find a limit ,
He has more faith in the Supreme Court than I do .
Once the precedent is set that the government can force a person to buy anything they are not going to find a limit to what the government can force an individual to buy .
Steny Hoyer claims that eventually the “ due process ” clause in the constitution will trump the “ general welfare ” clause in the eyes of the Supreme Court .
Steny Hoyer claims that forcing Americans to buy healthcare is constitutional because they can buy any healthcare plan from any insurance company that they want to but he forgets that the option not to buy healthcare insurance will be taken off of the table .
That means one option is being taken away from the people .
The last time that the government tried to implement national healthcare the Congressional Budget Office even questioned the constitutionality of the proposal .
A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action .
The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States .
An individual mandate would have two features that , in combination , would make it unique .
First , it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society .
Second , it would require people to purchase a specific service that would be heavily regulated by the federal government
What has changed ?
Steny Hoyer is trying to equate buying healthcare insurance to paying taxes in order to justify his position .
we mandate other things as well , like paying taxes
That is true but the power to levy taxes is actually one of the powers strictly granted to congress in the constitution .
On a sidenote , is he admitting that healthcare reform is nothing more than a tax ?
Steny Hoyer is desperately trying to find constitutional grounds to stand on for the attempt by the federal government to mandate healthcare insurance but the fact is that he has no constitutional grounds to stand on .
In the end a healthcare mandate will probably be passed and made into law .
The question is will the Supreme Court hear arguments about the constitutionality of healthcare mandates ?
And if they do , will the Supreme Court find the limit that Steny Hoyer claims they will eventually ?
We better hope so .
The Compensation Committee of the UA System Board of Trustees unanimously approved a move this morning that will make Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban one of the nation 's best - paid college coaches for years to come .
Under terms of the new nine - year deal , Saban stands to earn roughly $ 4.7 million per year should he stay at Alabama for the life of the contract .
Saban 's original deal would have averaged $ 4.125 million over the remaining six years .
The most valuable aspect of Saban 's extension is the formation of a $ 5 million " Contract Year Completion Benefit " clause that will pay Saban a lump sum at three different times if he is still coaching the Crimson Tide .
He would be due an additional $ 1.6 million in Jan. 2012 , $ 1.7 million in Jan. 2015 and $ 1.7 million more in Jan. 2018 .
Overall , Saban stands to make a total of $ 42.35 million should he remain the Crimson Tide 's coach for the life of his new nine - year deal .
Saban 's deal now runs through Jan. 31 , 2018 .
He will receive annual salary compensation of $ 4.2 million for each of the three added seasons , which holds consistent with what he was to make through the final years of his original contract .
The new deal also calls for parties to meet in Feb. 2015 to " determine marketplace trends " in regards to football coaches in the SEC and nationally .
Per the contract , if Saban makes less than the " total guaranteed annual compensation " of three highest - paid SEC football coaches or less than that of the average of the five highest - paid NCAA football coaches , " UA agrees to increase employee 's total guaranteed annual compensation to the higher of the two averages . "
UA announced the agreement earlier this preseason , with Saban saying that , " Our acceptance of the extension expresses our commitment to the University of Alabama for the rest of our coaching career . "
The FIA announced today that Lotus will get the final place on the 2010 F1 grid .
The Malaysian government has backed the bid and the entry was made by a company called “ 1 Malaysia F1 Team ” .
1 Malaysia is an initiative of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak , intended to promote unity among Malaysians .
This brightly - coloured car model was on display at an official announcement in Malaysia today .
The team principal will be Tony Fernandes , who is ranked the 15th - richest man in Malaysia and set up Air Asia , the airline which sponsors Williams .
A statement from the government said : “ ?���?
�The cars will be made in Malaysia , by Malaysians [ … ]
The team will announce its two drivers by October 31 , 2009 .
Currently six local and international drivers have been selected . ”
Ex -Renault , Toyota and Force India man Mike Gascoyne will return to F1 as the team ’s technical director .
Interestingly , FIA president candidate Jean Todt has links to Malaysia via his partner Michelle Yeoh and his role as an ambassador for Malaysian tourism ( about which questions were raised earlier this year ) .
The model above may prove not to be indicative of what the team ’s final 2010 livery will look like – but I think it would be great to see such a radical colour scheme on the F1 grid .
But with Force India , US F1 and now 1 M alaysia , is F1 slowly turning into A1 Grand Prix ?
Update : Alex Yoong yesterday referred to the car as ‘ project raibow ’ on Twitter .
Is this paint scheme serious ?

The Chamber of Commerce stunned DC on Monday by calling a last - minute press conference to announce a dramatic about - face in its climate policy — it would not only stop opposing the Kerry - Boxer climate bill but would work with them to make it better .
But the whole thing turned out to be a hoax mounted by the Yes Men , a notorious band of anti-corporate pranksters .
Reporters received a press release early Monday stating that the Chamber would be “ throwing its weight behind strong climate legislation ” at an event at the National Press Club in downtown Washington , DC .
But when I and others showed up , we were met by a fellow dressed in a suit looking like a typical corporate PR man .
This was n’t Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue .
And I recognized him as Yes Man Andy Bichlbaum .
( I ’ve written about the group previously . )
He soon was telling reporters , “ We at the Chamber have tried to keep climate science from interfering with business .
But without a stable climate , there will be no business . ”
The Yes Men posted text of the fake speech on a fake website that closely mirrors the actual Chamber site .
There were a couple of tell - tale signs that there might be some funny business going on :
The speech was to come from “ Tom Donahue , ” while the actual CEO of the Chamber is named “ Tom Donohue . ”
And as TPM pointed out , the press release announcing the event was issued by one Erica Avidus , whose last name is Latin for “ greedy . ”
As one might expect , the real Chamber was none too pleased .
Eric Wohlschlegel , spokesman for the US Chamber , showed up and protested loudly during the event .
“ This is a fraudulent press conference ! ” he yelled .
Later he could be heard asking a Press Club employee how they could host this kind of stunt .
“ How could someone call and represent the Chamber in this way ? ” he asked .
“ We do a lot of events here .
We ’re very supportive of the Press Club . ”
The Press Club was n’t very happy either .
An employee was overheard telling one of the organizers that they “ could have canceled it based on your illegal behavior . ”
Surely the reporters who showed up were also miffed .
I initially fell for the press release , but was thankfully tipped off to the scam before the event .
But reporters for Reuters , Greenwire and other news organizations showed up to cover the event , and Reuters , basing its reporting on the press release , posted a piece proclaiming that the Chamber had made an “ about face ” and “ no longer opposes climate change legislation , ” which was republished on the Washington Post and New York Times sites .
National Journal took the bait as well .
Reuters ran a correction a little while later .
Most reporters at the event , however , were utterly confused .
“ Which one is the real Chamber ? ” one asked .
The Yes Men , and their allies at the Avaaz Action Factory who helped coordinate the event , were pleased with the latest in their series of climate - change - related stunts .
Recent efforts include a fake issue of the New York Post proclaiming “ We ’re Screwed ! ” that was distributed in New York during the United Nations Climate Summit ; or their “ Survivaball ” system for withstanding climate change ( a.k. a a “ gated community for one ” ) .
Over the years , the Yes Men have honed an expertise in elaborate pranks that call attention to corporate misbehavior ( see the latest issue of Mother Jones for a piece by Dave Gilson on the Yes Men ’s MO and the changing role of the prank in the age of Borat ) .
“ It definitely does get attention for causes , ” said Bichlbaum .
“ It definitely gets coverage about things , and points out obvious things .
Like right now the Chamber has this troglodytic stance on climate change , completely ridiculous . ”
UPDATE : It appears CNBC also bit on the fake story .

We ’ve contended many times before that severe weather and global warming are not linked .
Here ’s a new essay on the issue .
From CO2 Science
Tornados — Summary
Climate alarmists typically claim that global warming will lead to both more frequent and more intense stormy weather ; and in terms of their ferocity , tornados rank pretty high on the scale of societal concern .
Nevertheless , they have mostly been studied , in this regard , together with several other types of storms , as is the case with the majority of the papers discussed in this summary .
In a major review of “ temporal fluctuations in weather and climate extremes that cause economic and human health impacts ” — as they titled their study of the subject — Kunkel et al. ( 1999 ) analyzed empirical data related to historical trends of several different types of extreme weather events and their societal impacts .
This work revealed , in their words , that “ most measures of the economic impacts of weather and climate extremes over the past several decades reveal increasing losses . ”
However , they found that “ trends in most related weather and climate extremes do not show comparable increases with time , ” suggesting that “ increasing losses are primarily due to increasing vulnerability arising from a variety of societal changes , including a growing population in higher risk coastal areas and large cities , more property subject to damage , and lifestyle and demographic changes subjecting lives and property to greater exposure . ”
With respect to hurricane losses ( which have shown a steady increase with time ) , the three researchers stated that “ when changes in population , inflation , and wealth are considered , there is instead a downward trend [ italics added ] . ”
They also found that “ increasing property losses due to thunderstorm - related phenomena ( winds , hail , tornadoes ) are explained entirely [ italics added ] by changes in societal factors . ”
In addition , they say there has been “ no apparent trend in climatic drought frequency ” and “ no evidence of changes in the frequency of intense heat or cold waves . ”
Balling and Cerveny ( 2003 ) also reviewed the scientific literature to determine what had been learned about severe storms in the United States during the modern era of greenhouse gas buildup in the atmosphere , paying particular attention to thunderstorms , hail events , intense precipitation , tornadoes , hurricanes and winter storm activity .
In doing so , they found that several scientists had identified an increase in heavy precipitation , but that “ in other severe storm categories , the trends are downward [ italics added ] , ” which , of course , is just the opposite of what climate alarmists contend is the case .
Noting that “ media reports in recent years have left the public with the distinct impression that global warming has resulted , and continues to result , in changes in the frequencies and intensities of severe weather events , ” which implied changes are mostly for the worse , Hage ( 2003 ) attempted to get to the truth of the matter by using “ previously unexploited written resources such as daily and weekly newspapers and community histories ” to establish a database adequate for determining long - term trends of all destructive windstorms ( primarily thunderstorm - based tornadoes and downbursts ) in the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in western Canada over the period 1882 to 2001 .
And because “ sampling of small - scale events such as destructive windstorms in the prairie provinces of Canada depends strongly on the human influences of time and space changes in rural settlement patterns , ” Hage says that “ extensive use was made of Statistics Canada data on farm numbers by census years and census areas , and on farm sizes by census years in attempts to correct for sampling errors . ”
The results of these operations were stated quite simply : “ all intense storms showed no discernible changes in frequency after 1940 , ” while prior to that time they had actually exhibited minor maxima .
Changnon ( 2003 ) investigated trends in both severe weather events and changes in societal and economic factors over the last half of the 20th century in the United States .
In doing so , he found that trends in various weather extremes were mixed , noting that “ one trend is upwards ( heavy rains - floods ) , others are downward ( hail , hurricanes , tornadoes , and severe thunderstorms ) , and others are unchanging flat trends ( winter storms and wind storms ) . ”
It should noted , however , that had the analysis of heavy rains - floods been extended back to the beginning of the 20th century , the longer - term behavior of this phenomenon would have been found to be indicative of no net change over the past hundred years , as demonstrated by Kunkel ( 2003 ) .
So why did insurance losses rise so rapidly over the past several decades ?
Changnon reports that “ the primary reason for the large losses [ was ] a series of societal shifts ( demographic movements , increasing wealth , poor construction practices , population growth , etc. ) that collectively had increased society ’s vulnerability . ”
When properly adjusted for societal and economic trends over the past half - century , therefore , monetary loss values associated with damages inflicted by extreme weather events , as Changnon describes the situation , “ do not exhibit an upward trend . ”
Consequently , as he emphasizes , “ the adjusted loss values for these extremes [ do ] not indicate a shift due to global warming . ”
And to make this point perfectly clear , he reiterates that these real - world observations “ do not fit the predictions , based on GCM simulations under a warmer world resulting from increased CO2 levels , that call for weather extremes and storms to increase in frequency and intensity . ”
Khandekar ( 2003 ) briefly reviewed what he had learned about extreme weather events in Canada in the course of conducting a study of the subject for the government of Alberta .
In doing so , he noted how his research had led him to conclude that “ extreme weather events such as heat waves , rain storms , tornadoes , winter blizzards , etc. , [ were ] not increasing anywhere in Canada at [ that ] time . ”
In addition , he noted that a recent special issue of Natural Hazards ( Vol. 29 , No. 2 ) had concluded much the same thing about other parts of the world ; and in this context he cited a survey article by Robert Balling that concluded “ there is no significant increase in overall severe storm activity ( hurricanes , thunderstorms / tornadoes , winter blizzards ) across the conterminous United States , ” as well as an article by Stanley Changnon , which concluded that “ increasing economic loss due to weather extremes in the conterminous United States is a result of societal change and not global warming . ”
Focusing solely on tornados , Daoust ( 2003 ) catalogued daily tornado frequencies for each county of Missouri ( USA ) for the period 1950 - 2002 , after which he transformed the results into monthly time series of tornado days for each of the state ’s 115 counties , its six climatic divisions , and the entire state .
This work revealed the presence of positive trends in tornado - day time series for five of the six climatic divisions of Missouri ; however , none of these trends was statistically significant .
For the sixth climatic division , on the other hand , the trend was significant ; but it was negative .
Most importantly , at the level of the entire state , Daoust reported that “ for the last 53 years , no long - term trend in tornado days can be found . ”
Last of all , Diffenbaugh et al. ( 2008 ) briefly reviewed what is known about responses of U.S. tornadoes to rising temperatures .
On the theoretical side of the issue , they indicate there are competing ideas with regard to whether tornadoes might become more or less frequent and / or severe as the planet warms .
On the observational side , there is also much uncertainty about the matter .
They write , for example , that “ the number of tornadoes reported in the United States per year has been increasing steadily ( ~ 14 per year ) over the past half century . ”
However , they say that “ determining whether this is a robust trend in tornado occurrence is difficult , ” because “ the historical record is both relatively short and non-uniform in space and time . ”
In addition , the increase in yearly tornado numbers runs parallel with the concurrent increase in the country ’s population , which makes for better geographical coverage and more complete ( i.e. , numerous ) observations .
On the other hand , the three researchers report that the number of tornadoes classified as the most damaging ( F2 - F5 on the Fujita scale ) may well have truly decreased over the past five decades ( 1954 -2003 ) , as their frequency of occurrence actually runs counter to the trend of the country ’s population .
In fact , the graphs they present show yearly F2 - F5 tornado numbers in the latter half of the record period dropping to only about half of what they were during the first half of the record , while corresponding data from the U.S. Southern Great Plains show damaging tornado numbers dropping to only about a third of what they were initially .
Nevertheless , Diffenbaugh et al. considered the question posed in the title of their paper —
Does global warming influence tornado activity ? — to be unresolved , stating that “ determining the actual background occurrence and trend in tornado activity over recent decades will certainly require further development of other analysis approaches . ”
In conclusion , therefore , and in spite of all of the media hype surrounding the rising economic impact of each new year ’s weather extremes , there is really nothing unusual about the weather extremes themselves , including tornados .
Consequently , since the earth did indeed warm significantly over the 20th century , it must be concluded , on the basis of this empirical evidence , that global warming does not bring about an increase in extreme weather events .
Like “ the emperor ’s new clothes , ” which some pretend to see , they ’re just not there .

Workflows Over Robots
Workflows are the engine of every business that deals with physical goods : from distribution to wholesale , retail to manufacturing .
They drive the operating budget – people , facilities , machines .
They drive the value of the business .
Our solutions go beyond traditional automation and focus on continually maximizing human and robot performance in the workflow to enhance your flexibility , productivity , and achieve a sustained competitive advantage .

The great promise of neuroscience at the end of the last century was that it would revolutionize the treatment of psychiatric problems .
But the first real application of advanced brain science is not novel at all .
It is a precise , sophisticated version of an old and controversial approach : psychosurgery , in which doctors operate directly on the brain .
In the last decade or so , more than 500 people have undergone brain surgery for problems like depression , anxiety , Tourette ’s syndrome , even obesity , most as a part of medical studies .
The results have been encouraging , and this year , for the first time since frontal lobotomy fell into disrepute in the 1950s , the Food and Drug Administration approved one of the surgical techniques for some cases of O.C.D .
While no more than a few thousand people are impaired enough to meet the strict criteria for the surgery right now , millions more suffering from an array of severe conditions , from depression to obesity , could seek such operations as the techniques become less experimental .
But with that hope comes risk .
For all the progress that has been made , some psychiatrists and medical ethicists say , doctors still do not know much about the circuits they are tampering with , and the results are unpredictable : some people improve , others feel little or nothing , and an unlucky few actually get worse .
In this country , at least one patient was left unable to feed or care for herself after botched surgery .

I manganellatori del premier stanno sparando da settimane contro Annozero e Ballarò , dimenticando che in queste trasmissioni vengono sempre invitati esponenti delle due parti per garantire il contradditorio , proprio in ragione del contratto di servizio della Rai .
Al monologo di Minzolini invece non c'è stato nessuno che potesse replicare .
2. " Panorama " è illegale .
Sì , lo so che non è elegante parlare male della concorrenza , ma questa non è una questione di carattere giornalistico .
E' una nota di carattere politico e legale : il settimanale che da anni spara copertine prone al premier - compresa una in cui gli hanno aggiunto i capelli in photoshop - può farlo in ragione di un'avvenuta corruzione effettuata da Berlusconi .
C'era già una sentenza penale ( da cui il premier è uscito illeso per prescrizione ) ora ce n'è una civile che non lascia più dubbi sull ' utilizzatore finale di quell ' azione fuorilegge .
Con Panorama , sono illegalmente possedute dal premier tutte le testate del gruppo Mondadori .
3. Il Lodo Alfano è illegale .
Lo spiega in modo semplice ed essenziale il giurista Vittorio Grevi sul Corriere di oggi , a pagina 14 ( non trovato on line ) : « Il principio di parità di trattamenti rispetto alla giurisdizione è un principio che si colloca alle origini della formazione dello Stato , per derogare al quale occorre quanto meno una legge costituzionale .
mentre , com'è risaputo , il Lodo Alfano è stato approvato nel giro di pochi giorni con una semplice legge ordinaria » .
In altre parole , l'incostituzionalità del Lodo è lapalissiana , e ( aggiungo io , ovviamente ) una sua approvazione alla Consula potrebbe avvenire solo attraverso gli stessi metodi che hanno portato alla sentenza sul Lodo Mondadori .

Capital market theory after the efficient market hypothesis
Dimitri Vayanos , Paul Woolley
Have capital market booms and crashes discredited the efficient market hypothesis ?
This column says yes and suggests a new model that explains asset pricing in terms of a battle between fair value and momentum driven by principal - agent issues .
Investment agents ’ rational profit seeking gives rise to mispricing and volatility .
Forty years have passed since the principles of classical economics were first applied formally to finance through the contributions of Eugene Fama ( 1970 ) and his now - renowned fellow academics .
Over the intervening years , capital market theory and the efficient market hypothesis have been developed and modified to form an elegant and comprehensive framework for understanding asset pricing and risk .
But events have dealt a cruel blow to these theories , as John Authers argued in his recent FT column .
Capital market booms and crashes , culminating in the latest sorry and socially costly crisis , have discredited the idea that markets are efficient and that prices reflect fair value .
Some economists still insist these events are simply the lively interplay of broadly efficient markets and see no cause to abandon the prevailing wisdom .
Other commentators , including a number of leading economists , have proclaimed the death of mainstream finance theory and all that goes with it , especially the efficient market hypothesis , rational expectations , and mathematical modelling .
The way forward , they argue , is to understand finance based on behavioural models on the grounds that psychological biases and irrational urges better explain the erratic performance of asset prices and capital markets .
Presented this way , the choice seems stark and unsettling , and there is no doubt that the academic interpretation of finance is at a critical juncture .
The need for a science - based , unified theory of finance
At stake is the need for a scientifically based , unified theory of finance that is rigorous and tractable ; one that retains as much as possible of the existing analytical framework and simultaneously produces credible explanations and predictions .
This is no storm in an academic teacup .
On the contrary , the implications for growth , wealth and society cannot be overstated .
The efficient market hypothesis has beguiled policymakers into believing that market prices could be trusted and that bubbles either did not exist , were positively beneficial for growth , or could not be spotted .
Intervention was therefore unnecessary , and regulation could be light - touch .
By contrast , a theory of asset pricing that did a good job of explaining mispricing would provide policymakers with a stronger rationale for intervention and more scepticism about mark - to - market , index - tracking , and derivative pricing , to name but a few examples .
Principal - agent investment problems : Mispricing with rationality
We believe that a first step in the search for a new paradigm is to avoid the mistake of jumping from observing that prices are inefficient to believing that investors must be irrational , or that it is impossible to construct a valid theory of asset pricing based on rational behaviour .
Finance theory has combined rationality with other assumptions , and it is one of these other assumptions that has proved unfit for purpose .
The crucial flaw has been to assume that prices are set by the army of private investors , the " representative household " as the jargon has it .
Households are assumed to invest directly in equities and bonds and across the spectrum of the derivatives markets .
Theory has ignored the real world complication that investors delegate virtually all their involvement in financial matters to professional intermediaries – banks , fund managers , brokers – who dominate the pricing process .
Delegation creates an agency problem .
Agents have more and better information than the investors who appoint them , and the interests of the two are rarely aligned .
For their part , principals cannot be certain of the competence or diligence of their appointed agents .
The agency problem has been acknowledged in corporate finance and banking but hardly at all in asset pricing .
Introducing agents brings greater realism to asset - pricing models and can be shown to transform the analysis and output .
Importantly , this is achieved whilst maintaining the assumption of fully rational behaviour on the part of all concerned .
Such models have more working parts and therefore a higher level of complexity , but the effort is richly rewarded by the scope and relevance of the predictions .
By doing this in our recent paper ( Vayanos and Woolley , 2008 ) , we have been able to explain momentum , the commonly observed propensity for trending in prices , which in extreme form causes bubbles and crashes .
Momentum is incompatible with an efficient market and has proved difficult to explain in the traditional framework .
Indeed , it has been described by Fama and French ( 1993 ) as the “ premier unexplained anomaly ” in asset pricing .
Central to the analysis is that investors have imperfect knowledge of the ability of the fund managers they invest with .
They are uncertain whether underperformance against the benchmark arises from the manager 's prudent avoidance of over - priced stocks or is a sign of incompetence .
As shortfalls grow , investors conclude incompetence and react by transferring funds to the outperforming managers , thereby amplifying the price changes that led to the initial underperformance and generating momentum .
1
The dot - com boom
The technology bubble ten years ago illustrates this well .
Technology stocks received an initial boost from fanciful expectations of future profits from scientific advance .
Meanwhile , funds invested in the unglamorous , value sectors languished , prompting investors to lose confidence in the ability of their underperforming value managers and switch funds to the newly successful growth managers , a response which gave a further boost to growth stocks .
The same thing happened as value managers themselves began switching from value to growth stocks to avoid being fired .
Through this conceptually simple mechanism , the model explains asset pricing in terms of a battle between fair value and momentum .
It shows how rational profit seeking by agents and the investors who appoint them gives rise to mispricing and volatility .
Once momentum becomes embedded in markets , agents then logically respond by adopting strategies that are likely to reinforce the trends .
Explaining the formation of asset pricing in this way seems to provide a clearer understanding of how and why investors and prices behave as they do .
For example , it throws fresh light on why value stocks generally outperform growth stocks despite offering seemingly poorer earnings prospects .
The new approach offers a more convincing interpretation of the way stock prices react to earnings announcements or other news .
It also shows how short - term incentives , such as annual performance fees , cause fund managers to concentrate on high - turnover , trend - following strategies that add to the distortions in markets , which are then profitably exploited by long - horizon investors .
At the level of national markets and entire asset classes , it will no longer be acceptable to say that competition delivers the right price or that the market exerts self - discipline .
More micro modelling of the financial sector
It seems self - evident that the way forward must be to stop treating the finance sector as a pass - through that has no impact on asset pricing and risk .
Incorporating delegation and agency into financial models is bound to lead to a better understanding of phenomena that have so far been poorly understood or unaddressed .
Because the new approach maintains the rationality assumption , it makes it possible to retain much of the economist 's existing toolbox , such as mathematical modelling , utility maximisation and general equilibrium reasoning .
The insights , elegance , and tractability that these tools provide will be used to study more complex phenomena with very different economic assumptions .
The new general theory of asset pricing that eventually emerges should relegate the efficient market hypothesis to the status of special and limiting case .
Concluding remarks
Of course , investors may not always behave in a perfectly rational way .
But that is beside the point .
If this new approach meets the criteria of relevance , validity , and universality required of any new theory , then it provides a valuable starting point in understanding markets .
Models based on irrational behaviour can always be helpful in offering supplementary or more detailed insights .
The impact of the new general theory will extend well beyond explaining asset prices and investors ' actions .
Corporate finance and banking theory have both been developed under the pro-forma assumption of price efficiency and will now need to accommodate systematic mispricing .
Macroeconomics has also treated finance as a pass - through and would benefit from changing the economic emphasis and focusing more on the impact of agency and incentives in the savings and investment process .
In the context of the recent crisis , governments and regulators can only rebuild and re-regulate banking and finance successfully if they have a better idea of how crises form .
Finally , economists may start to ask questions about the social value of the finance sector , its size , and complexity – questions that could be conveniently brushed under the carpet given the prevailing paradigm of efficiency .

Despite the fact that even President Barack Obama was n’t sure that his record warranted a Nobel Peace Prize , the Norwegian committee is defending the decision .
On Friday , after admitting that he was “ surprised and deeply humbled ” by the honor , Obama said , “ To be honest , I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who ’ve been honored by this prize — men and women who ’ve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace . ”

However , “ In rare comments to media , committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland tells The Associated Press that ‘ we simply disagree that he has done nothing .
He got the prize for what he has done . ' ”
The AP story adds , “ Jagland says Obama reached out to the Muslim world and ‘ modified ’ a Bush - era proposal for an anti-missile shield in Europe . ”
“ Jagland and three other members of the five - seat Nobel panel told the AP that they had expected criticism of their decision , ” the article continues .

As RAW STORY reported on Friday , “ Some members of the U.S. press reacted with jokes and puzzled musings Friday morning after waking up to learn President Barack Obama had won the Nobel Peace Prize . ”
There was light - hearted ribbing , like Ezra Klein , a blogger for the Washington Post , who twittered “ Obama also awarded Nobel prize in chemistry .
‘ He ’s just got great chemistry , ’ says Nobel Committee , ” and Time ’s Karen Tumulty who wondered “ Has anyone asked Kanye West what he thinks of Obama winning the Nobel Peace Prize ? ” ABC ’s Jake Tapper even noted “ apparently the standards are more exacting for an ASU honorary degree these days , ” referencing Arizona State ’s decision to hold off on the giving Obama an honorary degree until he ’d had time to accomplish more .
“ It ’s normally awarded to someone who has been in their field for some time , ” an ASU spokeswoman said at the time .

I have been at this blogging stuff for almost a year and I have tried to get credentialed to as many things as possible .
I have had moderate success , but the rejection I have received is for what I think are the wrong reasons .
Most of the time when I am denied a credential to a concert or major sporting event , I am handed the line that the performing party will only credential major traditional media such as television or newspapers .
I understand that advertising is a reason why those outlets receive preferential treatment and I respect both the local newspaper and the local television stations .
My first break for a credential came with the now defunct Mahoning Valley Thunder arena football team .
I called and asked , explained that I get some hits and outlined what I could do to help promote their product .
The powers that be issued the credential and I was extensive in my coverage of a team that would pack it in at the end of the year .
When I look at my hits and where they are coming from today , people are still looking at player profile pieces I did on Quorey Payne , Larry Harrison , Blake Powers , and Tom Zetts .
I took about 95 % of my own pictures , made sure to have a player profile up every week , did game previews and summaries , and received the respect of the people who took a chance on me .
My next big break was the Mahoning Valley Scrappers .
The Scrappers are the short - season Single - A affiliate for the Cleveland Indians with Travis Fryman as their manager .
I embraced the Scrappers project much the same way I did the Thunder .
Profiles , pictures , game summaries , and extensive coverage .
Overall , I feel the Scrappers also liked the efforts I put forth to cover their team .
I consider Youngstown State to be a sports school .
With a national reputation as the school where Jim Tressel came from , I was so honored to gain access to YSU sporting events .
I am currently covering football , but mens and womens basketball are right around the corner and I will be as extensive as I ever have .
This was the biggest credential I have received to date and it really keeps me busy .
I know players see their profiles because I receive favorable feedback from them .
YSU has “ traditional media ” covering their games and I am thrilled that I am rubbing elbows with the best in the area .
The most recent credential came from the Youngstown Phantoms of the USHL .
Same deal as above in the sense that I am trying to cover this team to the best of my ability .
It is harder to take pictures at these games because of the glass , but I am doing my best to give the readers a good shot .
This season is young but I feel comfortable with the coaches , players , and front office people who have extended the olive branch to the blogger .
Toward the end of the 2009 baseball season , I decided to take a chance and call the Pirates and Indians to maybe get a credential to one game at each place and interview anyone I could .
Both markets refused to give me a credential stating non-traditional media with no affiliation could not be awarded credentials .
I did n’t argue because if it is their policy , then so be it .
The way I see it , baseball attendance in these two markets is not soaring and if they want to roil in disaster , it is obviously less pressure on me to find positive things to write about .
The 4500 people who went to a Pirates home game surely would have spotted me and filed some form of complaint with Bud Selig or Pirate Management .
That nearly empty press box would have needed a good cleaning after I got done with one game and I am well aware that cuts were made and it might be hard to send Ryan Doumit back up there with a broom with his shin hurting so badly .
My latest endeavor of credential seeking failure comes from the land of music .
Concert promoters carry the same belief as MLB , an unlikely Rock & Jock connection .
They too feel that traditional media is worthy of a credential .
Mind you , a credential at a concert means you have permission to take pictures for the first three songs , there are no interviews or backstage access .
To be denied the privelage to snap a few photos was upsetting .
Traditional media was allowed to do so .
This is brilliant for many reasons .
Firstly , I have no beefs with the local newspaper , I think they do tremendous work and the promotional articles are on time and to the point , they work .
However , when a guy in New York is looking for a review on Styx , Daughtry , or Kelly Clarkson ( all denials for me ) , I do n’t think he is going to hop in the Jeep and drive to Youngstown to read the local newspaper for a review .
If these people were on the fence about buying a ticket , they would probably Google a specific band and maybe use a keyword of “ review ” .
I know that is the route I would take .
They find a website that reviewed the concert , they read the review , they are impressed that Styx played “ I Am The Walrus ” as their third song and want to hear it , so they buy tickets .
Will there be newspapers in 15 years ?
No one can answer that .
I read mine every day and will continue to subscribe .
But is there anyone with a brain cell who does n’t think that websites are turning into mainstream media ?
There is an unlimited audience , it does n’t cost a penny to visit most sites , and the coverage is adequate .
Writers like Jay Marriotti have blasted the internet contributions in the past , probably because they feel threatened .
Yeah , kudos to those who went to school for four years and got a journalism degree , they have my respect and write some intriguing pieces .
Should they be allowed to have websites ?
Do they have programming certification and / or even know what a widget is ?
I will continue to seek media credentials for any event I feel will generate this site more hits .
I will also be as diligent and prompt as I can be to ensure exposure of a positive nature to the group or organization who issued a credential to me .
Thanks to those who have said yes !
To those who will only cater to traditional media :
Welcome to the future where typewriter ink rolls are going through the roof and black and white film is getting harder to come by .

What Kind Of Super Douche Is Driving That Thing Around ?
Watching Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson get away with libeling Rush Limbaugh with several outrageously spectacular lies recently ( they falsely claimed Limbaugh " defended slavery " and praised Martin Luther King , Jr. ’s murderer ) reminded me once again how the American Left throws all morals out the door when it comes to any challenges to their secular " religion " of welfare statism and socialism .
( The neocon Right , which includes Limbaugh , tells even bigger lies , such as the ones that " justified " the Iraq war . )
It also reminded me of how campus leftists at Loyola University Maryland libeled Dr. Walter Block last year with equally outrageous slanders .
LRC readers may recall that after Dr. Block presented a very mainstream economics lecture on " The Economics of the Gender Gap " the university president , Rev. Brian Linnane , S.J. , who did not attend the lecture , issued an email to all faculty , staff , students and alumni that did not mention anything that was said in the lecture , but libeled Dr. Block as a racist and sexist .
Dr. Block ’s apparent " offense " was to use economic theory to challenge one of the superstitions of academic feminism — the dubious notion that all of the difference in male / female wages is caused by sex discrimination , something that no self - respecting economist would ever claim .
The obvious goal of such obnoxious tactics is to censor all views of such subjects that do not conform to left - wing political correctness .
( Linnane ’s academic field of specialization is “ feminist theology . ” )
I suspected from the beginning that the libeling of Dr. Block was a set - up by the self - appointed Campus Thought Police , who never stop reminding everyone that they are in favor of " social justice . "
( The implication is that anyone who opposes their socialistic political agenda must be in favor of injustice . )
It was this " social justice crowd " on the Loyola campus who immediately claimed after Dr. Block ’s lecture that a student complained to them about the " insensitivity " of Dr. Block ’s rendition of the economics of discrimination .
Within twenty - four hours I learned that the university president was preparing his libelous letter despite the fact that he had neither attended the lecture nor contacted Dr. Block to ask him if the scurrilous slanders about him were true .
I have always suspected that the student was sent to the seminar with specific instructions to cause trouble , which he did .

For the benefit of those outside of academe , " social justice " is a euphemism for socialism , as Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek explains in Law , Legislation and Liberty , Vol. 2 , " The Mirage of Social Justice , " pp. 62—100 .
( So - called " social justice , " wrote Hayek , is an expression that " described from the beginning the aspirations that were at the heart of socialism . "
" Millions . . . in Russia are the victims of a terror that attempts to conceal itself behind the slogan of social justice , " he wrote in 1976 .
" So long as the belief in u2018 social justice ’ governs political action , " Hayek explained , " this process must progressively approach nearer and nearer to a totalitarian system . "
And , " the term is intellectually disreputable , the mark of demagoguery or cheap journalism . . . its use is dishonest . " )
That the " social justice crowd " on the Loyola campus was behind the lynching of Walter Block was confirmed to me recently by one of my top students , who made it his business to investigate the whole matter in a way that I could not have .
It was also confirmed , as far as I ’m concerned , by an extraordinarily hateful and malevolent letter to the school newspaper ( " The Greyhound " ) shortly after the lynching took place by one Rev. John Donahue , S.J. , a " research professor " at Loyola and one of the " social justice " proselytizers on campus .
The letter was written in a very self - congratulatory tone and boasted of what a good job he and his lynch mob partners did in libeling Dr. Block with their false and baseless accusations of racism and sexism .
But that expression of hate , based on libel and slander , apparently was n’t enough to satisfy Donahue .

Like Linnane , Donahue did not attend the lecture , but he nevertheless wrote to the school newspaper that Dr. Block should also be denigrated for having criticized during his speech the predominance of " liberation theology " among Jesuit scholars .
Dr. Block did criticize " liberation theology " in his lecture , something that Pope John Paul II did , as has his successor , Pope Benedict XVI .
Dr. Block ’s criticism was not nearly as harsh , however .
Donahue then viciously and malevolently implied that Dr. Block should be considered to be in the same moral category as the El Salvadoran government thugs who murdered six Jesuit priests in 1989 .
The priests in El Salvador were apparently working to bring " liberation theology , " which considers the communist takeover of the Nicaraguan government in 1979 to be its high - water mark in Central America , to that country .
Apparently , Donahue believes that all critics of liberation theology are in the same moral category as those government murderers .
The last two Popes would have to be included on his list .
This is what seems to have caused the Loyola University Maryland Campus Thought Police , led by the likes of Rev. Donahue and supported by the university administration , to adopt the " moral " code , such as it is , of Al Sharpton and commit a truly outrageous act of libel against Dr. Walter Block .
There are many Jesuits whose memory deserves to be celebrated , not the least of which is Ignatius Loyola himself .
The most visible celebration that the Loyola " social justice crowd " ( as one of my students calls them ) organizes on the campus is in the form of a commemoration each November of the poor Jesuits in El Salvador who were brutally murdered in their sleep some twenty years ago .
A part of the campus is filled with grave marker crosses and turned into a mini-cemetery for several weeks each year .
There ’s nothing wrong with memorializing and praying for these poor souls , but it is obvious to me that the real purpose of the campus memorial is to continue promoting the cause that these Jesuits were working for — the replacement of one thuggish and tyrannical government in El Salvador with another one that , if history teaches us anything , would have been even worse .
Saying that a communist government in El Salvador would be good for the poor people of that country is like saying that gasoline is good for putting out fires .
Liberation theology has several different strands , but the one these El Salvadoran Jesuits were working on behalf of , according to a Web search , was one that is informed by Marxist ideology .
According to this " theology , " sin is the source of poverty , and in this context the worst sin of all is capitalism .
This is why " liberation theology " has been condemned by the last two Popes — it is essentially Marxism masquerading as Catholicism .

Before he became Pope , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger wrote an essay in 1984 entitled " Preliminary Notes of Liberation Theology . "
In the essay Cardinal Ratzinger said that " the phenomenon of liberation theology reveals that it constitutes a fundamental threat to the faith of the Church . "
Like all Marxists , liberation theologians are rarely willing to debate economic issues , said Cardinal Ratzinger .
All criticisms of Marxism are said to be merely " an expression of the ruling class ’s determination to hold on to its power , " he wrote , quoting " a well - known liberation theologian " as asserting : " The class struggle is a fact ; neutrality on this point is simply impossible . "
This is exactly the attitude of the Loyola University Maryland Campus Thought Police , as proven by their actions in the libeling of Dr. Block .
It is also the attitude of almost all other academic Marxists who I have run across in my thirty - year academic career .
Their apparent objective is to do whatever they can to censor all future debate on campuses about the efficacy and morality of socialism , a debate that was ended in the real world several decades ago with the worldwide collapse of socialism .
Calling socialism " social justice , " " economic democracy , " or " liberation theology " can never disguise this historical truth .
Cardinal Ratzinger went on to say that Marxian doctrine , as such , " takes the ground from under the feet of the Church ’s teaching office " because " if she were to intervene and proceed against such an interpretation of Christianity , she would only prove that she is on the side of the rich and the rulers and against the poor and suffering , i.e. , against Jesus himself . . . "
Liberation theology , he concluded , is a " Marxist myth . "
Pope John Paul II " emphatically rejected liberation theology " as well , as described by a February 12 , 1979 article in Time magazine entitled " John Paul vs. Liberation Theology . "
" The tactics of Marxist revolution , based as they are on class conflict , violate the most profound Christian teaching , " the Pope is quoted as saying .
Pope John Paul II lived much of his life under the communist regime in Poland and understood that , regardless of whatever euphemism is used for it , it is inevitably a recipe for social and economic disaster , especially for the poor .

Blue Origin's Goddard demonstration vehicle in mid-flight above its West Texas launch pad during a test launch on Nov. 13 , 2006 .
In the entrepreneurial space business , there 's nothing like the " cone of silence " surrounding the rocket work of billionaire Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com fame .
In hush - hush surroundings , the Bezos Blue Origin business plan has been resolute in developing its New Shepard , a vertical takeoff and landing rocket .
The plan :
To develop a craft that can routinely fly multiple astronauts into suborbital space at competitive prices .
Flight tests of an Origin - class suborbital craft have been staged at a Bezos - bankrolled private launch site in Texas .
That much is known ... and beyond that , little is known in any great detail .
But now there 's news .
Research payloads selected
Today , Blue Origin announced that it has picked three research payloads to fly on the New Shepard suborbital vehicle .
That trio of experiments – to be shot high above Earth – is part of Phase 1 of the New Shepard Research Flight Demonstration Program .
The three selected investigations are :
Three - Dimensional Critical Wetting Experiment in Microgravity by principal investigator , Stephen Collicott , of Purdue University .
Microgravity Experiment on Dust Environments in Astrophysics ( MEDEA ) , to be done under the eye of Joshua Colwell of the University of Central Florida .
Effective lnterfacial Tension lnduced Convection ( EITIC ) , with the principal investigator identified as John Pojman of Louisiana State University .
" These payloads were selected from an excellent field of submitted proposals , " explains the Blue Origin web site .
According to Blue Origin , the suborbital hops of these experiments is planned to begin " in the coming years " to demonstrate the integration and operation of scientific experiments into the New Shepard system .
Suborbital space race
In the big scheme of things — in terms of suborbital experimentation — there is a growing competitive movement to lob payloads , people , as well as people and their payloads on suborbital jaunts .
Firms such as the XCOR Aerospace Lynx , Scaled Composite 's SpaceShipTwo , as well as the Blue Origin 's New Shepard are pulsing investigator interest in flying suborbital experiments .
NASA is also engaged in evaluating what vehicles may give them an edge on flying to the edge of space .
Meanwhile , the public relations - shy Blue Origin group 's New Shepard will consist of a pressurized Crew Capsule carrying experiments and astronauts atop a Propulsion Module .
Flights will take place from Blue Origin 's launch site , which is already up and operating in West Texas .
First tests
New Shepard is being designed to take - off vertically and accelerate for roughly 2.5 minutes before shutting off its rocket engines and coasting into space .
In space , the Crew Capsule would separate from the Propulsion Module and the two re-enter and land separately for re-use .
As blueprinted by Blue Origin , the Crew Capsule lands softly under a parachute at the launch site .
Astronauts , as well as tote - along experiments , will experience no more than 6 g acceleration into their seats and a 1.5 g lateral acceleration during a typical flight .
High - quality microgravity environments , according to Blue Origin , can be achieved for durations of 3 or more minutes , depending on the mission trajectory .
Flight testing of prototype New Shepard vehicles began in 2006 .
Blue Origin has stated in the past that flight opportunities in 2011 may be available for autonomous or remotely - controlled experiments on an unpiloted flight test .
The firm has also said that it expects the first opportunities for experiments requiring an accompanying researcher astronaut to be available in 2012 .

Greg Stafford - founder of Chaosium , creator of Glorantha ( setting of the original RuneQuest roleplaying game ) , designer of the illustrious Arthurian RPG King Arthur Pendragon and 1987 inductee into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame - would , I think , make a good cleric .
Though I know many RPG designers with high Intelligence ( consistent , of course , with human racial maxima ) , I consider Stafford the wisest .
It might not seem " wise " to have started not one but three game companies , seemingly a folly to rank with the Maginot Line , TV reality shows and the Children 's Crusade .
But as every Dungeons & Dragons player knows , the Wisdom attribute does n't imply prudence - or else priests would never walk into monster - ridden holes .
Nor is wisdom a superhuman ability to dodge trouble .
Now 61 , Stafford has endured life 's ordinary vicissitudes : a broken marriage , family strife , business setbacks and recurrent bouts ( only recently diagnosed ) of clinical depression .
Yet he remains good - humored , active , gregarious and curious - a seeker still .
Stafford is also , still , a writer .
As a college freshman in 1966 he conceived - or , as he unfailingly phrases it , discovered - his fantasy world of Glorantha , and through stories and games he has developed it unstintingly ever since .
He founded Chaosium in 1974 to publish Gloranthan board games .
He established Glorantha as the setting for RuneQuest 's first two editions , as well as for the later HeroQuest RPG and the 1999 King of Dragon Pass computer game .
The early history of both Glorantha and RuneQuest is exhaustively documented online , and the setting has many devotees to this day .
Some regard it not only as a backdrop for adventure but as , they might say , a tool for understanding .
In a galaxy of thoroughly developed campaign settings , Glorantha remains unusual and potent .
Through it , Stafford treats of myth and the place of myth in our lives , drawing on his studies and his mystical experience in shamanic practices .
( He's on the advisory board of Shaman 's Drum Journal , " the leading magazine on experiential shamanism . " )
The heroes of Glorantha , guided by the gods and cults of myth , rise in power and ultimately re-enact these myths through their own careers .
Where Stafford 's sense of myth permeates Glorantha , in Pendragon , myth works more like Fate , a hidden imperative that shapes eight decades of King Arthur 's life .
Whole families of knights vie for Glory across the years from the Sword in the Stone to the final days of Camelot .
An innovative , all - embracing virtue system aids in roleplaying knights of the British Isles , Christians and pagans , Saxon and Byzantine warriors , even Saracens and Picts .
Drawing from every source in history and legend , Pendragon presents a matchless totality , one of the rare roleplaying books that stands as genuine scholarship .
The game 's essential supplement , The Great Pendragon Campaign , is a breathtaking four - generation saga unrivaled in scope .
Though he no longer owns rights to the game proper , Stafford now publishes his own line of licensed Pendragon supplements .
( Now the bad news : Stafford 's masterwork is currently out of print !
The rights belong to White Wolf Game Studio , now part of CCP , publisher of EVE Online .
CCP , earn greater Glory by restoring Pendragon ! )
Stafford has written of the virtues of roleplaying : fun , education , creativity , empowerment .
" Roleplaying activates a critical human process that has nearly been killed by over - rationalization and materialism .
Roleplaying is a way for humans to interact with our deep , hidden mythological selves .
They are a way to feed our souls . "

A new report coming from Optimum Population Trust and carried out by the prestigious London School of Economics says that expanding access to family planning and contraception is about five times less expensive than low - carbon technology in combating climate change .
Between 2010 and 2050 each $ 7 spent on basic family planning can reduce emissions more than a ton ; to achieve that same level of reduction using low - carbon tech would on average cost $ 32 per ton .
For more specific comparison , wind power would cost $ 24/ton , solar $ 51/ton , carbon capture and storage $ 57-83/ton .
In total , expanding access to basic family planning throughout the globe would save 34 gigatons of carbon emissions over the next 40 years , the report concluded .
On the significance of these findings , OPT 's chairman Roger Martin said : " It 's always been obvious that total emissions depend on the number of emitters as well as their individual emissions . . . The taboo on mentioning this fact has made the whole climate change debate so far somewhat unreal .
Stabilizing population levels has always been essential ecologically , and this study shows it 's economically sensible too .
Between the nearly 80 million people added to the planet every year , and recent calculations projecting a population of 7 billion by 2011 , prospects for a healthy future are not great .
We are running out of resources , and polluting the only environment we have to live in .
. .
The UN has been issuing warnings for years now , and upon the release of a 2007 report , the director of the Environment Program said , " The human population is now so large that the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available at current consumption patterns .
" Diminishing Returns
In 1900 , 7.91 hectares of land was available for every person , and by 2005 that share had dropped to 2.02 hectares , and is expected to fall further to 1.63 by 2050 .
Demand for resources , however , has only been growing , and stands at about 22 hectares per person .
Not exactly sustainable .
Feeding the population has become an increasingly difficult task , especially as regions that already struggle agriculturally , in particular , become drier because of global warming .
With animals going extinct faster than ever , biodiversity is plummeting .
Some have predicted that the oceans will be depleted of all the species now being fished if current consumption and fishing practices continue , since , according to the same UN report , we are catching 250 percent more fish than the oceans can produce .
Also associated with population - induced environmental degradation are the " dead zones " -- areas that cannot support marine life because of depleted oxygen supplies -- that have expanded and multiplied around the world .
The damage will be irreversible if sufficient action is not taken immediately , and the magic number , according to leading scientists , is 350 .
That 's the safe upper limit for carbon , measured in parts per million , that our atmosphere can handle before the harm caused by climate change is completely irreversible .
Yes , superheroes have a rich history in the of wars own invented universes ( Secret , Civil ) as well as real - life conflicts like WWII and Vietnam , where heroes like Captain America and the Punisher showed up to lend a hand in the pages of their comics .
Photographer and illustrator Agan Harahap continues this tradition with a series of ' shopped photos that mix real life history and superheroes ( and an occasional Darth Vader ) in ways that are almost as entertaining as Captain America punching Hitler in the face .

Listen to mayor Dorothy Thornhill .
Her council has just banned parents from watching their own children at two council play areas in Watford .
Quoted in the Watford Observer this evidently simple - minded woman says , " Sadly , in today 's climate , you can't have adults walking around unchecked in a children 's playground . "
Instead of parents being able to watch and play with their own and other people 's children at the Harwoods and Harebreaks recreation grounds , vetted council staff known as " play rangers " will be in charge .
The mayor says that this enforces government policy .
Actually that 's not true because no government policy has yet determined that parents may not supervise their own children in a playground .
It seems possible that the mayor and her appalling council may be in breach of article 8 of the Human Rights
Act – the right to family life .
A mother of three named Rebekah Makinson was quoted by reporter Neil Skinner as saying : " Banning parents from an open access playground , I feel , is a breach of our personal freedom . "
She is right .
This is a fundamental breach of rights , but almost as serious is the offence to common sense .
The council pretends that it is forced into this position to protect children under the new vetting and barring scheme but as parents point out , the number of kids using the play areas and the range of ages means that some parents want to keep on eye on the children .
Makinson said : " We have used Harwoods since I was a child and my mother stayed with me .
It has always had a fantastic community atmosphere .
Even with the excellent staff employed it is ridiculous to assume that three staff members can safeguard the high volume of children that currently use the playground . "
I had a free - range childhood with almost no supervision and I can see the point of allowing children to play away from overprotective parents .
But the critical issue here is that parents ' right are being trampled on by this new atmosphere of fear and suspicion , brought about by the Independent Safeguarding Authority , a government that increasingly thinks it knows better than parents and local authorities that are keen to use any new power offered to them , however mad or tyrannical its application .
When I called the council , the press officer made the usual allegation that the reporter had got his facts wrong but then could not detail a single inaccuracy .
In fact it turned out that his story was pretty much spot on .
The council spokeswoman was keen to point out that the policy meant that if no parents were allowed into the two play areas it reduced the risk of adults wandering into the playground .
If parents want to watch their children they should damned well be allowed to do so .
No officially sanctioned " play ranger " should have supervisory rights over a child in a public " open access " playground that in any way tops the child 's parents ' rights .
Last night an Australian variety show aired a skit with five men in blackface performing as the Jackson 5 .
And the audience cheered !
Thank goodness Harry Connick
Jr was there to be the voice of reason .
The show was a live reunion special for Hey Hey , It 's Saturday , a popular and long - running program down under that was cancelled a decade ago .
During their Red Faces segment , which is similar to the American version of The Gong Show , six doctors performed a choreographed number in blackface and afro wigs pretending to be the Jackson 5 .
Thankfully , one of the judges hit the gong shortly into the number .
But what did the crowd do when they stopped the music .
They booed !
Harry Connick
Jr , one of the guest judges gave the team a zero score and the judge who gonged gave them a one , even though the crowd was roaring to give them a 10 !
One female judge gave them a 7 out of 10 because she is apparently ignorant or , beause she 's a sweet female sitting between two men judging a singing competition she thought she was Paula Abdul and took a handful of pill before the broadcast , so she did n't know better .
The amazing thing is that , as the show tells us , in 1989 , the same group doing a very similar act won the competition !
So , in 20 years , we 've gone from this offensive form of comedy being wildly popular to being still popular with the masses , even though some people know better .
In America , blackface is one of those things that you can only show if you 're talking about how awful it is because , well , it is pretty awful .
Sure , there are culture differences , but it 's not like they do n't have black folks in Australia who would get pissed off by this .
Luckily , they gave Connick some time at the end of the show to say that he would n't have done the show if he knew there was going to be such an act .
" [ Americans ] have spent so much time trying to not make black people not look like buffoons , that when we see something like that we really take it to heart . "
Wow , and American is being the voice of cultural sensitivity ?
Australia must be really messed up .

Arriving 30 minutes late and dressed in full " aeronaut " attire , Johnson did his yearly review of propaganda and fan mail from CCP censors , offered his artistic take on the Delve war , showed off some disturbing images from Goon gatherings , and did the Goons proud by answering audience questions to the best of his visibly intoxicated ability .
It 's just about the best 20 minutes of video coming out of this year 's FanFest , so hide your children ( profanity , lots of it - not safe for work ) , forgive the shakycam ( this was an impromptu recording ) , and have a look !

A Lawyer Career – Pros and Cons of Being a Family Lawyer .
Being a lawyer might be one of the most popular careers across the industry from time to time .
However , there are several types of lawyers available .
Before becoming one , you need to complete a series of processes to meet the qualifications .
Meanwhile , if you want to be a family lawyer , there might be several things you need to acknowledge .
This article will show you the pros and cons of being a family lawyer in general .
Also , your client will talk to you about a super sensitive family issue .
The pros of being a family lawyer
# 1 Referrals
According to data , it is not complicated to find clients since many people you know may get a divorce .
As long as you did a good job , clients will come along the way .
Other than that , when family clients have entrusted the most important concerns to you , it commonly means that you will be in charge of other legal matters as well .
So , you may build a referral network by sending out cases out of your practice to other lawyers .
# 2 Career satisfaction
Career satisfaction may come in many ways .
The highest valued points are such as money , community recognition , peer approval , or simply doing good .
Meanwhile , being a family law will allow you to get these things as rewards .
A family attorney can make money let ’s say USD 400 per house while the peer approval is also high .
Keep in mind that peer approval is essential to survive in the industry .
On the other hand , you can do good by helping families to get over a divorce peacefully .
# 3 Practice variety
According to family lawyers , this specialization made them enjoy the practice variety .
Their practice could be as general as criminal law , property law , probate , or even constitutional law .
Of course , it would be a long way but it is pretty satisfying .
The cons of being a family lawyer
# 1 Stressful
Stressful is such a thing that would be experienced by everyone in every type of field .
However , a family lawyer tends to be more stressful compared to other types of lawyers because the family issues could bring up some unnecessary emotions .
Until today , many family issues have turned into criminal issues and some of them included family law attorney murder cases .
# 2 Emotional
Being a family lawyer may bring you to tons of persona issues in a family .
This has a lot to do with the biggest life choice of a person .
It sounds so empathetic while , on the other hand , it should be done professionally yet objectively .
One of your clients , or more , could break down in tears right in front of your face .
# 3 Addiction
The addiction depends on the attorney after all .
It is important to note that addiction may lead to the ability of a lawyer to practice .
So , in case you still want to stay strong in the family law business , you should be nice to yourself in the first place .
Well it 's been a wonderfully busy week , and now it 's over .
I finished Big Bang Theory on Tuesday , spent much of Wednesday wishing I was still working with them , and then recorded the voice of Mr. Qubit for the IRREDEEMABLE motion comic yesterday .
Since I 'm too busy to write up the stuff that needs writing up , and I really do n't like those blog posts that are about not posting to your blog , I thought I 'd share this incredible picture that Warren Ellis showed me :
Have a great weekend , everyone .
Memories of the Future comes out next week .
( I guess I probably should have lead with that , huh ? )

The fall in cost is due to the increased lifetime , the institute says
The cost of installing and owning solar panels will fall even faster than expected according to new research .
Tests show that 90 % of existing solar panels last for 30 years , instead of the predicted 20 years .
According to the independent EU Energy Institute , this brings down the lifetime cost .
The institute says the panels are such a good long - term investment that banks should offer mortgages on them like they do on homes .
At a conference , the institute forecast that solar panels would be cost - competitive with energy from the grid for half the homes in Europe by 2020 - without a subsidy .
Basically everything ( in the industry ) is bound to grow still further .
Growing further means less cost
Heinz Ossenbrink , EU Energy Institute Incentive programmes for solar panels in Germany , Italy and Spain have created manufacturing volume that 's bringing down costs .
Solar panel prices dropped 30 % last year alone due to an increase in output and a drop in orders because of the recession .
But Heinz Ossenbrink , who works at the institute , said China had underpinned its solar industry with a big solar domestic programme which would keep prices falling .
There are large - scale solar plans in the US and India too .
Panels had been expected to last for 20 years and price calculations were based on this ( with a free energy source , purchase and installation represent almost the entire price of solar power ) .
But Dr Ossenbrink says the institute 's laboratory has been subjecting the cells to the sort of accelerated ageing through extremes of heat , cold and humidity that has long been a benchmark for the car industry .
Long lifetime
It has shown that more than 90 % of the panels on the market 10 years ago are capable of still performing well after 30 years of life , albeit with a slight drop in performance .
Dr Ossenbrink says 40 - year panels will be on the market soon .
A key goal for solar is what is known as grid parity .
That is the point when it is as cheap for someone to generate power on their homes as it is to buy it from the grid .
It varies from country to country depending on electricity prices , but the institute estimates that Italy - which has a combination of sunny weather and relatively high electricity prices - should reach grid parity next year .
Half of Europe should be enjoying grid parity by 2020 , it estimates .
Cloudy northern countries like the UK could wait further , possibly up to 2030 .
But the day would come when solar panels on homes would be cost - competitive without a subsidy , even in Britain .
Dr Ossenbrink says : " Basically everything ( in the industry ) is bound to grow still further .
Growing further means less cost .
Less cost means grid parity . "
" We have been surprised in the past five years at the drop in prices .
It 's due to good incentive programmes first in Germany then Spain and Italy .
That created a kind of a boom that was helping industry to reduce costs and get into profitability .
And when an industry is in profit it drives on its own . "
Owning solar Professor Wim Sinke , from Utrecht University in the Netherlands , who leads the solar umbrella group the European Photovoltaic Technology Platform , says the industry has even greater ambitions .
" The target of the sector as a whole is to reach grid parity in almost all of Europe over the next 10 years .
So by 2020 we should have grid parity in most of Europe , " he told BBC News .
Key sticking points for domestic solar , he said , would be the lack of flexibility in electricity grids to take in surplus generated energy and difficulties with finance .
Dr Ossenbrink said : " What I would like to see is the finance sector saying solar power is a product like financing a house - except they can predict the value of the solar panel much more safely than they can predict the value of the house in a volatile market .
" Electricity will never be given away free .
Banks should offer mortgages on people 's solar panels like they do on homes - the bank should own the panel , then it would transfer to the householder when the loan has been paid off .
It would be perfect for life assurances . "
It will take much longer for solar to match fossil fuel power at the point of generation , the institute says , as wholesale electricity prices are much lower than retail prices .

The Commercial Speech Arms Race
A few years ago , a company began to sell a liquid with identification codes suspended in it .
The idea was that you would paint it on your stuff as proof of ownership .
I commented that I would paint it on someone else ’s stuff , then call the police .
I was reminded of this recently when a group of Israeli scientists demonstrated that it ’s possible to fabricate DNA evidence .
So now , instead of leaving your own DNA at a crime scene , you can leave fabricated DNA .
And it is n’t even necessary to fabricate .
In Charlie Stross ’s novel Halting State , the bad guys foul a crime scene by blowing around the contents of a vacuum cleaner bag , containing the DNA of dozens , if not hundreds , of people .
This kind of thing has been going on for ever .
It ’s an arms race , and when technology changes , the balance between attacker and defender changes .
But when automated systems do the detecting , the results are different .
Face recognition software can be fooled by cosmetic surgery , or sometimes even just a photograph .
And when fooling them becomes harder , the bad guys fool them on a different level .
Computer - based detection gives the defender economies of scale , but the attacker can use those same economies of scale to defeat the detection system .
Google , for example , has anti-fraud systems that detect ­ and shut down ­ advertisers who try to inflate their revenue by repeatedly clicking on their own AdSense ads .
So people built bots to repeatedly click on the AdSense ads of their competitors , trying to convince Google to kick them out of the system .
Similarly , when Google started penalizing a site ’s search engine rankings for having “ bad neighbors ” — backlinks from link farms , adult or gambling sites , or blog spam — people engaged in sabotage : they built link farms and left blog comment spam linking to their competitors ’ sites .
The same sort of thing is happening on Yahoo Answers .
Initially , companies would leave answers pushing their products , but Yahoo started policing this .
So people have written bots to report abuse on all their competitors .
There are Facebook bots doing the same sort of thing .
Last month , Google introduced Sidewiki , a browser feature that lets you read and post comments on virtually any webpage .
People and industries are already worried about the effects unrestrained commentary might have on their businesses , and how they might control the comments .
I ’m sure Google has sophisticated systems ready to detect commercial interests that try to take advantage of the system , but are they ready to deal with commercial interests that try to frame their competitors ?
And do we want to give one company the power to decide which comments should rise to the top and which get deleted ?
Whenever you build a security system that relies on detection and identification , you invite the bad guys to subvert the system so it detects and identifies someone else .
Sometimes this is hard ­– leaving someone else ’s fingerprints on a crime scene is hard , as is using a mask of someone else ’s face to fool a guard watching a security camera ­– and sometimes it ’s easy .
But when automated systems are involved , it ’s often very easy .
It ’s not just hardened criminals that try to frame each other , it ’s mainstream commercial interests .
With systems that police internet comments and links , there ’s money involved in commercial messages ­– so you can be sure some will take advantage of it .
This is the arms race .
Build a detection system , and the bad guys try to frame someone else .
Build a detection system to detect framing , and the bad guys try to frame someone else framing someone else .
Build a detection system to detect framing of framing , and well , there ’s no end , really .
Commercial speech is on the internet to stay ; we can only hope that they do n’t pollute the social systems we use so badly that they ’re no longer useful .

Markus Naslund believes his long - time friend Peter Forsberg will continue his hockey career this season and should play for their hometown club in Sweden , Modo .
Naslund had dinner with Forsberg , 36 , on Thursday evening as part of the NHLPA ’s decade - long anniversary celebration of its Goals and Dreams program , which donates equipment to grassroots players in a 10 - country , 10 - day trip .
The opening day of the tour visited Ornskoldsvik , where Naslund and Forsberg grew up playing together .
" There is definitely a chance that he might stay here and , in my opinion , it might be better for him , " Naslund said in a phone interview on Friday .
" He could play regularly — there are less games here and that would mean less wear and tear on him than in the NHL . "
Naslund has no doubt that Forsberg , who is attempting a comeback after a chronic foot problem , will continue playing this season because he dearly wants to suit up for Sweden at the Vancouver Olympics .
It ’s now a matter of where , in Sweden or the NHL .
The Canucks , Rangers , Flyers , Avalanche and Bruins are among the teams believed to be interested in signing the unrestricted free agent .
" I personally think he ’s not going to retire , " Naslund said .
" I feel he will play somewhere this year .
But who knows where he is going to play .
" He ’s still working on figuring everything out .
He wants to make sure he ’s 100 per cent fit before he can commit to anything .
I know he ’s getting closer to making his decision , but I honestly do n’t know which way he ’s leaning . "
Forsberg , of course , was a member of the 2006 Olympic gold - medal team , a club that Naslund was not part of because a groin injury kept him from playing in Torino Winter Games in Turin , Italy four years ago .
No regrets over retirement
Naslund , also 36 , decided to retire last May .
The former Penguins , Canucks and Rangers sniper does n’t have any regrets now that the NHL season six weeks old .
" No , I do n’t have any regrets , " he said .
" I ’m at peace with my decision .
There obviously is stuff that I miss , but I ’m just happy that I had a chance to play the game for as long as I did .
I just felt that it was time to go . "
What keeps Naslund busy these days is coaching the minor team his seven - year - old son Alex plays on and the supervising the building of a new home in Ornskoldsvik .
Ornskoldvik is a northern pulp and paper town in Sweden on the Gulf of Bothnia .
The town has produced an incredible number of world - class hockey players , including Anders Hedberg , Tomas Gradin , Anders Kallur , Bo Berglund , Lars Lindgren , Tomas Jonsson , Lars Molin , Näslund , Forsberg , Niklas Sundström , Anders Eriksson , Mattias Timander , Per Svartvadet , Hans Jonsson , Henrik and Daniel Sedin , Samuel Påhlsson and Mattias Karlin .
The residents of Ornskoldvik are as passionate for Modo as any of the fans are for the six Canadian NHL clubs , even thought Modo occupies the bottom spot of the Swedish Elitserien standings this season .
Naslund and Forsberg were teammates with Modo , which has a history dating back to 1921 , in the early 1990s when they were still junior aged .
So why has Ornskoldvik produced so much talent ?
" I do n’t have an answer for you , " Naslund said .
" Probably , a lot has to do with the grassroot teams here .
We have a lot of volunteer coaches that put their heart and soul into their teams and there always has been pretty good competition among those teams in town .
" I do n’t know if this is unique , but they have had a lot of success , that ’s for sure .
Program in 10th year
The Goals and Dreams program is commemorating its 10th year by distributing more than 360 sets of equipment worth about $ 180,000 .
They began this mission by issuing 50 sets to Ornsköldsviks Hockeyklubb and 25 more to Jarveds IF .
" I ’m more proud of the Goals and Dreams program , " Naslund said .
" The teams that have received the equipment are overwhelmed .
During this trip , the most of the cities that will be visited are bigger or capital cities , so this has been well received . "
The Goals and Dreams fund , which is funded by the members of the NHLPA , is the largest grassroots hockey program in the world .
Since its inception in Nov. 1999 , the program has donated more than $ 17 million to grassroots programs to more than 40,000 children in 22 countries .
Linux has much to offer as a development platform : a robust operating environment with tested tools .
Linux also boasts implementations of just about every programming language available .
I think it is safe to say , however , that among compiled languages , C is the language of choice for most Linux developers .
Consequently , other languages such as C++ seem to be somewhat neglected in most discussions of Linux development .
The dynamic class loading technique provides developers with a great deal of flexibility in their designs .
Dynamic class loading is a means of providing extensibility without sacrificing robustness .
In this article , we will design a simple application that defines a single class , a shape class we wish to use in a drawing package .
As we shall see , dynamic class loading allows us to provide a smooth extension path through which users of the application can add new types of shapes without needing to modify the original application code .
Polymorphism
The basic idea behind dynamic class loading is the concept of polymorphism .
Anyone familiar with C++ should be familiar with this concept , so I will discuss it here only briefly .
In short , polymorphism is the ability of an object belonging to a derived class to act as an object belonging to the base class .
This is the familiar “ is a ” relationship of OOP ( object - oriented programming ) parlance .
For example , in the following code snippet , circle is a class derived from the base class shape ( see Listing 1 ) , so the object my_circle can act as a shape object , invoking the shape member function draw .
Listing 1 class shape { public : void draw ( ) ; } ; class circle : public shape { } ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { circle my_circle ; my_circle.draw ( ) ; }
While this has all the usual advantages , e.g. , code reuse , the real power of polymorphism comes into play when draw is declared to be virtual or pure virtual , as follows : class shape{ public : virtual void draw ( ) =0 ; } ; class circle : public shape { public : void draw ( ) ; }
Here , circle has declared its own draw function , which can define behavior appropriate for a circle .
Similarly , we could define other classes derived from shape , which provide their own versions of draw .
Now , because all the classes implement the shape interface , we can create collections of objects that can provide different behavior invoked in a consistent manner ( calling the draw member function ) .
An example of this is shown here .
shape * shape_list [ 3 ] ; // the array that will // pointer to our shape objects shape [ 0 ] = new circle ; // three types of shapes shape [ 1 ] = new square ; // we have defined shape [ 2 ] = new triangle ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) { shape_list [ i].draw ( ) ; }
When we invoke the draw function for each object on the list , we do not need to know anything about each object ; C++ handles the details of invoking the correct version of draw .
This is a very powerful technique , allowing us to provide extensibility in our designs .
Now we can add new classes derived from shape to provide whatever behavior we desire .
The key here is that we have separated the interface ( the prototype for shape ) from the implementation .

The key here is that we have separated the interface ( the prototype for shape ) from the implementation .
While this technique is very powerful , it does suffer from a drawback in that we must recompile ( or at least relink ) our code when we add new derived classes .
It would be more convenient if we could simply load in new classes at runtime .
Then , anyone using our code libraries could provide new shape classes ( with new draw functions ) without even needing our original source code .
The good news , and the subject of this article , is that we can .
dlopen and Dynamic Class Loading While C++ has no direct mechanism under Linux for loading in classes at runtime , there is a direct mechanism for loading C libraries at runtime : the dl functions dlopen , dlsym , dlerror and dlclose .
These functions provide access to the dynamic linker ld .
A complete description of these functions is provided in the appropriate man page , so they are presented here only briefly .
The prototypes for the functions are as follows : void * dlopen ( const char void * dlsym ( void * handle , char * symbol ) ; const char * dlerror ( ) ; int dlclose ( void * handle ) ;
The dlopen function opens the file given in filename so that the symbols in the file can be accessed via the dlsym function .
flag can take one of two values : RTLD_LAZY or RTLD_NOW .
If flag is set to RTLD_LAZY , dlopen returns without attempting to resolve any symbols .
If flag is set to RTLD_NOW , dlopen attempts to resolve any undefined symbols in the file .
Failure to resolve a symbol causes the call to fail , returning a NULL .
dlerror can be used to provide an error message explaining the failure .
The dlsym function is used to obtain a pointer to the functions ( or other symbols ) provided by the library .
handle is the pointer to the thing being referenced , and symbol is the actual string name of the item referenced , as it is stored in the file .
Given that we can use these functions to access functions in a C library , how do we use them to access classes in a C++ library ?
There are several problems to overcome .
One is that we must be able to locate the symbols we need in the library .
This is trickier than it might seem because of the difference between the way symbols are stored in C and C++ files .
Secondly , how can we create objects belonging to the classes we load ?
Finally , how can we access those objects in a useful manner ?
I will answer these three questions in reverse .
Since we do not have the prototypes for the classes we load dynamically , how can we access them in our code ?
The answer to this lies in the description of polymorphism in the preceding section .
We access the functionality of the new classes through the common interface provided by their base class .
Following the examples above , any new shape classes would provide a draw function that would allow an object of that class to render itself .
Fine ; we can use pointers to the base class to access objects from the derived classes .
How do we create the objects in the first place ?
We do n't know anything about the classes that might be loaded , other than the fact that they conform to the shape interface .
For instance , suppose we dynamically load a library that provides a class called hexapod .
We can't write shape * my_shape = new hexapod ; if we do n't know the class name ahead of time .
The solution is that our main program does n't create the objects , at least not directly .
The same library that provides the class derived from shape must provide a way to create objects of the new class .
This could be done using a factory class , as in the factory design pattern ( see Resources ) or more directly using a single function .
To keep things simple , we will use a single function here .
The prototype for this function is the same for all shape types : shape * maker ( ) ; maker takes no arguments and returns a pointer to the constructed object .
For our hexapod class , maker might look like this : shape * maker ( ) { return new hexapod ; }
It is perfectly legal for us to use new to create the object , since maker is defined in the same file as hexapod .
It is perfectly legal for us to useto create the object , since maker is defined in the same file as hexapod .
Now , when we use dlopen to load a library , we can use dlsym to obtain a pointer to the maker function for that class .
We can then use this pointer to construct objects of the class .
For example , suppose we want to dynamically link a library called libnewshapes .
so which provides the hexapod class .
We proceed as follows : void * hndl = dlopen ( " libnewshapes.so " , RTLD_NOW ) ; if ( hndl == NULL ) { cerr << dlerror ( ) << endl ; exit ( - 1 ) ; } void * mkr = dlsym ( hndl , " maker " ) ;
The pointer to maker must be of type void * , since that is the type returned by dlsym .
Now we can create objects of the hexapod class by invoking mkr : shape * my_shape = static_cast < shape *( ) >( mkr ) ( ) ;
We are required to cast mkr to a pointer to a function returning shape * when we invoke it .
We are required to cast mkr to a pointer to a function returningwhen we invoke it .
Some readers may see a problem with the code as written thus far : the dlsym call is likely to fail because it cannot resolve " maker " .
The problem is that C++ function names are mangled to support function overloading , so the maker function may have a different name in the library .
We could figure out the mangling scheme and search for the mangled symbol instead , but fortunately there is a much simpler solution .
We need only tell the compiler to use C - style linkage using the extern " C " qualifier , as shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2
Autoregistration Loading the maker functions into an array associates a position in the array with each maker .
While this may be useful in some cases , we can obtain more flexibility using an associative array to hold the makers .
The Standard Template Library ( STL ) map class works well for this , as we can then assign key values to the makers and access them via these values .
For example , we may desire to assign string names to each class and use these names to invoke the appropriate maker .
In this case , we can create a map such as this : typedef shape * maker_ptr ( ) ; map < string , maker_ptr > factory ;
Now when we want to create a particular shape , we can invoke the proper maker using the shape name : shape * my_shape = factory [
We can extend this technique to make it even more flexible .
Rather than loading the class makers in and explicitly assigning a key value to them , why not let the class designers do the work for us ?
Using a little bit of ingenuity , we can have the makers register themselves with the factory automatically , using whatever key value the class designer chooses .
( There are a couple of warnings here .
The key must be of the same type as all the other keys , and the key value must be unique . )

( There are a couple of warnings here .
The key must be of the same type as all the other keys , and the key value must be unique . )
One way to accomplish this would be to include a function in each shape library that registers the maker for us , and then call this function every time we open a shape library .
( According to the dlopen man page , if your library exports a function called _init , this function will be executed when the library is opened .
This may seem to be the ideal place to register our maker , but currently the mechanism is broken on Linux systems .
The problem is a conflict with a standard linker object file , crt.o , which exports a function called _init . )
As long as we are consistent with the name of this function , the mechanism works well .
I prefer to forego that approach in favor of one that will register the maker simply by opening the library .
This approach is known as “ self - registering objects ” and was introduced by Jim Beveridge ( see Resources ) .
We can create a proxy class used solely to register our maker .
The registration occurs in the constructor for the class , so we need to create only one instance of the proxy class to register the maker .
The prototype for the class is as follows : class proxy { public : proxy ( ) { factory [ " shape name " ] = maker ; } } ;
Here , we assume factory is a global map exported by the main program .
Using gcc/egcs , we would be required to link with the rdynamic option to force the main program to export its symbols to the libraries loaded with dlopen .
Next , we declare one instance of the proxy : proxy p ;
Now when we open the library , we pass the RTLD_NOW flag to dlopen , causing p to be instantiated , thus registering our maker .
If we want to create a circle , we invoke the circle maker like so : shape * my_circle = factory [ " circle " ] ;
The autoregistration process is powerful because it allows us to design the main program without having explicit knowledge of the classes we will support .
For instance , after the main program dynamically loads any shape libraries , it could create a shape selection menu using all the keys registered in the factory .
Now the user can select “ circle ” from a menu list , and the program will associate that selection with the proper maker .
The main program does not need any information about the circle class as long as the class supports the shape API and its maker is properly defined .

Listing 3 Listings 1 through 5 pull together the concepts presented thus far .
The shape class defined in Listing 1 is the base class for all shapes .
Listings 2 and 3 are the source code for dynamically loadable libraries that provide circle and square shapes , respectively .
Listing 4 Listing 4 is the main program that is extensible through dynamically loaded libraries .
It scans the current directory for any . so files ( libraries ) and opens them .
The libraries then register their makers with the global factory provided by the main program .
The program then dynamically constructs a menu for the user with the shape names registered by the libraries .
Using the menu , the user can construct shapes , draw the shapes constructed , or exit the program .
Listing 5 is the makefile used to build the project .

Real - World Examples
Recently , I have had two occasions to use this technique .
In the first case , I was developing a moving object simulation .
I wanted to provide users with the ability to add new types of moving objects without having access to the main source .
In order to accomplish this , I defined a base class called entity , which provides the interface definition for any moving object in the simulation .
A simplified version of the entity prototype is shown below .
class entity { private : float xyz [ 3 ] ; // position of the object public : activate ( float ) =0 ; // tell the object to move render ( ) =0 ; // tell the object to draw itself };
Thus , all entities have at least a position in three - space , and all entities can draw themselves .
Most entities will have many other state variables besides position and may have many other member functions besides activate and render , but these are not accessible through the entity interface .
New entity types can be defined , incorporating whatever motion dynamics the user desires .
At runtime , the program loads all the libraries in a subdirectory called Entity and makes them available to the simulation .
The second example comes from a recent project in which we wanted to create a library that could load and save images of various formats .
We wanted the library to be extensible , so we created a base image_handler class for loading and saving images .
class image_handler{ public : virtual Image loadImage ( char *) =0 ; virtual int saveImage ( char * , Image &) =0 ; } ; The image_handler has two public functions , used to load and save images , respectively .
The Image class is the library 's basic object type for images .
It provides access to the image data and some basic image - manipulation functions .
In this case , we were not interested in creating multiple objects of each type of image_handler .
Instead , we wanted one instance of each image_handler that would handle loading and saving images of that type .
Rather than registering a maker for each handler , we created a single instance of the handler in its library and registered a pointer to it with a global map .
The map is no longer a factory , since it does not produce objects per se ; it is more of a generic image loader / saver .
The keys used here were strings representing file extensions ( tif , jpg , etc. ) .
Because a file format can have one of several different extensions ( e.g. , tiff , TIFF ) , each handler registers itself multiple times with the global map , once for each extension .
Using the library , a main program can load or save an image simply by invoking the correct handler via the file extension : map < string , handler , less < string > >
handler_map ; char * filename = " flower.tiff " ; char ext [ MAX_EXT_LEN ] ; howEverYouWantToParseTheExtensions ( filename , ext ) ;<
> // after parsing " flower.tiff " ext = " tiff " <
> Image img1 = handler_map [ ext ]->loadImage ( filename ) ; // process data here handler_map [ ext ] -> saveImage ( filename , img1 ) ;

How to Distribute Commercial Python Applications
Most of us in the software business are not in a position to release our source code to the public .
As much as I love free and open source software , I also understand it ’s not part of all business models .
Python is enjoying commercial success , but perhaps less so in cases where end - users actually install the software .
Distributing applications written in Python can be tricky , especially if you do n’t want to distribute your source code .
I set out to find out how exactly do you distribute a Python program , sans source code , on various operating systems .
It turns out there are quite a few alternatives to consider .
In each alternative , the first step is to compile your code to bytecode ( .pyc or . pyo ) .
That ’s what you ’ll be shipping instead of the source code .
1. Using a preinstalled Python
Nowadays , many operating systems actually come with a sane Python interpreter preinstalled .
Most Linux distributions ship with Python , and Mac OS X comes with Python , for example .
Windows does not come with Python , nor do most commercial Unix systems .
Even if a preinstalled Python is available , it may not work for you .
Maybe it ’s an older version , and you want to use the latest and greatest .
Another potential hurdle is that the Python version will be different on different operating systems .
Mac OS X 10.5 ( Leopard ) comes with Python 2.5.1 , Mac OS X 10.4 ( Tiger ) came with Python 2.3.5 .
Ubuntu 8.04 came with Python 2.5.2 , Ubuntu 9.04 comes with Python 2.6.2 …
You get the point .
Sometimes modules are deprecated between versions and you ’ll need to write stuff like this to suppress warnings :
try : import hashlib md5_new = hashlib .
md5 except ImportError : import md5 md5_new = md5 .
new
Varying Python versions may or may not be a problem for you application .
The example above is actually a fairly bening problem , and it ’s easily solved .
If you ever need to support both Python 3 and Python 2 , you will have bigger problems than just deprecated modules .
2. Freezing tools
Freezing tools compile Python programs to executables .
If you ’re distributing a small number of executables , a freeze tool might be just what you need .
There are quite a few of these around .
Disclaimer : I have n’t used most of these tools .
Caveat emptor .
py2exe
If you only care about Windows , py2exe fits the bill nicely .
py2exe is a Python Distutils extension which converts Python scripts into executable Windows programs , able to run without requiring a Python installation .
Applications such as BitTorrent and SpamBayes use py2exe – so it should be stable .
From what I ’ve read , py2exe works quite well .
py2app
py2app makes standard Mac OS X application bundles from Python scripts .
It ’s “ py2exe for Mac ” .
cx_Freeze
cx_Freeze is similar to py2exe , but claims to be portable to both Windows and Unix systems .
bbfreeze
bbfreeze works on Windows and Unix , but not on OS X. Originally based on cx_Freeze .
Freeze
The Freeze tool ships with Python .
It compiles Python programs to executables on Unix systems .
In my simple tests , it was able to handle a trivial hello world application pretty well , if we ignore the size of the resulting executable ( several megabytes ) .
Throwing anything more complex at it tended to fail miserably for various reasons .
It seems to me that Freeze does not work very well out of the box .
PyInstaller
PyInstaller creates executables for Windows , Linux , and Irix .
Yeah , Irix .
3. Bundling CPython with your application
CPython is the default , most widely used implementation of Python .
It is written in C .
When people talk about the Python interpreter , they mean CPython unless they explicitly mention IronPython ( for .NET and SilverLight ) , Jython ( for JVM ) , Stackless Python ( for concurrent programming ) , or something like that .
Sometimes the freezing tools are n’t a good choice .
They might lack platform coverage or could have other problems .
If you ’re distributing a large collection of separate programs the overhead of bundling the full Python interpreter to each program will be prohibitive .
A good alternative is to bundle the Python interpreter with your application yourself .
You gotta love some DIY in the software business , right ?
The first step is to bundle the CPython interpreter with your application .
That ’s fairly straightforward if you know what you ’re doing .
You simply include the Python interpreter with your code .
The second step is to cherry - pick what you need from the Python standard libraries .
Tools like snakefood or modulegraph can help you do that .
From what I can tell , these tools are n’t perfect , so be prepared to manually fix the results or patch the tools .
A third and optional step is to customize your Python distribution .
For example , you might inline all bytecode directly into your executables instead of separate files .
Then you can override the loading functions to pass the code directly from memory instead of loading from disk .
4 . My recommendations
My first choice is to use the Python interpreter which comes with your target platform , if it has one .
Use distutils to install custom modules or extensions .
If your application only supports Windows , use app2exe py2exe .
For complex scenarios , my recommendation is to go with bundling CPython yourself and steer clear of the freezers .
If a freezing tool works for you , awesome .
You just saved yourself from a lot of trouble .
But if you need to cover a large number of platforms , or your application has special needs from the interpreter , then packaging CPython yourself seems to be the best way to go .
The added benefit of bundling CPython yourself is that you can customize the interpreter to your heart ’s content .
Not that you ’ll really need to , but it sounds like fun .
There ’s nothing like making your own bubble wrap , complete with a custom hand - painted smiley face on each bubble .

The Big Lebowski ends with the Dude assuring us he abides and the story 's narrator promising he 'll catch us further on down the trail .
And we might indeed be in for a follow - up of sorts , given the news that the film 's star , Jeff Bridges , is in talks to reunite with its directors , the Coen brothers , for a new adaptation of True Grit .
The Coens are no strangers to working with the same cast again ; Steve Buscemi , John Goodman and John Turturro are among those who have appeared in Lebowski and multiple other Coen pictures besides .
But Bridges has only ever played one part for them and it remains the defining role of his career , even if it 's taken a decade for that to become fully apparent .
The suggestion that he might be their leading man once again therefore carries a frisson of expectation for devotees of the Dude , especially as the filmmakers and actor have gone from strength to strength since their first collaboration : even those who turned their noses up at Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers lavished praise on No Country for Old Men and A Serious Man , which just premiered at Toronto , while Bridges ' roles in Iron Man and the forthcoming Tron sequel see him wielding more industry clout at the moment than he has for a long time .
But what are we to make of his trading in the Dude 's jelly sandals for John Wayne 's cowboy boots ?
The 1969 movie of True Grit stars Wayne as Rooster Cogburn , a semi-retired marshal drawn into action by Mattie Ross , an adolescent girl seeking retribution for her father 's death .
While the film 's main focus is the laconic heroics of Cogburn , the Charles Portis novel on which the story is based – and on which the Coens are reportedly leaning more heavily – filters the entire experience through Mattie 's amusingly narrow perspective .
Given the Coens ' predeliction for outre narrators , there 's a clear appeal there , as there is in the bodily mutilations and Biblical overtones that did n't make it from page to screen in 1969 .
We can guess at several other reasons this material might have caught their eye .
They are repeatedly drawn to mismatched pairs such as the story 's central duo ; their continuing and wide - ranging tour of great American landscapes has not yet taken in the expanses of Oklahoma and Arkansas , where the novel is set ( though the film was shot in Colorado ) ; and , despite being notorious lovers and up - enders of genre , they have never directly tackled a Western .
This is all the more surprising given how much attention they have paid , in various forms , to the question posed by the Big Lebowski himself : " What makes a man ? "
There are few genres to which that question is more central than the Western , which perhaps explains why there are so many cowboy motifs in Lebowski , from the tumbling tumbleweed with which it begins to the not - so - wise words of Sam Elliott 's Stetson - toting tee - totaller .
The character of the Dude was a wickedly irreverent send - up of the classic LA private eye , but also a sincere tribute : shambolic instead of sharp , two steps behind instead of one ahead , he was nevertheless indifferent to worldly temptations and instinctively inclined to do the right thing .
It 's also worth remembering that the character on whom the Dude most obviously riffs , Bogart 's Philip Marlow in The Big Sleep , was himself something of a tongue - in - cheek take on the archetype .
Cogburn is a similarly doubled - sided character : initially dissolute , drunken and inclined to a quiet life , he still proves worthy of the moral challenge that comes knocking at his door , not so much mending his ways as demonstrating that heroism can be found fully - formed in unassuming vessels .
The Dude and the Duke might just have the makings of a great partnership .
The number of young Americans without a job has exploded to 53.4 percent — a post - World War II high , according to the Labor Dept . — meaning millions of Americans are staring at the likelihood that their lifetime earning potential will be diminished and , combined with the predicted slow economic recovery , their transition into productive members of society could be put on hold for an extended period of time .
The number represents the flip - side to the Labor Dept . ’s report that the employment rate of 16 - to - 24 year olds has eroded to 46.6 percent — the lowest ratio of working young Americans in that age group , including all but those in the military , since WWII .
And worse , without a clear economic recovery plan aimed at creating entry - level jobs , the odds of many of these young adults — aged 16 to 24 , excluding students — getting a job and moving out of their parents ’ houses are long .
Young workers have been among the hardest hit during the current recession — in which a total of 6.9 million jobs have been lost .
“ It ’s an extremely dire situation in the short run , ” said Heidi Shierholz , an economist with the Washington - based Economic Policy Institute .
“ This group wo n’t do as well as their parents unless the jobs situation changes . ”
Al Angrisani , the former assistant Labor Department secretary under President Reagan , does n’t see a turnaround in the jobs picture for entry - level workers and places the blame squarely on the Obama administration and the construction of its stimulus bill .
“ There is no assistance provided for the development of job growth through small businesses , which create 70 percent of the jobs in the country , ” Angrisani said in an interview last week .
“ All those [ unemployed young people ] should be getting hired by small businesses . ”
There are six million small businesses in the country , those that employ less than 100 people , and a jobs stimulus bill should include tax credits to give incentives to those businesses to hire people , the former Labor official said .
“ If each of the businesses hired just one person , we would go a long way in growing ourselves back to where we were before the recession , ” Angrisani noted .
During previous recessions , in the early ’ 80s , early ’90s and after Sept. 11 , 2001 , unemployment among 16 - to - 24 year olds never went above 50 percent .
Except after 9/11 , jobs growth followed within two years .
A much slower recovery is forecast today .
Shierholz believes it could take four or five years to ramp up jobs again .
A study from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth , a government database , said the damage to a new career by a recession can last 15 years .
And if young Americans are not working and becoming productive members of society , they are less likely to make major purchases — from cars to homes — thus putting the US economy further behind the eight ball .
Angrisani said he believes that Obama ’s economic team , led by Larry Summers , has a blind spot for small business because no senior member of the team — dominated by academics and veterans of big business — has ever started and grown a business .
“ The Reagan administration had people who knew of small business , ” he said .
“ They should carve out $ 100 billion right now and create something like $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 job credits that would drive the hiring of young , idled workers by small business . ”
Angrisani said the stimulus money going to extending unemployment benefits is like a narcotic that is keeping the unemployed content — but doing little to get them jobs .
Labor Dept. statistics also show that the number of chronically unemployed — those without a job for 27 weeks or more — has also hit a post - WWII high .
In a harshly worded rebuke of the two pilots of the wayward Northwest Airlines Flight 188 , the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday revoked their licenses , saying they " carelessly and recklessly ' ' put their passengers and crew in jeopardy .
" NW188 was without communication with any air traffic control facility for a period of 91 minutes while you were on a frolic of your own , " the FAA said in a letter to the pilots .
" You were disengaged and impervious to the serious threat to your own safety , as well as the safety of the people for whom you are responsible . "
Previously , federal investigators had laid out a timeline that indicated the plane was out of radio contact for only about 75 minutes .
Asked why the licenses were revoked while the investigation is still underway , FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said , " Whenever we think there is reason to take immediate action , we would do so . "
The pilots , Capt . Timothy B. Cheney , 53 , of Gig Harbor , Wash . , and First Officer Richard I. Cole , 54 , of Salem , Ore. , dropped out of radio communications on the 1,530 - mile San Diego - to - Minneapolis flight last Wednesday evening because they were engrossed in their personal laptop computers , the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday .
They have 10 days to appeal the emergency revocations to the NTSB .
If that fails , they can apply for new certificates after one year .
Neither man returned phone calls seeking comment .
Asked to comment on the revocations , Delta Air Lines , parent of Twin Cities - based Northwest , would say only that the pilots remain suspended .
Company policy prohibits use of laptops on the flight deck .
The pilots overshot the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport ( MSP ) by about 100 miles before turning around and landing safely .
The flight had 144 passengers and five crew members .
PIPRI VILLAGE , India 
Two very different recent scenes from India :
At a power breakfast in New Delhi for many of the country ’s corporate leaders and top economic officials , Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee declared that India had “ weathered the storm ” of the global economic crisis and was witnessing “ green shoots ” in industry and services that signaled a return to more rapid growth by next year .
Hundreds of miles away in this farming village in Andhra Pradesh , in the south , weeds were the only green shoots sprouting in the black soil that belongs to the widow Chandli Bai .
Her field went 12 weeks without rain during India ’s annual monsoon season before showers finally arrived on Aug. 23 , splattering down too late onto the dry dirt .
Her summer crop of lentils was stillborn in the ground .
“ We eat once a day , ” said Mrs. Bai , 65 , explaining how she and her family had survived the lack of rain .
For the past year , as the economic crisis convulsed much of the world , India wobbled but never tumbled over .
And now that the world is starting to pull itself out of the mire , India seems poised to resume its rapid economic expansion .
Government officials are projecting that growth will reach or surpass 6 percent this year and approach 8 percent next year , almost the pace that established India as an emerging global economic power second only to China .
Many historical systems used this efficiency and took it one step further with systems exclusively powered by water and gravity .
A large portion of the power required to pull up the ascending car is delivered by the counterweight of the descending car .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cable trains first appeared within the second half of the 19th century .
Many of them have survived and continue to be utilised ( mostly in a modernized form ) and new systems are being developed .
A cable train system is operated on a steep slope with a gradient of up to 55 percent and consists of two passenger cars which are connected by a steel cable .
Both cars travel on the same single track , which is undoubled in the middle so that they can pass each other .
Cable trains prove extremely energy efficient because a large share of the power required to pull up the ascending car is delivered by the counterweight of the descending car .
Since the system only needs one track and can go straight up a mountain , it also saves a lot of materials and space ( some systems use two tracks but follow the same principle ) .
A funicular should not be confused with a cog wheel train - even though many older cable cars applied a similar mechanism , as a braking system and speed governor , not as a traction method .
Water powered cable trains
Originally , cable train systems were even more energy - efficient than they are today .
Instead of using an engine to pull the cable , the extra power required to overcome friction and to pull up the ascending car was delivered by filling the water reservoir of the upper car ( see an example of the mechanism below ) .
Before departure , the employee in the upper station was informed of the number of passengers that had entered the ascending car .
He then knew exactly how much water the reservoir of the descending car should contain ( around 80 litres per passenger ) .
From the moment the descending car became heavier than the ascending car , the brakes were loosened and both cars were set in motion powered solely by gravity .
Once the descending car arrived , its water reservoir was emptied and the process was repeated .
Most cable trains using water counterbalanced energy have been replaced by systems that utilise engines .
One famous example is the Funiculaire de Montmartre in Paris , France , which was operated by water power from 1900 to 1930 and transported one million passengers per year ( illustration below ) .
Thankfully , a few water powered cable cars continue to be in service , and have remained so for over a century .
The Elevador do Bom Jesus in Braga , Portugal , has been in use since 1882 .
The Nerobergbahn in Wiesbaden , Germany , has been working since 1888 , the Lynton & Lynmouth in North Devon , UK since 1890 , and the Funiculaire Neuveville - St. Pierre in Fribourg , Switzerland since 1899 ( see picture intro , note the water filling system on the side of the car ) .
Perpetuum mobile
Most water powered cable cars require energy to operate the pump that transports the water up the hill again , so of course , perpetual motion does not exist .
There are however some exceptions to this .
The 120 metre track in Fribourg , Switzerland , operates without a pump .
It makes use of the natural flow of water along the track , more specifically the waste water infrastructure which connects the upper and the lower part of town .
How it works is this ( illustration above , source ) :
The waste water flows into a reservoir of 100,000 litres .
From there it flows in the water tank of the rail car .
Around 1,500 litres of water is required to pull up the other car from 60 meters below , and it takes 3 minutes to fill up the tank .
After approximately 1.5 minutes , you will have arrived at the ground station .
The reservoir is then emptied and the water continues its way downwards through the sewer system .
The train route was designed as a ( very creative ) way to lower the flow of the fountains in the lower part of town .
Gravity
To add to this , in the case of the Lynton & Lynmouth Cliff Railway , no water is pumped from the bottom to fill the tanks at the top station - the water is taken from a nearby river .
Moreover , at this track the method is reversed .
Both car tanks are full of water , the tank of the bottom car is partially discharged until the bottom car becomes lighter than the top car , and gravity takes its course ( source & more info ) .
The Centre for Alternative Technology built a similar system in 1992 with a lake at the top of the mountain supplying the railway with water .
The main disadvantage of a water - balanced railway ( just like any other use of hydro power ) is that it cannot be operated when the water freezes over .
Bummer .
You need a mountain as well , of course .

It ’s official .
The “ Caffeine for Linux ” project has reached 1.0 !
Only a few short months ago , I was hacking away in secret on the initial 0.1 release of a clone of the original Caffeine for Mac .
I had no idea if anyone would be interested in contributing to it , or even using it .
I ’m very pleased to say that the response has been terrific , and far beyond even my most optimistic predictions .
I ’m very glad that I took this project on , in part because I now have a version of Caffeine for my Linux box .
But the best thing about this project has been having the opportunity to work with such incredibly talented and knowledgeable developers .
I have learned so much , and I owe it all to you .
Tommy and Isaiah , you ’re the best !
But I think that I ’ve spent quite long enough waxing nostalgic about the events of the last six months .
Moving along …
What is “ Caffeine for Linux ” ?
Caffeine keeps your computer awake !
It ’s a little coffee - cup applet that sits in the notification area :
When you click on it , the coffee - cup fills up and keeps your computer from going to sleep :
It also inhibits the screensaver .
Why is this Important ?
Imagine that you ’re giving a presentation .
The room is illuminated only by the blue glow of the projector , displaying your slides on the screen behind you .
You linger on a particularly crucial slide , carefully explaining the subtleties to your mesmerized audience .
Several minutes pass , and just as you are about deliver the stunning conclusion , the projector goes dark , displaying only a tiny “ No Signal ” message in the bottom corner .
I expect that everyone reading this has seen some presentation or other where the display powered off or the screensaver came on halfway through .
Do n’t let this happen to you !
But That ’s Not All !
There are a depressingly large number of fullscreen games available on Linux that do n’t properly inhibit the screensaver .
With Caffeine , you can fix this problem quite easily ; no scripting required .
It ’s also handy for watching long flash videos without having to tap the Shift key every few minutes .
In fact , the new 1.0 auto- activation features make these two things even easier than before .
There are three types of auto-activation that can be configured in the preferences :
You can configure Caffeine to automatically start preventing the screensaver and powersaving whenever a particular program is running .
To set this up , just run the program that should inhibit the screensaver , right - click on the Caffeine applet , select “ Preferences ” , and then click “ Add ” .
You should see a list of all running processes in the pop -up window .
Click the name of the program that you started earlier and click “ Add ” .
Close the preferences window .
In about 30 seconds , you should see the coffee - cup applet spontaneously fill up .
If you want to set this up for a fullscreen application , just run the application , wait a minute or so and then quit .
When you go into the Caffeine preferences to add a new auto- activation program , your fullscreen application should be listed under the “ Recent Processes ” tab .
Caffeine can also automatically prevent the screensaver and sleep mode when a flash video is playing in Firefox .
This works for many popular flash video websites , most notably youtube.com .
Unfortunately , there are also some websites for which this wo n’t work , like hulu.com ( a workaround for this issue is available ; see Isaiah ’s post for details ) .
Finally , Caffeine can be configured to auto - activate whenever you play Quake Live , a version of Quake III that you can play for free right in your web browser .
Hopefully , these features will allow you to deal with any powersaving inhibition issues that you encounter on your Linux box .
Once you get Caffeine configured , you should never have to think about it again .
Caffeine is also available in several new languages .
In some cases , the translations are not totally complete , but are enough for typical day - to - day use .
Installation Instructions
At the moment , the easiest way to install Caffeine is through the project ’s PPA .
Just copy and paste the following three commands into a terminal :
sudo bash -c " echo ' deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/caffeine-developers/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main ' >> /etc/apt/sources.list " sudo apt - key adv -- keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com -- recv-keys 569113
AE sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get install caffeine
However , we do hope to get Caffeine 1.0 into the official repositories in the near future .
Where Do We Go From Here ?
Caffeine 1.0 now has all of the features that I originally envisioned , and plenty more features on top of that .
Still , now that 1.0 is here , I can see now that there is still room for improvement .
The major task for the 2.0 release of Caffeine will be to make it easier to configure .
We hope to do this through an online database of programs that have difficulty inhibiting powersaving on Linux .
Our goal is to implement the capability for Caffeine to regularly download the online database of problematic programs , if the user explicitly enables it .
There are some details that still need to be worked out , such as how to prevent a hostile individual from adding well - behaved programs to the database and thus draining people ’s batteries unnecessarily .
However , if we do manage to figure these things out , then it could become possible to fix all “ powersaving - challenged ” programs by simply installing Caffeine and enabling the database download feature .
Conclusion
I guess that ’s it .
If you have any ideas for new features , please post a comment or write a blueprint the project page .
If you discover a bug , you can report it here .
Finally , I ’d like to say thanks to all the people who have contributed to Caffeine for Linux .
Your hard work is helping to eliminate a major source of headaches for Linux users , and thus helping to push the whole Linux desktop experience forward .
How many students does it take to power a light bulb ?
Just one , if that student works out on an elliptical machine at the Cal State San Bernardino fitness center .
Like fit hamsters in power - generating wheels , the exercisers actually provide the center 's power .
It 's the first California school to convert human exercise into electricity .
" The harder they work out and the longer they work out , they 'll generate more electricity , " said Rick Craig , director of recreation .
Each elliptical machine generates about 100 watts of power per hour .
The electricity flows to a power grid , which is located in a fitness center closet .
A 30 - minute workout can power a laptop for about a half hour .
The same workout can power a flourescent bulb for 90 minutes .
" I think it 's really good idea , " said student Sara Calderon .
" We might as well be generating clean energy .
We 're all here to get our energy and relax .
Obviously there are a lot of health benefits . "
The equipment cost the school less than $ 15,000 .
Another reason for Windows users to hate the Microsoft Patch Tuesday policy ,
The exploit is n’t 100 % reliable but it ’s still fairly significant in my eyes as it is a critical vulnerability and can be used for code execution .
Vista is n’t the most popular OS still so perhaps Microsoft do n’t the threat being that wide as the protocol this exploit focuses on ( SMB 2 ) was only introducted in Vista .
A security researcher has downplayed the significance of publicly released attack code exploiting a critical vulnerability in newer versions of Windows , saying it is n’t reliable enough to force Microsoft to issue an emergency patch .
The exploit , which on Monday was folded into the open - source Metasploit penetration testing kit , is at best successful only 50 percent of the time , said Dave Aitel , CTO of security firm Immunity .
Given the burden of releasing out - of - schedule patches , Microsoft is unlikely to do so in this case .
“ To move something like Microsoft you ’ve got to have something major and this is n’t quite it , ” Aitel , whose company released its own attack code two weeks ago .
“ It ’s going to be a lot of work to take the exploit where it is to something that works enough that they will do that . ”
It seems like the exploit is more reliable with Windows on VMware , but honestly how commonly do you see that ?
With a real native Windows installation they are only seeing a 10 % success rate .
Which really is n’t that serious is it ?
Apparently Immunity have made it much more reliable , but they have poured a ton of resources into it .
The vulnerability , which surfaced three weeks ago , resides in file - sharing technology called SMB2 , short for server message block version 2 , which was first added to Windows Vista and later made its way into newer versions of the operating system .
While the Metasploit exploit is sophisticated , it is frequently thwarted by a security measure known as ASLR .
Short for address space layout randomization , it picks a different memory location to load system components each time the OS is started .
Without being able to predict where required code will be located , the Metasploit attack is n’t reliable enough to prompt Microsoft to take the drastic step of releasing a patch outside of the regularly scheduled update cycle .
The software giant adopted the patch routine to make life easier on system administrators by allowing them to plan and test updates before installing them on huge numbers of business critical machines .
The Metasploit exploit in many cases is able to get around ASLR by targeting memory locations that are predictable when Windows is running on VMware .
But when the exploit targets the OS running directly on a computer , the success rate can be as low as 10 percent .
Microsoft will patch this eventually , but I doubt it ’ll be soon and they definitely wo n’t be rushing an out - of - schedule patch out just for this vulnerability .
The question is can the bad guys fashion this into a reliable exploit and get some major ownage going on ?

WASHINGTON — There 's nothing neutral in the battle between AT&T Inc. and Google Inc. over the future of the Internet .
Google , the powerhouse of Silicon Valley , and AT&T , champion for the old - line phone industry , are marshaling political allies , lobbyists and — in AT&T 's case — labor unions for a fight over proposed " net neutrality " rules that could affect tens of billions of dollars in investments needed to upgrade the U.S. broadband network , which lags in speed and affordability compared with some countries .

Australian race fans will have to choose their drinks wisely Australian police are gearing up for an annual crackdown on motor - racing fans - limiting race - goers to 24 cans of beer a day .
Spectators at the Bathurst 1000 - a three - day race meeting staged this week - will be told to stick to just the one " slab " of beer while at the racetrack .
Wine - drinkers must also show restraint , facing a four litres per day limit .
Police hope the limits will prevent the famous New South Wales race being blighted by alcohol - related violence .
Known as " The Great Race " , the Bathurst 1000 is a 1,000 km ( 621 mile ) event , the highlight of the three - day meeting held annually in the town of the same name .
Boasting a long , proud history , the race - seen as the most prestigious motor event in Australia - is currently contested by teams of drivers racing powerful touring cars equipped with V8 engines .
The " one - slab " limit was first imposed in 2007 , with police insisting drunken hooligans were tarnishing the reputation of the race and causing disruption in town .
Those choosing to drink lower - strength beer will be allowed to bring in 36 cans , police said .
Pilgrimage
The limits - and a tougher police presence around the racetrack - were greeted with dismay by some race - goers when they were first introduced .
Many fans making the annual pilgrimage continue to feel they should be able to drink as much as they like while watching the race .
But police insist the limits are necessary .
Alcohol has been blamed for violence elsewhere in Australia , with drink seen as a factor in sparking race - related riots in Sydney in 2005 .
Race - related violence in Sydney in 2005 was part - blamed on alcohol " This is one of the greatest motorsport events in Australia and for some it is a pilgrimage that they make every year , " Assistant Commissioner Alan Clarke said .
" Police respect people 's rights to enjoy the race weekend , but will promptly act when the law is broken .
" Every year thousands of race fans attend and enjoy the event and police will not allow their safety to be compromised by a drunken few .
" As such we will once again be focusing on alcohol - related behaviour , " he said .

NEW DELHI : In a highly idelogical response on Maoists , CPM general secretary Prakash Karat on Friday said ultra-Left in India was nothing but part of " Left - sectarian and anarchist trend " .
Stressing the need for " political - idelogical exposure " of Maoists in India , Karat , however , cautioned the government not to treat them as terrorists and even admitted that they had struck a chord among tribals and a section of intelligentsia .
Comparing current violence in West Bengal to the one that swept through the state in the early 1970s , Karat said he was hopeful that it could be dealt with ideologically just the way it was done in the past .
He cited election results to show that while CPM lost support among middle classes , it had retained support among tribals .
Violence against his party cadre , Karat said , was not a new phenomenon because Marxists mobilised people whom the extremists want to win over .
Giving out a historical perspective on the growth of Maoists in India , Karat said wherever Left has grown , there has been Left - sectarian and anarchist trends .
He cited Lenin saying how petty bourgeoisie was drawn to anarchism when it experienced horrors of capitalism .
Karat , who had taken time off from party work in the mid-1980s to study naxalism , said before understanding Maoists it was important to understand their world view .
Maoists , he said , saw South Asia on the verge of revolution while West Asia was seen as a focal point of struggle against imperialism .
This 1970 photo provided Tuesday by Alcatel - Lucent shows Bell Labs researchers Willard Boyle , left , and George Smith at Bell Labs in Murray Hill , N.J. , with the charge - coupled device , which transforms patterns of light into useful digital information .
(( Alcatel - Lucent / Bell Labs / Associated Press ) )
A scientist born in Amherst , N.S. , is sharing the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in developing the sensor that is widely used in digital cameras .
Willard S. Boyle will share the award with George E. Smith and Charles Kao for their " groundbreaking achievements " in physics , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Tuesday .
Willard S. Boyle , shown in 2005 , is one of three scientists sharing in the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics .
( ( Black Star / Rob Allen / Canadian Press ) )
Boyle , 85 , was born in Amherst in 1924 and moved to northern Quebec as a child so his father could work as a doctor at a lumber camp .
He was home - schooled by his mother until he went to high school at Lower Canada College in Montreal .
He flew Spitfires in the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Canadian Navy in the Second World War .
After the war , Boyle went back to school and completed a PhD in physics at McGill University in 1950 .
He taught physics at the Royal Military College in Kingston , Ont. , before joining Bell Labs in New Jersey .
Boyle is a father of four and has been married to his wife , Betty , for 62 years .
They have 10 grandchildren and one great - grandchild .
Boyle said becoming a Nobel laureate has been a surprise .
" They do n't tell you until the last minute , and it 's the biggest surprise of your life to wake up and somebody says you 've won a Nobel Prize , " Boyle told CBC News from his condo in Halifax .
Boyle said the call came at 5:15 a.m. AT .
" I just found out because my wife punched me , she woke me up and she said , ' It 's not a joke , ' " he said .
Boyle holds dual Canadian and American citizenship , and Smith is American .
Kao holds British and American citizenship .
The scientists ' discoveries include the transmission of light in fibres for optical communication and the invention of the charge - coupled device ( CCD sensor ) , which is an imaging semiconductor circuit used as a digital camera 's electronic eye .
The work by the three scientists has " helped shape the foundations of today 's networked society , " the committee said .
" They have created many practical innovations for everyday life and provided new tools for scientific exploration , " said the prize citation .
' Revolutionized photography '
Boyle and Smith , 79 , invented the first charge - coupled device , which is a semiconductor circuit that transforms light into electric signals that produce a large number of image points , or pixels , in a short time .
The invention " revolutionized photography , " the citation said .
The technology is also commonly used in medical imaging .
" Digital photography has become an irreplaceable tool in many fields of research .
The CCD has provided new possibilities to visualize the previously unseen .
It has given us crystal clear images of distant places in our universe as well as the depths of the oceans , " the citation said .
Boyle said the idea for the device was born while sketching up possibilities on a blackboard at Bell Labs in October 1969 .
" We realized here is something that is pretty interesting because it will for the first time enable technology to store photographs and transmit them and use them somewhere else .
There was no film involved , " he said .
Though the CCD sensor is most commonly used by the general public in their digital cameras , Boyle said he is most proud of the telescopic applications it has in astronomy .
The device is used to capture images from the Hubble Space Telescope and Mars rovers .
" We saw for the first time the surface of Mars , " Boyle told The Associated Press .
" It would n't have been possible without our invention . "
Boyle 's other inventions include the first continuously operating ruby laser and he also worked with NASA to provide technological support during the Apollo space program .
Global broadband communication
Meanwhile , Kao , 75 , calculated how to transmit light over long distances via optical glass fibres , which allow global broadband communication .
" Kao 's enthusiasm inspired other researchers to share his vision of the future potential of fibre optics , " the citation said .
Optical fibres now " make up the circulatory system that nourishes our communication society , " said the citation .
The award includes 10 million kronor ( $ 1.5 million ) .
Kao will receive half the purse while Boyle and Smith each get a quarter .
All three will receive a diploma and an invitation to the prize ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on Dec. 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death in 1896 .
The prize announcement is the second of six awards focusing on medicine , physics , chemistry , economics , literature and the Peace Prize that will be announced through Oct. 12 .
Alfred Nobel , the Swede who invented dynamite , established the prizes in his will in the categories of medicine , physics , chemistry , literature and peace .
The economics prize is technically not a Nobel but a 1968 creation of Sweden 's central bank .
On Monday , three American scientists shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering a key mechanism in the genetic operations of cells , an insight that has inspired new lines of research into cancer .
It sounds like a classic horror story -- eyeless , mouthless worms lurk in the dark , settling onto dead animals and sending out green " roots " to devour their bones .
In fact , such worms do exist in the deep sea .
They were first discovered in 2002 by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ( MBARI ) , who were using a robot submarine to explore Monterey Canyon .
But that was n't the end of the story .
After " planting " several dead whales on the seafloor , a team of biologists recently announced that as many as 15 different species of boneworms may live in Monterey Bay alone .
After years of study , the researchers have begun to piece together the bizarre story of the boneworms , all of which are in the genus Osedax .
The worms start out as microscopic larvae , drifting through the darkness of the deep sea .
At some point they encounter a large dead animal on the seafloor .
It may be a whale , an elephant seal , or even the carcass of a cow that washed out to sea during a storm .
Following chemical cues , the tiny larvae settle down onto the bones of the dead animal .
Once settled , the boneworms grow quickly , like weeds after a rain .
One end of each worm develops feathery palps , which extract oxygen from seawater .
The other end of the worm develops root - like appendages that grow down into the bone .
Bacteria within these roots are believed to digest proteins and perhaps lipids within the bones , providing nutrition for the worms .
Soon the worms become sexually mature .
Strangely enough , they all become females .
Additional microscopic larvae continue to settle in the area .
Some of these larvae land on the palps of the female worms .
These develop into male worms .
But they never grow large enough to be seen by the naked eye .
Somehow these microscopic male worms find their way into the tube that surrounds the female 's body .
Dozens of them share this space , not eating at all , but releasing sperm that fertilize the female 's eggs .
Eventually the female worm sends thousands of fertilized eggs out into the surrounding water , and the cycle begins again .
Dr. Robert Vrijenhoek , an evolutionary biologist at MBARI , has been fascinated with these worms ever since he and his colleagues first discovered their unusual lifestyles and bizarre reproductive habits .
Vrijenhoek has been trying to find out how widespread and genetically diverse these worms are .
He would also like to know how they manage to find and colonize the bones of dead whales in the vast , pitch - black expanse of the deep seafloor .
Between 2004 and 2008 , Vrijenhoek 's research team towed five dead whales off of Monterey Bay beaches and sank them at different depths within Monterey Canyon .
Every few months , coauthor Shannon Johnson and others on the team would send one of MBARI 's remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) down to study the worms and other animals that had colonized the whale carcasses .
To their surprise , the different whale carcasses yielded different types of boneworms .
One whale carcass hosted three or four different types of worms .
After examining all of the worms , coauthor Greg Rouse concluded that most of them were entirely new to science .
The researchers also discovered that the worms would colonize cow - bones placed on the seafloor , which showed that the worms were not limited to feeding on dead whales .
In their recent paper in the journal BMC Biology , Vrijenhoek and his coauthors describe the results of extensive DNA analyses on all the different types of Osedax worms that have been discovered so far ( including two species found off Sweden and Japan ) .
This work suggests that these worms could belong to as many as 17 different species , most of which have yet to be named .
None of the worms appear to interbreed , despite the fact that some of them grow side by side .
Based on their appearance and similarities in their DNA , the researchers divided the boneworms into several groups .
Some of the worms have feathery palps , which may be red , pink , striped , or even greenish in color .
Others have bare palps .
One type of boneworm has no palps at all .
Its body forms a single , long , tapering tube , which curls at the end like a pig 's tail .
This worm has evolved to live in the seafloor sediment near a dead whale .
It sends long , fibrous " roots " into the mud , presumably in search of fragments of bone on which to feed .
Knowing how fast the DNA of these worms changes ( mutates ) over time , the researchers can calculate how long it has been since worms in the genus Osedax first evolved as a distinct group .
Using one possible estimate of mutation rates , the researchers hypothesized that this group could have evolved about 45 million years ago -- about the time the first large open - ocean whales show up in the fossil record .
Alternatively , the worms may have evolved more slowly , which would suggest that the genus is much older , and first evolved about 130 million years ago .
If this second estimate is correct , the worms could have feasted on the bones of immense sea-going reptiles during the age of the dinosaurs .
Eventually the researchers will give all these new worms their own species names .
First , however , they must collect enough samples of each possible species for additional laboratory analysis and distribution to type - specimen collections .
Like a classic horror story , the macabre saga of the boneworms will continue to thrill marine biologists for years to come .

All agree that the bursting of the housing bubble caused the financial collapse of 2008 .
Most agree that the housing bubble started in 1997 .
Less well understood is that this bubble was the result of government policies that lowered mortgage - lending standards to increase home ownership .
One of the key players was the controversial liberal advocacy group , Acorn ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) .
The watershed moment was the 1992 Federal Housing Enterprises ...
A few days ago masak blogged about the social aspect of the is Perl 6 really Perl ? question .
He presumes that the answer is yes , but does n't tell us why .
I 'll try to give some reasons .
Perl 6 started as the successor to Perl 5
Perl 6 started off as the successor to Perl 5 , at a Perl 5 meeting , by the Perl crowd .
It was a plan to escape both the backwards compatibility trap ( which meant that broken things could n't be fixed without many people yelling ) , and the lack of momentum in the community .
Perl 6 embraces the Perl philosophy
What makes Perl Perl ?
In my opinion it's not the sigils on variables that make Perl Perl , or that writing a regex only need two characters and so on .
It 's mostly the philosophy that makes the difference .
There are some underlying principles like TIMTOWTDI , context sensitivity , convenience over consistency , making simple things easy and hard things possible , often used constructs short and less frequent things longer , and so on .
Perl 6 is founded on all those philosophies and ideals , and also shares some technical principles .
For example sigils on variables ( oh , I mentioned them already ... ) , easy access to powerful regexes , that fact that operations coerce their arguments ( instead of the type of arguments determining the operation like in javascript , where a + can either mean addition or string concatenation ) .
So if you agree with my definition of what makes Perl Perl , Perl 6 is also Perl .
If not , please tell me what 's the essence of Perl !
Proponents of auditing the Federal Reserve have a new bill to support their cause .
Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D. , Ore. ) and Sen. Bob Corker ( R. , Tenn . ) introduced legislation today to require the Government Accountability Office to audit several of the central bank ’s emergency lending programs that were created during the financial crisis .
The two junior senators are joining a movement that has drawn more than two - thirds of the House and a third of the Senate .
But their legislation , the Federal Reserve Accountability Act , is intended to sidestep criticism that auditing the central bank would hinder the Fed ’s independence in conducting monetary policy .
The bill directs the GAO — the investigative arm of Congress — to audit emergency lending programs that are n’t already subject to government audits .
( Institution - specific lending programs , such as those tied to AIG and Bear Stearns , are already open to GAO review , as are programs conducted jointly with the Treasury Department . )
To avoid disrupting markets , the legislation directs the GAO to redact from its reports the names of specific institutions using the programs and “ identifying details regarding assets or collateral ” held in the audited facilities .
But that information would be released one year after each program is no longer used .
The legislation specifically cites programs created under the Fed ’s 13.3 authority , which allows central bank lending to any firm in “ unusual and exigent ” circumstances : the money market investor funding facility , the asset - backed commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility , the term asset - backed securities loan facility , the primary dealer credit facility and the commercial paper funding facility .
Mr. Merkley , in a statement , said the legislation “ strikes the right balance between protecting taxpayer dollars and respecting the central bank ’s responsibility to manage monetary policy . ”
Mr. Corker said it allows audits of emergency facilities “ without inappropriately compromising the independence of the Fed or politicizing its role in crafting monetary policy . ”
Fed officials may not necessarily see it that way .
The bill avoids review of the Fed ’s regular lending programs , such as the longstanding discount window , and its interest - rate decisions .
But some of the emergency programs are central to monetary policy operations that the Fed wants to keep outside of GAO review .
Still , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials have indicated a willingness to work with lawmakers on more disclosure outside of any GAO reviews .
Last month , Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez said the Fed is “ giving serious consideration ” to releasing the names of firms that receive loans from the central bank .
Many backers of the original audit - the - Fed legislation are unlikely to find the Merkley / Corker alternative to be appealing .
The House bill , by Texas Republican Ron Paul , would open all of the Fed ’s operations — not just emergency programs — to a review by the GAO .
The legislation has 303 co-sponsors , including more than 100 Democrats .
A matching Senate bill by independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont has 30 sponsors ( the vast majority Republicans ) .
Still , the Merkley / Corker bill could be appealing for lawmakers who are looking for middle ground on the issue .
At the very least , it raises the odds that audit legislation in some form will clear the Senate , as it ’s expected to in the House .
A Fed spokeswoman said Mr. Bernanke “ has said the Fed wants to work with Congress to assure them of the operational integrity of our liquidity facilities , including sound accounting , financial and internal controls .
We look forward to working with the Senate Banking Committee and Senators Merkley , Corker and others in achieving that goal . ”
UPDATE 6:30 PM : Sen .
Corker , in an interview , said he views his bill not as a compromise but a “ minimal step ” in auditing the Fed .
He said he ’s awaiting negotiations by Mr. Paul in the House regarding audit legislation and might support what comes out of that .
But he does n’t want his bill viewed as an offer from the Senate to resolve those negotiations .
“ I went along with this bill because it was a Democrat willing to look at this audit , ” he said .
“ This is at a minimum what I believe should occur . ”
Sen .
Corker said he has n’t signed onto Senate bill 604 , which mirrors Mr. Paul ’s House version , because he does n’t think the GAO should review the Fed ’s development of monetary policy .
But he supports audits of all Fed credit facilities , not just the emergency programs outlined in his bill .
“ I believe that all financial transactions that the Fed is involved in are perfectly legitimately auditable and should be , ” he said .

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts recently held that officers may not place GPS tracking devices on cars without first getting a warrant .
The case , Commonwealth v. Connolly , was decided under the state corollary to the Fourth Amendment , and its reasoning may influence pending GPS tracking cases , including United States v. Jones , where EFF is an amicus .
Connolly decided that the installation of the GPS device was a seizure of the suspect ’s vehicle .
“ When an electronic surveillance device is installed in a motor vehicle , be it a beeper , radio transmitter , or GPS device , the government 's control and use of the defendant 's vehicle to track its movements interferes with the defendant 's interest in the vehicle notwithstanding that he maintains possession of it . ”
Thus , the court held this interference with the owner ’s possessory interest requires a warrant .
Interestingly , Connolly did not hold that it was a violation of the state constitution to use GPS technology to track suspects as they drive .
The court merely acknowledged two 1970s era U.S. Supreme Court cases that had found that the Fourth Amendment did not regulate the use of primitive beeper technology that helped officers follow a suspect ’s public movements , before moving on to the question of whether the installation was a seizure .
Another recent state court case , People v. Weaver in the State of New York , has held that because modern GPS devices are far more powerful than beepers , police must get a warrant to use the trackers , even on cars and people traveling the public roads .
Massachusetts and New York are in the forefront of protecting their citizens ’ right to location privacy against technological encroachment .
Federal courts should do the same under the Fourth Amendment .
For the Constitution to have continued relevance in a technological world , it should protect the privacy that individuals reasonably anticipate as we move through the world , and that means no pervasive , remote , suspicionless , wholesale tracking by GPS or other device .
Summarized below are the statistical averages tracking the number of fights , disclosed payouts , and disclosed bonus money for most UFC events since 2006 .
Please keep in mind that disclosed salaries are not always available , nor are they a true representation of the total purse a fighter receives in the UFC .
Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 Δ 2006 – 2009 Fights / Event 8.88 9.08 9.92 10.50 18.31 % All UFC Events $ 376,406 $ 614,077 $ 735,000 $ 898,375 138.67 % UFN / TUF Events $ 170,250 $ 245,300 $ 321,833 $ 434,665 155.31 % UFC
Events $ 500,100 $ 844,563 $ 1,089,143 $ 1,176,600 135.27 % Bonuses $ 162,500 $ 196,667 $ 216,333 33.13 %
Payout Perspective :
The disclosed payouts submitted to athletic commissions represent only a portion of the entire purse that UFC fighters receive for participating in a match .
All fighters receive varying degrees of sponsorship money for endorsing certain clothing or company brands while fighting .
Many of the fighters receive undisclosed bonuses from the UFC on a per fight basis .
Some of the UFC ’s top draws also have PPV bonuses written into their contract , which give them a cut of the buyrate they helped to generate .
What does this tell us ?
We are able to observe that disclosed fighter payouts are increasing .
The rate at which disclosed payouts are increasing exceeds the growth of the number of fights per card .
We can then extrapolate that disclosed payouts are also increasing per fighter .
Finally , we may also loosely extrapolate that total payouts per fighter are increasing .
If , that is , we can correctly assume that undisclosed bonuses , sponsorship money , and PPV cuts have also increased at a rate which matches the growth of the UFC / MMA in the last four years .
What does n’t this tell us ?
Whether the growth in disclosed fighter pay is uniform or top - heavy ( i.e. , has everyone received a raise , or just the big money earners ? ) .
Whether the increase in fighters payouts equals , exceeds , or trails the change in UFC revenues over the corresponding period of time .
Conclusion
It ’s tough to deny that the UFC is increasing the amount which it pays its fighters ; whether those increases are enough for some people is an entirely different matter .
I would certainly advocate that we lack too much information to make an accurate assessment one way or another .
However , I do believe it ’s fair to point out that the above evidence would suggest that , as the UFC continues to grow , so too will the financial prospects of its current and former fighters .

MOSCOW , Aug 26 ( Reuters ) - Russia plans to invest up to 60 trillion roubles ( $ 1.9 trillion ) in its energy sector by 2030 in a drive to boost stagnanting oil and gas output , two sources in the government said on Wednesday .
They said Asian markets would increase their share of Russia ’s energy export volumes to 25 percent by 2030 from only 6 percent today .
“ Europe ’s share is set to decrease , although volumes will be rising , ” one of the sources said on condition of anonymity .
Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said Russia ’s Energy Strategy - 2030 plan would be revised on Thursday at a government meeting presided over by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
He gave no further details .
One of the government sources said the plan foresaw an increase in Russian oil output to 530 - 535 million tonnes by 2030 from 481.1 million tonnes in 2008 .
Natural gas output would rise to 880 - 940 billion cubic metres from 665 bcm last year , he said .
For this , the authorities plan to set aside a total 60 trillion roubles , or 5.0 - 5.5 percent of gross domestic product each year .
Energy exports contribute a large share of Russia ’s budget , but oil output fell last year for the first time in a decade .

Post - nuclear punk odyssey Godkiller is making the jump from indie comic book to “ illustrated film ” with engaging animation that merges sequential art , 3 - D CGI and motion graphics .
Which is different from a motion comic because … wait , how is it different again ?
“ It ’s a purely aesthetic difference , ” explained Matt Pizzolo , the Godkiller writer and filmmaker who founded indie studio Halo - 8 .
“ In illustrated films , we drive the pace of the storytelling with the dramatic voice performances and the sound design , so that allows us to showcase the illustrations in a way where you can really take a moment to absorb the art in the same way you can when reading a comic book , ” Pizzolo told Wired.com in an e-mail interview .
Godkiller , previewed in the exclusive clip above , is a horrific yarn of apocalypse , quantum physics , culture jamming and conspiracy theory .
The illustrated film features voiceovers from sci-fi standouts like Lance Henriksen ( Aliens , Millennium ) , Nicki Clyne ( Battlestar Galactica ) , cult priestess Lydia Lunch and singers Justin Pierre of Motion City Soundtrack and Davey Havok of A.F.I .
“ Motion comics are closer to a form of ‘ limited animation ’ that uses comics as source material , ” Pizzolo said .
“ Illustrated films are closer to the experimental cinema of Ralph Bakshi‘s work , Chris Marker ’s La Jetée or animation like Liquid Television . ”
Halo - 8 is adopting the comic book world ’s episodic release schedule for Godkiller , which will come out on short - form DVD in three stages .
The first episode drops Tuesday , with the second due Nov. 24 and the third in January 2010 , when the full feature will premiere theatrically .
In March , the whole enchilada lands on DVD and Blu-ray .
With Godkiller , the self - described “ Hollywood 2.0 ” studio is riding a comics - cinema merge that ’s as interesting as it is lucrative .
And Halo - 8 is not just riding Godkiller : In September , the studio entered into a deal with DreamWorks Animation and reboot kingpins Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci ( Star Trek , Transformers ) to turn James Farr ’s Flash - animated sci-horror series and comic Xombie into a live - action blockbuster .
“ Comics are driving media right now because so many creators grew up as obsessive fans , ” Pizzolo said .
“ You now have one of the first generations of media makers who are as influenced by comics books as they are by film and TV . ”
If the new digital paradigm of motion comics , illustrated films or whatever you want to call them finds success , expect even more creative crossovers .
“ In terms of it exploding as a market , that all depends on whether or not comics readers embrace the new animation formats and digital comic technologies , ” Pizzolo said .
“ If they feel like we ’re bastardizing the art form , then they ’ll tell us to fuck off and the market wo n’t grow . ”
Graphic novels , whether rendered into traditional panels or Flash - animated series , have already become pop culture ’s de facto narrative format .
Now they ’re primed to unseat conventional novels as box - office beasts , just waiting for some producer to come along and pluck them off the money tree .
At least , that ’s the theory .
The reality is still messy .
“ I think one of the problems is the role of comics shops , ” Pizzolo said .
“ They are one of the few remaining mom-and - pop marketplaces not yet dominated by chains .
A lot of these technologies are circumventing comic shops in favor of iTunes and others , and I think that ’s dangerous . ”

Amid rising anticipation of a US - Israeli agreement on a settlement freeze , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US envoy George Mitchell said they would meet again Wednesday after an inconclusive visit Tuesday in Jerusalem .
With one week until the United Nations General Assembly opens in New York , the contested issue has taken on new urgency .
President Barack Obama , whose administration has strongly encouraged a settlement freeze as a way to jumpstart Arab - Israeli peace talks , seeks to meet Mr. Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the UN gathering .
But Mr. Abbas has refused to resume negotiations before Israel agrees to a total freeze .
Netanyahu , under pressure from his right - wing constituents not to succumb to Washington 's demands , last week approved permits for 455 new housing units to be built in the settlements – bringing to nearly 3,000 the number of homes his government would likely exclude from any settlement freeze .
Originally encouraged by the government after Israel expanded its territory in the 1967 war with its Arab neighbors , settlements were meant to seed Israeli " pioneers " and to extend the Jewish state 's defenses .
Now numbering 121 , their purpose and legality draw varying definitions and fuel relentless debate .
This Monitor briefing examines those definitions , explains the varying interpretations of international law , and looks at the trends in settlement growth over the past few decades .
What is a settlement ?
A settlement is any residential area built over the Green Line , the 1949 cease - fire line established between the newly established Jewish state and its Arab neighbors .
Today , Israelis live in several key areas that Israel took control of in the 1967 Six - Day War : the West Bank , East Jerusalem , and Syria 's Golan Heights .
As a key part of his Middle East policy , President Barack Obama has insisted that Israel freeze settlement expansion as a confidence - building gesture to help relaunch Middle East peace talks .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not commence negotiations with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unless he halts settlement growth first .
Arab governments have also made a withdrawal to 1967 borders a prerequisite to making peace with Israel .
The main focus is on settlements in the West Bank , where Israeli pockets give the mainly Palestinian territory a Swiss - cheese look ( see map ) .
Palestinians and their supporters describe settlements as " facts on the ground " that will force the hand of future negotiators determining the borders of a Palestinian state .
How many are there ?
From 30 in the early 1970s , West Bank settlements now number 121 , and the settler population there this year surpassed 300,000 .
An additional 17,000 Israelis live in the Golan Heights and 193,000 in East Jerusalem , where Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state .
( Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and thus does not consider citizens there settlers , but most international and human rights organizations do . )
Formerly , 8,000 settlers lived in the Gaza Strip , but they were evacuated in 2005 under former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's disengagement plan .
According to figures from Israel 's Central Bureau of Statistics and the Foundation for Middle East Peace ( FMEP ) in Washington , the settler population in the West Bank and Gaza has increased three times faster , on average , than the population within Israel proper since the 1993 Oslo peace accords were signed .
Last year , the growth rate was 4.9 percent in the West Bank compared with 1.8 percent in Israel .
Who lives there ?
After the 1967 war , Israeli governments – left and right – promoted settlements as a strategy to strengthen Israel 's defense and protect it from further attacks from neighboring Arab countries .
Proponents encouraged Israelis to go to the fledgling communities as " pioneers . "
Most eager were national - religious activists known as " Gush Emunim " or Bloc of the Faithful .
These settlers believed that Israel 's success in the 1967 war was a sign of messianic redemption , and today they view the settler movement as an irreversible return of the Jewish people to their biblical homeland .
But while many have moved for patriotic or religious reasons , other settlers seek a different lifestyle – wanting to live in a small , semirural community , or in the desert .
Some are also motivated by financial considerations .
For example , a 968 - square - foot apartment in Jerusalem 's upper - middle - class Arnona neighborhood is advertised at $ 385,000 , while a 1076 - square - foot apartment in the burgeoning settlement of Maale Adumim just a 10 - minute drive away can be bought for $ 186,000 .
While most government incentives for settlers , such as grants and tax breaks , were eliminated under Mr. Sharon , Israelis can often still obtain more advantageous mortgages for homes in settlements .
Since the Oslo Accords , Israel has also ramped up construction of roads serving settlements .
Many are only intended to service settlements and not neighboring Palestinian villages .
Btselem , an Israeli rights group , says that some of these new roads are forbidden to Palestinian traffic .
Are they illegal ?
The United Nations considers the West Bank , East Jerusalem , and the Golan Heights occupied territory ; Israel considers them territories under its administration and officially refers to the West Bank by the biblical names Judea and Samaria .
Much of the international community also does not recognize Israel 's annexation in 1967 of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem , which it declared its " complete and united " capital .
Palestinians and many international organizations say that on the basis of the Fourth Geneva Convention , the settlements are a serious violation of international law .
Article 49 says that the occupying power " shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies . "
Israel holds that the West Bank , East Jerusalem , and the Golan Heights are territories acquired in a defensive war , and that Geneva conventions are not applicable to the dispute : Settlers have not been moved there by force nor transferred en masse .
Israel also says that the transfer of major West Bank cities to Palestinian Authority control means that the area should no longer be considered occupied .
There are settlements that Israeli officials do consider to be illegal , however .
Known as outposts , they are established without any government permission , usually on the fringes of larger settlements .
Peace Now , an antisettlement group , counts 100 outposts .
Around 50 were established after March 2001 , when Sharon came to office and promised the US he would stop the growth of outposts , according to a government - commissioned study known as the Sasson Report .
Among these , 24 are on a list of illegal settlement outposts scheduled to be dismantled by the Israeli government .
What obligations does Israel have ?
The previous two Israeli prime ministers – Sharon and Ehud Olmert – promised to remove those 23 outposts in talks with the Bush administration .
Mr. Netanyahu has repeated that pledge .
Since coming to power in March , the Netanyahu government put a de facto freeze on issuing tenders for new housing in the settlements until Sept. 6 , when it approved permits for an additional 455 units .
The approximately 2,500 issued previously would allow developers to move ahead once they are ready – potentially increasing by tens of thousands the number of housing units under construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , which currently stands at 1,000 , according to Peace Now .
Moreover , government - sponsored construction constitutes about 40 percent of all construction in the territories , Peace Now says , with the rest funded by private initiatives and settler groups .
A video posted to YouTube a few weeks ago making the rounds across the internet apparently shows Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck having Vicks applied under his eyes in order to cry on cue for a photo shoot .
One blog , Sensico , mocks , “ This is only shocking video to those that love Glenn Beck and think he cries non -stop because he ‘ loves this country . ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The blog links to a montage of Beck crying jags put to the theme song of “ The Crying Game ” as sung by Boy George : YouTube link .
In April , Comedy Central ’s Stephen Colbert mocked one of Beck ’s tear - ups , by pretending to be choked up about it : “ I ’m sorry .
I just love Glenn Beck ’s sanity — and I fear for it . ”
Of course , using Vicks to cry during a staged photo shot would n’t be the same as using it to produce tears on television about how the country “ is turning Socialist . ”
So , until another tape surfaces showing Beck getting the Vicks treatment before a rant on Fox , it would be premature to speculate that he only emits fugazi tears .
But if Beck is outed as a Vicks - enabled weeper , then there are other tricks of the trade he can employ .
A wikiHOW manual offers many suggestions such as , “ Make a crying face , which usually involves closing your eyes and scrunching your face . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Turn the corners of your lips down a little , ” the manual advises .
“ Try to force the inner corners of your eyebrows upwards .
Wrinkle up your chin like people do right before they start bawling . ”
However , the manual notes , “ This may look faked . ”
So , another suggestion is to “ try pinching hard in some sensitive parts of your body , ” and “ tears will automatically flow down . ”
UPDATE
In a post entitled “ Internet Finally Discovers Glenn Beck Photoshoot Video , Freaks Out , ” Huffington Post ’s Jason Linkins blogs , “ Depending on your point of view , this is either the object demonstration of a time - tested photographer ’s trick , or the SMOKING GUN THAT WILL BRING DOWN GLENN BECK’S EMPIRE OF FAKE TEARS !
As you might surmise , I am opting to err on the side of calmness and serenity , because Gawker posted this video about two weeks ago , and the Republic survived . ”

Gawker did indeed post the video about two weeks ago , after it was first “ published exclusively in June , ” which we ( staff and readers who send tips ) somehow missed .
From Gawker ’s two week old blog post :
ADVERTISEMENT
It ’s difficult to take a performance artist like Glenn Beck too seriously when he keeps breaking out of character .
For instance : Time ’s new cover is another photo of him by Jill Greenberg , a liberal he pretends to hate .
The photo comes from a shoot Greenberg — whom Beck has lambasted as a liberal photo - agitator — did for a GQ story on Beck back in June , in which she made the emotionally unstable Mormon cry .
Hey , as long as she makes him look good , right ?
Here ’s the deeply unsettling behind - the - scenes video we obtained of a bawling Beck at that shoot , which we first published exclusively in June .
From Gawker ’s June post :
GQ assigned photographer Jill Greenberg to shoot Glenn Beck for an interview , in a cheeky homage to Greenberg ’s notorious series of crying children .
Funny !
Hey , did n’t Beck accuse Greenberg of “ terrorizing ” children for those photos ?
Of course he did .
Beck ’s penchant for hysterical tears makes the pairing obvious — why not ask a photographer famous for taking pictures of crybabies to shoot a blubbering TV personality ?
But Greenberg is an officially designated public enemy of the right wing : Last year , when she was hired by the Atlantic to shoot John McCain , she boasted of taking extra shots of McCain deliberately lit to make him look old and leaving “ his eyes red and his skin looking bad . ”
Also , she posted photoshopped outtakes on her web site featuring a monkey shitting on McCain ’s head .

The State And City Financial Time Bomb Ticks Louder
The financial crisis has too many pieces to follow even if it is being resolved and brought to an end as many experts expect .
The end is still far off , at least as long as unemployment stays high and consumer credit continues to shrink .
Recently , the focus of the public and politicians has been on the furious fight over the cost and shape of national healthcare and the possibility of a third stimulus package that would primarily be aimed at extending unemployment benefits , eventually for millions of people .
Lost among all of this confusion is what has happened to the states and municipalities , many of which have a deeply compromised ability to raise money to pay their deficits .
Tax receipts are down along with their credit ratings .
The People ’s Republic of China is not a ready purchaser of their debt .
In the shadow of the national financial crisis , the trouble at the local level is getting much worse and getting worse quickly .
Bloomberg recently reported that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he will know within a month whether a $ 1.1 billion drop in revenue collections in his state is part of a growing budget shortfall or an isolated event .
The huge and rising number of unemployed and under - employed could certainly cause the collection problem .
California , only recently at the brink of a financial calamity , could be back there again shortly .
The Washington Post published a special report on state and municipal pension funds .
The paper wrote “ Within 15 years , public systems on average will have less half the money they need to pay pension benefits , according to an analysis by Pricewaterhouse Coopers . ”
States and municipalities have lost about $ 1 trillion in the markets .
That $ 1 trillion problem gets to vie for capital with the $ 1.6 trillion federal budget deficit and the $ 1 trillion healthcare reform package .
To paraphrase Senator Everett Dirksen who died 40 years ago , “ A trillion here , a trillion there , and pretty soon you ’re talking real money . ”
Politicians at every level still want to believe , or at least have voters think that they believe , that everything is going to be alright with the economy and financial system .
It will only be a matter of time before GDP growth will return to 5 % or 6 % and the deficit , healthcare , and local government costs and obligations will pay for themselves .
The idea of things paying for themselves has never really worked , even in times of severe inflation .
The consequences of the debt are only pushed a little way out into the future .
A number of cities and perhaps one or two states are still at risk for either insolvency or such severe cutbacks in services that they may not look like governments at all .
Several municipalities in Michigan are in receivership , most notably Flint which was once one of the largest industrial cities in the car industry .
Several others like Pontiac may still become wards of the state .
In these towns the numbers of police are cut , so are the number of firemen , school teachers , and sanitation workers .
The areas become small collections of chaos and neighborhoods no longer linked to one another by any political bond–pockets of social calamity .
There will not be any miracle among the nation ’s cities .
There is no one to feed the 5000 with just a few loaves and fishes .
The number of people in American society who will go hungry , both physically and in terms of their finances is inextricably growing .
The pension systems around the nation , both those created by large American companies and those created for state and municipal workers class=” mceItemHidden ” > were supposed to be the ultimate in benefits programs .
They were funded by large and well - financed entities .
The actuarial calculations made certain that the capital would be available as people retired or had medical needs .
The capital in the funds was to be invested conservatively so that any trouble in the markets would have a minimum effect .
Even the bright people at Harvard and Yale lost over 25 % of their endowments over the last year .
And , they are supposed to be the smart ones .
The news that politicians want to keep from voters because they want to be re-elected is that many , many Americans will not only lose their jobs or have family members who will lose their jobs .
They will also get sick or retire without the money that was supposed to be available , would certainly be available to them , because they had worked so long and probably so well .
It is un-American to say that a problem cannot be solved , that there is nothing that can be done about something , but the chances that states and cities can regain their footing enough to insure the future of their workers and retirees is as near to zero as anything can be .

They point to dips or valleys in the graph during WW1 and WW2 where volcanic activity seems to decline .
They believe this is due to reporting on issues concerning the war and not reporting on volcanoes .
According to Earthalert there are 17 volcano reports along with three alerts in the world today .
In the last 30 days there have been 293 earthquakes registering 4.0 on the Richter scale or higher .

New version of LC exam anxiety likely to haunt Govt Analysis and Comment
Longtime counterintel official acknowledges evidence behind key aspect of allegations against Marc Grossman made by former FBI translator turned whistleblower Sibel Edmonds
Bureau vet says investigation was ' buried and covered up , ' calls for new investigation , ' accountability ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/28/2009 , 5:08 pm PT
[ UPDATE 10/5/09 : Cole has now greatly expanded on his confirmation of Edmonds ' credibility and is calling for a ' Special Counsel ' investigation , prosecution .
Full story here ...]
George W. Bush 's third - highest ranking State Department official , Marc Grossman , who became the Under Secretary of State after previously serving as Ambassador to Turkey , was targeted as part of a " decade - long investigation " by the FBI , according to an 18 - year veteran manager of the bureau 's Counterintelligence and Counterespionage departments .
For still - unknown reasons , the investigation , which also involved a multitude of cases involving Israeli espionage , was ultimately " buried and covered up , " according to the official .
The comment from the former FBI official John M. Cole , in response to recent , stunning disclosures made by former FBI translator turned whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , helps to shore up a key aspect of her allegations .
Cole is now calling for an investigation to help " bring about accountability " in the matter .
Edmonds ' allegations of bribery , blackmail , and infiltration by foreign agents at the highest levels of the U.S. government were recently detailed in a remarkable cover story interview , as published last week by the American Conservative magazine .
" I read the recent cover story by The American Conservative magazine .
I applaud their courage in publishing this significant interview , " Cole says in his public response , as posted today at the AmCon website by interviewer and former CIA agent Philip Giraldi .
Cole then went on to verify his knowledge of the espionage investigation which , he says , included Grossman .
Edmonds has long alleged he had been a key target in the agency 's counterintelligence probe of the Turkish lobby and their relationship to current and former members of Congress and high - ranking officials in the Bush State and Defense Departments .
Cole also charges , in his brief comment , that the investigation was ultimately quashed by still - unnamed officials .
" I am fully aware of the FBI 's decade - long investigation of the High - level State Department Official named in this article , Marc Grossman , which ultimately was buried and covered up , " Cole notes , adding his call to re-open the matter .
" It is long past time to investigate this case and bring about accountability . " ...
Grossman was specifically identified as a ring - leader in a very broad espionage scandal --- which includes the theft and sale of nuclear weapons technology to the foreign black market --- in a series of front - page exclusives by the UK Sunday Times in early 2008 ( the stories can be found here , here and here ) .
At the time , though the paper clearly identified the official in question , they did n't name him outright due to British libel laws .
One of the co-authors of the series , Joe Lauria , has since confirmed the official in question was , indeed , Grossman .
The 2008 Sunday Times series detailed Edmonds ' allegations that Bush 's Under Secretary of State Grossman --- the third - highest ranking official in the State Department , after Colin Powell and Richard Armitage --- worked closely with both the Turks and Israel in obtaining and selling U.S. nuclear weapons technology on the worldwide black market , and that he had even tipped off Turkish diplomatic colleagues about the true identify of then - covert CIA operative Valerie Plame - Wilson 's front company , Brewster Jennings , several years before the operation was named publicly by columnist Robert Novak .
Grossman , identified by the Times as " The senior official in the State Department [ who ] no longer works there , " was quoted offering this non-denial denial of Edmonds ' allegations in their report : " If you are calling me to say somebody said that I took money that 's outrageous .
... I do not have anything to say about such stupid ridiculous things as this . "
So far , Grossman has yet to respond to The BRAD BLOG 's requests for comment as sent to his lobbying firm , The Cohen Group , where he now serves as Vice Chairman .
" Mastering the complex and often veiled dynamic where government , politics , media , and business intersect requires a rare combination of knowledge , skills and experience , " the Cohen Group 's website announces on their " Expertise " page .
" Our Principals bring centuries of experience at the White House , the State Department , the Defense Department , and Congress . "
Founded in 2001 by President Bill Clinton 's former Republican Secretary of Defense , William Cohen , the page goes on to note : " The Cohen Group 's reach extends internationally where our Principals have developed great expertise and relationships with key political , economic and business leaders and acquired valuable experience with the individuals and institutions that affect our clients ' success abroad . "
Grossman's " veiled dynamic " and " acquired valuable experience " with " key political , economic and business leaders " may well have been in play during the time he served as Under Secretary of State , according to the startling charges levied by the former FBI translator Edmonds .
In the American Conservative interview , she details a great many specifics about the way the she says the spy ring actually worked , and claims that Grossman was a key player who , at times , would receive bags of cash from foreign operatives .
Here 's some of the discussion pertaining to Grossman from the recent interview :
PHILIP GIRALDI : We were very interested to learn of your
We were very interested to learn of your four - hour deposition in the case involving allegations that Congresswoman Jean Schmidt accepted money from the Turkish government in return for political favors .
You provided many names and details for the first time on the record and swore an oath confirming that the deposition was true .
Basically , you map out a corruption scheme involving U.S. government employees and members of Congress and agents of foreign governments .
These agents were able to obtain information that was either used directly by those foreign governments or sold to third parties , with the proceeds often used as bribes to breed further corruption .
Let 's start with the first government official you identified , Marc Grossman , then the third highest - ranking official at the State Department .
SIBEL EDMONDS : During my work with the FBI , one of the major operational files that I was transcribing and translating started in late 1996 and continued until 2002 , when I left the Bureau .
Because the FBI had had no Turkish translators , these files were archived , but were considered to be very important operations .
As part of the background , I was briefed about why these operations had been initiated and who the targets were .
Grossman became a person of interest early on in the investigative file while he was the U.S. ambassador to Turkey [ 1994 - 97 ] , when he became personally involved with operatives both from the Turkish government and from suspected criminal groups .
He also had suspicious contact with a number of official and non-official Israelis .
Grossman was removed from Turkey short of tour during a scandal referred to as " Susurluk " by the media .
It involved a number of high - level criminals as well as senior army and intelligence officers with whom he had been in contact .
Another individual who was working for Grossman , Air Force Major Douglas Dickerson , was also removed from Turkey and sent to Germany .
After he and his Turkish wife Can returned to the U.S. , he went to work for Douglas Feith and she was hired as an FBI Turkish translator .
My complaints about her connection to Turkish lobbying groups led to my eventual firing .
Grossman and Dickerson had to leave the country because a big investigation had started in Turkey .
Special prosecutors were appointed , and the case was headlined in England , Germany , Italy , and in some of the Balkan countries because the criminal groups were found to be active in all those places .
A leading figure in the scandal , Mehmet Eymür , led a major paramilitary group for the Turkish intelligence service .
To keep him from testifying , Eymür was sent by the Turkish government to the United States , where he worked for eight months as head of intelligence at the Turkish Embassy in Washington .
He later became a U.S. citizen and now lives in McLean , Virginia .
The central figure in this scandal was Abdullah Catli .
In 1989 , while " most wanted " by Interpol , he came to the U.S. , was granted residency , and settled in Chicago , where he continued to conduct his operations until 1996 .
GIRALDI : So Grossman at this point comes back to the United States .
He 's rewarded with the third - highest position at the State Department , and he allegedly uses this position to do favors for " Turkish interests " - both for the Turkish government and for possible criminal interests .
Sometimes , the two converge .
The FBI is aware of his activities and is listening to his phone calls .
When someone who is Turkish calls Grossman , the FBI monitors that individual 's phone calls , and when the Turk calls a friend who is a Pakistani or an Egyptian or a Saudi , they monitor all those contacts , widening the net .
EDMONDS : Correct .
GIRALDI : And Grossman received money as a result .
In one case , you said that a State Department colleague went to pick up a bag of money …
EDMONDS : $ 14,000 GIRALDI : What kind of information was Grossman giving to foreign countries ?
Did he give assistance to foreign individuals penetrating U.S. government labs and defense installations as has been reported ?
It 's also been reported that he was the conduit to a group of congressmen who become , in a sense , the targets to be recruited as " agents of influence . "
EDMONDS : Yes , that 's correct .
Grossman assisted his Turkish and Israeli contacts directly , and he also facilitated access to members of Congress who might be inclined to help for reasons of their own or could be bribed into cooperation .
...
GIRALDI : So the network starts with a person like Grossman in the State Department providing information that enables Turkish and Israeli intelligence officers to have access to people in Congress , who then provide classified information that winds up in the foreign embassies ?
EDMONDS : Absolutely .
And we also had Pentagon officials doing the same thing .
We were looking at Richard Perle and Douglas Feith .
They had a list of individuals in the Pentagon broken down by access to certain types of information .
Some of them would be policy related , some of them would be weapons - technology related , some of them would be nuclear - related .
Perle and Feith would provide the names of those Americans , officials in the Pentagon , to Grossman , together with highly sensitive personal information : this person is a closet gay ; this person has a chronic gambling issue ; this person is an alcoholic .
The files on the American targets would contain things like the size of their mortgages or whether they were going through divorces .
One Air Force major I remember was going through a really nasty divorce and a child custody fight .
They detailed all different kinds of vulnerabilities .
Later on in the interview , Edmonds also claims that Grossman similarly " took care " of others , outside of the government , even , she says , contacts at the New York Times .
" Grossman would brag , ' We just fax to our people at the New York Times .
They print it under their names . ' "
She later elaborated on that point to The BRAD BLOG , explaining that this " also happened with the Washington Post , but the New York Times was their primary one for this . "
" Every time they wanted something on Azerbaijan , Turkey , and Turkmenistan , for example , they just faxed it over [ to the Times ] , and it was run under their own guys ' name , even though it was written by the State Department , " she told us .
" This was an ongoing operation , at least during a four year period of time " from 1997 to 2001 . "
There is much more on Grossman in the full AmCon interview , as well as in Edmonds ' recent under - oath deposition given in early August , in the Schmidt v. Krikorian case now pending before the Ohio Election Commission .
Her sworn deposition , both transcript and video , was published in full by The BRAD BLOG here .
Previously , Edmonds had been twice - gagged by the Bush Justice Department 's use of the draconian , so - called " State Secrets Privilege " , after she was fired by the FBI when she alerted superiors about a co-worker in her department who had been a member of one of the Turkish organizations being targeted by the FBI 's counterintelligence probe in the Turkish division .
Following the dismissal , Senators Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) and Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , then senior members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee , wrote letters on her behalf to the DoJ , seeking an investigation into her allegations .
The DoJ's Inspector General would ultimate release a de-classified version of his report finding a number of Edmonds ' allegations to be " credible , " " serious , " and " warrant[ing ] a thorough and careful review by the FBI . "
In 2002 , during a CBS 60 Minutes report on the Edmonds case , Grassley was asked about Edmonds ' credibility , and responds by saying : " Absolutely , she 's credible ...
And the reason I feel she 's very credible is because people within the FBI have corroborated a lot of her story . "
While we do n't know if Cole was one of those " within the FBI " who " corroborated a lot of " Edmonds story at the time to Grassley and Leahy , but he has certainly done so today .
Unfortunately , neither 60 Minutes , nor any other major corporate U.S. media outlet , has bothered to cover Edmonds ' allegations now that she is much more free to speak , since the Obama Administration chose not to invoke the " State Secrets Privilege " prior to her 8/8/09 deposition which allowed her to begin sharing the full breadth of her extraordinary allegations publicly for the first time .
UPDATE 10/5/09 : Cole has now greatly expanded on his confirmation of Edmonds ' credibility , offered new insider detail on the panic inside the Bureau when her allegations first came to light in 2002 , and has called for a ' Special Counsel ' to investigate , prosecute .

A Stanford Law School graduate was sentenced Monday on a federal tax conviction related to running a high - priced call girl service , punishment that includes restrictions on her ability to keep advertising as an escort while she ’s on probation .
During a hearing in San Jose federal court , U.S. District Judge James
Ware concluded he needed to impose those restrictions on Cristina Warthen after federal prosecutors disclosed she ’s continued to advertise herself on the Internet as a high - priced escort , even as she awaited sentencing on federal tax evasion charges related to her days as an upscale prostitute named “ Brazil . ”
Warthen gained notoriety when she was busted as a jet - setting call girl who sold her services to pay off her Stanford Law School debts .
She got her law degree from Stanford in May 2001 , but quickly began to run a steamy Web site with offers to jet off for liaisons with clients in cities around the country , including New York , Chicago and Washington , D.C .
She eventually pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes on more than $ 133,000 she earned as a prostitute in 2003 .
Under a plea deal with the government , Warthen was sentenced Monday to one year of home detention with an electronic monitoring device and three years of probation .
She also has to pay the government a total of about $ 243,000 , less than the original $ 313,000 set out in her original plea arrangement .
Federal prosecutors agreed to the lower amount when Warthen demonstrated she could not pay it after her recent divorce from David Warthen , the co-founder of the online search engine Ask Jeeves , now known as Ask.com .
Court papers show the once - wealthy
Web entrepreneur ’s finances were decimated by last year ’s stock market collapse , and he could not provide more money to his now - ex - wife , who says she ’s unemployed .
But Ware was dismayed to learn from federal prosecutors and probation officials that Warthen has continued to advertise her escort services as she has awaited sentencing .
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Callaway told the judge Warthen has posted ads on the Internet offering “ companionship ” for $ 2,000 a night .
“ We all know that ’s a wink and nod and what she really is advertising is high end prostitution , ” Callaway said in court .
Warthen , who has been temporarily living in Seattle with her mother , has placed an escort ad on the Web .
The image of her face is blurred in photographs on the Web ad , which boasts of a graduate degree from an “ Ivy League university . ”
Brian Getz , Warthen ’s attorney , objected to the government ’s request , saying she is a “ law abiding citizen ” who has a free speech right to advertise escort services as long as she ’s not breaking prostitution laws .
But Ware , noting that her sentence is already “ lenient , ” was unmoved .
When Ware tried to get Warthen to explain the escort ads , Getz advised her not to discuss the matter .
“ It pains me … to be advised that you are asking the court for permission to engage in advertising an escort business , ” Ware told Warthen .
In court papers , Warthen , now 34 , previously admitted dealing in cash to hide her income as an escort , which she advertised on a Web site called “ TouchofBrazil.net . ”
As the government was investigating the service , Warthen , previously Cristina Schultz , married David Warthen .
He filed for divorce earlier this year , citing “ irreconcilable differences . ”

Then There Was Mayhem
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 4th of November 2009 - 09:55 PM ]
Well curiosity is sated a bit more with THQ 's latest trailer for the game .
Nicknamed the Mayhem trailer .
Which , as the name implies , shows a lot of the mayhem and madness that is going on in the game world for Darksiders .
People running for their lives .
Angels coming to Earth .
Deals being made to help destroy everything .
Total mayhem .
I 'm actually left wanting more mayhem here .
That and the date of Darksiders to get here sooner .
January 8th , as the trailer says , seems like eons from now .
But from the looks of it , the game should be totally worth the wait and all the game convention teasing .
Indiana , for example , reported saving or creating 13,232 education jobs with its stimulus money , but Cris Johnston , the director of the government efficiency division of the state budget office , said that it was difficult to say whether the state would have actually lost those jobs without the money .
“ We ca n’t make the statement that they were created or retained , ” Mr. Johnston said .
Indiana , he said had followed federal guidelines in reporting how many full - time jobs were paid for with the stimulus money , which also paid for education supplies and other expenses .
And while New York City officials have said the stimulus helped them save thousands of teaching jobs , it would have been politically difficult for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to actually lay off that many teachers while running for re-election .
Hard hats could surpass teachers next year , as more construction projects get under way .
In Florida , for instance , one of the biggest infrastructure projects is its plan to build the Indian Street Bridge in Martin County .
But with a big , complex project like that , it takes a while before construction can start .
That project , which will cost more than $ 72 million , claims to have saved or created just one job so far .
An analysis by The New York Times of the grants and contracts in the stimulus showed that as of the end of September , only 7 percent of the work had been completed and 9 percent was more than half done , while 46 percent was less than half done and 38 percent had not begun .
The jobs announced Friday were created by about $ 159 billion in grants , loans and contracts made available to the states .
About $ 37 billion of that amount has been paid out so far .
There were not many people packed in to the Los Angeles " town hall " meeting who had heard of the foreign woman with the unfamiliar title who had come to listen to their tales of plight .
But many took it as a good sign that she had worried the last American government enough for it to keep her out of the country .
Deanne Weakly was among the first to the microphone .
The 51 - year - old estate agent told how a couple of years ago she was pulling in $ 80,000 ( £ 48,000 ) a year from commissions selling homes in LA 's booming property market .
When the bottom fell out of the business with the foreclosure crisis , she lost her own house and ended up living on the streets in a city with more homeless than any other in America .
She was sexually assaulted , harassed by the police and in despair .
She turned to the city and California state governments for help .
" No one wanted to listen .
They blame you for being homeless in the first place , " she said .
Others followed , recounting in English or Spanish , sometimes Korean , their personal crises .
Some shouted their anger , others laboriously recounted details of losing homes , families forced into overcrowded shelters , life on the streets .
The United Nations special rapporteur , Raquel Rolnik , listened to it all patiently , occasionally taking notes , nodding encouragement .
Rolnik had waited more than a year to tour cities across the US to prepare a report for the UN 's human rights council on America 's deepening housing crisis following the subprime mortgage debacle .
UN special rapporteurs are more often found investigating human rights in Sudan and Burundi or abuses of the Israeli occupation than exposing the underbelly of the American dream .
George Bush 's administration blocked her visit , finding itself in the company of Cuba , Burma and North Korea in blocking a special rapporteur .
" I was asking for almost a year before I as allowed in , " Rolnik said .
When Barack Obama came to power she was welcomed to range across America talking to those who have lived on the streets for years and the newly homeless forced out by the foreclosure crisis .
Rolnik , a Brazilian urban planner and architect , said administration officials were genuinely interested in what she might find , if not embracing of her raison d'etre that everyone is entitled to a decent home .
" One of the first meetings I had at the state department they clearly told me : here , adequate housing is not a human right , " she said .
" I was shocked when I realised that the US , and countries in Europe – England – as well , had a solid housing policy for many years that worked pretty well .
That was dismantled and the situation became worse throughout the nineties .
Then we had this financial crisis and a real crisis in housing .
It 's all tied together , " she said .
" But I did n't expect to see what I have seen .
In some ways the situation is worse than I expected . "
Rolnik travelled from New York and Chicago to New Orleans and South Dakota 's Native American reservations , talking to the homeless , the desperate , the foreclosed , and the officials who run housing policy .
Her final stop was Los Angeles , the homeless capital of the nation .
Up to 100,000 people are sleeping on the streets or in shelters on any given night .
Some have been living like that for years .
Others found themselves suddenly destitute as the bank seized their home or they lost a job and could n't pay the rent .
Two years ago about 1,300 people were evicted from properties in central LA .
Last year it was 15,500 .
Across the wider Los Angeles region 62,400 people were thrown out of their homes .
" There is a predictable path for those who lose their jobs and can't pay the rent or the mortgage , " Gary Blasi , a University of California law professor , told Rolnik .
" First they live with friends and relatives , but they 're poor , too .
Then they live in their cars until the cars get towed or break down .
Some live in tents .
Almost all the camping grounds within 100 miles of Los Angeles are now filled with people living in them . "
A single person on welfare living in Los Angeles receives $ 221 a month – an amount that has n't changed in a decade .
The rent for one room is typically nearly double that .
Too often the newly destitute end up on the streets .
" I had a job as a cashier in K - Mart and shared a house with other women , " Deborah Burton told Rolnik .
" But then I lost my job and when you lose your job you lose your home .
You can't pay the rent . "
Burton , 57 , found herself sleeping on the streets .
She explained how the tents go up on Skid Row in central LA after dark but must be down before dawn .
" If you are n't up and moving by 6 am , the police arrest you for sleeping or sitting on the sidewalk .
It goes on your record and makes it very difficult to get [ public ] housing , " she said .
" Not many think of us as people .
Do n't criminalise us because we find ourselves in a certain situation .
No one wants to be homeless . "
Doris Tinson certainly does n't but she is on the brink of losing the house she bought in 1964 for $ 29,000 .
She paid off the mortgage several times as she borrowed against the house to supplement her pay as a nurse and send her children , and then grandchildren , to college .
Then a few years ago , a man came knocking offering her a cheap mortgage , a fraction of the value of the house by then put at $ 750,000 .
Tinson took out the $ 87,000 loan but along the way the monthly payments quadrupled to $ 2,324 , nearly her entire income and they are set to rise again .
" The mortgage went up because the interest rate went up .
I still do n't know how that happened , " she told Rolnik .
On Los Angeles ' own Wall Street , in the poorer , mostly black and Hispanic , south of the city , the " for sale " signs hang outside the boarded and secured foreclosed homes with warning notices against trespass .
On average homes have lost two - thirds of their value in south central LA .
At the end of 2008 about 2 % of Los Angeles homes had been foreclosed on .
Housing activists told Rolnik that was mostly because of sharply increasing unemployment and predatory lending that exploited the vulnerable .
Rolnik takes it all in .
Later she describes herself as disturbed that a country so rich is in many ways so deficient and indifferent in dealing with its poor and vulnerable .
She says that the more recent conservative philosophy of dismantling the old policy of providing affordable housing to those with smaller incomes in favour of the illusion that everyone can , and should , buy their own home played a central role in not only creating the housing crisis but the financial one .
" Part of the financial crisis has to do with these housing policy options because one of the main ideas of this policy is to promote home ownership to those who never got access to property .
People who never had credit finally had banks provide them credit and they can buy a home .
But it did n't work for the poor .
" So now we have a new face of homelessness – people who had homes , were not living in public housing , were not living in assisted housing , but now are in a position of asking for assistance because they 're homeless .
But the public housing has been destroyed , " she said .
Rolnik held a town hall meeting in every city she had visited .
Always they were packed .
At the Los Angeles meeting , the queues quickly form at the three microphones .
Toni Matthews has been homeless for nearly nine years .
" I wrote to Washington but nobody ever answered , " she said .
A Spanish - speaking veteran of the Korean war steps up .
He is the angriest of the lot .
He is not a communist , he says , but in Cuba nobody goes homeless .
He fought for America and now he is left to live on the streets .
Others tell of being evicted by unscrupulous landlords , of living in dangerous and filthy buildings and how the city council does n't force landlords to obey the law .
The frustration is mixed with a sense of powerlessness .
" Anyone can end up in this situation , living on the streets .
Do n't imagine it can't happen to any of you , " shouted a man .
Away from the microphone , Deanne Weakly says she had never heard of a UN special rapporteur but she 's glad Rolnik turned up .
" I am grateful for the spotlight on the homeless .
The spotlight of attention on what people do n't think exists here .
These people have no voice .
They 're afraid .
Not everyone has a big mouth like me , " she said .
Deborah Burton thinks it is a shameful reflection on America that Rolnik should be in the US .
" America is one of the richest countries in the world .
For me as a citizen and a person of colour I think it 's important to let the rest of the world know what 's going on here , " she said .
" American politicians come and listen but they do n't do anything .
The question we have to answer is why this has been going on so long . "
Rolnik does n't pretend she can change the situation .
All she can do , she tells the crowd at the meeting , is to draw their problems to the attention of their government and warn others of the dangers .
" The US has exported an economic model with the idea that everyone can organise themselves under that model .
It 's very important for the rest of the world to know who fits in to this model and who is excluded , " she tells her audience .
WASHINGTON , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) - Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Monday he was introducing legislation calling for a temporary freeze on credit card interest rates on existing balances .
The push for a freeze comes as Democratic lawmakers say some credit card issuers have jacked up fees to try to maximize their revenues before new rules kick in .
Dodd said his bill would immediately freeze rates on existing balances until the remaining provisions of new credit card industry regulations come into effect , which would be in February 2010 at the latest and possibly earlier .
“ We worked long and hard to enact the safeguards included in ” the new rules , Dodd said in a statement .
“ And no sooner had it been signed into law , but credit card companies were looking for ways to get around the protections this Congress and the American people demanded . ”
Dodd ’s bill arrived just days before an expected vote by the House of Representatives , possibly on Thursday , on a bill to advance by almost three months to Dec. 1 the effective date for strict new rules on credit card fees and interest rates .
The bill to accelerate the rules ' implementation was approved on Thursday by the House Financial Services Committee in a swipe at major card issuers such as Bank of America BAC.N , Citigroup C.N and American Express AXP.N .
The new rules were approved by Congress and signed into law in May by President Barack Obama .
The employers you see on the Globe 100's Top Places to Work ranking take care of their people .
They make sure employees are compensated , presented with opportunities to build strong careers , and enjoy a rewarding work life .
That 's why we asked the workers themselves to complete a 12 - question survey on workplace practices .
To compile the ranking , each employer was measure according to six factors : direction , execution , managers , career , conditions , and pay and benefits .
Read on to see the top 10 , and then check out the special section .
The crisis of American governance goes much deeper than political divisions and ideology .
The U.S. is in a crisis of policy implementation .
Not only are Americans deeply divided on what to do about health care , budget deficits , financial markets , climate change and more , but government is also failing to execute settled policies effectively .
Management systems linking government , business and civil society need urgent repair .
The recent systems failures are legion and notorious .
The 9/11 attacks might well have been prevented if the FBI and the intelligence agencies had cooperated more effectively in early 2001 when they were receiving various signals of a possible terrorist attack .
Hurricane Katrina caused mass devastation and loss of life because recommendations to bolster the levees shielding New Orleans and other protective measures were neglected for decades despite urgent expert warnings , and because the federal emergency relief effort failed completely after the storm .
To this day , reconstruction efforts in New Orleans are paralyzed and many poor communities there have been abandoned .
The U.S. occupation of Iraq was marked by massive and shocking corruption , incompetence , and implementation failures by U.S. agencies .
On the economic front , the current financial crisis is a remarkable systems failure .
Government regulatory agencies completely dropped the ball while overseeing the surge of several dangerous financial instruments , especially sub - prime mortgages , collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , and credit default swaps ( CDSs ) .
The supply of CDSs in particular soared from nearly zero in 2000 to an estimated $ 60 trillion in 2008 with almost no regulatory attention .
These unregulated CDSs underpinned the reckless lending that eventually burst in the Great Crash of 2008 .
The list , alas , goes on and on .
Military procurement systems are , according to retired military leaders , so broken that they now jeopardize national security : the U.S. is buying armaments that are overpriced , unneeded and technically defective armaments .
Our system for financing the costly federal health care system subsidizes the overuse of advanced technologies while underfinancing highly effective and lower - cost public health measures .
Public construction systems are failing to keep up with urgent national needs .
Roads , bridges , rail , water and sewerage systems and many dams are in dangerous disrepair around the country ; large sections of New Orleans remain wrecked and highly vulnerable ; and even ground zero of 9/11 remains a hole in the ground because of endless bickering .
Similarly , despite nearly a decade of planning , the government has failed to build and test even a single coal - fired power plant that captures and sequesters its carbon dioxide . *
This so - called Future - Gen project , vital for the transition to a low - carbon economy , has still not been launched .
We need a better scientific understanding of these pervasive systems failures .
It is wrong to think that they illustrate the inevitable failure of government .
Other governments around the world more successfully manage infrastructure investments , health systems and environmental resources , apparently with greater flexibility , less corruption , lower costs and better outcomes .
America should be learning from their experiences .
Several factors are at play .
A key one has been the flawed privatization of public - sector regulatory functions .
Wall Street firms hold excessive sway over government regulators , so that dangerous behavior has been unconstrained .
Private insurance companies and health care providers block measures to curtail the overuse of costly technologies .
Private military suppliers drive the procurement of unneeded weapons systems .
A second has been the collapse of planning functions within the federal government .
A remarkable feature of the recent debates over climate change , energy systems , infrastructure rehabilitation and health care reform is the lack of detailed forward - looking government proposals and plans .
The Obama administration has stated general principles ( very admirable ones ) but too often without clear targets and the operational strategies to achieve them .
Planning has been replaced by lobbying and backroom deals in Congress that are nearly opaque to the public .
A third , and paradoxical , factor is the chronic underfunding of government itself .
It sounds like the old joke about the bad restaurant : that the food was lousy and there was n’t enough of it .
The public is wary of putting more funds into government having witnessed one public sector failure after another .
Yet without investing more resources in skilled public managers in health care , energy systems , and national security , we are probably doomed to remain stuck in the hands of vested interests and lobbies .
Fourth , today ’s challenges cut across technical specialties , government departments and public and private sectors .
In health care and energy , for example , the private sector holds the key technologies but the public sector is needed to finance research and development , to regulate sustainable practices ( for example , for emissions reduction and primary health standards ) , and to ensure access for the poor .
Public health must be addressed not only through curative medical care but also through nutrition , food systems and a safer built environment .
Energy systems must respect ecological as well as economic constraints .
Yet our government agencies are not designed to take a holistic approach .
In short , we have arrived at a point where the challenges of sustainable development — including public health , infrastructure , energy and national security — require changes not only to policy but also to basic public management systems .
In many crucial areas , tinkering will no longer suffice : we need an overhaul to regain government control over regulatory processes , reduce lobbying , restore public planning and ensure the adequate financing of skilled public managers , and align public management systems with holistic strategies .
* Clarification ( 11/24/09 ) : Jeffrey D. Sachs complains that the U.S. government has failed to build a single coal - fired plant that captures and sequesters its carbon dioxide .
One such facility does exist at the Shady Point coal power plant in Oklahoma , but it is not a government project .
The desire to sport a different handbag for every occasion is shielding the largest makers of luxury leather goods from the economic crisis as women prove to be more consistent spenders than men .
Louis Vuitton and Hermes bags are still amongst the most sought - after luxury products compared with weak demand for watches , a traditionally male - dominated sector .
Gender marketing expert Diana Jaffe said the uncertainty about jobs caused by the economic slump posed a threat to male identity , prompting men to cut back on spending .
Meanwhile , women are taking steps to cheer themselves up with a treat .
" Women are also worried about their jobs , but not to the extent that they feel their mere existence is being threatened and so they are in the mood to buy despite the crisis , " Jaffe said .
Some men have stopped themselves from splurging on flashy goods that could be deemed as tasteless during times of austerity , while others do n't have the capacity to think about spending on luxury items , Jaffe said .
" Many male managers are suffering from a huge loss of status , many feel under an enormous amount of pressure or are suffering from burnout .
They just do n't have the resources to think about buying luxury goods and prefer to go to a life coach , " she said .
Banks , insurers and asset managers have slashed nearly 400,000 jobs worldwide since the credit crisis started to intensify in August 2007 , hitting retailers who cater to the luxury - loving professional classes .
Swiss watch exports slumped 26 percent in the first half of the year and the industry is grappling with the sharpest drop in demand in some 20 years , while French luxury goods group Hermes posted a 28 percent rise in first - half sales in its leather goods and saddlery unit .
Women are also more used to dealing with change at various points throughout their careers , making it easier for them to cope with this financial crisis , said Eva Kreienkamp , director of marketing agency FrischCo .
" Men are more affected psychologically by the crisis than women .
A bag can be bought on impulse , whereas a jewellery or watch purchase is not , " said Armando Branchini , secretary general of Italian luxury goods association Altagamma .
OWN SHOPS
But handbag envy is not the only aspect boosting groups such as LVMH and Hermes .
These players are benefiting from their own extensive retail networks , which make it easier for them to control how much stock is hitting the shelves .
Watchmakers , on the other hand , are more dependent on third - party retailers , which are currently looking to run down stock levels and have put a brake on new orders .
" The difference in the end demand between watches and leather goods is possibly not as big as some figures suggest , but there is still a substantial difference , " said ZKB analyst Patrik Schwendimann .
Handbags and other leather items are also more accessible than top - end watches as they do not cost as much , said Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox .
" When it comes to luxury watches , these can be big ticket items - at least US $ 10,000 and for more prestige models US $ 50,000 plus .
I think the soft luxury category is holding up because it is still more of an affordable treat , " Cox said .
Shoppers of both sexes who are still buying favour big brands , which are seen as a better investment than less well - known names .
Within the watch industry , analysts at Credit Suisse said Swatch Group 's Omega and Richemont 's IWC and Cartier were mentioned by retailers as brands that had held up better in recent months .
Stephan Schuck , manager of the Zett Meyer watch and jewelry shop on Zurich 's exclusive shopping precinct Bahnhofstrasse , said his female customers just do not appear to be as affected by the crisis as men .
" Many of the women buying in our store are independent or employed and earning their own wage which they manage themselves .
These women are paying less attention to the crisis when shopping than men , " he said .

As the sun rises over San Franciso we ’re gearing up for another exciting day at Unite 2009 .
Yesterday was a new experiment for us in having a day of classes added on to the conference and from what I saw it was a huge success .
In one room we had a “ Unity for Unity Developers ” track with three 2 - hour classes taught by our in - house experts ( Nicholas , Aras , Joachim and Lucas ) and so far the feedback forms show that folks learned a lot .
At the same time in another room we had a “ Unity for Flash Developers ” track that featured four speakers ( myself included ) delivering one - hour sessions introducing Flash developers to Unity .
The speakers were me , John Grden ( engineer on Papervision3D ) , Paul Tondeur ( author of a book about Papervision3D ) and Mauricio Longoni ( noted Unity community member already ) .
All the sessions were great and the word around the conference was all positive .
Today we ’re back to our “ normal ” agenda , three days of technical sessions .
The view above is what I was lucky enough to take in while sipping my coffee outside the event center this morning at 7:30 am or so .
I ’m strangely sleeping too little yet extremely amped up with energy .
The vibe and excitement from everyone in attendance is great and it ’s only going to get better .
In 45 minutes the keynote starts and then day # 2 begins …
Here we go !
NEW YORK —
This month , the mayor of Mesa , Arizona , a city of about 500,000 inhabitants in the American Southwest , became the 1,000th local leader to sign on to a climate change agreement under the United States Conference of Mayors .
In signing the compact — initiated in 2005 by Greg Nickels , the mayor of Seattle and the president of the conference — local leaders commit to reducing their cities ’ carbon emissions in concert with the national goals laid out by the Kyoto Protocol : a 7 percent reduction over 1990 emissions levels by 2012 .
As with the country - level signatories to the Kyoto agreement , many cities will fail to meet this goal .
But with prospects dimming that world leaders will agree to a substantive successor treaty to the expiring Kyoto accord at the global climate summit meeting in Copenhagen in December , local endeavors like Mr. Nickels ’s mayoral agreement would seem to take on a whole new measure of import .
“ Locally elected officials can create ripples — and maybe even waves — in the fight against global warming , ” Mr. Nickels wrote in the introduction to a report , published this month , highlighting the efforts of 16 mayors in various American cities .
“ What we do in our cities , ” he continued , “ whether it ’s constructing green buildings , establishing electric car charging stations , planting urban forests or creating legions of good - paying green jobs , can serve as a model for state governments ” and for Washington .
Garlic vs. high blood pressure
( NaturalNews ) Garlic is one of the most amazing medicinal herbs on the planet .
It has been among my top - recommended healing foods and medicines for years .
Most people know garlic as being anti-cancer .
Others recognize its ability to naturally lower high cholesterol .
But did you know that garlic also helps normalizeHere , we present a collection of powerful quotes about garlic and high blood pressure , documented in some of the best health books ever written .
Enjoy this collection of knowledge !
Onions have similar characteristics and are often used in combination with garlic .
To preserve the beneficial effects of garlic it should not be boiled .
The fresh juice is the most effective preparation .
For nervous spasms , cramps and seizures , crush one clove of garlic in a glass of hot milk .
For high blood pressure , take one clove of garlic each morning .
Prepare oil of garlic by placing eight ounces of peeled minced garlic in a wide - mouthed jar with enough olive oil to cover .
Close tightly and shake a few times each day ; allow to stand in a warm place for three days .
Garlic has achieved a legendary reputation as an antihypertensive medication .
It 's been used in China for centuries for that purpose , and the Japanese government officially recognizes garlic as a blood - pressure depressor .
American scientists first tried garlic against high blood pressure in 1921 .
Garlic consistently lowers blood pressure in laboratory animals .
Eat more garlic .
It is another legendary folk remedy for high blood pressure , and it is effective , according to recent studies .
Long used in China and widely used today in Germany as a blood pressure medication , garlic can have a striking impact .
In a recent double blind German test of Kwai , an over - the - counter garlic preparation , doses comparable to a couple of daily garlic cloves pushed diastolic blood pressure down in patients with mild high blood pressure .
I heard a lot about garlic being a good remedy for colds , but I was hesitant to try it because I also heard it lowers high blood pressure .
Since my blood pressure is normal , I thought the garlic might cause it to drop .
Fortunately , I read where a medical doctor said that garlic normalizes high or low blood pressure , but does not disturb normal blood pressure .
With this assurance , I tried Kyolic garlic tablets the next time I felt I was starting to come down with a cold .
Within a few days , I felt fine .
The confidence the Egyptians had in garlic is demonstrated by the fact that they reportedly used it to strengthen the workers who built the pyramids .
Pliny recommended garlic for 61 maladies in his Historia Naturalis ; Hippocrates recommended it as a laxative , diuretic , and cure for tumors of the uterus .
Garlic has been used to treat high blood pressure for centuries in China and Japan .
In first - century India , garlic and onion were thought to prevent heart disease and rheumatism .
Garlic even had a reputation as an aphrodisiac in Shakespearean England .
A number of scientific studies suggest another reason that garlic is your heart 's friend :
Its ability to bring down high blood pressure .
Exactly how much can garlic reduce your blood pressure ?
It 's not as fast - acting as high blood pressure medication , says Dr. Mowrey .
But over time , he says , garlic can be almost as effective as lifestyle changes like weight loss , regular exercise and cutting back on salt intake .
According to David Hoffmann , B.Sc , M.N.I.M.H. , of Sebastopol , California , eating a clove of raw garlic daily will help considerably in preventing or reversing the effects of high blood pressure .
While garlic has been used for centuries in traditional cultures throughout the world as a multipurpose medicinal food , in recent decades more than 2,000 clinical studies have validated many of the folk - healing claims for " the stinking rose , " as garlic was once called .
Three to ten cloves of garlic a day are needed to induce the beneficial effects for the cardiovascular system .
However , the garlic cloves must be crushed , chopped , bruised , or chewed to release the full effect .
You might want to try some of the popular garlic - rich Italian and Asian dishes .
If you 're worried about the famous odoriferous side effect of consuming garlic , do as the Europeans do and take your garlic in concentrated odor - free capsules .
Studies show that garlic has antibiotic properties as well as the ability to fight fungal infections , and at least twenty - eight studies have found garlic effective for lowering cholesterol levels .
In one German experiment , volunteers taking an 800 - mg garlic tablet saw their cholesterol levels drop an average of 12 percent over four months .
Compounds in garlic dilate the blood vessels and may help high blood pressure , congenital heart disease , and lung conditions .
Can garlic also prevent cancer ?
Some scientists are finding out .
Another group of researchers proposed that garlic 's antiplatelet activity and other cardiovascular effects may be due to activation of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) and subsequent production of nitric oxide .
The correlation between low levels of nitric oxide and high blood pressure has been known since 1991 , and this research correlated the effect of garlic extract on NOS and platelet aggregation .
Raw , dried , aged , and macerated garlic as well as garlic oil have all demonstrated antiplatelet effects .
Ajoene may be one of the most potent antiplatelet compounds in garlic .
In the eighteenth century , Esteyneffer recommended both garlic and onion for a wide variety of illnesses , uses that continue today .
The Mountain Pima insert a clove of garlic into the anus to treat fever .
The Mayo use garlic in capsules for arthritis and cancer and to reduce fat .
Mexican Americans insert the clove to treat susto , fright disease .
Both respect garlic for its magical properties .
Garlic is used for high blood pressure and against fright ; onion has been used for fever .
As an antithrombotic agent , ajoene is at least as potent as aspirin and its activity is enhanced by other breakdown products of the garlic .
Allicin is found to lower serum cholesterol by blocking its biosynthesis .
Fresh garlic , garlic juice , aged garlic extracts or the volatile oil - all lowered cholesterol and plasma lipids , lipid metabolism , and atherogensis both in vitro and in vivo .
Methyl - allyl trisulfide of the garlic helps expand constricted blood vessels , thereby preventing high blood pressure .
The typical study compares diets high in fat with and without Garlic .
Garlic diets consistently produce the lowest cholesterol levels .
In the 1940s , one investigator found that 40 of 100 patients with high blood pressure experienced a reduction of 20 mmHg or more after about a week of garlic treatment .
In another study , a water extract of garlic was given to hypercholesterolemic patients for two months during which time the patients experienced a 28.5 % reduction in cholesterol - the dose was equivalent to about 10 grams of garlic per day .
One study looked at 41,000 American women and found that one or more servings a week of garlic was associated with a 35 percent decrease in the risk of colon cancer .
It is thought that garlic 's sulfur compounds are key in preventing these types of cancers by helping to control carcinogens ( cancer - causing substances ) .
High blood pressure is recognized as one of the leading causes of heart disease , and garlic has been shown to have mild blood - pressure - lowering effects .
Clinically , I would not rely on garlic alone to lower blood pressure .

Why not leave us a comment .
A consensus seems to have formed here at The Atlantic that the Ft. Hood massacre means not very much at all .
Megan McArdle writes that " there is absolutely no political lesson to be learned from this . "
James Fallows says : " The shootings never mean anything .
Forty years later , what did the Charles Whitman massacre ' mean ' ?
A decade later , do we ' know ' anything about Columbine ? "
And the Atlantic Wire has already investigated the motivation for the shooting , and released its preliminary findings .
Of Nidal Malik Hasan , the Wire states : " A 39 - year - old Army psychiatrist , he appears to have not been motivated by his Muslim religion , his Palestinian heritage ( he is American by nationality ) , or any related political causes . "
It seems , though , that when an American military officer who is a practicing Muslim allegedly shoots forty of his fellow soldiers who are about to deploy to the two wars the United States is currently fighting in Muslim countries , some broader meaning might , over time , be discerned , especially if the officer did , in fact , yell " Allahu Akbar " while murdering his fellow soldiers , as some soldiers say he did .
This is the second time this year American soldiers on American soil have been gunned down by a Muslim who was reportedly unhappy with America 's wars in the Middle East ( the first took place in Arkansas , to modest levels of notice ) .
And , of course , this would not be the first instance of an American Muslim soldier killing fellow soldiers over his disagreements with American foreign policy ; in 2003 , Army Sgt.
Hasan Akbar killed two officers and wounded fourteen others when he rolled a grenade into a tent in a homicidal protest against American policy .
I am not arguing , of course , that American Muslims , as a whole , are violently unhappy with America ( I 've argued the opposite , in fact ) .
But I do think that elite makers of opinion in this country try very hard to ignore the larger meaning of violent acts when they happen to be perpetrated by Muslims .
Here 's a simple test :
If Nidal Malik Hasan had been a devout Christian with pronounced anti-abortion views , and had he attacked , say , a Planned Parenthood office , would his religion have been considered relevant as we tried to understand the motivation and meaning of the attack ?
Of course .
Elite opinion makers do not , as a rule , try to protect Christians and Christian belief from investigation and criticism .
Quite the opposite .
It would be useful to apply the same standards of inquiry and criticism to all religions .
Exclusive to STR
The radio was playing in the background , but when I heard the words ' Middle East peace process , ' it got my attention .
Evidently something had happened in that part of the world that might endanger the ' peace process , ' or something to that effect .
It was that two - word phrase that set me thinking : how long has this ' process ' been ongoing ?
I do n't know , exactly , but certainly a very long time indeed .
Every U.S. president in recent ' and not - so - recent - - memory has involved himself , and the U.S. , in the ' process , ' with meetings in various locations so the opposing factions could arrive at some sort of agreement , with abundant photo opportunities for smiles and handshakes .
But wait a minute !
Does this make sense ?
The animosity is between the Israelis and their Arab neighbors .
The Israelis want peace .
The Arabs want peace .
They all insist on it , and promise to work to achieve it .
So what 's stopping them ?
Where 's the peace ?
If both sides want peace , but only on their terms , it 's silly to perpetuate this ' peace process . '
Surely the Jews and the Arabs realize that they will have to make concessions if there is to be peace .
If they do n't want to do that , fine ; but let 's stop this inane prattling about a ' peace process ! '
( Could it be that , as far as governments are concerned , war , or the threat of it , is more profitable than peace ? )
Only an hour or so later I heard another snippet of information on the radio .
This time someone was warning us that old refrigerators , like those many of us have in our basements , can be expensive to operate .
In fact , according to the announcer , that old refrigerator in the basement can cost up to $ 100 yearly to operate , since many of them , especially if made prior to 1993 , are not energy efficient .
It happens that we have an old fridge from my parents in our basement , and it must be at least 25 years old .
We only use it occasionally , so I 'm sure it does n't cost us $ 100 yearly to operate , assuming that figure to be correct .
But so what if it did ?
Whose problem is that , anyway ?
Ah , but it 's society 's problem , you see !
Old , inefficient refrigerators use more electricity , which means more coal burned to supply that electricity , which , in turn , means more carbon dioxide placed in the atmosphere !
And you know what that means : more greenhouse effect , more global warming , the rising of the oceans , and the END OF MANKIND !!!!
Gosh -- and all because we want to stock a few frozen foods when our regular freezer is full !
Let 's suppose , filled with verdant fervor , we decide to scrap the inefficient old refrigerator and get a new one .
Heck , let 's suppose that everyone with inefficient old fridges decided to do the same thing .
That would be a stimulus to the refrigerator business , meaning more electricity used by the manufacturers .
The scrap companies that got the old refrigerators would use more electricity to compact them into recyclable steel , which would then be transported by rail ( diesel engines ! ) to the steel mill .
Lots of carbon dioxide generation , not to mention lots of borrowing to pay for expensive new refrigerators .
This is better than just using the inefficient old refrigerators ?
Recently my wife and I drove to Washington D.C. A couple of weeks later , we made a similar trip by automobile to rural Kentucky .
On both trips we were impressed , as we always are , by the miles upon miles of nothing .
An occasional farm , scattered small towns , but hundreds and hundreds of acres of empty land .
Where is the population explosion ?
Yet even as we are warned of the dangers of an increasing population , we are told of the efforts of science to bring fecundity to infertile couples , the work of volunteers on anti-suicide hotlines , and the efforts of organizations to bring food to the starving children of this or that wretched place .
So what should we do : work to preserve and increase the population , or decrease it ?
Are people a threat to society , or a blessing ?
There are many such examples of the perfectly reasonable and laudable activities of organization A being more or less directly opposed to the perfectly reasonable and laudable activities of organization B. Often , both organizations are government , or government - sponsored / sanctioned groups .
At a time when people have been inculcated with the idea that society 's problems are the result of human greed or stupidity , and the solutions lie with government action , such contradictory programs are inevitable .
The only consistency we expect from government is that it will consistently favor any group that promises support .
So forget the groups !
Give the matter some thought , do a little research , and then act upon your knowledge .
Make up your mind without blind adherence to what this or that group suggests .
Individuals make wrong choices , admittedly , and suffer as a result .
When large , influential groups make wrong choices , many more suffer .
When governments make wrong choices -- war , anyone ?
Depression , shortages , rationing ?
Determine the best thing to do , and do it .
How can everyone not benefit when everyone acts in his own enlightened self - interest ?
As the leading gastronomy writer and food critic in the region , Alfredo Argilés proves once again that the pen is a formidable weapon .
His carefully weighed opinions are read by thousands of discerning diners , making him a man both revered and feared by restaurant owners and chefs whose success rests on the strength of their reputation .
“ It ’s not quite as bad as all that , ” insists the affable expert .
“ I only give harsh reviews to those who really set themselves up to be measured among the very best – and fall short . ”
Others are measured not against the highest yardsticks but judged within their own segment , ensuring that the verdict is always proportionate to the establishment he critiques .
“ If the truth be known , I ’d rather not write about someone than have to say something harsh . ”
It is a true reflection of a self - confessed lover of those things that add beauty to life , for gastronomy , art and architecture all compete for a place in his heart .
“ In essence , they are all expressions of artistry and creativity , starting with a basic need such as food and shelter , and culminating in heights of culinary and architectural excellence that matches art as a form of human expression .
Naturally , art is largely free of practical function , but when we excel in fields such as gastronomy , architecture and cinema , we are in essence creating art . ”
During August , when he traditionally writes an article per day , he created a series in which the food he reviewed was compared to compositions of great contemporary artists .
“ It ’s amazing how much a meal and its ingredients can approximate famous works , ” says the food critic who also happens to be an authority on art .
Indeed , the two fight for his affections , “ and it ’s undecided which has won , ” smiles Argilés .
This unusual way of comparing fine food and fine art caught the public ’s attention , drawing their attention to the fact that cuisine is an art in itself .
It is this creative process that excites and fascinates him , though this respected food critic has his feet firmly on the ground .
Essentially a food historian who loves to trace the cultural and anthropological origins of regional cuisine , the head of the gastronomic department at El País has not got caught up in the fads of the past years .
“ Do n’t get me wrong , I love the way luxury dining has become avant - garde and experimental , but I feel too many young chefs are trying to establish themselves too early , and their efforts all too often end up looking kitsch . ”
“ Having lots of technique and wanting to show it off is not enough , just like a designer décor does not necessarily make a great restaurant .
It takes passion , innate talent and also a degree of patience and humility to become a great chef .
First you have to learn from mistakes and experimentation , earn your stripes under a master chef , and then be let loose on the public .
It is at this stage that you are more likely to make a true and lasting contribution to gastronomy . ”
According to Argilés a good restaurant is one where the focus is on the diner , not the chef .
“ Rather than this sudden boom in sommeliers , therefore , we should have more maîtres .
They can really add a dimension to the dining experience in terms of service .
Of course , when a chef has the personality to act as maître in his own restaurant that is even better , but this is a relatively rare phenomenon . ”
Asked how he rates Valencia as a culinary centre , he answers : “ Catalonia and the Basque country may have more international fame than Valencia , but in reality our best matches theirs , partly because we are particularly blessed with some of the finest produce in the country .
I would say that among its many other facets Valencia is well worth visiting for its gastronomy ” .
Alfredo Argilés recommends Casa Salvador , L’Estany de Cullera ( 40 min. from the city of Valencia ) and art at IVAM , Valencian Institute of Modern Art , Valencia .

ONE OF the first photos I saw of Barack Obama was a picture of him at his desk with a poster of Muhammad Ali staring down upon him .
That was cool to me .
Here is a basketball - playing Chicago politician , and he chooses Ali over that icon of apolitical apathy , Michael Jordan .
But if Tuesday 's election results reveal nothing else , it 's that the time for swooning over photo ops has long passed .
This is not rocket science .
Throughout the country , Republican turnout stayed the same as in 2008 while Democratic turnout cratered .
That 's what happens when you do n't deliver the goods .
For all the people who voted Democrat because they wanted to bring home the troops , stand for civil rights for all people , and see real job creation and union protections , the last year has been thin gruel indeed .
It 's not about accomplishing my personal laundry list of wishes .
It 's about forward progress -- or even effort -- from the Oval Office .
The White House did n't say one word about opposing the Maine referendum to overturn LBGT marriage equality .
Attorney General Eric
Holder even said last week that he did n't " know enough about it " to comment , which was both a lie and a slap in the face .
Obama has said he is for LGBT equality , but he was silent on Maine 's Question 1
Obama has n't fought a lick for the pro-labor Employee Free Choice Act or the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , known as ENDA .
And please do n't mention on Afghanistan , Iraq or the Wall Street bailouts .
Please do n't mention an economic policy geared toward socializing debt and privatizing profit .
There is no effort coming from the White House that moves anyone in the direction that people rallied , campaigned and voted for in 2008 -- and that is an indictment of this administration .
It also reveals something very bankrupt about the nature of our political system and the Democratic Party .
The people spoke , and it mattered little .
Now we need to do more .
Yes , the 21st century incarnation of the Republican Party achieves the double distinction of being both cartoonish and frightening in the extreme .
But patiently waiting for the Democrats to figure out how to both appease their big - money backers and the popular desire for change is a recipe for failure .
Look at Virginia on Tuesday , where less than 10 percent of voters were under 30 , and African American turnout was a non-factor .
As Dr. Martin Luther King said , you have to give the people victories .
But all we 're getting is spin .
We need action , not words .
We need to become more than the scenery for eloquent wordplay .
We need to fight for our goals , and this administration can choose to get on board or get out of the way .
As Bill Maher said of Obama , " Muhammad Ali also had a way with words , but it helped enormously that he could also punch guys in the face . "

China on Wednesday banned the use of physical punishment to treat Internet addiction after reports of beatings and at least one death in recent months at clinics for the condition around the country .
Clinics are also banned from locking up subjects or otherwise limiting their physical freedom , the country 's health ministry said in regulations posted on its Web site .
Multiple subjects in China , including the 15 - year - old boy who was later beaten and died , have reportedly been sent for solitary confinement at Internet addiction clinics in recent months .
Internet obsession has been seen in China as a reason that students begin scoring bad grades or become distant from their parents .
Boot - camp style clinics sometimes charging sky - high prices to cure the condition have sprouted up around the country in recent years .
But the health ministry regulations said Internet addiction is not yet well - defined and that it should not be used as a label for harm caused by excessive Internet use .
The ministry also recently banned the use of shock treatment for Internet addiction after accounts appeared online of the practice at a hospital in eastern Shangdong province .
Staff at the notorious hospital tied down subjects and forced them to admit faults while receiving shocks for up to 30 minutes at a time , according to posts in online forums by people claiming to have received the treatment .
The new regulations from the ministry urged minors to limit their time online and avoid surfing the Web to kill time .
It also called for parents to cultivate relations with their children by spending time with them and to pay attention to what their children do online .
The Associated Press last week rolled out its brave new plan to " apply protective format to news . "
The AP 's news registry will " tag and track all AP content online to assure compliance with terms of use , " and it will provide a " platform for protect , point , and pay . "
That 's a lot of " p " - prefaced jargon , but it boils down to a sort of DRM for news — " enforcement , " in AP - speak .
But how could that possibly work ?
It was good enough for music ...
Turns out that it wo n't , not really , not if the goal is to exercise control over AP content by those not voluntarily disposed to play by the AP 's rules .
First , let 's try to make sense of what 's being proposed .
According to the AP 's announcement , the news registry it plans to set up relies on a new " microformat , " described thusly :
The microformat will essentially encapsulate AP and member content in an informational " wrapper " that includes a digital permissions framework that lets publishers specify how their content is to be used online and which also supplies the critical information needed to track and monitor its usage .
The registry also will enable content owners and publishers to more effectively manage and control digital use of their content , by providing detailed metrics on content consumption , payment services and enforcement support .
It will support a variety of payment models , including pay walls .
To make the system clear , the AP also released this not - in - any - way confusing chart of what it intends to do .
The " wrappers " and " digital permissions frameworks " that it hopes to implement sound like tough encryption , but they are n't .
Instead , the AP is simply relying on a newly - developed microformat called hNews .
It 's a simple HTML - based tagging scheme for marking up news content and making headlines , author names , and permitted uses machine - readable and search - engine friendly .
( See an example . )
hNews is funded by major foundations , and all of its tools and specs will be released as open - source software .
In what way does this scheme " wrap " and " protect " the news ?
It does n't ; it simply marks it up , and adding tags expressing a content creator 's wishes on reuse has no bearing on someone 's rights under US copyright law .
What it does do is provide organizations that use hNews a way to release more rights than are granted under copyright — in essence , a sort of " Creative Commons " news license .
In fact , hNews ' " rights field " uses ccREL , the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language .
The AP 's news registry will use hNews to embed some kind of Web beacon in news content as well , making it possible to track some uses of the story across the Web .
Users who simply copy and paste parts of the story , or those who retype bits of it to use as quotes , or those of simply strip out the tags will of course not end up being tracked .
You 'll be forgiven if you find it difficult to square the reality of hNews with the AP 's pronouncements about it .
Ed Felten , the eminent Princeton computer security researcher , could n't figure it out , either .
" It was hard to make sense of this , so I went looking for more information , " he wrote on his blog .
" AP posted a diagram of the system , which only adds to the confusion — your satisfaction with the diagram will be inversely proportional to your knowledge of the technology ...
h News is a handy way of annotating news stories with information about the author , dateline , and so on .
But it does n't ' encapsulate ' anything in a ' wrapper , ' nor does it do much of anything to facilitate metering , monitoring , or paywalls . "
The great difficulty in talking about the AP 's year - long push to stop " misappropriation " of its content is that it has never been quite clear what behavior AP is trying to stop .
It 's not targeting Google , as it already has a deal in place with Google to provide full - text feeds of its news stories .
It does n't appear to be going after small - time bloggers or those who use quotes from AP stories in their work .
But it has pursued a " hot news " case recently ( which was just settled ) , and the AP seems to be signaling its intentions to go after sites that profit from large - scale use of AP headlines without paying for them .
How the news registry helps them do this remains unclear , since sites that do n't do what AP wants are unlikely to include its Web beacons .
Is AP going after sites that occasionally quote from its news stories ( using proper citation and links ) ?
Such a move seems bizarre on its face — and the AP routinely cites sources of its own , including Ars Technica — but it 's not out of the question .
When paidContent 's Staci D. Kramer put the question recently to AP Chairman Dean Singleton , the response was slightly creepy .
" I was a little taken aback when I asked Singleton what would happen to sites like ours : ' I 'll leave that to the rules of engagement that we 'll be developing ' in coming weeks .
Not ' we 're not after sites like yours ' or ' we 're looking at flagrant violators . '
And no sign at all that AP will be reaching out beyond its members for input . "
And yet , when we spoke to AP back in June , AP news editor Ted Bridis seemed much more sure of the answer .
OK , we said .
How will you define " wholesale theft ? "
If somebody publishes a paragraph of AP copy with a link to the AP story , will that be theft ?
" Not at all , " Bridis replied .
" I do n't think AP would have any problem with that . "
We did n't want to give the impression that we were bargaining , but we pressed on as to exactly how one would disturb AP 's comfort zone .
Was this about not posting links ?
No , Bridis replied .
" What I 'm talking about , and what has really riled up our internal copyright folks , are the bloggers who take , just paste an entire 800 word story into their blog .
They do n't even comment on it .
And it happens way more than most people realize . "
But neither hNews nor the news registry will do anything to stop bloggers copying text off a webpage , and they certainly wo n't stop people from doing marginal " rewrites " of AP 's work and passing it off as original writeups .
So this all might be about wholesale infringement , or it might be about the " hot news " contained in AP headlines and ledes , or it might be both .
But the one thing it is n't is " clear " — the journalist 's cardinal sin .
h News looks like a nice way to mark up news , to make it visible to search engines , and to provide useful metadata for those who want to do interesting things with the content .
But what it has to do with " wrappers , " " enforcement , " and " protection " is unclear .
Reading the AP announcement and the graphic that accompanied it , one is struck by the thought that perhaps the AP has been snookered into believing that it 's getting " DRM for news , " when in reality it 's simply using an open - source news metadata markup language with Creative Commons rights expression .
Certainly , there 's a pretty large contingent of writers in the blogosphere who think the AP is simply misguided , out of touch , or simply stupid .
It 's the sort of attitude that leads to mocking graphics which may be uncharitable , but it is quite obvious that hNews and a registry are n't going to save the traditional news industry without some significant other changes .
Down the road , of course , the AP might go to Congress and ask that whatever tracking and rights system it settles on be given the force of law .
It 's not as crazy as it sounds ; European publishers already hope to get a law enforcing the Automated Content Access Protocol .
" We need search engines to recognize ACAP as a step towards acknowledging that content providers have the right to decide what happens to their content and on what terms , " said the Chairman of ACAP , Gavin O'Reilly , recently .
" The European Commission and other legislators call on our industry constantly to come up with solutions — here we have one and we call upon the regulators to back it up . "
Cern 's particle collider aims to recreate conditions of the Big Bang Anti-terrorism magistrates in Paris have filed preliminary charges against a French physicist arrested last week on suspicion of links to al - Qaeda .
The 32 - year - old man of Algerian descent works at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) , Europe 's main centre for studying particle physics .
He was one of two brothers detained in the town of Vienne on Thursday .
Officials said he had been in contact with people linked to al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and planned attacks .
The researcher had been working on an experiment at the Cern laboratory which houses the giant Large Hadron Collider , designed to recreate the conditions that existed just after the Big Bang .
It is located on the Swiss - French border .
After his arrest , Cern was quick to stress that his job " did not bring him into contact with anything that could be used for terrorism " .
On Monday , spokesman James Gillies said the man had not been seen at work for most of the year because he was ill , but that he had been in touch via e-mail .
' Desire '
The scientist , who has so far not been identified under French judicial rules , appeared at a court in Paris to face charges of " criminal association with a terrorist enterprise " , officials said .
He was placed under formal judicial investigation and would later hear whether he would have to remain in custody until trial , they added .
His 25 - year - old brother has been released without charge .
After their arrest last week in Vienne , about 100 km ( 65 miles ) south - west of Cern 's laboratory , judicial sources told the AFP news agency that agents had come across him during a separate inquiry into the recruitment of would - be Islamist militants who wanted to fight in Afghanistan .
The physicist had exchanged messages over the internet with people known to be close to al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and expressed a desire to carry out attacks , but had " not got to the stage of carrying out material acts of preparation " , one said .
On Friday , French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux said magistrates would " doubtless establish what the targets were in France or elsewhere , and perhaps indicate that we have avoided the worst " .
The BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner , says the prospect of a French nuclear physicist having alleged links to al - Qaeda has sent alarm bells ringing in counter - terrorism circles .
Al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb emerged in early 2007 , after the Algerian militant group , the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat ( GSPC ) , aligned itself with Osama Bin Laden 's international network .
The group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the French embassy in Mauritania in August which wounded three people .

What is to be done when the major means of communication with the majority of a nation ’s people is under the control of select groups that consistently distort and fabricate the information delivered ?
This is the situation that the whole world faces .
The major points of contact with the information that the world ’s people require in order to make personal and societal decisions are primarily : TV , radio and print media , and internet sources that are driven by these sources ; other internet sources are more correctly called propaganda tools regardless of their ideological position .
The primary “ news ” sources lay claim to some degree of neutrality and veridicality ; but , they only pretend “ neutrality ” on issues that do not directly concern their owners or the self - interest of individual reporters and “ news ” departments .
They use the cheap device of giving “ equal time ” and authority to positions whether or not there is any valid reason to assume equality ; they always distort and ignore news that would negatively impact the economic and political elite .
The consequence is that there is no consistently reliable source for vital , informing descriptions of the conditions of our world .
We cannot act with any confidence that the information upon which we must act is accurate .
While we know we are being lied to , there is no source that stands as sufficiently honest and unbiased that we can use it as a reference to measure the maelstrom .
Of course , some people with enough time , experience and determination can often piece together descriptions of events in ways that they might reasonable trust as veridical , but there is little or no way that their efforts can be generally disseminated – or for that matter , separated from the propaganda that is boiling up as a substitute for real information .
So , regardless of the motives , of which there are many ( to be looked at more closely in moment ) , the result is the almost complete impossibility of the general public having the information that they require to act in response to the actual events and processes going on in the world .
This is the loss of a most basic survival tool : accurate information to inform action in the environment .
Insidiously , the non-news part of media acts to set the base - line expectations for the “ news ” itself .
‘ Every ’ person in TV dramas carries a gun , drives a Land Rover , uses a satphone and lives in a million dollar house or condo ; even if they have a 50 K job doing what , in the real world , might be some form of accounting .
‘ Everyday - people ’ have al Qaeda sleeper cells in the house next door to them .
Serial killers roam the streets of every neighborhood .
And personal success and satisfaction is never ever seen as a moment of quiet reflection .
If we average the content of the lives we see portrayed on our “ home theaters ” and compare them to the actual modal lives of American citizens , the disconnect rises to the level of the pathological : the stories that we tell about ourselves have absolutely nothing – nothing – to do with the lives we lead , even as we attempt , as we always have done , to model ourselves after them .
For every film like The Remains of the Day , there are hundreds where the moral choices are drawn in crayon and gratuitous blood .
People embrace the entertainment media , giving it 50 , 80 , even 100 % of their non-working life ( and many times part of their working life ) not so much to be entertained , but to be part of the common human experience .
If people felt fully connected to flesh and blood people , then they would not spend 5 hours a day watching 2 - dimensional electronic representations of people that they can’t know , ca n’t touch or ask a question .
If people felt informed and competent in the execution of their lives , then they would n’t so desperately seek the slick and phony “ competence ” of media “ heroes . ”
The professional news media is now only an extension of this pattern .
To a large extend it is competing with fictional stories , with the carefully rehearsed control of emotional content and production values , while at the same time purporting to discover and extract accurate descriptions of events and behaviors that talented and powerful interests wish to remain hidden .
My critique in no way is intended to suggest that this social role and responsibility is easy , only that this vital role is being thoroughly mishandled and abused .
The reasons for the abuse run from the most mundane to the most violently draconian .
Reporters and editors have often been the targets of the forces who wish not to be reported on .
In 2006 , 81 journalists were killed ( other accounts give the number as 110 ) and 871 were put in jail worldwide .
2007 saw 86 ( 95 ) killed and hundreds more jailed .
The assumption is made that the vast majority of the journalists so treated were acted on in response to their reporting things that someone really did n’t want to see made public .
A message was being sent : speak and die ; this would distort what is reported on .
But there are many other ways to motivate the distortion of information .
Limbaugh is reported to have a 400 million dollar contract !
Top TV “ news ” anchors are all in the 6 to 8 figure range .
These amounts of money create organized interest groups deep within the media beast with a disproportionate voice in how stories are framed so that the “ news ” show can ‘ get its story ’ day after day .
The self - interested corporate ownership of media has its own influence .
At the other extreme the public must be appealed to to watch and listen .
This has become about polling and presentation , personality and production values , matching expectations and desires more than giving the most straightforward accounting of events no matter where the chips may fall – there must be no chips , though sparks are good , i.e. , there must be no real consequences , just shiny things to distract attention .
If real substantive stories with real consequences that led to human action were presented , people might come to expect , and eventually demand , substantive information … .
And then there would be the danger of the numbers a couple of paragraphs above going up – it is a tough decision : package a dishonest product , have sycophantic fame and make lots of money … or tell the greatest truth that can be divined from the muscular digging of evidence and be ignored , rejected , threatened , fired , jailed or killed .
What matters , what gets lost in the wailing over this and that specific crime against the public good , is exactly that , the public good .
Just as wind sailors died from the lack of specific vitamins , so societies die from the lack of accurate information on the vital details of life .
A social order cannot sustain on lies .
It is just so simple : the biophysical world in which we live requires that it be responded to from veridicality .
The ‘ vascular system ’ through which is pumped the information necessary for societal and individual survival is diseased and failing .
The informational nutrients of life delivered by it cannot be trusted and we accept them with reluctance even as we must , at some level , accept them .
What hope there is in this model of our informational dilemma comes from those who will not give up trying to organize , out of the cacophony , some bits of the real .
So long as this impulse is alive there is always a corner to be turned .
Like the creature that collects tiny drops of water , one at a time , from the morning dew in a rainless land , those who have the ability and inclination to organize some more truthful image of our present time must do so to stay mentally alive .
As those people spread their efforts and share their methods for making sense of the intentional chaos perhaps , just maybe , a critical mass can demand even more .
The government is playing a two - handed game over its plan to snoop on all our communication and internet activity .
On the one hand , officials have put it about that the scheme has been indefinitely shelved because of concerns raised in the public consultation on the proposals .
On the other , Home Office insiders assure me that the government has no intention of putting the scheme on hold .
Any statements to the contrary are designed to mitigate the risk of a negative campaign in the run-up to the general election .
The government quite rightly perceives an election risk because of its surveillance plans .
It is , after all , proposing to reach deep into the private life of everyone in the nation .
From your phone records and emails to your activity on social networking sites such as Facebook , the government wants to know everything you do .
The scheme is a political disaster in the making .
Both the Tories and the Lib Dems have positioned themselves with a reform agenda on privacy .
The mere existence of a surveillance plan of this magnitude would have created the sort of clear blue water that no government would want .
Bad enough that it has already created a surveillance society second to none in the democratic world ; even worse if it was seen to be moving toward a North Korean model .
The consultation in this scheme was a disreputable piece of work .
The government tried to sell the snooping plans as if they were a range of vacuum cleaners .
It offered a " do nothing " option , already dismissed by ministers ; a ridiculously complex and unlawful option ; and a " middle ground " option .
The document offered no specific detail , primarily because officials and ministers had no clue what technology or techniques are available to spy on the public .
It said nothing about safeguards , principally because the Home Office had no idea what it had to safeguard .
And it was mute on specifics about risks , again because the government had no clue what it was trying to " protect " us from .
In other words , what was proposed was a nebulous scheme dreamed up on non-existent technology to combat unspecified threats .
Little wonder that the majority of responses to the consultation dismissed the plans as sheer nonsense .
But the true litmus test of the viability of the government 's scheme happened in Madrid recently .
There , more than a thousand of the world 's leading technical experts , lawyers , privacy regulators and corporations gathered at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners to consider the best and the worst information projects in the world .
The government 's scheme sat magnificently at the top of the pile of bad ideas , attracting a uniquely harsh assessment from the experts at the meeting .
To give you a flavour of the considered expert view of the scheme , I could not find a single supporter of the proposals .
The technology companies told me they were fantasy , the privacy commissioners said they were probably unlawful , and civil society groups said they are obnoxious .
On the basis of my straw poll at the event , I could write a slogan for this scheme : " Eight out of ten of the world 's biggest corporations think the government 's plan is insane . "
This scheme is a break point for this government .
If it had any mind to assure the public that it cares about rights , it will make an unequivocal commitment in parliament to withdraw the plans .
At least then we can have some assurance that some shred of privacy remains in our surveillance - infested world .
Looks like the DROID invasion is starting a little early -- we were just sent these pics of Motorola 's beastly Android slider on sale at an unspecified Best Buy Mobile somewhere deep within America 's heartland .
Or perhaps it 's lurking around the fringe of our nation 's coasts .
In either case , we 're told BBM reps can sell you a DROID as of today , so it might be worth checking out if you 're not psyched to hit up your local Verizon store at 7 AM tomorrow .
And do let us know if the DROID ERIS is available , will you ?
P.S. - Just got a tip that Wal - Mart is now selling 'em early too .
The DROIDs are loose , people .
Gather your valuables .
P.P.S. - Target Mobile Solutions , which operates kiosks in California Target stores , has opened the floodgates too -- but the catch is that you 'll be paying $ 249.99 for a new activation , $ 50 more than Verizon after rebate .
Thanks ,
Tony !
( Update : we 're hearing it 's back down to $ 199.87 now -- nice ! )

SEATTLE -- San Francisco
Giants star pitcher Tim Lincecum is facing misdemeanor marijuana charges following a traffic stop in his home state .
Washington State Patrol spokesman Steve Schatzel said Thursday that the 2008 Cy Young Award winner and former star at the University of Washington was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 5 in the town of Hazel Dell , about four miles north of the Oregon border , on Oct. 30 .
An officer approached Lincecum 's 2006 Mercedes and smelled marijuana as the pitcher rolled down his window .
Schatzel said Lincecum immediately complied with a request to hand over the drug and a marijuana pipe from the car 's center console .
The amount measured was 3.3 grams .
Schatzel said police consider that a small amount for personal use , well below the maximum of 40 grams before possession is classified differently and carries a more severe penalty .
The incident was first reported by The Columbian in Vancouver , Wash .
" It 's not really out of the ordinary .
It happens every day , " Schatzel said of the volume of marijuana Lincecum handed over .
" It was about the size of a thumb , the whole thumb . "
Lincecum could face potential fines totaling $ 622 for the misdemeanor possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia counts plus the citation for driving 74 mph in a 60 mph zone , Schatzel said .
The 25 - year - old All - Star starter entered a plea of not guilty through his attorney on Monday , according to records in Clark County District Court .
A hearing that had been scheduled for Friday morning was canceled , pending a pretrial conference between Lincecum 's attorney and a county prosecutor on Nov. 23 .
Lincecum is currently scheduled to appear before a judge on Dec. 22 .
The Giants said they were aware of the situation but did not immediately have a comment .
The native of the Seattle suburb of Bellevue went 15 - 7 with a 2.48 ERA in 32 starts and 225 1/3 innings in 2009 , his third season in the major leagues .
He is 40 - 17 with a 2.90 ERA in his career and could be getting a huge , multimillion - dollar raise from salary arbitration this offseason .
Teammates consider the smallish right - hander a quirky perfectionist .
They also consider him the " Franchise , " the nickname they gave him when he broke into the big leagues only a year out of college .
Others see his boyish face , shaggy dark hair , diminutive frame -- and his dominance -- and call him " The Freak . "
San Francisco chose him 10th overall in the 2006 draft out of Washington , and he instantly became the organization 's top pitching prospect since Hall of Famer Juan Marichal signed with the New York Giants as an amateur free agent in 1957 .

DNA databases kept by police forces have grown all over the world since Britain launched the first one in 1995 .
Police in England and Wales have since amassed profiles of 8.7 % of the population , by routinely taking samples from everyone arrested .
Samples are held for six years .
On Tuesday November 24th the author of a government report on DNA databases claimed that the police were making arrests purely to get more samples on file .
Three out of four young black men are now said to have their profiles on the database .
Yet the usefulness of DNA databases is not apparently related to size .
DNA reportedly helped with 58 % of criminal investigations in England and Wales in 2008 , compared with 70 % in Scotland , which destroys samples taken in more minor investigations and so holds profiles of a much smaller share of its population .
According to the FBI , California 's database , with 1.2 m profiles , has aided nearly 8,000 investigations while Florida's , at half the size , has helped in over 10,000 cases .

NASA ’s recent lunar - punch mission apparently was not the high - profile flop it first appeared .
Officials at Ames Research Center in Northern California , which managed the mission , released images Friday that clearly show a plume of debris from the Cabeus crater shortly after the space agency ’s rocket plowed into it .
The plume reached an estimated mile above the lunar surface .
Creating a plume was key to the mission ’s success because the goal was to measure dust kicked up by the Centaur rocket to find out whether ice might lie hidden in polar craters that have n’t seen sunlight in billions of years .
To do that , the accompanying $ 79 - million Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite was to fly through the debris cloud so its spectrometers and cameras could sample the lunar dust .
Everything appeared to go as planned in the early morning hours of Oct. 9 , except that no debris plume appeared as the LCROSS satellite followed the Centaur into the crater .
Hundreds of members of the public , who had gathered at Ames ’ campus in Mountain View to watch the 4:30 a.m. event on a huge outdoor movie screen , were disappointed to see only a close - up of the craggy lunar surface before the screen went black when the satellite crashed .
At the time , NASA scientists said they hoped the problem was simply that cameras aboard the satellite were not properly adjusted to detect the plume .
But some scientists feared the Centaur might have hit bedrock and failed to create a plume .
The new images , lifted from a different camera aboard the spacecraft , show that a plume did , in fact , occur .
That means the satellite should have been capable of detecting water , if it was present .
“ We are blown away by the data returned , ” Tony Colaprete , the mission ’s top scientist , said in a statement .
“ The team is working hard on the analysis , and the data appear to be of very high quality . ”
Colaprete said that it was too early to say what the plume contained but that several clues , including the temperature of the flash created by the crash , will help scientists find out in coming weeks .
Finding significant amounts of water on the moon would be a major discovery , making eventual colonization easier than it would be if settlers had to transport water from Earth .

UTTAR PRADESH , India ( CNN ) --
On World Population
Day this year India 's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue :
Bring electricity to every Indian village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies .
Could the remote control be a birth control method ?
That statement raised eyebrows across this vast country -- but what are the realities and reactions from families who make up the second largest population in the world ?
At 80 - plus years old Omar Mohammed has never heard of population control .
He lives in India 's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and has certainly done his part in contributing to India 's burgeoning population .
" Now you see I have 24 children , 13 boys and 11 girls , " Omar says .
Omar believes only God can decide how many children you should have .
He lifts his hands to the sky and says : " This is His command .
It 's not my doing , it 's His doing . "
On the other hand there 's the Arora family in the capital city of Delhi .
They have two children .
" You can't even get enough water or electricity now .
So its advisable that people have only two children and then they should stop having more kids . " mother Anjana Arora says .
The Aroras know a little something about population issues ; their daughter was given the official title of India 's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000 .
With family planning and free contraceptive programs the Indian government has long tried to encourage families to have only two children .
Overall government statistics show the birth rate is coming down .
The numbers show 14 of India 's 35 states have reached the two child per family target .
But the push is failing in other states , especially in villages and among the poor and illiterate where the fertility rate is as high as 3.5 children per woman .
Do n't Miss World population projected to reach 7 billion in 2011
There are all kinds of reasons -- from the desire to continue having children until a son is born to lack of access to contraceptives .
The government 's concern is that a booming population will further test already scarce resources , greatly impact the environment , and make life even harder for the poor .
According to the United Nations , India is home to 50 percent of the world 's poor and on current projections , India will become the most populous country on earth sometime in the next 50 years , overtaking China .
Upon hearing about the latest idea to use electricity and television to give people something else to do besides procreate , mom Anjana Arora scoffed .
" That 's a stupid thing " she said in English then switched to Hindi " The only way to change people 's mentality is through education . "
But not everyone is writing the idea off .
" It 's an idea that can really work . " says A.R. Nanda .
Years ago Nanda helped draft some of India 's population stabilization policies and he now runs the Population Foundation of India .
He says while education and access to health care is paramount , electrifying villages is not a bad idea .
" It gives a message loud and clear that we need to do something for the people which is people - friendly and which in a way will keep their minds from taking irrational decisions about producing more babies , " Nanda says .
He says there are studies that prove it .
One such survey done in 2006 by an Italian sexologist reveals couples with televisions in their bedrooms had sex half as much as those without it .
That being said Omar Mohammed , the man with 24 children had a different take .
" After watching TV , " he says , " when we look at scintillating things we will probably want to make more children . "
There are some cycles in oil price fluctuations .
For instance , the seasonal fluctuations in oil demand or even the change of oil contract at the end of each month .
On top of that , there is the usual chaos of geopolitical events , Hurricanes , etc. .
The objective is to see if we can apply the Periodicity Transform in order to capture eventual cycles and get an idea of future oil market volatility .
The amplitude of the big slide in oil prices from $ 75 to $ 61 was a little bit a surprise for everybody .
I 'm trying to answer the following question : is this big drop significant or simply a consequence of a very volatile market ?
I consider the prices from 2002 to end of July 2006 ( the data is from the EIA ) .
We fit a straight line in the log domain ( Fig. 1 ) .
The fit is quite nice with a correlation coefficient equals to 0.97 , the slope is 0.2615 / year which represents a 30 % per year increase in prices .
Fig 1 .- Linear fit in the log domain .

The residuals are Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation equals to 0.095 :
Fig 2 . - Residuals of the fit shown on Fig. 1 and corresponding pdf ( the red line is the Gaussian model ) .

If we apply an exponential transform to go back to the normal price domain , we get a nice exponential trend ( Fig. 3 ) .
The dotted lines are the 95 % confidence interval derived from the above gaussian model for the residuals .
Note that even if the residuals can be modeled as a gaussian additive noise , once the exponential transform is applied the noise becomes multiplicative and non gaussian ( that 's why the confidence interval becomes wider with time ) .
Fig 3 . - Exponential trend and 95 % confidence interval .
The red points are the recent drop from Aug 1 to Sept 19 .

The Periodicity Transform is quite a new tool proposed by William A. Sethares and Tom Staley in 1999 :
Periodicity Transforms decompose a data sequence into a sum of simple periodic sequences by projecting onto a set of periodic subspaces , leaving residuals whose periodicities have been removed .
As the name suggests , this decomposition is accomplished directly in terms of periodic sequences and not in terms of frequency or scale , as do the Fourier and Wavelet Transforms .
In consequence , the representation is linear - in - period , rather than linear - in - frequency or linear - in - scale .
Unlike most transforms , the set of basis vectors is not specified a priori , rather , the Periodicity Transform finds its own " best " set of basis elements .
Technically , the collection of all periodic subspaces forms a frame , a more - than - complete spanning set .
The Periodicity Transforms specify ways of sensibly handling the redundancy by exploiting some of the general properties of the periodic subspaces .
Applied on the residuals , we get 29 basis elements .
I show the four most important periodic basis elements in terms of energy contribution :
Fig 4 .
The 4 top basis elements out of 29 .

We can reuse the periodicity basis in order to estimate future fluctuations of the residuals :
Fig 5 .- Modelisation of the residuals by the Periodcity Transform .

Back in the price domain , we get the following prediction :
Fig 6 .- Periodicity Transform Extrapolation .
Click to enlarge .
Fig 7 .- Zoom in on Fig. 6 .
The recent drop in oil prices is still within the confidence interval of the exponential trend observed since 2002 .
There is about a 2 % probability that prices could drop below $ 61 .
It seems that $ 60 is the actual lower support line for the oil prices right now .
The periodicity transform gives us a rough idea of what future volatility could look like .
The PT basis elements are hard to interpret in terms of known price cycles .
The predictive power of the Periodicity Transform is probably limited because of the chaotic nature of price fluctuations .
The PT seems to have predicted the recent big drop in prices and is predicting a big rise at the end of the year .
Of course , this is a very simple approach that is assuming that the exponential trend observed since 2002 will stay a valid model for the coming years .
