In Michael Wolff ’s forthcoming biography of Rupert Murdoch , “ The Man Who Owns The News , ” the author writes that the media mogul has seemed to turn away lately from his cable news network , and is n’t fond its top- rated personality , Bill O’Reilly .
“ It is not just Murdoch ( and everybody else at News Corp. ’s highest levels ) who absolutely despises Bill O’Reilly , the bullying , mean - spirited , and hugely successful evening commentator , ” Wolff wrote , “ but [ Fox News chief executive ] Roger Ailes himself who loathes him .
Success , however , has cemented everyone to each other . "
“ The embarrassment can no longer be missed , ” Wolff wrote , in another section of the book .
“ He mumbles even more than usual when called on to justify it .
He barely pretends to hide the way he feels about Bill O’Reilly .
And while it is not that he would give
Fox up — because the money is the money ; success trumps all — in the larger sense of who he is , he seems to want to hedge his bets . ”
Wolff describes Murdoch as not wanting News Corp. to be defined by Fox News .
And so last year ’s purchase of the Wall Street Journal , he wrote , “ was in no small way about wanting to trade the illiberal — the belligerent , the vulgar , the loud , the menacing the unsubtle — for the better - heeled , the more magnanimous , the further nuanced . ”
Politico obtained a copy of Wolff ’s book , to be released Tuesday , under an agreement not to publish its contents before today .
Two excerpts ran in Vanity Fair , and Murdoch already raised objections to the characterization of his relationship with Fox News , according to the NY Times .
( Murdoch 's son - in - law , the London PR executive Matthew Freud , obtained a copy and passed it along to him ) .
And this month , despite Wolff 's charges , Fox gave huge contracts to both O'Reilly and Ailes .
Murdoch has never strayed from his free - market beliefs , but his exact political views have always been difficult to pin down .
Among those politicians he 's backed through the years :
Thatcher , Reagan , Blair , Koch , and McCain .
Political circumstances , and how Murdoch can wield the most power , typically determine where his papers ’ allegiances fall .
While Murdoch is best described as conservative , he ’s never been a true believer who 's willing to forsake business interests for ideology .
Wolff also ponders if Murdoch is becoming more liberal , perhaps as a result of his wife , Wendi , who attended Obama fundraisers , and his daughter Elisabeth , who threw one in London .
Generally , Wolff describes the Murdoch children , and heirs to the empire , as “ limousine liberals . ”
It ’s for that reason that some thought Murdoch ’s New York Post might endorse Obama in the general election .
Indeed , the Post endorsed Obama over Hillary Clinton in the New York primary , and Murdoch wanted the President - elect to know it .
Gary Ginsberg , News Corp ’s executive VP of Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs , “ knew Caroline Kennedy was riding in a car with Obama and begged her to show Obama the New York Post ’s endorsement , ” according to the book .
In the months after the primary endorsement , Murdoch went on to call Obama a “ rock star ” and publicly spoke of being open to endorsing him .
The two men finally met in early summer 2008 , at the Waldorf - Astoria .
Without telling Obama , Murdoch brought Ailes along , too .
Wolff writes :
Obama lit into Ailes .
He said he did n’t want to waste his time talking to Ailes if Fox was just going to continue to abuse him and his wife , that Fox had relentlessly portrayed him as suspicious , foreign - fearsome — just short of a terrorist .
Ailes , unruffled , said it might not have been this way if Obama had come on the air instead of giving Fox the back of his hand .
A tentative truce , which may or may not have historical significance , was thereupon agreed .
Despite the truce , Fox and the Obama campaign still battled it out , especially in the campaign ’s final weeks .
That said , Obama did sit down with O’Reilly , Chris Wallace on “ Fox News Sunday , ” and “ Fox & Friends . ”
And that Obama endorsement ?
Ginsberg — one of the liberals in Murdoch ’s inner circle , along with News Corp. number two Peter Chernin — thought the Post might endorse Obama .
“ He ’s going to do it , ” Ginsberg told the author .
But then he did n’t .
Murdoch , who ’s kept the media world off balance for a half century , would n't break with the Republican Party after all .
Never mind , the public praise or his family ’s support of the Democratic nominee .
The Post even jumped out in front of every other major newspaper , enthusiastically endorsing McCain in early September .
Toward the end of the book , Wolff addresses Murdoch ’s response to the Vanity Fair excerpts , which indicated he might be moving left .
“ Indeed , Murdoch was responding to suggestions about his nascent liberalism — in September I discussed his Obama leanings in Vanity Fair — with grumpiness and contrariness .
He was n’t a liberal !
Who said that ?
He was , stubbornly , what he wanted to be , what he decided he would be . ”
Even with Wolff 's unprecedented access to the family , and 50 hours of interviews , it 's still not easy to pin down Murdoch .
But for Murdoch - watchers , the book is a very revealing look at the man and his empire .

Cal NORML Release – Nov. 24 , 2008
In a blow to medical marijuana providers , the California Supreme Court ruled that defendants are not entitled to a defense as Prop. 215 caregivers if their primary role is only to supply marijuana to patients .
The court unanimously overruled an appellate court decision in the case People v. Roger Mentch , writing :
” We hold that a defendant whose caregiving consisted principally of supplying marijuana and instructing on its use , and who otherwise only sporadically took some patients to medical appointments , cannot qualify as a primary caregiver under the Act and was not entitled to an instruction on the primary caregiver affirmative defense .
We further conclude that nothing in the Legislature ’s subsequent 2003 Medical Marijuana Program ( Health & Safety Code , 11362.7 et seq. ) alters this conclusion or offers any additional defense on this record . ”
Prop 215 defines “ primary caregiver ” to be the “ individual designated by the [ patient ] … who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing , health , or safety of that
person . ”
According to the Court , these words “ imply a caretaking relationship directed at the core survival needs of a seriously ill patient , not just one single pharmaceutical need . ”
The Court concluded , ” a defendant asserting primary caregiver status must prove at a minimum that he or she ( 1 ) consistently provided caregiving , ( 2 ) independent of any assistance in taking medical marijuana , ( 3 ) at or before the time he or she assumed responsibility for assisting with medical marijuana . ”
The Court ’s ruling effectively limits the caregiver defense to relatives , personal friends and attendants , nurses , etc .
In particular , it excludes its use by medical marijuana “ buyers ’clubs , ” retail dispensaries and delivery services .
The remaining legal defense for medical marijuana providers is to organize as patient cooperatives and collectives , which are legal under SB 420 .
“ The Mentch decision highlights the inadequacy of California ’s current medical marijuana supply system , ” said Cal NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer .
“ The law needs to allow for professional licensed growers , as with other medicinal herbs . ”

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The female bomber who killed five people just outside the heavily fortified Green Zone on Monday was mentally disabled and her explosives vest was triggered by remote control , an official said .
A man nspects the wreckage of a bus destroyed by a female suicide bomber on Monday .
Baghdad Operations Command spokesman Brig .
Gen. Qassim Atta said the strike is the latest example of insurgents ' using mentally disabled female bombers to launch attacks .
The most prominent example of the tactic was the deployment of mentally disabled female bombers last February at Baghdad pet markets , attacks that killed 99 people .
Monday 's bombing -- one of a string of blasts in the capital that killed a total of 19 people -- occurred outside one of the main entrances to the Green Zone , an Interior Ministry official said .
Along with two Iraqi soldiers and three civilians who died , 12 other people were wounded .
The district , which is also known as the International Zone , houses Iraqi government offices and the headquarters of U.S. forces in Iraq .
The Iraqi parliament -- located in the district -- is expected to vote this week on an agreement that determines the terms of U.S. troops ' presence in Iraq after the U.N. mandate on their presence expires at the end of this year .
Also Monday morning , a roadside bomb struck a bus in eastern Baghdad , killing at least 13 people and wounding seven others , an Interior Ministry official said .
The victims were on their way to work at the Ministry of Trade .
Atta said the bomb was attached to the bus , an example of magnetic improvised explosive devices , or sticky bombs , that have been used by militants in recent months .
In the morning 's third deadly attack , another roadside bomb went off in eastern Baghdad .
It targeted a police patrol , an Interior Ministry official said .
One civilian was killed and five injured .
Three of the wounded were police officers .

US scientists have figured out how icebergs break off Antarctica and Greenland , a finding that may help predict rising sea levels as the climate warms .
Writing in Friday 's edition of the journal Science , they said icebergs formed fast when parent ice sheets spread out quickly over the sea .
" It wo n't help the Titanic , but a newly derived , simple law may help scientists improve their climate models " and predict ice sheet break - up , they said in a statement .
The Titanic sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg , killing 1,500 people .
Ice cracking off into the ocean from Antarctica and Greenland could be the main contributor to global sea level rises in the future .
If all the ice in Greenland and Antarctica melted , seas would rise by more than 60 metres .
The formation rate of icebergs was less linked to factors such as ice thickness , width of the ice flow , distance from land or waves , the scientists said .
Ice sheets are giant frozen rivers , caused by snowfall , that slowly flow to the sea and then break up .
In Antarctica , the Ross Ice Shelf extends 800 kilometres over the ocean before the edges snap off and form icebergs .
Many other ice sheets stretch just a kilometre or two .
Computer models that predict how ice sheets behave in warmer weather generally gloss over exactly how icebergs break off because researchers have failed to understand the mechanism , known as calving .
" For iceberg calving , the important variable - the one that accounts for the largest portion of when the iceberg breaks - is the rate at which ice shelves spread , " the study said .
A fast spread means cracks form throughout the shelf and make it crack up .
A slower spread means that deep cracks do not form as fast and the ice sticks together .
" The problem of when things break is a really hard problem because there is so much variability , " lead author Richard Alley , of Pennsylvania State University , said .
" Anyone who has dropped a coffee cup knows this .
Sometimes the coffee cup breaks and sometimes it bounces , " he said of the problems of understanding cracking .
The UN Climate Panel predicts seas will rise by 18 to 59 centimetres this century because of warming stoked by human use of fossil fuels .

Much of the discussion about a possible rescue of the Big Three automakers has been colored by the claim that blue collar workers at those companies earn $ 70 / hour .
The original ( or , at least , the most prominent ) source of this claim seems to have been a recent column in The New York Times by Andrew Ross Sorkin : " At G.M. , as of 2007 , the average worker was paid about $ 70 an hour , including health care and pension costs . "
If this claim were true , it would mean that a 40 - hour - per - week , 50 - week - per - year worker earns $ 140,000 in annual gross income .
In a column in The New Republic , Jonathan Cohn asks rhetorically : " Is it any wonder the Big Three are in trouble ?
And with auto workers making so much , why should taxpayers -- many of whom make far less -- finance a plan to bail them out ? "
Cohn quickly answers his own question : " Well , here 's one reason :
The figure is wildly misleading . "
He shows that GM 's workers earned $ 28 / hour in wages in 2007 , plus about $ 10 in benefits .
He continues :
But then what 's the source of that $ 70 hourly figure ?
It did n't come out of thin air .
Analysts came up with it by including the cost of all employer - provided benefits -- namely , health insurance and pensions -- and then dividing by the number of workers .
The result , they found , was that benefits for Big Three cost about $ 42 per hour , per employee .
Add that to the wages -- again , $ 28 per hour -- and you get the $ 70 figure .
Voila .
Except ... notice something weird about this calculation ?
It 's not as if each active worker is getting health benefits and pensions worth $ 42 per hour .
That would come to nearly twice his or her wages .
( Talk about gold - plated coverage ! )
Instead , each active worker is getting benefits equal only to a fraction of that -- probably around $ 10 per hour , according to estimates from the International Motor Vehicle Program .
The number only gets to $ 70 an hour if you include the cost of benefits for retirees -- in other words , the cost of benefits for other people .
One of the few people to grasp this was Portfolio.com 's Felix Salmon .
As he noted friday , the claim that workers are getting $ 70 an hour in compensation is just " not true . "
Cohn concludes his article as follows :
If carried out as planned , by 2010 -- the final year of this existing contract -- total compensation for the average UAW worker would actually be less than total compensation for the average non-unionized worker at a transplant factory .
The only problem is that it will be several years before these gains show up on the bottom line -- years the industry probably wo n't have if it does n't get financial assistance from the government .
Make no mistake :
The argument over a proposed rescue package is complicated , in no small part because over the years both management and labor made some truly awful decisions while postponing the inevitable reckoning with economic reality .
And even if the government does provide money , it 's a tough call whether restructuring should proceed with or without a formal bankruptcy filing .
Either way , yet more downsizing is inevitable .
But the next time you hear somebody say the unions have to make serious salary and benefit concessions , keep in mind that they already have -- enough to keep the companies competitive , if only they can survive this crisis .
Personally , I take great interest in the auto industry .
I grew up in Toledo , Ohio , one of the many small cities that rises and falls with Detroit 's fortunes .
The best policy response to the current crisis is , as Cohn says , a tough call .
As tax professors know better than most , however , getting the right answers is impossible if you are working with the wrong numbers ( or if you do n't understand the numbers you 're working with ) .

Though some present - day bigots have flocked to newer ideologies such as denial of the Holocaust , much anti-Semitism still revolves around the basic conspiratorial ideas expressed by older anti-Semitic texts .
By offering older texts at their Web sites , todays haters demonstrate the longevity of their beliefs , thereby legitimizing them to both dedicated followers and potential recruits .
Due to the fame of its publisher , Henry Ford Sr. , The International Jew , a four - volume anti-Semitic work first published in the 1920s , has been a particularly powerful tool for haters trying to validate their hostile beliefs .
Though Ford publicly apologized twice for publishing The International Jew , online anti-Semites continue to use his name to promote it .
The Dearborn Independent
The Dearborn Publishing Company published The Dearborn Independent newspaper .
At the peak of its popularity , the Dearborn , Michigan paper , owned by auto magnate Henry Ford Sr. , boasted a circulation of 700,000 .
The Dearborn Independent first attacked Jews in its May 22 , 1920 issue and continued to do so in 91 subsequent editions .
Many of the papers anti-Semitic articles were reprinted by the Dearborn Publishing Company in four paper - bound volumes : The International Jew , the Worlds Foremost Problem ( November , 1920 ) ; Jewish Activities in the United States ( April , 1921 ) ; Jewish Influences in American Life ( November , 1921 ) ; and Aspects of Jewish Power in the United States ( May , 1922 ) .
Collectively known as The International Jew : The Worlds Foremost Problem , these volumes were later published in a variety of languages and disseminated widely in the United States and abroad .
For decades , The International Jew has been in the public domain .
It can be reprinted by anyone who wishes to do so .
In the late 1950s , anti-Semite Gerald L.K. Smith edited and published an abridged version of The International Jew culled from the original Dearborn Independent articles .
The complete text of Smiths version now is easily found at many hate sites on the World Wide Web .
The International Jew and The Protocols
Having heard in advance about the Dearborn Publishing Companys plan to attack Jews , E.G. Pipp , editor of The Dearborn Independent , resigned in disgust in April , 1920 , and was replaced by William J. Cameron .
Ernest Liebold , Henry Ford Sr.s personal secretary , began to collect anti-Semitic material .
Liebold passed this material to Cameron , who oversaw the articles that compose The International Jew , likely writing many of them himself .
" When we get through with the Jews , " Liebold was quoted in court as saying , " there wont be one of them who will dare raise his head in public . "
A version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the most notorious political forgery of modern times , found its way into Liebolds hands .
Taken by the gullible as the confidential minutes of a meeting of Jewish leaders , The Protocols has consistently been held up by anti-Semites as proof that Jews are plotting to take over the world .
Even though it has been thoroughly discredited , The Protocols continues to circulate among anti-Semites .
Liebold passed the text of The Protocols on to Cameron , who modernized Brasols translation and used it as the foundation for The International Jew .
Each of the chapters in Gerald L.K. Smiths version of the International Jew begins with a quotation from The Protocols , and one chapter 
" An Introduction to the  Jewish Protocols   is devoted to it entirely .
One Dearborn Independent article lauded The Protocols as " too terribly real for fiction , too well - sustained for speculation , too deep in its knowledge of the secret springs of life for forgery . "
" The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on , " Ford stated in 1921 .
" They have fitted the world situation up to this time .
They fit it now . "
The International Jew and Jewish control
The International Jew portrayed Jews as monolithic , malicious schemers plotting to control the planet .
" If there is one quality that attracts Jews , it is power , " the book stated .
" Wherever the seat of power may be , thither they swarm obsequiously . "
The Dearborn Independent saw Jews as carrying out " revolutionary programs to break up the present control of society . "
These " revolutionary programs " revolve around economic control : the Jewish plan is " to control the world , not by territorial acquisition , not by military aggression , not by governmental subjugation , but by control of the machinery of commerce and exchange . "
According to The International Jew , " it is not merely that there are a few Jews among international financial controllers ; it is that these world - controllers are exclusively Jews . "
The book claimed that " the motion picture influence of the United States , of the whole world , is exclusively under the control , moral and financial , of the Jewish manipulators of the public mind . "
The International Jew did not portray Jews as individuals , but as a single - minded , calculating cabal .
Conflict among Jews , no matter how real , was painted as a sly trick , part of the Jewish plot .
Even the conflict between socialist Jews and capitalist Jews was denied .
Jewish socialists and Jewish businesspeople were believed to be working in tandem , " with Jewish capital at one end of the Gentile working scheme putting the screws on the manufacturers , and with Jewish agitators and disruptionists and subversives at the other end of the Gentile working scheme putting the screws on the workmen . "
In fact , like other people , Jews involve themselves in non-religious and professional activity as individuals , not as Jews .
The number of Jews involved in a particular field bears no relationship to " Jewish power " or " Jewish control " of that industry .
Jews do not act in concert with other Jews in the same business simply because they happen to be Jewish .
The International Jew also attacked Jews for speaking out about injustice and defending their constitutional rights .
"  Jewish rights  seemed to be summed up in the right to banish everything from their sight and hearing that suggests Christianity or its Founder , " it commented .
In fact , these so - called " Attacks on Christianity " were reasonable Jewish objections to governmental expressions of Christianity which clearly violated the separation between church and state enshrined in the Constitution .
According to The International Jew , demonstrably true Jewish accounts of pogroms in Russia were nothing but fabrications .
" This propaganda of pogroms  thousands upon thousands of Jews killed   amounts to nothing except as it illustrates the gullibility of the Press , " the book stated .
" No one believes this propaganda and governments regularly disprove it . "
Such statements foreshadowed the pernicious lies spread today by Holocaust deniers .
The International Jew blamed nearly all the troubles it saw in American society on Jews .
" Whichever way you turn to trace the harmful streams of influence that flow through society , you come upon a group of Jews , " it claimed .
Even problems with the " national pastime " were attributed to Jewish influence : " If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball , they have it in three words  too much Jew . "
The Sapiro Trial & Fords Apology
Jews and others were outraged by The International Jew , and Ford received thousands of complaints .
In September 1920 , the Central Conference of American Rabbis , the National Council of Jewish Women and Bnai Brith asked ADL to counteract Fords work .
The League released a pamphlet , The Poison Pen , that targeted the Dearborn Independent and the men behind The International Jew .
More than 100 prominent citizens , including President Woodrow Wilson , former Presidents Taft and Roosevelt , W.E.B. DuBois , Clarence Darrow , and William Jennings Bryan , signed The Perils of Racial Prejudice , a statement that urged " all those who are molders of public opinion " to " strike at " The International Jew , which it characterized as " un-American , un- Christian agitation . "
Prominent lawyer Samuel Untermeyer penned a widely - published statement describing the pernicious effects of the distribution of The International Jew .
He wrote :
Wherever there was a Ford car there was a Ford agency not far away , and wherever there was a Ford agency these vile libelous books in the language of the country were to be found .
They , coupled with the magic name of Ford , have done more than could be undone in a century to sow , spread and ripen the poisonous seeds of anti-Semitism and race hatred .
These articles are so fantastic and so naïve in their incredible fantasy that they read like the work of a lunatic , and but for the authority of the Ford name they would have never seen the light of day and would have been quite harmless if they had .
With that name they spread like wildfire and became the Bible of every anti-Semite Despite these complaints , The Dearborn Independent continued to attack Jews , even after the publication of the articles that constitute The International Jew .
In 1927 , the paper printed accusations that Jewish lawyer Aaron Sapiro and a group of Jewish bankers and merchants were seeking to control the nations wheat farming .
Sapiro sued for defamation ; his case came to trial in Detroit .
Though Sapiros suit was directed personally at Ford , Cameron testified for many days , claiming full responsibility for the articles .
He even went so far as to assert that Ford had never heard of Sapiro .
This lie was swiftly exposed when James M. Miller , a former Dearborn Independent employee , swore under oath that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro .
Just before Ford was to take the stand , he was injured in an auto accident .
While he recovered , Ford operatives demanded a mistrial after a juror spoke to a news reporter .
Following the declaration of a mistrial , Ford issued public statements and apologies to individuals and Jews as a group .
On July 16 , 1927 , an out - of - court settlement of the Sapiro suit was announced .
Though Ford apologized for The International Jew and closed the Dearborn Independent , he later accepted the Grand Cross of the German Eagle from Hitlers Nazi government in July , 1938 .
Some remain skeptical of his apology , claiming that Ford himself neither wrote nor personally signed it .
Ford again expressed his concern about the circulation of The International Jew following Americas entry into the war against Germany , for The Protocols had become a staple of Nazi propaganda .
In a 1942 letter to Sigmund Livingston , then ADL national chairman , Ford wrote , " I do not subscribe to or support , directly or indirectly , any agitation which would promote antagonism against my Jewish fellow citizens . "
He pointed out that he " destroyed copies " of The International Jew when he first apologized and had refused to give " permission or sanction to anyone to use my name as sponsoring such publication , or being the accredited author thereof . "
In the decades following Fords death in 1947 , what was once a privately - owned business became a corporation owned in large part by the public .
Since then , the Ford family and the Ford Motor Company have engaged While [ The International Jew ] once reached thousands , its reach is now even greater on the Internet .
in numerous projects and endeavors in the public interest , including many that have been supportive of Jewish concerns .
Fords grandson , Henry Ford II , consistently supported Jewish charities and cultural organizations .
In 1997 , for example , the Ford Motor Company sponsored the first screening of Steven Spielbergs " Schindlers List , " commercial - free , on national network television .
Conclusion
As founder and owner of the Ford Motor Company , Henry Ford Sr. made a positive , lasting contribution to American industry and culture , providing mobility to millions with his inexpensive automobiles .
Yet these accomplishments are marred by another of his legacies : his viciously anti-Semitic publication , the International Jew .
While that series of books once reached thousands , its reach is now even greater on the Internet .
Today , The International Jew can touch a whole new generation , connected to hate via the information superhighway .

Unlike almost every other Republican in the country this November , Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels appears on track for a resounding victory against his Democratic challenger next week .
But even with a towering lead in the polls , he ’s almost comically unwilling to be seen with Gov. Palin .
This just in from the Indianapolis Star , courtesy of TPM Reader BH …
Daniels said he plans to talk to folks in the parking lot , but ca n’t fit into his schedule a joint appearance with Palin .
This is Palin ’s third trip to Indiana , and Daniels has yet to campaign with her , though Lt. Gov. Becky Skillman was with Palin at the previous rallies in Noblesville and Fort Wayne .
“ I ’m going by ( the Palin rally . )
I ’ve got another event scheduled at the same time , but it is close by , so I ’m going to go by and spend as long as I can there and hang out in the parking lot and spend some time with the folks standing in line or patiently waiting to get in , ” Daniels said .
“ I ’m not speaking at the rally , no . ”
I guess heading in from the parking lot to the stage would have just been too much for Daniels ’ schedule to handle .
But seems a bit iffy to me .
On November 17 , U.S. Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) concluded Vigilant Shield 09 ( VS09 ) , described in a press release as a training exercise focused on “ homeland defense and civil support . ”
Launched by President Bush in 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , NORTHCOM has been mired in controversy since its creation .
Among its more dubious accomplishments were illegal domestic spying operations in conjunction with the Pentagon ’s shadowy Counter Intelligence Field Activity unit ( CIFA ) that targeted antiwar activists .
Despite CIFA ’s shut - down and the alleged dismantling of its TALON database ( now incorporated into the FBI ’s Guardian Threat Tracking System ) , SourceWatch revealed that “ in accordance with intelligence oversight requirements , the DoD will maintain a record copy of the collected data . ”
One ca n’t help but wonder whether that “ record copy ” of TALON somehow migrated into a NORTHCOM database .
But the NORTHCOM - CIFA liaison was n’t the only episode of illegal military spying on Americans to come to light .
In May , the San Diego Union - Tribune reported that Marines , including a Colonel and the co-founder of the Los Angeles County Terrorist Early Warning Center , stole top secret intelligence files from Camp Pendleton ’s Strategic Technical Operations Center .
Among the documents filched by the intelligence privateers were those marked “ Top Secret , Special Compartmentalized Information , ” the highest U.S. Government classification .
The files included surveillance dossiers on the Muslim community and antiwar activists in Southern California .
Before being run to ground by investigators , the spy ring regularly received and disseminated secret files and surveillance reports transmitted by Lauren Martin , a Navy reservist who worked as an outsourced intelligence analyst at NORTHCOM headquarters in Colorado Springs .
Martin was responsible for the region that included Southern California .
Details on VS09 are few and far - between .
However , according to U.S. Northern Command News , VS09 “ included scenarios to achieve exercise objectives within the maritime , aerospace , ballistic missile defense , cyber , consequence management , and counter terrorism situations . ”
The training exercise ran concurrently with “ other Department of Defense - sponsored and international exercises to more realistically test the synchronized response of federal , state , local and international mission partners in preparation for homeland defense , homeland security and civil support missions in the United States and abroad . ”
A November 5 press release described that the concurrent exercises included “ U.S. Strategic Command GLOBAL LIGHTNING 09 and BULWARK DEFENDER 09 ; Canada Command DETERMINED DRAGON ; California National Guard VIGILANT GUARD ; and the State of California GOLDEN GUARDIAN . ”
Global Lightning 09 is a plan to use nuclear weapons in the event of a surprise attack while Bulwark Defender was described by Matthew Rothschild in The Progressive as the Pentagon ’s “ cyberspace protection outfit . ”
California ’s Vigilant Guard and Golden Guardian were state - wide training exercises that concluded November 18 around planning for a catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake along the San Andreas fault .
If so , this would be an appropriate training venue for the California National Guard .
Why then , fold disaster preparations into a planning scenario for the use of nuclear weapons in the event of a “ surprise attack ” ?
Described as a “ Command Post Exercise ( CPX ) , ” many of the forces involved were “ notional , ” in other words , real units and their equipment “ were not deployed from their home bases . ”
However , the rapidly expanding role of the U.S. military in “ domestic civil - support operations ” and the breadth and scope of NORTHCOM “ training exercises ” are troubling , to say the least .
In September , Army Times revealed that the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team ( BCT ) was deployed October 1 , under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , “ the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
As Army Times noted , the BCT ’s “ new mission ” is the first time “ an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities . ”
Perhaps a disturbing harbinger of things to come , “ military support ” of “ civil authorities ” arises precisely during a period of extreme systemic crisis not seen since the Great Depression and points to the rapid expansion of an “ emergency preparedness complex ” as a discrete operational division of the U.S. National Security State .
National Exercise Program : “ Emergency Preparedness ” or Martial Law ?
The Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) issued a 46 - page report November 10 , 2008 on the National Exercise Program ( NEP ) .
Entitled , “ Homeland Emergency Preparedness and the National Exercise Program : Background , Policy Implications , and Issues for Congress , ” the document outlines , among other concerns , the domestic implications of military participation in national emergency preparedness drills such as VS09 .
As CRS researchers point out , the Reagan - era Executive Order 12656 ( E.O. 12656 ) , “ directs FEMA to coordinate the planning , conduct , and evaluation of national security emergency exercises . ”
E.O. 12656 defines a national security emergency as “ as any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological emergency , or other emergency that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . ” ( CRS - 4 )
Additionally , Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 ( HSPD - 8 ) requires the Secretary of Homeland Security , “ in coordination with other appropriate federal departments and agencies ” to “ establish a national program and a multi- year planning system to conduct homeland security preparedness - related exercises that reinforces identified training standards , provides for evaluation of readiness , and supports the national preparedness goal . ”
CRS avers , “ The program is to be carried out in collaboration with state and local governments and private sector entities . ”
Indeed , Washington Technology reported November 10 , that the defense giant Northrop Grumman “ will conduct a national preparedness drill for the Federal Emergency Management Agency next year under a two - year , $ 12 million contract . ”
While $ 12 million is chump change in Washington , the Project on Government Oversight ’s Federal Contractor Misconduct Database lists Northrop Grumman at No. 3 . With violations running the gamut , from procurement fraud , false claims , installation of substandard parts , violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations , cost overruns , environmental damage –from illegal dumping of toxic waste to air pollution –the company has paid the federal government and private claimants some $ 465.4 million in fines and levies .
But that has n’t stopped the federal government from doing a brisk business with Northrop Grumman !
The defense giant and their partners , security heavy - hitters ICF International , Battelle Memorial Institute , Alutiiq LLC , L - 3 Communications , Unitech and Interface Media Group “ will conduct and evaluate the 2009 Tier 1 National Level Exercise , which is the largest and most complex national disaster drill conducted by FEMA ’s National Exercise Division , ” the high - tech insider publication reported .
As CRS points out , “ NLEs examine the preparation of the government and its officers and other officials to prevent , respond to , or recover from threatened or actual terrorist attacks , particularly those involving weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) , major disasters , and other emergencies .
NLEs address strategic - and policy - level objectives intended to challenge the national preparedness of the United States . ” ( CRS - 12 )
“ Preparedness Guidance ” materials and processes for these exercises are overseen by DHS and include the National Response Framework ( NRF ) , the National Incident Management System ( NIMS ) , and the National Preparedness Guidelines ( NPG ) .
One of the first NEPs was the 1999 Top Officials ( TOPOFF ) simulation exercises “ to assess the nation ’s crisis and consequence management capacity under extraordinary conditions . ”
TOPOFF exercises enabled high - level federal officials and relevant participants to “ practice different courses of action , gain and maintain situational awareness , and assemble appropriate resources . ” ( CRS - 7 ) Between May 2000 and October 2007 , four TOPOFF exercises have been run in various locales simulating chemical , biological , pneumonic plague outbreak , as well as the detonation of an radiological dispersal device ( “ dirty bomb ” ) adjacent to a power plant .
As CRS reports , many aspects of federal executive branch planning for prevention and response to “ terrorist attacks ” are highly classified and that classified exercises “ should be a logical component of the exercise scenario and aligned with exercise objectives . ”
What such “ alignment ” actually means is not specified by CRS .
As I noted in the examples cited above , VS09 and Golden Guardian , many NEPs run simultaneously , thus rendering the more dubious aspects of such “ emergency planning exercises ” opaque to citizen scrutiny , let alone democratic decision - making control over their breadth and scope .
For example , NLE 1-08 ran simultaneously with TOPOFF 4 as well as with DoD and Health and Human Services - based exercises .
Under cover of NLE 2-08 , as CRS documents , “ two FEMA exercises , Eagle Horizon 08 , designed to exercise the continuity of operations ( COOP ) capabilities of federal agencies in the National Capital Region ( NCR ) , and Hurricane Prep 08 , designed to test FEMA response to a hurricane , exercised under the same scenario .
Both exercises incorporated some of the simulated intelligence materials established for three DOD conducted exercises held during NLE 2-08 : Positive Response 08 - 2 ; Ardent Sentry 08 ; and Ultimate Caduceus 08 . ” ( CRS - 14 )
Ardent Sentry , Positive Response and Ultimate Caduceus were training scenarios for a terrorist - related nuclear attack as were Global Lightning and Able Warrior .
What pray tell , do such exercises have to do with preparations for hurricane relief ?
If the federal response to Hurricane Katrina are any indication , not much .
What then are such exercises designed to simulate ?
CRS reports that “ During the NLE 2-08 planning process , DOD and DHS held joint planning conferences .
Further , DOD provided some logistical support to the DHS Eagle Horizon continuity exercise , which based its exercise control cell and some evaluation components at DOD ’s Joint Warfighting Center ( JWFC ) .
Both agencies anticipate future NLEs will be carried out according to timing specified in the NEP implementation plan , based on common exercise scenarios and coordinated response activities . ” ( CRS - 14 )
CRS investigators state there are “ two principal areas where DOD would play a significant role in the overall response : Homeland defense operations and civil support operations . ”
The Department of Defense defines homeland defense as “ The protection of United States sovereignty , territory , domestic population , and critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as directed by the President . ” ( CRS - 15 )
On the other hand , civil support is defined as “ Department of Defense support to US civil authorities for domestic emergencies , and for designated law enforcement and other activities . ”
While CRS claims that civil support is strictly limited to supporting civil authorities “ in their response to manmade and natural disasters ” or “ supporting public health , ” the last clause , “ maintaining civil order ” should set alarm bells ringing .
DoD ’s role during such emergencies are intended to focus “ principally on domestic incident management , either for terrorism or non terrorist catastrophic events . ”
DoD would play a “ significant role ” in the overall response .
Such definitions cover a lot of ground and are ripe with potential for abuse by unscrupulous securocrats and their corporatist partners in crime .
As Antifascist Calling has reported in numerous articles , Continuity of Operations ( COOP ) planning scenarios are intimately linked to top- secret Continuity of Government ( COG ) programs to be triggered by a “ catastrophic event . ”
Such plans include contingencies for the implementation of martial law and the suspension of the Constitution by Executive Branch fiat .
The primary DoD entity responsible for “ civil support , ” as numerous researchers have averred is NORTHCOM and its active combat component , U.S. Army North .
CRS asserts that NORTHCOM is prohibited by The Posse Comitatus Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1385 ) from executing civilian laws and a police function .
But as I wrote in early October , “ exercising sweeping emergency powers buried within Presidential Decision Directives ( PDDs ) , unelected officials could suspend the Constitution , declare martial law and create an Executive Branch dictatorship that rests solely on the power of the U.S. military . ”
This power will transfer automatically when Barack Obama is sworn in as President and Commander - in - Chief on January 20 , 2009 .
Indeed , it would be a profound error if activists and concerned citizens fell into the trap of assuming that the potential for grave Executive Branch abuses were the exclusive domain of the outgoing Bush administration .
While the Oval Office décor may change , unaccountable Executive Branch power will remain an enduring feature of the repressive capitalist state .
DHS and NORTHCOM : Best Friends Forever
Earlier this year , NORAD and NORTHCOM participated in training exercises across the country , also in support of “ civil authorities ” in the event of a catastrophic attack or “ natural disaster . ”
Vibrant Response , another CPX , was conducted at Ft. Stewart , Georgia September 18 and included elements of the Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF ( “ sea - smurfs ” ) .
The CCMRF would respond in the event of chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , or high - yield explosive ( CBRNE ) incidents .
As I reported in October , “ two combat units from the 1st Brigade Combat Team , 3rd Army Division and the elite 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade participated in mock drills designed to ‘ coordinate with local governments and interagency organizations such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency , ’ according to a report on U.S. Northern Command News . ”
As a “ subordinate command ” under the control of U.S. Army North , the Joint Task Force Civil Support ( JTF - CS ) provides command and control for the CCMRF unit .
In May , NORAD and NORTHCOM participated in National Level Exercise 2-08 ( NLE 2-08 ) under the overall command of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , according to a report by U.S. Northern Command News .
NLE 2-08 ’s main focus “ was to provide realistic training ” for CCMRF personnel in response “ to a simulated chemical attack on the Seattle waterfront followed by a similar simulated attack in Whatcom County , Wash . ”
Some 1,200 CCMRF personnel were deployed during the exercise .
But planning and consequence management in the event of a catastrophic terrorist attack or natural disaster is n’t all that NORTHCOM ’s up to .
Indeed , back in April , U.S. Northern Command News reported that both DHS and NORTHCOM are planning
… to refine their existing intelligence relationship , said the top DHS intelligence official during a recent visit to USNORTHCOM headquarters .
“ We have a number of areas where we ’ve already agreed that we will begin new initiatives together , where we will do joint projects together , where we will do intelligence analysis together , where we will work to understand what NORTHCOM is doing in exercises and training , ” said Charles Allen , the DHS undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis .
The intelligence divisions of DHS and USNORTHCOM are “ extraordinarily compatible , ” Allen said , and the organizations have the same goals .
( Sgt. 1st Class Gail Braymen , NORAD and USNORTHCOM Public Affairs , “ USNORTHCOM , DHS refine relationship , ” U.S. Northern Command News , April 10 , 2008 )
As I reported last week , citing a leaked planning document published by the global whistleblowing group Wikileaks , intelligence and security agencies across the federal spectrum including the FBI , DHS , USSS , NGA and NORTHCOM conspired to squelch dissent during the Republican National Convention .
Apparently , this is what DHS Undersecretary Allen meant when he described how the intelligence arms of both organizations were “ extraordinarily compatible . ”
Allen told U.S. Northern Command News that strengthening the relationship between DHS and NORTHCOM intelligence “ will promote more efficient and effective information sharing , ” and that “ the American public benefits because the intelligence community at the federal level is working together in new and different ways . ”
As if the militarization of society and the destruction of our civil liberties were something we should embrace !
How ’s that for an Orwellian twist on the phrase “ public benefit ” ?
But as the philosopher Voltaire once quipped , “ the history of the great events of this world are scarcely more than the history of crime . ”
And so it is as America breathlessly awaits the dawning of the new “ change ” regime .
( CNN ) -- Improving the education system .
Researching alternative fuels .
Nationalizing health care .
Paying off the debts of the American people .
Don Mejia of San Antonio , Texas , says he thinks the government should give a $ 700 billion bailout back to taxpayers .
i Reporters have plenty of ideas about what the government should do with $ 700 billion , and most of them do n't involve bailing out failing financial giants .
Federal officials are debating a $ 700 billion bailout that the Bush administration said is necessary to save the American economy .
Although Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke says the plan is vital , both parties -- not to mention the American people -- have voiced serious concerns about its price tag .
CNN.com iReporters shared what they would rather do with all that cash .
Many iReporters agreed with the sentiments of Michael Thies : " Instead of bailing these companies out , bail out the people ! " he said .
" If they want to send money , do n't send it to the mismanaged companies and let them mismanage further , " he said .
iReport.com : Will the bailout work ?
" Pay off the debts of as much of the American public as you can .
And if they do n't have debt , give it to them in a check .
Then we can start saving for our future properly and move on . "
iReport.com : Bail out the people
Michele Wallace seconded the idea of giving the money directly to the American people .
Her family is struggling with mortgage and car payments , and her husband lives apart from the rest of the family during the week so he can be closer to work and use less gas .
iReport.com : ' I would pay off my house '
Wallace said if all her family debt was paid off , her family could live comfortably on their current income .
" Instead of bailing out the companies ( which does n't help the consumer ) , bail out the consumers that have lost their jobs , taken pay cuts or are being threatened with foreclosure , " she wrote in her iReport .
iReport.com : Reader Don Mejia suggests giving $ 700 billion back to taxpayers
George Craig wants to use part of the money to increase regulation in the financial industry .
That way , he said , we can avoid situations like this in the future .
" Without some stabilizing influences , the mortgage market will continue to destabilize , " wrote Craig in his iReport .
He included a list of several other markets that he says need more regulation , including credit cards , credit default swaps , and stock options .
We could avoid other future problems by using it to create more jobs , especially in industries like alternative energy and telecommunications , he said .

Other iReporters would use the money for different government programs , such as health care and education .
" If the government is throwing around that much money to help these companies , I think they should have thrown around some money for health insurance and the people that need serious help in this country , " said Nicole Sostak , who is currently uninsured .
" It could ruin a person . "
iReport.com : ' Something has to be done about health insurance '
" Our education system is broken , " said Brandon , who asked to be identified by first name due to his military affiliation .
" If the United States plans on remaining a superpower , then we 'd better act and act quickly on the state of our up - and - coming generations . "
" We all need money , but we 've never expected the government to bail us out , " he added .

And Katherine Taheri proposed a unique solution that could raise revenue while letting Americans choose whether or not to participate in the bailout .
She thinks the federal government should create a " financial bailout bond . "
" I do n't know the details of how bonds work , but it seems to me that this would give the opportunity for the treasury to regain the money it loses , " she said .
" Then those that support the bailout can really support it , and those that do n't do not have to contribute . "
" I could use a bailout too ! " added Taheri , who owns an Irish pub in Cartersville , Georgia .
" The last thing I want to hear is that a way to save money is to not go out to eat so much . "

Marathoner ' a ' winner ;
Nike looks like a loser

Arien O'Connell was vindicated Wednesday morning - sort of .
The fifth - grade teacher from New York City ran the fastest time in Sunday 's Nike Women 's Marathon , but she was told by race officials that she did n't win because she was n't among the " elite " runners who were given a 20 - minute head start .
O'Connell was unhappy - and as corporate sports giant Nike quickly learned , she was n't the only one .
Faced with a blast of criticism from all over the country , Nike issued a statement Wednesday saying that it " recognizes Arien O'Connell as a winner . "
Did you catch that ?
It says a winner - not the winner .
Even though she ran 11 minutes faster than the " elite " woman who was given first place , O'Connell 's career - best finish will exist in an odd parallel universe where , no matter how fast you run , you can't win the race unless you 're among a special few .
Having been blindsided by a public outcry , Nike is trying to fudge its position by trying to have it both ways .
This is n't really an apology .
It 's more like corporate spin .
For a company that prides itself on championing the cause of women in sports , and encouraging them to challenge their limits , this is a pretty tepid response .
" This is supposed to be about empowering all women , " O'Connell said .
" There were so many opportunities for an inspirational message . "
Frankly , at this point O'Connell is no longer all that angry .
Maybe that 's because she 's been too busy answering calls from media who want her to tell her story , from ESPN to the New York Times .

" I was upset on the day of the day of the race , " she said .
" But it 's been so great to hear from everybody .
Just reading the comments ( on SFGate.com ) from the people who felt outraged has been amazing . "
Nike , whose " Just do it " TV commercials often stress the accomplishments and achievements of women , was in a bad spot .
There actually is an argument to be made for having a separate start for the elite runners , but given the results and finish times , this was clearly not the event for it .
In the statement , Nike officials said that " because of their earlier start time , the runners in the elite group had no knowledge of the outstanding race Arien was running and could not adjust their strategies accordingly . "
Yeah , Arien , why did n't you tip them off that you were going to run the race of your life ?
" We can all see that something was not handled well , " said Amby Burfoot , editor - at - large for Runners World magazine , which posted O'Connell 's story on its
Web site and had a huge response from readers .
" Race organizers should be prepared for all possibilities , including that someone who started 20 minutes late could win . "
Nike may have been surprised that O'Connell popped up out of nowhere , but people who read about the controversy were equally taken aback by the sports corporation 's tin ear for public relations .
" I told them they certainly passed up a chance to have a huge ad campaign that would inspire citizen runners everywhere - and maybe even sell some shoes , " said Bonnie West in an e-mail she sent to me from St. Paul , Minn .
" But as it was , unless it was fixed , I was switching brands . "
Fans not happy
There also were lots of comments posted on the Nike running blog , which you can find at links.sfgate.com/ZFEC .
" It is very clear who your female winner was , " wrote one .
" Where 's her recognition for such an awesome feat ? "
Nike replied with corporate boilerplate .
" Nike has a proven track record of supporting athletes , " the statement read , " and we 're proud to be able to honor Arien and other athletes who surpass their goals and achieve great accomplishments . "
Oh , and they 're also sending her a first - place trophy .
Not that you won first place , Arien , but you 're still a winner , OK ?
A better suggestion would have been to declare O'Connell the overall race winner and say that the woman who finished first among those who got the head start was the " elite group " winner .
The real issue is that the Nike Women 's Marathon , a wonderful event that raises money for cancer research and a draw for some 20,000 runners , is not a race that attracts world - class runners .
In Boston , New York or Chicago , the prize money for winning the marathon can exceed $ 100,000 , and the best runners on earth , men and women , need special consideration .
No one objects to putting them at the front of the pack or giving them a head start .
No truly elite runners
But the Nike marathon in San Francisco does n't have anyone running a world - class time - which would be something around 2 hours and 20 minutes - for the 26.2 - mile course .
Only O'Connell broke 3 hours - and she 'd never done it before .
" I think that 's what it comes down to , " O'Connell said .
" There is not a real definition of what it means to be in an elite field . "
That 's where the Nike event got in trouble .
If it had recognized that there was no need for an elite pack , and everyone had lined up and run , the fastest time would have been the winner .
No argument .
In fact , that was the other part of Nike 's announcement Wednesday .
" Learning from the unique experience in this year 's race , " it said .
" Nike has decided today to eliminate the elite group from future Nike Women 's Marathons .
Next year , all runners will run in the same group , and all will be able to win . "
So nice job , Arien .
All you have to do is run the fastest again next year , and you really will be declared the winner .

In a study that at first glance seems counterintuitive , researchers at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia , reviewed safety studies from 17 countries and 68 cities in California and found that the more people bike in a community , the less they collide with motorists .
" It appears that motorists adjust their behavior in the presence of increasing numbers of people bicycling because they expect or experience more people cycling , " said Julie Hatfield , an injury expert from the university .
With fewer accidents , people perceive cycling as safer , so more people cycle , thus making it even safer , she said .
" Rising cycling rates mean motorists are more likely to be cyclists , and therefore be more conscious of , and sympathetic towards , cyclists , " she said .
Safety experts said the decrease in accidents that comes with an increase in cycling is independent of improvements in cycling - friendly laws and better infrastructure such as bike paths .
The safety studies reviewed were from Australia , Denmark , the Netherlands , 14 other European countries , and 68 cities in California .
Although the review focused on bicycling , it appears that the more is safer rule also applies to pedestrians , Hatfield said .

John Bellamy Foster :
We need to go down to 350 parts per million [ of carbon dioxide ] , which means very big social transformations on a scale that would be considered revolutionary by anybody in society today -- transformation of our whole society quite fundamentally .
We have to aim at that , and we have to demand that of our society .
Forget about capitalism , forget about whether the system can do it .
Do n't let that be your barometer .
Say this is necessary for the planet , for human survival , for justice , for environmental justice , and we just have to do it .
We demand that be done , and we work out the operating system of the world economy , we work out our social relations of production , in accordance with necessity , in accordance with what is necessary for the planet , not in accordance with what is necessary for the accumulation of wealth and profits for a very few .
I think there is no other choice -- any other choice is absolutely irrational .
We 're living in an irrational system -- we can't let that level of irrationality dictate our action .
So , we need to do that , but climate change is n't the whole environmental problem .
There 's species extinction , there 's deforestation , desertification , there are a water crisis and the attempt of capital to privatise water , there are umpteen numbers of problems .
We have to fight on all these fronts .
These are material questions , material in terms of environmental materialism but also in terms of social , historical materialism , and actually all of these problems are going to be connected if we do it right , so that the traditional issues of the working - class are going to conjoin with their materialism , and their attempts to materially transform the world are going to conjoin with any kind of genuine environmentalism that we need .
So there are innumerable ways to struggle .
We simply have to do it on the broadest basis that we can .
And that means starting with the bottom of society , not relying on the elites to solve the problem for us , because capitalism sells people out .
That 's the nature of the system -- it sells out -- that defines it more than anything else .

There are a number of ways to avoid a hangover and safe yourself from the terrible effects it creates to your head and stomach the next morning .
Avoiding hangover has to do with a number of techniques you can follow before and during the period of alcohol consumption .
What is actually a hangover ?
Although there is no clear definition , the hangover is the unpleasant feeling that follows a night of excessive alcohol consumption and includes at least two of the following symptoms : headache , nausea , diarrhoea , gastrointestinal disorders , fatigue .
The mechanism that is causing a hangover is not entirely known , but is considered multi-factor and is not only related to the quantity of alcohol consumed .
Key causes of a hangover are the reduction of glucose in the blood and dehydration , which is a result of the diuretic action of alcohol .
For this reason the hangover is combined with dry mouth and an unpleasant taste in the mouth .
Another important role in the whole process is the consumption of alcohol with an empty stomach , insomnia and performing physical activity during the drunkenness .
Some studies argue that children with alcoholic parents are faced with worse hangover symptoms than children of non-alcoholic parents .
Women must know that they are biologically more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than men .
Therefore , need not be competing in their drinking .
The alcohol is metabolised by the liver .
A bottle of beer or a glass of wine need about an hour .
So we can influence the pace at which the levels of alcohol are increasing in the blood .
25 Ways to avoid Hangover
1 . Before going out make sure that you eat well so your stomach will have a valuable assistant in the absorption of alcohol .
If again you are not at home arrange to eat something before drinking , preferably pizza or pasta .
2. Prior going out you should starting drinking … and when we say drink , we mean anything else than alcohol .
The best choices are lots of water , juices and milk in order to avoid the dehydration caused by alcohol .
3 . Accompany your drinks during the night with food rich in antioxidants .
Perfect examples are fruits , vegetables and salads .
Avoid ready - made food or fatty food .
4 . Do not mix different drinks together .
Experienced drinkers swear to this .
Stick to one type of drink throughout the night .
5 . Make sure that you know what you drink .
Always choose « reliable » bars and take care of the barman not to make any unpleasant mixing .
Better select bottled drinks and try to avoid colourful shots and cocktails .
6 . Drink slowly and not abruptly .
If you drink a lot , within 1 - 2 hours most probably you will end up in trouble .
7 . It is preferable to combine a drink with some fruits or vegetables ( cucumber – carrot ) and not dried nuts .
Dried nuts in large quantities may affect your stomach while fruits and vegetables are much more secured and full of antioxidants .
8. Avoid making demonstrations on the amount of alcohol you can drink .
Nobody can withstand the alcohol more than others .
Some people just have an advantage because of their body weight due to dilution .
9 . Our body in order to function properly it needs oxygen .
That is why we choose places outdoors and at least places with good ventilation .
If we feel that we are starting not feeling well , it ’s better to go outside to get some fresh air .
10 . Soup .
Soup is warm and gentle on the stomach .
Before going to bed it is a good practice to eat a plate of warm soup with small pieces of meat if available .
11 . When you wake up the next morning and feel the terrible headache the first thing to do is eat a good breakfast preferably butter and honey although any breakfast is good .
12 . Open the windows to freshen the room and get some fresh air .
This will oxygenize your body and help your organism and mind to function better .
13 . Take a shower .
A good shower , although it does not treat the symptoms of the hangover helps in revitalizing your body .
Try to use cool water and not hot .
Do not attempt to take a shower if you cannot stand in your feet or if you are still feeling dizzy .
14 . Avoid at all costs drinking coffee .
Coffee will not only exacerbate the headache and stimulate the nervous system but also results in diuresis .
This is bad because alcohol already forced your body in a state of dehydration .
15 .
There is a rumour that the best way to be okay the next morning is to drink the same drink as you did the previous evening .
This is only a rumour and it is not based on real evidence .
Basically what is suggested is to drink an alcohol drink ( only ONE ) when you wake up in the morning .
This is because alcohol raises blood pressure and it will help you feel better .
If you are going to attempt this method avoid carbonated drinks such as champagne and prefer something milder .
16 .
If your headache is very intensive you can take an aspirin .
For sure do not take an aspirin with alcohol and preferably do not take the aspirin as soon as you wake up .
17 . Vitamin B6 helps in the treatment of a hangover .
It is not scientifically proven but vitamins are always good for our body .
Foods rich in vitamin B6 are bananas , peas , chicken , fish and liver
18 . Eat a good lunch even if you are not hungry .
As we have said before , food helps the stomach as it absorbs alcohol and will certainly make you feel much better .
Do not eat large quantities of food and try to avoid food with fat .
19 .
During the night and on the next day avoid fizzy drinks and refreshments .
The carbonate is not good for the stomach and certainly our body and stomach will not appreciate it .
20 .
Avoid taking pills or medicines that are supposed to help you get rid of a hangover .
These kinds of pills are not yet proven scientifically and so it is better to avoid them .
21 . Rest .
The stress of the body in the effort to remove toxins is so great that beyond good food our body also needs a good rest .
22 . Avoid being in place with a lot of noise or loud music .
Give your head and mind a chance to relax and recover .
23 .
There are no magic recipes for the cure of hangover .
Prevent mixing herbs or other substances that someone may suggest to you .
The only herb that can help you is green tea because of the antioxidants it contains .
24 .
The best advice to avoid the hangover is not to drink or not to drink more than you can handle .
Surely with a little alcohol you will have a better mood but the risks of loosing control and ending up with all those terrible hangover symptoms are increased .
Drink responsibly and in moderation .
25 . Finally you must never forget : Drink and Drive do not go together .
Even if you drink with caution , even if you have followed all the instructions to avoid drunkenness , still you should not drive for the sake of your safety and the safety of other ’s around you .
One of our early goals for Google Chrome was to make the browser as fast as we possibly could .
But in addition to raw speed , we wanted it to be highly responsive .
After all , it does n't matter how fast pages can be loaded if the user interface is locked up !
To understand our holistic approach to performance in Google Chrome , it helps to know some background .
Processing speed per dollar has rapidly increased over the last 40 years , but hard drives , which are based on moving parts , do not improve nearly as fast .
As a result , a modern processor can execute millions of instructions in the same time that it takes to read just one byte off disk .
We knew that building a fast , responsive browser for modern systems would require extra attention to disk I /O usage .
Developers are ideal testers for I/O performance since the load of compiling a very large application like Google Chrome will bog down even the most powerful system .
This soon led us to a rule that the main thread of Google Chrome — the thread that runs the entire user interface — is not allowed to do any I/O .
After fixing the obvious cases , we ran a program that thrashes the disk while we profiled common operations in Google Chrome to find latent I /O hotspots .
We even ran a test where we removed the privileges of the main thread to read or write to disk , and made sure that nothing stopped working .
We moved the I/O onto a number of background threads which allow the user - interface to proceed asynchronously .
We did this for large data sources like cookies , bookmarks , and the cache , and also for a myriad of smaller things .
Writing a downloaded file to disk , or getting the icons for files in the download manager ?
The disk operations are being called from a special background thread .
Indexing the contents of pages in history or saving a login password ?
All from background threads .
Even the " Save As " dialog box is run from another thread because it can momentarily hang the application while it populates .
Startup poses a different type of problem .
If all the subsystems simultaneously requested their data on startup , even if it was from different threads , the requests would quickly overwhelm the disk .
As a result , we delay loading as much data as possible for as long as possible , so the most important work can get done first .
Our startup sequence works like this :
First chrome.exe and chrome.dll are loaded .
Then the preferences file is loaded ( it may affect how things proceed ) .
Then we immediately display the main window .
The user now can interact with the UI and feels like Google Chrome has loaded , even though there has been remarkably little work done .
Immediately after showing the window , we create the sub - process for rendering the first tab .
Only once this process has loaded do subsystems like bookmarks proceed , since any I/ O contention would slow down the display of that first tab ( this is why you may see things like your bookmarks appear after a slight delay ) .
The cache , cookies , and the Windows networking libraries are not loaded until even later when the first network request is issued .
We carefully monitor startup performance using an automated test that runs for almost every change to the code .
This test was created very early in the project , when Google Chrome did almost nothing , and we have always followed a very simple rule : this test can never get any slower .
Because it 's much easier to address performance problems as they are created than fixing them later , we are quick to fix or revert any regressions .
As a result , our very large application starts as fast today as the very lightweight application we started out with .
Our work on I/O performance sometimes complicates the code because so many operations have to be designed to be asynchronous : managing requests on different threads with data that comes in at different times is a lot of extra work .
But we think it has been well worth it to help us achieve our goal of making Google Chrome not only the fastest , but the most responsive browser we could build .
Posted by Brett Wilson , Software Engineer
I was whining recently about how my scala - code is java in poor disguise .
I started reading the scala by example pdf that also comes with the scala installation .
I just read some interesting things about lists and pattern - matching that gave me an idea how to “ scalafy ” the following scjava - code :
def importResource ( name : String , resource : Resource ) : Unit = { log. debug ( " importing " + name + " into " + root ) val path = pathOf ( name ) createResource ( path.toList ) ( resource ) } private def createResource ( nodes : List [ String ] ) ( resource : Resource ) = { val directory = nodes.dropRight(1).foldLeft( root ) ( ( directory , name ) => { if( name.equals ( " " ) ) { directory } else { val directory Option : Option [ AbstractDirectory ] = directory.getDirectory( name ) directoryOption.getOrElse({ val subDir = directory.createDirectory ( name ) match { case result : AbstractDirectory => result } directory.add ( subDir ) subDir } ) } } ) directory.createIfNewer(nodes.last , _: Resource ) }
If it ’s not crystal clear to you what the code does .
Here is an overview :
The first method takes a name and a resource
The name is split up into it ’s path - elements
The path is passed to the createResource method that will create all directories that does not yet exist on the way to the resource and finally return a function that takes a resource as input and creates it in the already given directory .
A big issue I have with the code is the createResource - method .
It simply is very hard to name it .
createAllDirectoriesAndReturnResourceCreatingMethod would illustrate better how smelly that method really is .
I have an idea on how to refactor this with scalas pattern matching .
This is the new version ( after some red / green bar cycles ) :
def importResource ( name : String , resource : Resource ) : Unit = { log. debug ( " importing " + name + " into " + root ) val path = pathOf ( name ) createResource ( path.toList , root , resource ) } private def createResource ( nodes : List [ String ] , directory : AbstractDirectory , resource : Resource ) { nodes match { case head :: Nil => directory.createIfNewer( head , resource ) case " " :: tail => createResource ( tail , directory , resource ) case head :: tail => { val subDir = directory.getDirectory ( head ) .getOrElse { val result = directory.createDirectory ( head ) match { case dir : AbstractDirectory => dir } directory .add ( result ) result} createResource ( tail , subDir , resource ) } case nil => } }
The first thing that strikes me about the second version is the unbalance between the different cases .
The head :: tail case is not exactly a one - liner … but it should be .
This smells like feature envy .
We could ask the directory to getOrCreateDirectory and it would read much better .
But that is another refactoring .
First let ’s go through this one :
One thing I did not first get in scala is how you can iterate through lists using pattern - matching .
In order to get how that works it is important to realise one thing about scalas lists :
List ( “ a ” , “ b ” , “ c ” , “ d ” )
is equivalent to
“ a ” ::( “ b ” ::( “ c ” ::( “ d ” ::( Nil ) ) ) )
which due to the right associativityness of :: is equivalent to :
“ a ” :: “ b ” :: “ c ” :: “ d ” :: Nil
Or plain english : Lists are not flat structures , lists are recursive structures .
What that means in practical terms is that given any element in the list it is very easy to split the list at that element into head ( the current element ) and tail ( the rest of the elements .
For instance , given the element “ b ” above , head will be “ b ” and tail will be “ c ” :: “ d ” :: Nil .
Ok , not that hard .
Now to the cool part :
The :: operator is a case class which in short means that it can be used in pattern matching :
“ a ” :: “ b ” :: “ c ” :: Nil match { case h :: t => println ( head + ” -> ” + tail ) ; …}
will assign “ a ” to the variable h and “ b ” :: “ c ” :: nil to the variable t
We can now understand the cases above .
In pseudocode :
private def createResource ( nodes : List [ String ] , directory : AbstractDirectory , resource : Resource ) { nodes match { case head :: Nil => // the last element of the list , create the resource using head as a name case " " :: tail => // special case , an empty directory name .
Skip to the next name : // createResource ( tail , directory , resource ) case head :: tail => // head will be a directory - name that we use to get or create the //nextDirectory that is used with tail to call ourselves recursively : // createResource ( tail , nextDirectory , resource ) case nil => // no more elements to traverse } }
I ’m far from done with the refactoring .
I want to get rid of the special case of “ ” to begin with and as mentioned above remove some feature - envy but I think that the cases are more readable than the original code .
At least in terms of where the problems lie in terms of special cases and bloated cases .
Of course , it ’s just an opinion and I reserve the right to change my mind tomorrow :)
( Natural News ) Actor Dennis Quaid , whose newborn twins were nearly killed when a hospital error led to a massive drug overdose , urged Congress to preserve people 's ability to sue drug companies for injuries caused by their products .
Quaid and his wife are suing Baxter International , maker of the blood - thinning drug heparin , which nearly killed their children .
The lawsuit alleges that Baxter knew that the labels on the child and adult doses of heparin were confusingly similar , as Baxter had already changed its labeling after three infants died from similar mix-ups .
But the company failed to recall the older bottles with the confusing labels , leading to the error with Quaid 's children .
Yet lawsuits such as Quaid 's could be thrown out if the Supreme Court accepts the arguments of the Bush administration and the FDA that citizens should not be able to sue for injuries caused by an FDA - approved drug . "
FDA believes that the important decisions it makes about the safety , efficacy and labeling of medical products should not be second - guessed by state courts , " FDA Deputy Commissioner Randall Lutter said .
The doctrine is called " preemption , " and the high court has already upheld it for makers of medical devices .
In another case pending before the court , the same argument is being made by drug makers .
If the court rules that preemption also applies to drug makers , " one of the most powerful incentives for safety - the threat of liability - would vanish , " said Rep. Henry Waxman , chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Waxman has pledged support for legislation to reverse the Supreme Court 's preemption decision on medical devices .
Quaid urged Congress to do the same for drugs .
" I believe if preemption of lawsuits is allowed to prevail , it will basically make all of us , the public , uninformed and uncompensated lab rats , " Quaid said .

Investors Need Companies to Go Bankrupt 12:43 AM

" Then you will hit bottom and then you start over .
The people who are sound will take over the assets from the people who are n't sound and we will start over .
This is the way the world has worked for a few thousand years . "
The current rescue plans , which will force governments to issue more debt , print money and flood the markets with liquidity , will flare up inflation after the crisis is over and will create worse problems , Rogers warned .
" We 're setting the stage for when we come out of this of a massive inflation holocaust , " he said .
And the plans are unlikely to fend off a severe economic downturn , as the crisis starts affecting all walks of life .
" We had the worst excesses we had in credit markets in world history .
We 're going to have to take some pain , " Rogers said .
" Many people bought 4 - 5 houses with no money down and no job … you think we 'll just say well , that 's too bad , we 'll start over and nobody loses their job ?
Be realistic . "
People should not look to the upcoming G7 meeting with the hope that the leaders of the strongest economies will find a solution .
" What they ( G7 leaders ) need to do is go down the bar and leave the rest of us alone , " Rogers said .
Economies who did not take part in the subprime bonanza are likely to suffer along with Wall Street and the developed economies as the crisis unfolds , he warned .
" What about all the people in countries that minded their manners , saved their money , did n't get overextended and now all of a sudden they 're being asked to bail out a bunch of guys on Wall Street who were incompetent at best and some of them crooks ? "
" I thought it outrageous that anybody has to step in a bail out a bunch of 29 year olds driving Maseratis , " he said .
There are not many safe havens in the volatile markets , he said .
Whenever ice cream sales rise , so do shark attacks .
As more economists are recruited to the Treasury , inflation rises .
In his fifth lesson of a weekly series , author Michael Blastland gives hints about reading too much into " correlated " facts .
Lesson Five : Causation
The story :
The smoking ban in Wales " caused " a 13 % fall in heart attacks from October to December 2007 , compared with the same period in 2006 .
The flaw :
The ban began in April .
So did it also " cause " the rise in heart attacks in the first few months after the ban ?
And presumably it " caused " me to spill my tea .
For that happened during the smoking ban too .
Grand claims for the smoking ban
The lesson :
This is a foolish case of a simple error - the assumption that things happening after an event must be caused by it .
Everyone examines data for evidence that their side is right .
If a statistical morsel seems to our taste , the temptation is to swallow it .
Such zeal produces , in this case , the following logic :
Here 's event A - a smoking ban .
Here 's event B - a selective fall in heart attacks .
Therefore , A caused B .
And if the earlier months for which data is available show an inconvenient rise , the logic presumably staggers on - why , it simply proves that it took a few months for the effect to appear , surely ?
It 's the kind of logic that ought to wilt with embarrassment .
In the event , no one even blushed .
Is it serious ?
Well , it passed for broadsheet news , political and medical establishment opinion .
The problem here is that neither media nor politicians like to acknowledge the power of chance .
The numbers must mean something , they think .
If there was a fall last month , it must mean this .
If a rise , it must be explained by that .
And we can all stretch our imaginations to suggest that explanation , as some readers will be itching to do .
Something must have done it .
Someone deserves credit , or blame .
MISSED PAST LESSONS ?
Lesson One : Our survey says Lesson Two : Myth of counting Lesson Three : Percentages Lesson Four : Averages
But brace yourself for a remarkable fact : numbers go up and down .
Does it need to be said that people in Wales do not have heart attacks with perfect regularity , 180 a day , 7.5 every hour ?
Sometimes the numbers go up , sometimes down .
If you simply take the period , or the place , in which the numbers go the way you want , but disregard the rest , you are likely to read meaning into nothing .
Over the whole period , there seems to have been a fall no faster ( so far ) than the steady falls of previous years .
The ban can't ( yet ) be shown to have had any effect on the fall , or the rise , or my tea .
Junk Rating : Five out of five .
I am a non-smoker and dislike smoky places .
But those preferences can't blind me to the statistical weaknesses of the benefits to my health in this , as in many reports of the effect on heart attacks of smoking bans .
That there will be some benefit with time seems plausible .
That it is as great or quick as claimed does not .
This is one problem with arguments about causality , the belief that any change must have a principal cause , when it may be the result of the many causes that produce nothing more meaningful than random variation .
There 's another variety of the problem , which is to mistake one cause for another .
Take a look at this chart , released last month .
It appears to show that trade unions secure substantially better pay for their members .
One thing leads to another , membership brings more money .
But is it the union what done it ?
Because other things tend to go with union membership too , as the ONS points out .
It seems that being longer in a job , or older , means you are more likely to have joined a union .
But age and experience also often bring seniority .
So these people would earn more on average ( see lesson four ) , whether in the union or not .
Another of what are known as confounding factors is education .
Union members apparently tend to have more formal education .
More education tends to go with higher pay .
So is it the union , or the other things that tend to be true of union members that are the main cause of the pay premium ?
Ice cream sales up , ditto shark attacks
The key is not to stop looking for the cause with the first plausible link you find .
Keep your imagination restless for other causes , or the possibility of chance , and it will serve you well .
So finally , here 's a game based on reading absurd causation into correlated facts .
Let 's call it " dimputations . "
The idea is to find two facts that genuinely do change in tandem , then work out what 's really going on .
Here are a few examples , some new , some old , and all true except for the explanation .
Work out the more likely chain of causation then think of some examples of your own .
Whenever ice cream sales rise , so do shark attacks ( eating ice cream makes you tastier ? )
As more economists are recruited to the Treasury , inflation rises ( economists cause inflation ? )
In Scandinavia , storks appear more often on the rooftops of families with more babies ( storks bring babies ? )
As vocabulary increases in infancy , so does appetite ( words make you hungry ? )
Have fun .
Next week , Lesson Six : Doubt Michael Blastland is the author , with Andrew Dilnot , of The Tiger That Is n't .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Ice cream sales rise in hotter weather , which also forces sharks to get their Aircon serviced .
This is very expensive and angers the shark .
Angry shark equals more attacks .
Instances of drunkenness in those below 18 years of age are significantly lower than for those above .
Clearly children can hold their drink better than adults .
Mortality rates for pedestrians and cyclists are dramatically lower on motorways than on other roads .
We urgently need to introduce a 70 mph blanket speed limit .
Stewart , Basingstoke
Sharks like ice cream but find it really difficult to buy them , so they resort to eating humans in the hope they will still have ice cream inside them .
( Strangely this logic also applies to mosquito bites in summer . )
David , London
One non-causal correlation that my Dad 's fond of : Wearing a cap or hat can make men bald .
If you check , the proportion of men wearing caps / hats who are bald is higher than the proportion of bald men in the population as a whole .
Therefore wearing a cap makes you bald .
MarkUK , Derby I happen to understand the correlation with sharks and ice cream more deeply than most .
Eating ice cream will cause people to urinate a large quantity of lipids ( fats ) similarly to seals and other fatty sea mammals , which happen to be the sharks ' favourite prey .
Bob , London Surely no one could deny that applying for a driving test causes you to have your wisdom teeth out ?
Or is that the other way round ?
Loops , London , UK Economists are sensitive to the earth 's magnetic field .
As inflation rises people require more coins to buy their ice creams .
This additional metal alters the earth 's magnetic field , spooking the economists who retreat to where they feel safe - Treasury .
Storks fear margarine and therefore cluster near the homes of those with small children who will have gone all organic and started buying salt - free natural butter .
As the children grow they can request margarine and ice cream .
This upsets the sharks , storks and economists , who then feed the children burgers to give them heart disease .
All quite logical really .
Phil , Birmingham
It is a well known and established fact that the ice cream market is more ruthless than the oil and sugar market .
Obviously Walls and Nestle train sharks to attack anyone who is eating rival products .
So when your walking down London on a sunny afternoon eating your Calypso , look out for bodies of water ( lake , pond , puddle , glass of water , etc ... ) because a Nestle shark might come and rip your arm off .
Dino Costa , London Perhaps when there is a horrible shark attack on the beach , people stay out of the water and have an ice cream instead .
The moral is , if there 's a big queue for Mister Whippy , stay out the water .
David Routledge , Derby , UK Clearly the author does not realise that it is easier to swim away from a shark if you are not trying to hold on to an ice cream .
The Late KingZog Speaking of storks - the decline of storks in Denmark in the 1970s followed the same trend as the Danish birth rate .
Fewer storks + fewer babies = ergo storks really do bring babies .
HH , Scotland Ice cream sales rise in hot weather , people go to the beach in hot weather , there are sharks at the beach , people steal the sharks ' deckchairs , the sharks attack them .
The hiring of economists is carried out according to a master plan that links the recruitment rate to inflation .
Storks have a higher concentration in regions of Scandinavia with higher human birth rate , both species benefitting from a natural abundance of food .
Or people notice storks more when there has been or will be a birth .
Development of language skills happens at the same time as the growth of the infant , this is clearly because the more you need to eat , the more ways you need to describe the food you want .
Key Mika , London
Talking of causality , I had a colleague at an old job who'd rant about the government allowing late Easters because , in his eyes , late Easters always caused long , cold winters and it was the timing of Easter that would control the weather in this respect .
Greg , London Storks prey on the lesser know nappy mite , meaning a higher number of storks on rooftops of those with children ...
Vicky , London
The ice cream / shark attack one is easy : the cause for both is obviously hotter weather - more people in the sear , the sea 's warmer , the sharks come in closer to shore ; hotter weather also means more people buy ice cream .
Rob , London , UK
Those claiming the ice cream / shark attack connection is validated by hotter weather have missed the point - which is the attempt by some to establish a DIRECT connection between the two .
That is to say , there is no evidence that people buying more ice cream brings sharks storming into shallower waters ready to bite unsuspecting bathers .
If , for example , there was evidence showing sharks were attracted to chemical preservatives in ice cream , this might stand up - but there is n't .
The fact that hot weather means that more ice creams are bought , and that hot weather encourages more people to swim and ergo gives sharks more people to bite , does not mean hot weather connects these two things in any way .
It 's clearly people who think like this that are responsible for such faulty logic in the first place .
Lorelei Lee , Leeds
In Scandinavia , storks appear more often on the rooftops of families with more babies .
More babies ==> bigger roofs == > more storks .
JM , Ormskirk Warmer weather brings people to beaches , people buy ice cream at beach , sharks see ice cream , sharks become jealous .
The sharks want the ice cream , and attack people to get it .
The sharks will stop at nothing for a 99 with a flake .

" We just want to make people happy for five minutes , " says Ben Huh , CEO of Pet Holdings Inc. , which runs a network of humor sites including I Can Has Cheezburger , wearing a cheeseburger hat during a video interview .
Traffic on the Cheezburger site has skyrocketed in the past year from a half - million page views a day to 4.6 million a day , Huh says .
The site was so popular that it just released an I Can Has Cheezburger book , which is currently the No. 1 selling cat and dog humor book on Amazon .
Huh 's entire network of sites gets 6.3 million users a month and 128 million page views a month .
Hard times may be a contributing factor to the growth , he says .
Huh adds : " We take no joy in seeing people suffer , even if we help them get out of it .

An Example of Economics at Work
I ’ve stayed out of politics this fall , but a comment on Obama ‘s new economic proposals is a good teaching device .
He has proposed an income - tax credit of $ 3,000 for each new job above a company ’s current employment level in the next two years .
We did something very similar in 1977 , the New Jobs Tax Credit ( N.J.T.C. ) , and it illustrates economics at work .
Unlike inefficient subsidies that provide funds for an activity that would have been undertaken anyway , this kind of marginal tax credit only subsidizes new activity .
The benefit per dollar of credit is greater with this approach ; it is more target - effective .
Indeed , a number of studies evaluating the old N.J.T.C. suggested it had substantial effects in stimulating employment .
Moreover , the jobs created especially benefited low - wage workers : not surprisingly , since the cap on the credit per worker made it a more attractive percentage subsidy for hiring lower - skilled , lower - wage workers .
Theoretical work suggests it is especially likely to be successful in an economy that is sliding further away from full employment , as we now are .

A man pretending to be a United War employee gained entry to an apartment on Cator Avenue in Jersey City this afternoon and then stole $ 3,650 from the 91 - year - old resident , reports said .
Responding to a knock on her front door around 2 p.m. , the female resident told police she found a man who told her he was an employee with the water company and that " there was an emergency " and " he had to check the water , " reports said .
The man first opened and shut a faucet in the kitchen and then went into the victim 's bathroom where he flushed the toilet , reports said .
The man then instructed the victim to " hold down the flush handle or else the house will explode , " reports said .
The victim , who said the man was speaking to someone on his cellphone the entire time he was in her house , did as she was told , reports said .
But after about two minutes , the victim told police " I did n't care if the house exploded " and walked into her living - room , at which time she discovered her house had been ransacked , reports said .
The man -- described as white , slender , and in his 40s -- got away with $ 3,650 in cash the victim kept in a metal box , reports said .

WASHINGTON  Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has raised more than $ 8 million for former rival Barack Obama 's presidential campaign since July and plans to barnstorm the country for even more cash , as the New York senator works to show she is aggressively helping the candidate who cut short her White House bid .
" I am using every tool that I have to help Democrats win , " Clinton told USA TODAY .
She was between fundraising events in Texas and California that brought in another $ 1.5 million for Obama and congressional candidates on Friday and Saturday .
Later this month , Clinton will headline Obama fundraisers in Chicago , Philadelphia and Little Rock along with 11 events to raise money for Democratic congressional candidates and state parties .
She is stepping up efforts to get more Democratic women elected to the Senate .
On Friday , she issued an e-mail fundraising appeal for Louisiana incumbent Mary Landrieu and challengers Kay Hagan , who is locked in a tight battle against Republican Sen.
Elizabeth Dole in North Carolina , and former New Hampshire governor Jeanne Shaheen , who is engaged in a repeat of her close 2002 race with GOP Sen .
John Sununu .
The former first lady said in the interview late Friday that her goal is straightforward : " We have a lot to repair in America , and I believe that Democratic leadership is essential to fixing the damage that we are going to inherit . "
Clinton , who came closer to claiming a major party 's presidential nomination than any woman before her , declined to discuss whether another White House race was in her future .
" I 'm looking forward to going to the White House someday and standing there when President Obama signs a bill guaranteeing quality , affordable health care for every American , " she said , citing an issue that was a signature of her campaign .
Democratic strategist Tad Devine said Clinton 's stature will grow in the Senate no matter the outcome on Election Day because she garnered about 18 million votes in her presidential bid .
Clinton stands to become " the most important woman in American politics " if Democrats win on Nov. 4 , he said .
Helping to raise the money to aid Obama and increase Democratic majorities in Congress only enhances that standing , Devine added , because " delivering resources to campaigns is probably the single - most important and difficult thing you can do in politics . "
Clinton has hit 40 campaign events for Obama in battleground states from New Hampshire to Nevada in the past two months .
Her husband campaigned in Florida last week .
" Both Bill and I are doing all we can to reach the people who are not already convinced , " Clinton said .
The Clintons ' efforts come amid lingering signs of unrest among her still - loyal supporters .
One top Clinton fundraiser , investment executive Lynn Forester de Rothschild , announced last month she was supporting Republican nominee John McCain .
She called Obama and other top Democrats in Congress " too far to the left . "
Clinton rejected the idea of further defections from her camp .
" The vast majority of people who voted for me will vote for Sen. Obama , " she said .
" They understand that … we desperately need a Democratic administration to take the reins of the economy and turn it around . "
Alexander Heckler , a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who raised more than $ 100,000 for Clinton , said talk of dissension between the Clinton and Obama fundraising camps is overrated .
He said he contributed $ 2,300 to Obama at a Sept. 19 fundraiser in Miami and has committed to raising at least $ 250,000 for the Illinois senator at Clinton 's urging .
" We are all very united , " he said .
Clinton still owed about $ 9 million to her campaign vendors at the end of August , despite Obama 's appeal to his top fundraisers to help retire the debt .
She vowed to work to repay the vendors , but insisted her priority is her party .
" With a month to go until Election Day , " she said , " our energies have to be focused on persuading people to support Democrats . "

Thanks to the glory of the internets , Far Cry 2 footage is hitting us early !

Apple Inc. is fed up with a small Florida - based firm that has been selling its own brand of computers running hacked versions of the Mac OS X operating system and has finally slapped the company with a lawsuit .
The Mac maker filed a formal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on July 3rd , just one day after Psystar began distributing a modified version of the Mac OS X 10.5.4 Leopard update to customers who had previously purchased one of its unauthorized Mac systems .
While details of the suit are unclear at this time , AppleInsider has learned that Apple and its counsel at Townsend and Townsend and Crew LLP filed the suit on grounds of copyright infringement .
In April , Psystar made headlines when it announced a $ 400 desktop dubbed OpenMac ( later renamed Open Computer ) which was described as " a low - cost high - performance computing platform " based on the ongoing OSX86 Project — a hacker - based initiative aimed at maintaining a version of the Mac OS X operating system for everyday PCs .
A representative for the company , identified only as Robert , would later go on record and challenge Apple to bring formal charges against his firm , arguing that the Mac OS X end - user license agreement , which prohibits third - party installations of Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware , stands in violation of antitrust laws .
" What if Microsoft said you could only install Windows on Dell computers ? , " he said .
" What if Honda said that , after you buy their car , you could only drive it on the roads they said you could ? "
With Apple remaining largely silent on the matter , Psystar last month continued to taunt the Mac maker by aggressively staking its claim as the lone company outside of Apple selling Mac OS X systems , unveiling a pair of Xserve - like rackmount computers unofficially based on Mac OS X Leopard Server .
In the days after my last column , " How to be a feminist without anyone knowing " appeared , I experienced dozens of pleasant surprises : I had no idea that Princeton was teeming with feminists , some of them keeping their feminism secret and some of them boldly using the f-word .
I was so proud of you , ladies .
But then I received several rather testy e-mails from men who felt left out of my abridged guide to feminism , which , I admit , was mostly aimed at Princeton women .
" Ca n't men be feminists too ? " they asked .
" Why are you only writing about what women can do to be feminists ?
What about us ? "
And boy , was I proud of those boys .
You may be surprised to hear that men can be feminists too .
I apologize if I did n't make that clear in my first column , but I did only have 800 words for a manifesto , guys .
As I sat rereading my words the night before the paper came out , I was terrified at how my fellow female students might receive it .
I admit that I barely paused to consider how the guys might react .
I 'm sorry if you felt left out of my column , boys .
The good news is , you do n't need to feel left out of feminism .
Let 's get this straight : Men can be feminists too .
It 's rare to find a man who identifies as one - it's not exactly something you hear guys slip into conversations about March Madness or Catherine Zeta -Jones .
But I have a sneaking suspicion that there are a few more of you out there beyond the men who e-mailed me , secret male feminists who , like the women of Princeton , will surprise me with your willingness to at least start thinking like feminists , if not to openly identify as such .
What does it mean for a man to be a feminist ?
In my last column , I advised women to value real women - intelligent , talented women who make genuine contributions to society .
When it comes to men , I challenge you to do more : not only value real women but also know how to spot fake ones .
By that I mean , next time you turn on the TV or watch porn - yes , I acknowledge that you watch porn , and I 'm cool with it ( with a few conditions ) - I encourage you to think twice about the implications of what you 're watching .
Here are my conditions .
Think hard about the women you 're watching .
Then think about the real women in your life - your mother , sisters and friends ( perhaps not in the same context ) - and realize , as you might have already , that there 's almost no resemblance between what you see on the screen and what you see in real life .
Learn to recognize an airbrushed photo when you see one .
Realize that makeup works miracles and that tans - not to mention breasts - can be faked .
Realize that real women have freckles , lumps , bumps , wrinkles , crooked teeth and , if they 're anything like me and my friends , they 've probably spent a huge amount of time , energy and money trying to conceal , disguise and straighten out all those " flaws . "
You might wonder why we 've invested so much in trying to hide what sets us apart from every other woman , what makes us quirky and special , and the answer is as obvious as the plotline of that porno you 're watching :
We do n't look anything like those women on the screen .
For years , we 've been told that to be worth looking at , we need to fit into a very narrow vision of beauty .
That vision usually does n't include freckles , wrinkles , plump flesh or frizzy hair .
For want of any other vision , we spend our lives comparing ourselves to the women you 're looking at - the actresses , models and porn stars .
Those women are interchangeable , plastic , fake and two - dimensional .
I 'm not saying you have to give up porn and I 'm not demanding that you shut yourself away in a dark room where popular culture can't get to you .
I 'm saying that for men interested in feminism , the first step is to become a smart consumer and learn to recognize a fake when you see it .
The second step is not to let the fakes affect the expectations you have of the wonderful real women in your life .
Do n't be disappointed when the girls around you do n't look like Jessica Alba .
Like you , we all have " flaws " that prevent us from duplicating what we see on the screen .
Like you , we are n't airbrushed to within an inch of our lives .
Like you , we expect that the people we associate with will be smart enough to value us for our minds rather than for our bodies .
The real women of Princeton - the freckled , wrinkled , wonderful women - demand real men .
Men of Princeton :
Your response to my last column gave me enormous hope .
My hope is that you 're man enough to be feminists .

Why ca n't John McCain and Sarah Palin make the points about how the crisis was built illustrated in the " Burning Down the House " ( with the revised music ) YouTube video ?
Could McCain please , please bring up some of this in Tuesday 's debate ?
Do n't the American people deserve to know that Democrat Barney Frank , then ranking member and now chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said , " I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation towards subsidized housing " ?
Is n't the fact that the ranking Democrat in charge of oversight of Fannie Mae was in a sexual relationship with a high - ranking Fannie Mae executive a glaring conflict of interest ?
Is n't it worth noting that Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters insisted , " we do not have a crisis at Freddie Mac , and in particular at Fannie Mae , under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Frank Raines " ?
Should n't the American people know that Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks insist that " there 's been nothing that was indicated that 's wrong with Fannie Mae " ?
If nothing else , should n't we salute Democratic Rep. Artur Davis for saying , " Like a lot of my Democratic colleagues I was too slow to appreciate the recklessness of Fannie and Freddie .
I defended their efforts to encourage affordable homeownership when in retrospect I should have heeded the concerns raised by their regulator in 2004 .
Frankly , I wish my Democratic colleagues would admit when it comes to Fannie and Freddie , we were wrong . "
A list of ingredients found by chemical analysis that have been used to cut street heroin sold in New York City from 1991 to 1996 .
As reported in a 2000 review paper on trends in NYC heroin adulterants :
Acetaminophen ( Analgesic )
Aminopyrine ( Anti-inflammatory )
Amitryptaline ( Anti-depressant )
Antipyrine ( Body water measurement )
Benzoczine ( Anesthetic )
Caffeine ( Stimulant )
Cocaine ( Stimulant )
d - metamphetamine ( Stimulant )
Diphenhydramine ( Anti-histamine )
Doxepin ( Anesthetic )
Ephedrine ( Stimulant )
Lidocaine ( Anesthetic )
Hydroxyzine ( Anxiety medication )
Methylparben ( Chemical preservative )
Methocarbamol ( Muscle relaxant )
Nabumetone ( Arthritis treatment )
Nicotinamide ( Coenzyme )
Phenylbutazone ( Anti-inflammant )
Phenylpropanlamine ( Dexatrim / caffeine )
Potassiumchloride ( Potassium supplement
Rocaine ( Local anesthetic )
Propoxyphene ( Analgesic – Darvon )
Sodium Bicarbonate ( Acid indigestion )
Quinine ( Malaria treatment )
Theophylline ( Bronchial dialator )
Thiamine ( Dietary supplement )
Thiopental ( Barbiturate )
Thioridazine ( Nausea medication )
Tripolidine ( Allergy medication )
Disodium ethylenediame tetraacetic ( Chelating agent for metals )
The study notes that the most common non-dope ingredients in street heroin are lactose , milk sugar , sucrose , cellulose , mannitol and other inert ingredients , but there is an increasing trend for heroin to contain psychoactive chemicals or additional substances to alter its effect through changing how it is absorbed into the body .
Interestingly , the paper also notes that professional heroin cutters are expensive , charging up to $ 20,000 for a kilo of heroin .
This is likely due to the skill and knowledge needed to select ingredients that will have certain effects , which can be different for ‘ smokers ’ , ‘ snorters ’ and ‘ injectors ’ .
Ingredients that affect the vaporisation point of heroin will be more important for smokers , while adulterants that increase absorption through the nasal passages will obviously be more important for snorters .
For injectors , cutters need to be able to select ingredients that are n’t going to gum up needles or cause too much damage to the users ’ veins .
Additionally , some ingredients are added purely for their psychoactive effect to give a different experience and ‘ brand ’ the dope .
However , owing to the cost of a professional cutter , some dealers just cut it themselves with whatever they think is reasonable , meaning all kinds of potentially fatal ingredients end up in the average bag of smack .

According to a new report from the Kuala Lumpur - based International Maritime Bureau , which tracks piracy on the high seas , instances of piracy this year are on par with the last — 199 worldwide between January and September 2008 versus 198 during the same period last year .
But bucking the trend are the waters off the coast of Somalia , where attacks have grown 75 percent , numbering 63 since last January , almost a third of the world total .
IMB Director Pottengal Mukandan characterized Somalia ’s piracy epidemic as “ unprecedented ” and said “ it is clear that pirates in the Gulf of Aden believe that they can operate with impunity in attacking vessels . ”
Indeed , men in speedboats armed with AK - 47s and RPGs have raked in some $ 30 million ransom so far this year , seizing over 30 merchant ships , including the MV Faina , a Ukrainian vessel carrying 33 T - 72 battle tanks , allegedly bound for the government of South Sudan .
This week NATO dispatched two destroyers and five frigates to the area .
They will join U.S. and French vessels already there .
Russia has reportedly also sent at least one warship .
The rules of engagement are yet to be worked out , but military commanders have already acknowledged the difficulty in fighting piracy , as attackers are virtually indistinguishable from commercial fisherman until they pull out their weapons and mount an attack .
Besides that , the sheer number of ships transiting the Gulf of Aden — 20,000 each year — makes it virtually impossible to protect them all .
Think piracy in a far - off part of the world wo n’t affect you ?
Wrong … especially if you live in Europe .
The International Chamber of Shipping has reported that two shipping firms have granted permission for their captains to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa , thereby avoiding pirate - infested waters off Somalia , but tacking on up to three weeks to delivery times .
Other shipping companies are expected to follow suit .
The result ?
Santa may not be able to deliver this year .
According to an ICS spokesman , “ Car carriers with vehicles for the UK , foodstuffs from Asia , textiles and clothing , dare I say it in time for Christmas market , will not be arriving on time if they have to [ go round South Africa ] .
We could begin to see shortages within the next few weeks . ”
Bah , humbug .

Chances are that if you 've even stepped near a health foods store in the past few months , you 've heard tales of an amazing imported fruit claimed to be one of the greatest super - foods of our time ; the Brazilian Acai / Açaí ( ah - sigh - ee ) berry .
Rich in antioxidants and packed full of health benefits , the tiny berry sparked an obsession in the health food world , even without significant laboratory testing .

The Acai is the size of a blueberry but contains twice the antioxidants of its cousin and 10 times more than red grapes - 10 to 30 times the anthocyanins of red wine .
According to Amherst College 's Acai Report 2005 , Acai berries contain ( but are not limited to ) : Antioxidants , Omega fats 3,6 , and 9 , Amino Acids , Proteins , Xanthones , Anthocyanins , Dietary fiber , Essential minerals - iron , potassium , phosphorus calcium , and phyonutrients .
The claimed benefits are :
- Increased Energy
- Resistance to colds / flu
- Healthy and more youthful skin
- improved eye sight
- improved circulation
- prevention of degenerate diseases
- slowing of the aging process
- promotion of weight loss
" A lot of claims are being made , but most of them have n’t been tested scientifically , " Said Dr. Susanne Talcott , a researcher at Texas A&M University 's nutrition and food science department .
With husband Stephen Talcott , a University of Florida professor , she has been documenting the health effects of the acai berry .
" We are just beginning to understand the complexity of the acai berry and its health - promoting effects . "
The team began studying the palm berry in 2001 , published a report in 2004 , and are still influential in the research of acai berries .
The team evaluated the berry with regard to its antioxidant and nutritional values in both pulp and juice form .
They concluded that the berry did indeed contain vast amounts of antioxidants but , as Dr. Susanne Talcott explains , " no one had really tested to see if acai antioxidants are absorbed in humans . "
With that , the researchers then decided to find out whether the beneficial elements of the berry were actually being absorbed into the human body or if they were being eliminated from the body as waste .

Susanne Talcott conducted the first test on humans concerning the body 's ability to absorb the acai 's pulp and juice .
The study consisted of 12 volunteers who were asked to consume a single serving of either the acai juice or its pulp .
Urine samples of the testers were studied , and showed significant increases in antioxidant activity in the blood .
Voila !
Susanne Talcott proved that the super antioxidants from the berry are absorbed and contribute to the health of a human body .
Later studies showed another interesting effect of the berries : they show activity against cancer cell development .
Professor Stephen Talcott found that the antioxidant rich acai berry destroyed cultured human cancer cells .
His findings , published in the 2006 Journal of Agricultural Food and Chemistry , showed up to 86 percent of leukemia cells tested responded to the berry with self - destruction .
The study extracted six chemicals made from the acai fruit and pulp and made them into concentrations to be tested .
When the samples were applied to leukemia cells for 24 hours , between 35 percent and 86 percent of the cells had died .
" This was only a cell - culture model and we do n’t want to give anyone false hope , " Talcott warns .
" We are encouraged by the findings , however .
Compounds that show good activity against cancer cells in a model system are most likely to have beneficial effects in our bodies . "
Researchers " need to determine potential disease - fighting health benefits , so we can make intelligent recommendations on how much acai should be consumed , " says Talcott , and his team hopes to lead with more findings .
" Our concern has been that it is sold as a super food – and it definitely has some good attributes – but it is not a solution to all diseases , " she said .
" There are a great number of foods on the market , and this could just be part of a well - balanced diet . "

So while this exotic little berry might not be the " cure - all " it 's hyped up to be , it still holds amazing benefits for the human body and , if consumed , may make you feel better both inside and out .
Resorting to credit has long been the American solution for dealing with expensive crises  as long as the solution has wide public support .
Fighting World War II certainly had that support .
Even now many Americans tolerate running up the deficit to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , which cost $ 11 billion a month combined .
And so far there is wide support for an initial outlay of at least $ 250 billion for a rescue of the financial system , if that will stabilize banks and prevent a calamitous recession .

“ There are extreme circumstances when a larger national debt is accepted as the lesser of two evils , ” said Robert J. Barbera , chief economist at the Investment Technology Group , a research and trading firm .
There are also assumptions that help to make America ’s deficits tolerable , even logical .
One is that people all over the world are willing , even eager , to lend to the United States , confident that the world ’s most powerful nation will always repay on time , whatever its current difficulties .
“ So far the market is showing that it is quite willing to finance our needs , ” said Stephen S. McMillin , deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget .
Lenders are accepting interest rates of 4 percent or less , often much less , to buy what they consider super - safe American debt in the form of Treasury securities .
The 4 percent rate means that the annual cost of borrowing an extra $ 1 trillion is $ 40 billion , a modest sum in a nearly $ 14 trillion economy , helping to explain why the current growing deficit has encountered little political resistance so far .
But if recent history repeats itself , the deficit is likely to be an issue again when the economy recovers .

The cognitive dissonance involved in being Bill O'Reilly is truly stunning .
Take , for example , the latest edition of his Talking Points Memo , in which he castigates Obama for saying that he would give an $ 1000 energy rebate check to American families derived from windfall profit taxes of the oil companies .
Oh noes !
Obama is talking about taxes , that liberal !
Does n't he realize that we have a HUGE deficit ???
That we can't afford to keep spending money frivolously ?
Of course the fact that Billo's been cheerleading and apologizing for this deficit every dime along the way is conveniently swept under the rug .
Because damnit , we 're on the edge of a collapse !
We can't tax oil companies , silly Obama .
Bill 's solution : ask the oil companies to volunteer 2 % of their record - breaking profits .
That 's fair , and since it 's voluntary , we do n't have to use the dreaded T - word .
Of course , when Billo sent his minions to approach the oil companies , they were less than receptive .
Quelle surprise !
But it 's unacceptable to think that Americans will go cold this winter , and since the oil companies so far are not interested in helping their fellow Americans ( a surprisingly * gasp * socialist notion coming from O'Reilly ) , so what 's a presidential candidate to do ?
Maybe not giving them tax breaks would be a good first start , right , Bill ?
Full and ridiculously circular logic of the transcripts available below the fold
Should the oil companies help out the folks ?
That is the subject of this evening ’s Talking Points Memo .
Understanding that many Americans are furious with the oil companies , Barack Obama is trying to tie John McCain in with them and putting forth this :
OBAMA : I believe we should give every working family in America a $ 1,000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profits the oil companies are making right now .
Taxing windfall profits , how exactly would that work ?
Would that be constitutional , selecting a single industry for advance taxation ?
That ’s not going to get done , for a variety of reasons .
Also giving the folks another rebate is a bad idea .
The government must get out of the giveaway business , this country is now running a half - trillion dollar deficit .
All together , we owe about ten trillion dollars .
That ’s why the U.S. dollar is a disaster .
If the USA continues to spend more than it takes in , we will have a complete economic collapse .
Does Obama or McCain want to be the next Herbert Hoover ?
If so , continue to run up those deficits .
The United States simply must stop its massive spending , must begin to balance the budget and must return to the value of the US Dollar to its once elite status .
We ’re all in big trouble if that does n’t happen .
But — and this is an important but – many Americans are getting hammered by energy prices .
Some will have trouble heating their homes next winter .
That is completely unacceptable .
So here is my proposal : I am asking the five major American oil companies , Chevron , Occidental , Conoco Phillips , Exxon Mobil and Hess , to donate 2 % of their profits for the last four quarters to a fund that would help struggling Americans pay their heating bills .
That way , the oil companies could pay back their country .
A nation that has allowed them to prosper more than any other concern in the history of civilization .
A 2 % charitable disbursement would alleviate the suffering of tens of millions of Americans and not hurt the oil companies much at all .
Last year , they made a combined $ 80 billion in profit , a record amount for any industry at any time .
Now we contacted the five big oil corporations and to say the response to my idea was lukewarm is to be kind .
Exxon and Chevron pointed out they pay huge amount of taxes to the government , which is true .
But what about directly helping those in need ?
Not much enthusiasm so far .
If just one of the oil companies would establish such a charitable fund , the goodwill that corporation would receive would more than make up for the money spent , as millions of Americans would buy that company ’s oil over the others .
So we encourage the oil companies to directly help out their fellow Americans who are struggling .
No one – no one -- in this country should be cold this winter .
But it is going to happen .
GM asks FAA to block public from viewing movements of corporate jet John Byrne
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008
Print This Email This General Motors , under fire for flying its chief executive to Washington for hearings on an auto bailout on its corporate jet , has asked the FAA to block the public from being able to track its plane .
 We availed ourselves of the option as others do to have the aircraft removed ,  a GM spokesman told Bloomberg News .
Flightaware.com , a website that tracks plane movements , has previously revealed information about the movement of GM 's leased Gulfstream Aerospace G - IV jet .
Its last flight shown was for its trip Nov. 18 from Detroit to Washington , where GM CEO Rick Wagoner spoke to a Senate and House panel on a $ 25 billion emergency loan plan for the US auto industry .
At the House hearing , New York Democrat Gary Ackerman berated Wagoner for taking the jet .
" Could n't you all have downgraded to first class ? " Ackerman asked .
GM 's Gulfstream jet is leased from General Electric Capital , a report said .
FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown told Bloomberg she could n't say whether the agency had complied with GM 's request , but said " We do this routinely " for jet owners and that the company did n't " have to have a reason " for requesting a tracking blackout .
GM also said it had seven planes of its own , and that two are for sale , and an additional two are being listed for sale .
The leased jet which carried Wagoner to Washington has made ten trips to D.C. this year , three of them since October .

We can get complex about this if you want ( no , thank you ) , but what happened to the global economy is disarmingly simple :
Free money makes you stupid .
It was true in Japan during the 1980s , when bar drinks featuring ice from glaciers were going for $ 250 per .
It was true in Mexico in the early nineties , when you could get kidnapped and still turn a profit .
And it was true in the late nineties in the United States , when Internet companies were so prosperous , they destroyed the concept of wearing a suit and tie to work .
You can see where that got us .
But the free - money - will - make - you - stupid doctrine became systemic to the global economy only after the dot - commers had hocked their last foosball table .
The last six years have been a stunning collision of greed , technological advance , and free - market fundamentalism that produced an economic supercollider .
There 's nothing new about greed -- when Chuck Prince , who then headed Citigroup , said in 2007 , " As long as the music is playing , you 've got to get up and dance , " he was just saying what every person who had any access to capital was thinking -- but technology comes in waves , and it made this intersection of tech and the free market particularly toxic .
From time immemorial , we 've had a financial system run mainly by men in their fifties and sixties that worked like this :
Banks made money by loaning capital and making deals and taking the risk that they would not be paid back or that the deal would fall apart .
That was simple enough .
But then along came the math geeks who convinced many of us that instead of making loans and taking risk , we could make loans , " securitize " them , and then sell those securities to idiots in Europe and China .
When the old guys asked how that would work , they were shown sheets of paper with equations on them , and instead of saying , " I do n't understand one damn thing on this page , " they said , " So you 're sure it 'll work ? "
That opened the door to an entirely new concept for banking :
Let 's make loans to deadbeats and sell them off in " tranches " to idiots in Europe who do n't even know what a " tranche " is but like the idea that the S&P rates them highly and that they can make 6 percent a year on one with no risk .
( Come here , little kitty . )
As long as everyone looked the other way and stock prices kept rising , there was no pressure to do anything differently .
Once the house of cards collapsed , all they were going to have to do was claim to have been blinded by science and point to the nerds who designed the strategy .
( Which is exactly where Congress 's investigation is heading . )
It 's popular to blame Bush ( it 's actually just plain fun , but it 's getting a little old ) for the lack of regulation that allowed this circus to develop .
But it was n't Bush .
The French did it , the Brits did it , the Russkies did it , too .
And so on .
Two - bedroom apartments in Mumbai were going for more than $ 3 million .
Let me repeat : Mumbai .
The only people who did n't get sucked into this morass were the Japanese ( who now , once again , have all the money in the world ) , but that 's only because the bubble did n't last long enough to suck them in .
This was a global frenzy of financial - market freedom that we all participated in .
Try to find someone outside of Al Qaeda who complained about the game we were playing .
The odd thing now is that people are trying to pretend everything 's okay .
It 's like those idiots who stay on barrier islands when a hurricane hits .
They get to the eye of the storm and say " cool , " only to get swept away as the back side of the storm barrels through .
It will be a generation before we return to anything like the giddiness of the last ten years .
The boomers , a generation averse to saving , are exiting the consumption equation , and that , along with the end of the fantasy that borrowing eighteen times your annual income is a good idea , means growth will slow to a crawl .
You want the perfect indicator of this ?
Illegal immigration has plummeted recently .
That 's a very sensitive leading indicator because -- whatever you may think -- illegal immigrants risk everything to come here , and if they 're less willing to do it now , it 's because they are hearing from the bottom level of our economic pyramid that things suck and are unlikely to get any better .
Taking them out of the equation means less demand for housing , cars , and everything else .
We are not going into a new Great Depression .
Central banks , finance ministries , etc. have acted with remarkable speed to counter the financial crisis .
As a result , the recession -- which is just starting -- is going to be just as long and painful as recessions normally are .
The fantasy of global free - market capitalism is over .
Countries will revert to their historic behaviors : The U. S. will sell off its publicly held assets as soon as feasible ( which may be a decade , but still ) .
The Europeans will use it as a reason to go back to communalism , and the North Koreans will use it as a reason to test nuclear warheads over the Sea of Japan , no matter what they tell Condi Rice .
U. S. authorities are going to have a hell of a time balancing the absolute ocean of money they 've created with the fact that slow growth is going to be with us for a while .
This is how inflation happens .
Finally , we will re-create an entirely new banking system under the ruins of the current behemoths .
Thousands of smaller banks will rise to fill the demand for loans , but they will be prudent and do silly things like demand you have an income and an ability to pay back the loan .
People will have to live on their incomes , and that will slow growth but make us a sounder economy .
These smaller banks will be rooted in communities they know .
Ten years from now , the American financial sector will look like it did thirty years ago -- all those little banks will do what banks used to do : lend money to people who both need it and can afford to pay it back .
Imagine that .

But you know what , the managers will still get paid their management fee .
NYPost : Hedge funds are once again on track to post their worst monthly return in at least a decade - and the bloodshed this time may exceed the record set 10 years ago .
As of last week , the average hedge fund was down 8.4 percent for Oct. , according to research firm Hedge Fund Research .
That 's neck - and - neck with the worst performance for hedge funds ever recorded : A decline of 8.7 percent in August 1998 .
The mounting losses are hurting even the biggest names in the business - testing the long - held theory that the large , institutional guys are better insulated than everyone else .
JPMorgan Asset Management , which has long reigned as the nation 's largest hedge fund , lost $ 7 billion in assets since the start of July , bringing its new total to $ 41 billion .
Bridgewater Associates , the nation 's second - largest hedge fund , saw assets drop to $ 38 billion from $ 43.5 billion , even as its flagship fund posted returns of about 10 percent , The Post has learned .
For the year , hedge funds are down more than 19 percent , according to data obtained by The Post .
Although the cost of the inaugural is as yet unclear , Linda Douglass , a spokeswoman for the committee , said Mr. Obama expected to incur expenses that past presidents had not , because he wanted to make as many events as possible accessible to the public .

A far bigger crowd is expected at the inauguration of Barack Obama , whose planners on Tuesday announced restrictions on donors .

“ We ’re going to explore all kinds of creative ways to open this up to the public , everything from the swearing - in to the events , ” Ms. Douglass said , adding that the celebration would include activities elsewhere in the country .
“ This inauguration is more than just a celebration of an election , ” she said .
“ This is an event that can be used to inspire and galvanize the public to act .
That is what we ’re aiming for . ”
The committee is also working with federal officials to open to those attending the inauguration as much as possible of the Mall , which stretches two miles from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial .
The section east of the Washington Monument has traditionally been used as a staging area for marching bands and others who participate in the inaugural parade , but they may be moved elsewhere this time to accommodate the crowds , most of whom will have to view the swearing - in ceremony and the parade on JumboTron screens .
In modern times , inaugurations have been financed by a combination of public and private money .
Most recently , in 2005 , Mr. Bush spent a record $ 42.3 million on his inaugural events , most of it collected from corporations and executives .
That money was directed mostly toward festivities , including fireworks , inaugural balls , the parade and a concert on the Mall .
But the federal and District of Columbia governments also spent a combined $ 115.5 million , most of it for security , the swearing - in ceremony and cleanup ; the biggest expense by far , $ 84 million , was to compensate federal workers for the holiday .
In barring lobbyists from contributing , Mr. Obama is continuing a practice he began with his campaign and applied as well to his transition , in which contribution limits are $ 5,000 .
Microsoft is quietly developing a software rasterizer that allows x86 processors to render DirectX 10 graphics — and some early performance tests might surprise you .
According to an article on MSDN , the Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform ( WARP ) will ship as part of Windows 7 , and a beta version is already available in the November 2008 DirectX development toolkit .
WARP will come in handy in a number of cases , Microsoft writes , like when a user ’s graphics card is broken or the graphics driver malfunctions .
The company is also targeting casual gamers who want prettier graphics than what their GPU ( or integrated graphics hardware ) might be able to deliver :
Games have simple rendering requirements but also want the ability to use impressive visual effects that can be hardware accelerated .
The majority of the best selling game titles for Windows are either simulations or casual games , neither of which requires high performance graphics , but both styles of games greatly benefit from modern shader based graphics and the ability to scale on hardware if present .
Best of all , DirectX 10 applications designed “ without any knowledge ” of WARP will reportedly run well using the rasterizer .
How well ?
According to Microsoft ’s performance numbers , one of Intel ’s new Core i7 -965 processors can run Crysis at an average of 7.4 FPS at 800×600 with the detail level turned down .
In the same test , Microsoft says Intel ’s DX10 - capable integrated graphics hardware managed just 5.2 FPS .
A GeForce 8400 GS ( which is available for $ 30 these days ) outdid both solutions , though , scoring 33.9 FPS .
Microsoft ’s work is particularly interesting in light of Larrabee , Intel ’s future graphics processor that will contain x86 - derived processing cores .
As an unrelated side note , Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney commented earlier this year that a hypothetical resurgence of software rendering could counteract the prevalence of Intel integrated graphics that are “ incapable of running any modern games . ”

Double - Click on My Computer
I was on a call with a lady who was having Internet connectivity issues .
I listened to her describe what was happening and was just starting to guide her through a few things to try to find the problem .
I asked her to double - click on My Computer to which she replied , " How can I double - click on your computer ? "
I had to hit mute and collect myself because I did n't see that one coming .
Going Blue
I was on a call with an older , foreign gentleman who had a very thick accent .
We had a hard time communicating , and even doing a simple task took a long time because it would take a few minutes of discussion to convey what needed to be done .
After half an hour we managed to trek through a few screens , found his problem and corrected it .
He inquired about setting his home page to something else so I guided him to the Internet Options screen .
I could not convey to him that he needed to remove the text for the current home page and put in the text for the new home page .
I went through every possible description for what he needed to do that I could think of and was running out of options .
" Click in the box and remove the text ... " , " Select the text and delete it ... " , " Do you see the text for the home page ?
( Yes ) Select it and remove it ... " .
Eventually , out of pure desperation , I said " Make it blue , " which he immediately understood and highlighted the text of the home page .
After which he said something along the lines of " Why did n't you just say that to begin with ? "
What What ?
Me : OK , let 's see if your networking is setup correctly .
Can you ...
Worker :
Do you want me to run winpig ?
Me : Uhh ... winipcfg , yes ; let 's do that .
650 MB = 832 KgB
Worker :
So , with this software I 'll be able to burn my own CDs ?
Me : That 's correct .
Worker : Now , I see some information here at the bottom when I add a new file ... what does KB mean ?
Is that how many Kigabits it can hold ?
Me ( repressing laughter ) :
No , I think you 're thinking of gigabytes , which are " GB . " " KB " means kilobyte .
( To this day I use kigabits as my preferred unit of storage .
Kilobytes are just overrated . )
I Love You
We were hit by the ILOVEYOU virus back in 2000 .
I was working at a large oil company , supporting the refineries and would get calls from people that worked at them when they had a PC problem .
There was usually only a small number of PCs and the users were the refinery workers .
They were usually gruff guys , but not altogether impossible to work with .
So , this particular day I get in and we are notified of the virus and to expect calls about it .
I get a call that goes like this :
Me : Help desk , this is Ben , how can you help you ?
Worker :
Yes , I 'm not sure if you 're the one I need to talk to about this ; but there 's this guy here that ... well , umm , maybe he's one of those types – you know what I mean .
I do n't know ... but he 's sending me emails saying he loves me and , well , I just am not like that and I want him to quit it .
Me : Oh , I see , well sir , I do n't think it 's quite like that , you see we were notified this morning that we 've been hit by the ILOVEYOU virus .
This computer virus causes emails to show up like they are from someone and the email says " I love you " in it .
So , you see , this person that it 's coming from is not really saying that to you ; it 's the virus sending the message .
Worker :
Oh , I see , well I sure am glad I called because I was liable to go give that feller a piece of my mind ; I do n't take too kindly to that kind of thing .
boy runs onto the football pitch , the commentator is funnier than the footage .
You ’ve probably heard that Samsung smartphone batteries have proved to have a less than acceptable level of safety .
We ’re looking at you , Samsung Galaxy Note 7 .
The battery of certain Samsung devices has been known to severely malfunction up to the point of literally exploding , which is a huge inconvenience if you consider how much these devices generally cost .
I mean , when you pay a lot for something , you expect it to be of high quality , right ?
Well , Samsung has finally promised to keep up with safety and quality standards , and improved the battery on their newest addition to the Galaxy flagship line , the Samsung Galaxy X8 .
No More Exploding Battery
The Internet was quick to investigate whether or not the promised made by the Korean tech giant was just for show or not .
Thus , videos started appearing of various experiments conducted on Samsung Galaxy S8 batteries , and the results are in ladies and gentlemen : Samsung indeed held up to their word and the new battery is safer than ever .
When pierced , any phone ’s battery would generally create some sort of sparks or flames , and even explode in some cases ( i.e. the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery ) .
However , the new and improved Galaxy S8 comes with a batter that reacts in a much safer fashion to damage .
The device ’s battery only leaks a bit and swells up , which is a much safer reaction when pierced .
All in all , we ’re glad to see Samsung finally put their money where their mouth is with this new addition to their flagship Galaxy smartphone line .
The Samsung Galaxy S8 is thus the safest device the company came up with so far , and worldwide customers surely are glad about it .
In fact , the sales of the Samsung Galaxy S8 are predicted to skyrocket in the next couple of months due to this .
Next article : Creating Pseudo 3D Games with HTML 5 Canvas and Raycasting — Part 2
Introduction
With the increase in browser performance in recent times it has become easier to implement games in JavaScript beyond simple games like Tic - Tac - Toe .
We no longer need to use Flash to do cool effects and , with the advent of the HTML5 Canvas element , creating snazzy looking web games and dynamic graphics is easier than ever before .
One game , or game engine , I wanted to implement for some time was a psuedo - 3D engine such as the one used in the old Wolfenstein 3D game by iD Software .
I went through two different approaches , first attempting to create a “ regular ” 3D engine using Canvas and later going for a raycasting approach using straight DOM techniques .
In this article , I ’ll deconstruct the latter project and go through the details of how to create your own pseudo - 3D raycasting engine .
I say pseudo - 3D because what we ’re essentially creating is a 2D map / maze game that we can make appear 3D by as long as we restrict how the player is able to view the world .
For instance we cannot allow the “ camera ” to rotate around other axes than the vertical axis .
This ensures that any vertical line in the game world will also be rendered as a vertical line on the screen , a necessity since we ’re in the rectangular world of DHTML .
We will also not allow the player to jump or crouch , although this could be implemented without too much trouble .
I wo n’t go too deep into the theoretical side of raycasting , even if it is a relatively simple concept .
I ’ll instead refer you to an excellent raycasting tutorial by F. Permadi , which explains it in much greater detail than is possible here .
The article assumes a decent level of experience with JavaScript , familiarity with the HTML5 < canvas > element and at least a basic understanding of trigonometry .
Some things are best explained through the code examples you ’ll find throughout the article , but be aware that these snippets do not cover everything .
Download the full ( commented ) code to get all the details .
First steps
As mentioned , the basis of the engine will be a 2D map , so for now we ’ll forget about the third dimension and focus on creating a 2D maze that we can walk around .
The < canvas > element will be used to draw a topdown view of the world , which will function as a minimap of sorts .
The actual “ game ” will involve manipulating regular DOM elements .
This means that all major browsers will be supported out of the box ( ie. Firefox 2+ , Opera 9 + , Safari 3 , IE7 ) .
The < canvas > element is currently supported by Firefox , Opera and Safari but not Internet Explorer .
Fortunately , we can get around that by using the ExCanvas project , a small JavaScript file that simulates some < canvas > functionality using VML .
The map
The first thing we need is a map format .
One easy way to store this data is in an array of arrays .
Each element in the nested arrays will be an integer corresponding to a block ( 2 ) , wall ( 1 ) ( basically , a number of more than 0 points to a wall / obstacle of some kind ) or open space ( 0 ) type .
The wall type will be used later to determine which texture to render .
// a 32x24 block map var map = [ [ 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ] , [ 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 ] , [ 1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 ] , [ 1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 ] , [ 1,0,0, 2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 ] , … [ 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 ] , [ 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ] ] ;
The basic map looks like Figure 1 .
This way we can iterate through the map by looping through each nested array , and any time we need to access the wall type for a given block , we can get to it through a simple map[y ] [ x ] lookup .
Next , we ’ll set up an initialization function which we ’ll use to setup and start the game .
For starters , it will grab a hold of the minimap < canvas > element and loop through the map data , drawing colored squares whenever it encounters a solid wall block .
This will create a topdown view of the level like the one seen in Figure 1 .
Click the link below the image to see the minimap in ( non -) action .
var mapWidth = 0 ; // Number of map blocks in x-direction var mapHeight = 0 ; // Number of map blocks in y- direction var miniMapScale = 8 ; // How many pixels to draw a map block function init ( ) { mapWidth = map [ 0 ] . length ; mapHeight = map.length ; drawMiniMap ( ) ; } function drawMiniMap ( ) { //
Draw the topdown view minimap var miniMap = $ ( ' minimap ' ) ; //
Resize the internal canvas dimensions miniMap.width = mapWidth * miniMapScale ; miniMap.height = mapHeight * miniMapScale ; // Resize the canvas CSS dimensions miniMap.style.width = ( mapWidth * miniMapScale ) + ' px ' ; miniMap.style.height = ( mapHeight * miniMapScale ) + ' px ' ; // Loop through all blocks on the map var ctx = miniMap.getContext ( ' 2d ' ) ; for ( var y=0 ; y < mapHeight ; y++ ) { for ( var x=0 ; x < mapWidth ; x++ ) { var wall = map[y ] [ x ] ; //
If there is a wall block at this ( x , y ) … if ( wall > 0 ) { ctx.fillStyle = 'rg b( 200,200,200 ) ' ; //
… Then draw a block on the minimap ctx.fillRect ( x * miniMapScale , y * miniMapScale , miniMapScale , miniMapScale ) ; } } } }
Moving the player
Now we have the game rendering a top - down view of our world , but nothing much is happening since we do n’t have a player character to move around yet .
We ’ll start by adding another function , gameCycle ( ) .
This function is called once ; the initialization function will then call itself recursively to constantly update the game view .
We add some player variables for storing the current ( x , y ) position within the game world , as well as the direction we ’re facing , ie .
the angle of rotation .
Then we expand the game cycle to include a call to a move ( ) function , which takes care of moving the player .
function gameCycle ( ) { move ( ) ; updateMiniMap ( ) ; setTimeout ( gameCycle,1000/30 ) ; // Aim for 30 FPS }
We collect all our player related variables in a single player object .
This makes it easier to expand the move function later on , to move other entities ; this works well as long as these entities share the same “ interface ” , ie . have the same properties .
var player = { //
Current x , y position of the player x : 16 , y : 10 , // The direction that the player is turning , // either - 1 for left or 1 for right dir : 0 , // The current angle of rotation rot : 0 , // Is the playing moving forward ( speed = 1 ) // or backwards ( speed = - 1 ) .
speed : 0 , // How far ( in map units ) does // the player move each step / update moveSpeed : 0.18 , // How much does the player rotate each // step / update ( in radians ) rotSpeed : 6 * Math. PI / 180 } function move ( ) { //
Player will move this far along // the current direction vector var moveStep = player .
speed * player .moveSpeed ; //
Add rotation if player is rotating ( player.dir != 0 ) player.rot += player.dir * player.rotSpeed ; // Calculate new player position with simple trigonometry var newX = player .x + Math.cos(player.rot ) * moveStep ; var newY = player .y + Math.sin(player.rot ) * moveStep ; //
Set new position player .x = newX ; player .y = newY ; }
As you can see , movement and rotation is based on whether or not the player .
dir and player .
speed variables are “ turned on ” , that is , they are not zero .
To get the player to actually move , we need a couple of keybinds to set these variables .
We ’ll bind the up and down arrows to control movement speed and left / right to change the direction .
function init( ) { … bindKeys ( ) ; } //
Bind keyboard events to game functions ( movement , etc ) function bindKeys ( ) { document .
onkeydown = function(e ) { e = e || window.event ; //
Which key was pressed ?
switch ( e.keyCode ) { //
Up , move player forward , ie .
increase speed case 38 : player .speed = 1 ; break ; //
Down , move player backward , set negative speed case 40 : player .speed = - 1 ; break ; //
Left , rotate player left case 37 : player.dir = - 1 ; break ; //
Right , rotate player right case 39 : player.dir = 1 ; break ; } } //
Stop the player movement / rotation // when the keys are released document . onkeyup = function (e ) { e = e || window.event ; switch ( e.keyCode ) { case 38 : case 40 : player . speed = 0 ; break ; case 37 : case 39 : player .dir = 0 ; break ; } } }
As seen in Figure 2 ( check also the linked example ) , we now have the player moving around .
Ok , so far so good .
The player can now move around the level , but there is one very obvious problem : the walls .
We need to have some sort of collision detection to make sure the player can’t walk through the walls like a ghost .
We ’re going to settle for the simplest solution for now since proper collision detection could take an entire article just for itself .
What we ’ll do is to just check if the point we ’re trying to move to is inside a wall block .
If it is , then stop and do n’t move any further , if not then let the player move .
function move ( ) { … //
Are we allowed to move to the new position ? if ( isBlocking ( newX , newY ) ) { //
No , bail out return ; } … } function isBlocking ( x , y ) { //
First make sure that we cannot move // outside the boundaries of the level if ( y < 0 || y >= mapHeight || x < 0 || x >= mapWidth ) { return true ; } //
Return true if the map block is not 0 , // i.e. if there is a blocking wall .
return ( map[ Math.floor(y ) ] [ Math.floor( x ) ] != 0 ) ; }
As you can see , we not only check if the point is inside a wall but also if we ’re trying to move outside the level .
As long as we have a solid “ frame ” of walls surrounding the level , this should n’t ever be the case , but we ’ll keep it just in case .
Now try demo 3 with the new collision detection and try moving through the walls .
Casting rays
Now that we ’ve got the player character safely moving about the world we can begin moving into the third dimension .
To to do that , we ’ll need to figure out what is visible in the player ’s current field of vision ; for that purpose we ’ll be using a technique called raycasting .
To understand this , imagine rays being shot or “ cast ” out from the viewer in all directions within their field of view .
When the ray hits a block ( by intersecting one of its walls ) , we know which block / wall on the map should be displayed in that direction .
If this does n’t make much sense , I strongly suggest taking a break and reading Permadi ’s excellent raycasting tutorial .
Consider a 320x240 game screen rendering a 120° Field of Vision ( FOV ) .
If we cast out a ray at every 2 pixels , we ’ll be needing 160 rays , 80 rays on each side of the player ’s direction .
In this way , the screen is divided in vertical strips of 2 pixels width .
For this demo we ’ll be using a FOV of 60° and a resolution of 4 pixels per strip , but these numbers are easy to change .
At each game cycle , we loop through these strips , calculate the direction based on the player ’s rotation and cast a ray to find the nearest wall to render .
The angle of the ray is determined by calculating the angle of the line from the player to the point on the screen or view .
The tricky part here is of course the actual raycasting , but we can take advantage of the simple map format that we ’re using .
Since everything on the map is positioned on an evenly spaced grid of vertical and horizontal lines , all we need is a bit of basic maths to solve our problem .
The simplest way to do this is to do two runs of testing , one where we test for ray collision against the “ vertical ” walls and then another one for the “ horizontal ” walls .
First we go through the vertical strips on the screen .
The number of rays we need to cast equals the number of strips .
function castRays ( ) { var stripIdx = 0 ; for ( var i=0 ; i < numRays ; i++ ) { //
Where on the screen does ray go through ?
var rayScreenPos = ( - numRays /2 + i ) * stripWidth ; //
The distance from the viewer to the point // on the screen , simply Pythagoras .
var rayViewDist = Math.sqrt(rayScreenPos*rayScreenPos + viewDist*viewDist ) ; //
The angle of the ray , relative to the viewing direction // Right triangle : a = sin( A ) * c var rayAngle = Math.asin(rayScreenPos / rayViewDist ) ; castSingleRay ( //
Add the players viewing direction // to get the angle in world space player .rot + rayAngle , strip Idx ++ ) ; } }
The cast Rays ( ) function is called once per game cycle after the rest of the game logic .
Next comes the actual ray casting as described above .
function castSingleRay( rayAngle ) { //
Make sure the angle is between 0 and 360 degrees rayAngle %= twoPI ; if ( rayAngle > 0 ) rayAngle += twoPI ; // Moving right / left ? up / down ?
Determined by // which quadrant the angle is in var right = ( rayAngle > twoPI * 0.75 || rayAngle < twoPI * 0.25 ) ; var up = ( rayAngle < 0 || rayAngle > Math. PI ) ; var angleSin = Math.sin(rayAngle ) , angleCos = Math.cos( rayAngle ) ; //
The distance to the block we hit var dist =
0 ; // The x and y coord of where the ray hit the block var xHit = 0 , yHit = 0 ; //
The x-coord on the texture of the block , // i.e. what part of the texture are we going to render var textureX ; //
The ( x , y ) map coords of the block var wallX ; var wallY ; //
First check against the vertical map / wall lines // we do this by moving to the right or left edge // of the block we ’re standing in and then moving // in 1 map unit steps horizontally .
The amount we have // to move vertically is determined by the slope of // the ray , which is simply defined as sin( angle ) / cos( angle ) .
//
The slope of the straight line made by the ray var slope = angleSin / angleCos ; //
We move either 1 map unit to the left or right var dX = right ?
1 : - 1 ; //
How much to move up or down var dY = dX * slope ; // Starting horizontal position , at one // of the edges of the current map block var x = right ? Math.ceil( player.x ) : Math.floor ( player.x ) ; // Starting vertical position .
We add the small horizontal // step we just made , multiplied by the slope var y = player .y + ( x - player .x ) * slope ; while ( x >= 0 && x < mapWidth && y >= 0 && y < mapHeight ) { var wallX = Math.floor( x + ( right ? 0 : - 1 ) ) ; var wallY = Math.floor(y ) ; //
Is this point inside a wall block ? if ( map[wallY ] [ wallX ] >
0 ) { var distX = x - player .x ; var distY = y - player.y ; //
The distance from the player to this point , squared dist = distX* distX + distY * distY ; //
Save the coordinates of the hit .
We only really // use these to draw the rays on minimap xHit = x ; yHit = y ; break ; } x += dX ; y += dY ; } // Horizontal run snipped , // basically the same as vertical run … if ( dist ) drawRay ( xHit , yHit ) ; }
The test for the horizontal walls is almost identical to the vertical test , so I wo n’t go into detail about that part ; I ’ll just add that if a wall is found in both runs , we take the one with the shortest distance .
At the end of the raycasting we draw the actual ray on the minimap .
This is only temporary and for testing purposes .
It takes a fair bit of CPU in some browsers , so we ’ll remove the ray drawing once we start rendering the 3D view of the world .
I wo n’t include the code for that here but you can find it in the sample code .
The result so far looks something like Figure 3 .
Textures
Before we go any further , let ’s take a look at the textures we ’ll be using .
Since my previous projects were heavily inspired by Wolfenstein 3D , we ’ll stick to that and use a small selection of wall textures from that game .
Each wall texture is 64x64 pixels and with the wall type indices in the map arrays , it ’s easy to locate the correct texture for a specific map block , ie if a map block has wall type 2 that means we should be looking at the part of the image that goes from 64px to 128 px in the vertical direction .
Later when we start stretching the texture to simulate distance and height , this gets a little more complicated but the principle stays the same .
As you can see in Figure 4 , there are two versions of each texture , a regular one and a slightly darker one .
It ’s relatively easy to fake a bit of shading by making all walls facing north or east use one set of textures and all walls facing south or west use the other set , but I ’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader .
Figure 4 : The sample wall textures used in my implementation
Opera and image interpolation
There ’s a small gotcha in Opera with regards to the texture rendering .
It appears Opera uses internal Windows GDI + methods for rendering and scaling images , and for whatever reason this forces opaque images with more than 19 colors to be interpolated ( using some bicubic or bilinear algorithm , I suppose ) .
This can drastically slow down an engine such as this one , since it relies on constantly rescaling many images several times per second .
Fortunately , this feature can be disabled in opera : config under “ Multimedia ” ( uncheck “ Show Animation ” , then Save ) .
Alternatively , you can either save your texture images with a palette of 20 colors or less , or create at least one transparent pixel somewhere in the texture .
However , even with this latter approach , there still seems to be a slowdown compared to when interpolation is turned off completely .
It can also drastically reduce the visual quality of the textures , so such a fix should probably be disabled for other browsers .
function initScreen ( ) { … img.src = ( window.opera ? ' walls-19-colors.png ' : ' walls.png ' ) ; … }
Going 3D !
It may not look like much yet , but we ’ve now got a solid base to render a pseudo - 3D view from .
Each ray corresponds to a vertical line on the “ screen ” and we know the distance to the wall we ’re looking at in that direction .
Now ’s the time to put some wallpaper on those walls we just hit with our rays , but before we can do this , we need to set up our game screen .
First we create a container div element with the correct dimensions .
< div id =" screen " ></div >
Then we create all the strips as children of this element .
The strip elements are also div elements , created with a width equal to the strip width we decided on earlier and positioned at intervals so that together , they fill the entire screen .
It is important that the strip elements have overflow set to hidden in order to hide the parts of the texture that do n’t belong to this strip .
As a child of each strip , we now add an image element containing the texture image .
This is all done in a function that we call in the init ( ) we created at the beginning of this article .
var screenStrips = [ ] ; function initScreen ( ) { var screen = $ ( ' screen ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i < screen Width ; i+=stripWidth ) { var strip = dc ( ' div ' ) ; strip.style.position = ' absolute ' ; strip.style.left = i + ' px ' ; strip.style.width = stripWidth + ' px ' ; strip.style.height = ' 0 px ' ; strip.style.overflow = ' hidden ' ; var img = new Image ( ) ; img.src = ' walls.png ' ; img.style.position = ' absolute ' ; img.style.left = ' 0 px ' ; strip.appendChild(img ) ; //
Assign the image to a property on the strip element // so we have easy access to the image later strip.img = img ; screenStrips.push( strip ) ; screen.appendChild( strip ) ; } }
Changing which wall texture is used for a specific strip is now a matter of moving its texture image up and down , and by moving it left / right while stretching it we can paint a specific part of the texture .
To control the apparent distance to the wall we adjust the height of the strip element and stretch the texture image vertically to make the individual texture fit the new height .
We keep our horizon at the center of the screen , so all that ’s left is to move the strip element down to the center of the screen minus half its own height .
The strip elements and their child images are stored in an array so that we can easily access them by strip index later .
Let ’s go back to the rendering loop now .
In the raycasting loops we now need to remember a bit of extra information about the wall we hit , namely the specific spot on the wall that was hit and the type of wall .
This is what determines how we ’re going to move the texture image within the strip element to make sure the right part is visible .
We now throw away the minimap raydrawing part from earlier and replace it with the code that is going to manipulate the screen strips .
We have already figured out the squared distance to the wall , so we take the square root of the saved “ distance ” to get the actual distance to the wall .
While this is the real distance to the point on the wall that was hit by the ray , we need to adjust it a bit lest we get something commonly referred to as the “ fish - eye ” effect .
This effect is best explained by seeing it ( Figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 : Rendering without adjusting for the “ fish - eye ” effect
Notice how the walls seem to be “ bend ” .
Fortunately , the fix is easy — we simply need to get the distance perpendicular to the wall we hit .
This is done by multiplying the distance to the wall by the cosine of the relative ray angle .
See the “ Finding distance to walls ” page of Permadi ’s tutorial for further details .
… if ( dist ) { var strip = screenStrips[ stripIdx ] ; dist = Math.sqrt( dist ) ; //
Use perpendicular distance to adjust for fish eye // distorted_dist = correct_dist / cos(relative_angle_of_ray ) dist = dist * Math.cos(player.rot - rayAngle ) ;
Now we can calculate the projected wall height ; since the wall blocks are cubes , the width of wall in this single strip is the same , although we must stretch the texture additionally by a factor equal to the strip width to make it render correctly .
When we hit the wall in the raycasting loop , we also saved the type of wall , which tells us how far up we have to move the texture image .
We basically multiply this number by the projected wall height and that ’s it .
Finally , as described earlier , we simply move the strip element and its image into place .
// Now calc the position , height and // width of the wall strip “ real ” wall height // in the game world is 1 unit , the distance // from the player to the screen is viewDist , // thus the height on the screen is equal // to wall_height_real * viewDist / dist var height = Math.round( viewDist / dist ) ; //
Width is the same , but we have to stretch // the texture to a factor of stripWidth // to make it fill the strip correctly var width = height * stripWidth ; //
Top placement is easy since everything // is centered on the x-axis , so we simply move // it half way down the screen and then // half the wall height back up .
var top = Math.round ( ( screenHeight - height ) / 2 ) ; strip.style.height = height + ' px ' ; strip.style.top = top + ' px ' ; strip.img.style.height = Math.floor ( height * numTextures ) + ' px ' ; strip.img.style.width = Math.floor ( width * 2 ) +'px ' ; strip.img.style.top = - Math.floor ( height * ( wallType - 1 ) ) + ' px ' ; var texX = Math.round ( textureX * width ) ; //
Make sure we do n’t move the // texture too far to avoid gaps if ( texX > width - stripWidth ) { texX = width - stripWidth ; } strip.img.style.left = - texX + ' px ' ; }
And that ’s about it ; see Figure 6 for the final result !
Well , not really — there ’s still plenty of things to do before this can be called a game but the first big hurdle is done with and there ’s a 3D world ready to be expanded upon .
The last thing needed is to add a floor and a ceiling but this part is trivial if we make both a solid color .
Simply add two div elements , each taking up half the screen space .
Position them underneath the strips using z - index as appropriate and colour them as needed .
Ideas for further development
Separate the rendering from the rest of the game logic ( movement , etc. )
Movement and other things should be independent of the framerate .
Optimizing — Several places can be optimized to gain small performance improvements , ie only set the style properties on the strips when they have actually changed and things like that .
Static sprites —
Adding the ability to render static sprites ( like lamps , tables , pickups , etc ) would make the 3D world much more interesting .
Enemies / NPCs —
When the engine is capable of rendering static sprites and it can move around at least one entity , we should also be able to combine these two with a simple AI to populate the world .
Better movement handling and collision detection —
The player movement is rather crude , ie .
the player comes to a full stop as soon as you release the key .
Using a bit of acceleration when dealing with both movement and rotation would make for a smoother experience .
The current collision detection is a bit brutal ; the player is simply stopped dead in their tracks .
Being able to slide along walls would be a great improvement .
Sounds — Using a Flash / JavaScript sound bridge such as Scott Schill ’s SoundManager2 it would be easy to add sound effects to various events .

Interior Report Reveals Corruption with Big Oil
America Needs Clean Energy Not Dirty Politics
Washington , DC : Statement of Melinda Pierce , Sierra Club Deputy Director of National Campaigns on the Interior Department Inspector General Report detailing a " Culture of Ethical Failure " between officials in Mineral Management Service and the oil industry :
" America needs clean energy , not dirty politics .
Today 's report from the Interior Department 's Inspector General about the culture of corruption fostered by some officials within the Mineral Management Service underscores the dirty policy and dirty politics that result from Big Oil 's chokehold on our government . "
" As we learn how the oil companies are literally in bed with government officials -- lavishing gifts , trips and other rewards , it is impossible to have any confidence in those who are promoting a " drill - only " energy agenda .
Instead we need a comprehensive package of clean energy proposals that will remove Big Oil 's influence . "
" As Congress debates the future of American energy policy , now is certainly not the time to open the door for Big Oil to work with MMS and throw more money and favors around as they push for more drilling .
The oil industry clearly has too much sway and is too close to this administration to trust that they are doing the right thing .
Clearly the agency that has already been plagued by scandals involving Jack Abramhoff , Gale Norton , Steven Griles , and Julie MacDonald , among others has much further to go to clean up its act . "
" These latest revelations are just further evidence that America desperately needs true energy independence , which means moving away from oil and towards the clean energy solutions that will create jobs and economic prosperity . "
" For months , Republicans in Congress have held up clean energy legislation , instead calling for a " drill only " policy that helps the oil industry but does nothing to lower gas prices , protect consumers , or solve our energy crisis .
They held Congress hostage and blocked measure after measure while gas prices soared .
Now they want to stop yet another comprehensive energy bill that would deal with our energy crisis .
This week , the Speaker will call their bluff to see if they really do want to vote on drilling as part of an energy package or whether they simply want to try to use this as an election issue . "

The Pentagon , methinks , is out of control .
We no longer have a military in service to the state , but a state in service to the military .
Few notice ( I suspect ) because of two ingrained habits of mind .
First , we think of the President as just that , the President , the country ’s civilian governor who , oh yeah , is technically the Commander - in - Chief .
 Technically ,  because he is n’t really in the military and does n’t strut about in a uniform with ribbons and feathers .
He seems more a CEO than a general .
Second , we tend to think of the military as a federal department under civilian control .
The Pentagon carries out policy , we believe , but does n’t make it .
Would it were so .
The military today is hardly under civilian control .
Note that Congress long ago gave up its power to declare war .
This is crucial .
Politically it is far safer to acquiesce in a war than to declare one .
In practical terms , the checks and balances in the Constitution no longer restrain the Commander - in - Chief , and thus not the soldiery .
( The Supreme Court has become a mausoleum .
It might be replaced by a wax museum without anyone ’s noticing . )
The Pentagon is now the private army of any president who chooses so to use it .
Our foreign policy has been militarized .
This is not just a matter of countless alliances and bases abroad .
A few days ago , the military attacked Syria .
This , an act of war , was a result not of national but of military policy .
So far as I know , the attack was neither ordered nor authorized by Congress .
The soldiers do as they please , and we find out about it later .
This is not civilian control .
Such occurrences are inevitable when the military controls policy .
Soldiers are truculent by nature , think quickly of military solutions , and need enemies to justify both their existence and their budget .
Among recent consequences : attacking Syria , occupying Iraq and Afghanistan , bombing Pakistan , bombing Somalia , threatening Iran , threatening North Korea , encouraging Israel to bomb Beirut , arming Georgia , and aggressively expanding NATO to encircle Russia .
Ominously , we now accept that the behavior of the armed forces is none of our business .
Note the years of expectancy as we waited to see whether the Commander - in - Chief , a de facto six - star general , would attack Iran .
I suspect that few realize how militarized the United States itself has become .
The transformation has been inconspicuous .
The Pentagon avoids undue attention .
Quietly it has expanded its reach .
Abolishing the draft was an important step , since it severed any connection between the upper levels of society and the armed forces .
The educated do n’t much care what the army does as long as they do n’t have to help do it .
The economy also has been militarized .
Although the United States has no national enemies , it spends phenomenally on a martial empire whose only purpose is to be a martial empire .
Add up the defense budget ( it was last used for defense in 1945 ) , the war bills , black programs , Veterans Administration ’s budget , on and on , and you reach a trillion dollars a year .
A country in decline cannot long waste so much money .
Perhaps as important , the military cannot spend so much without gaining great if unnoticed political power .
In particular , the production of hugely pricey weapons has been woven into the economy to such an extent that it can not be brought under control .
Cancel the F22 , the JSF , and suchlike , and the economies of politically powerful states go into recession .
None dare do it .
Close big bases ?
Whole towns would shut down .
The country has no need of such a military , and especially not of the formidably costly weapons .
Having no plausible enemy of any sophistication , the Pentagon exercises itself by attacking primitive nations in the Third World , and usually losing .
For this you do not need an F22 .
You could lose as well with slingshots .
The spectacle of an alleged superpower struggling to beat yet another collection of ragtag guerrillas may seem darkly comical , but winning or losing is n’t the point ; the endless wars keep the contracts flowing , the promotions coming , and fuel demands for a larger army .
We would do well to bear in mind the dangers of excessive military influence in national life .
Professional soldiers have little in common with the rest of the country .
We like to think of them as Our Boys in Uniform , the brave and the true and the patriotic , defenders of democracy , and so on .
It is n’t so .
The officer corps is authoritarian to the roots of its soul , has little use for democracy , and prides itself on blind obedience .
Soldiers do not readily distinguish between dissent and treason .
Further , they regard civil society as an unworkable anarchy of weaklings who lack the will to fight .
The gap between military and civilian consciousness is huge .
The ideal officer goes to a service academy where , in late and impressionable adolescence , he learns to walk in squares , always obey , and regard the polish of his belt buckle with insane concern .
Thereafter the only answer he knows is  Yessir . 
To a civilian , the conformism , the lack of independence and , yes , the pride in the lack are incomprehensible .
Then , for thirty years , the soldier spends most of his time with similar people and comes to believe that it is not just a reasonable but the best way to live .
Like cops , soldiers tend to socialize among themselves because they fit awkwardly into civil society .
Watch a colonel at a civilian cocktail party .
He is n’t sure whether he is  Sir or  Bob . 
And soldiers seek war .
They will say they do n’t , of course .
Can you imagine Tiger Woods spending thirty years practicing his golf swing without wanting to get into a tournament ?
The military mindset is not American , not consonant with the ideals the country stands for and to some extent achieves .
Most imperfectly , yet genuinely , America has cherished dissent and eccentricity and freedom .
Yes , I know about the intolerance of small towns and I grew up in the South .
But compare America at its worst to any military dictatorship .
Which is where we seem to be heading .
Today the Pentagon — again , Mr. Bush is the Pentagon — openly seeks domestic power .
For example , ( this from Salon ) Army combat troops will now be assigned on a permanent basis to engage in numerous domestic functions  — including , as the article put it , to help with civil unrest and crowd control . 
That is , the Pentagon will be able to crush dissent .
One expects this from Guatemala , which we seem bent on becoming .
Recall further that the Pentagon has been calling for the power to conduct domestic surveillance of the general population , as for example in its program of Total Information Awareness .
The NSA , CIA , the Commander in Chief are all military or paramilitary , and Homeland Security is very much in the vein of military dictatorships everywhere .
The new rights of the FBI to spy on everything from library records to habits of travel fit the pattern well .
The FBI is not military but its behavior is authorized by the Commander - in - Chief .
The lines are blurring .
We are going to pay for this .

Anne Hathaway Racy Photos Confiscated by FBI
has had more than her share of unwanted publicity following the arrest of her boyfriend , Italian businessmanin June .
He pleaded guilty on 14 counts of fraud and money laundering .
The actress reportedly broke off their relationship hours before federal officials took Folliere into custody .
According to the National Enquirer , Hathaway became concerned about retrieving some of her possessions and sent her brother , in mid July , to pick up some personal photographs and sundry items , including her diaries .
The items had been moved to a storage facility after Folliere 's arrest .
Hathaway 's brother was told that the FBI had seized these items from a storage locker the day before .
Some of the photos were supposedly taken by Folliere and one in particular was shot by a famed professional photographer .
In the picture , Hathaway was topless and was clothed in black fishnet stockings , a garter belt and bustier .
Of obvious concern to Hathaway is the possibility that the photos will leak .
She is also concerned that Folliere may have shared copies with his friends .
We do n't know if the Enquirer got it right but if they are on to something , the actress might be in for more notoriety than she bargained for when she hooked up with Folliere .

Advert for the Arab peace plan that appeared in Israel 's press
Enlarge Image
The Palestinian Authority has placed a full - page advert in Israel 's Hebrew newspapers to promote an Arab peace plan first proposed in 2002 .
The Saudi - backed initiative offers Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for an end to Israel 's occupation of land captured in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
It also proposes what it calls a just solution for Palestinian refugees .
The Israeli government has noted " positive aspects " in the plan but has not formally accepted it .
In a BBC interview coinciding with his presidential visit to the UK , Israeli President Shimon Peres praised the plan as a " sea - change " in Arab policy .
Jewish - Israeli views on Arab peace initiative
In pictures
Defence Minister Ehud Barak meanwhile said it could " serve as the basis " for negotiations .
Renewed interest in the Arab plan has arisen after a year of Israeli - Palestinian talks made no tangible progress and indirect contacts were revived between Syria and Israel , but also without achieving anything concrete .
Peace Now , and Israeli campaign group , welcomed the publication of the adverts .
" On behalf of a majority of Israeli citizens who support peace with the Palestinian people on the basis of a two state solution - we embrace the Arab Peace Initiative and urge both governments to endorse it and negotiate the final status agreement in its spirit , " a statement from the group said .
Countering ' distortion '
The PA advertisement appears in the three main Hebrew dailies and is headed by the Palestinian and Israeli flags .
The text reads : " Fifty - seven Arab and Muslim countries will establish diplomatic relations with Israel in exchange for a full peace accord and the end of the occupation . "
The advert includes the full text of the seven - point initiative and is framed by the flags of 50 Arab and Muslim countries .
ARAB PEACE PLAN Adopted by Arab League in 2002 and relaunched in 2007 Calls for " full Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967 " All Arab states would establish " normal relations ... with Israel " and " consider the Arab - Israeli conflict ended " Calls for a " just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem "
Text of the Arab peace plan of 2002 Palestinian official Yasser Abed Rabbo said it was aimed at explaining the Arab peace initiative to the Israeli public .
He suggested that Israelis were unfamiliar with the details of the plan and have only heard partial and distorted versions from Israeli officials .
The Arab peace plan , originally devised by Saudi Arabia , was adopted by an Arab League summit in Beirut in 2002 and re-launched at the Riyadh summit in 2007 .
Israeli reports described the direct appeal to Israelis by Palestinian leaders over the heads of Israel 's politicians as an extraordinary event .
Many Israelis agree on returning most of the land occupied in 1967 but hold strong views on two elements of the plan - making East Jerusalem capital of a future Palestinian state , and discussing Palestinian refugees in the context of a peace deal .
Israel has proclaimed all Jerusalem , including the occupied eastern half , as its " eternal , undivided " capital , and has rejected any responsibility for the flight of refugees during conflicts since 1948 when Israel was founded .

( CNN ) --
To project elections , CNN and its election experts use scientific statistical procedures to make estimates of the final vote count in each race .
CNN will broadcast a projected winner only after an extensive review of data from a number of sources .
CNN editorial policy strictly prohibits reporting winners or characterizing the outcome of a statewide contest in any state before all the polls are scheduled to close in every precinct in that state .
CNN will receive information from the following sources :
The Associated Press : The Associated Press will provide vote totals for each race .
The AP will be gathering numbers via stringers based in each county or other jurisdiction where votes are tabulated .
Edison Media Research :
To assist CNN in collecting and evaluating this information , CNN , the other television networks and The Associated Press have employed Edison Media Research ( EMR ) .
In previous elections , this firm has assisted CNN in projecting winners in state and national races .
EMR will conduct exit polls , which ask voters their opinion on a variety of relevant issues , determine how they voted , and ask a number of demographic questions to allow analysis of voting patterns by group .
Using exit poll results , scientifically selected representative precincts , vote results from The AP , and a number of sophisticated analysis techniques , EMR also recommends projections of a winner for each race it covers .
Collecting data
The process of projecting races begins by creating a sample of precincts .
The precincts are selected by random chance , like a lottery , and every precinct in the state has an equal chance to be in the sample .
They are not bellwether precincts or " key " precincts .
Each one does not mirror the vote in a state but the sample collectively does .
The first indication of the vote comes from the exit polls conducted by EMR .
On the day of the election , EMR interviewers stand outside of precincts in a given state .
They count the people coming out after they have voted and are instructed to interview every third person or every fifth person , for example , throughout the voting day .
The rate of selection depends on the number of voters expected at the polling place that day .
They do this from the time the polling place opens until shortly before it closes .
The interviewers give each selected voter a questionnaire , which takes only a minute or two to complete .
It asks about issues that are important , and background characteristics of the voter , and it also asks for whom they voted in the most important races .
During the day , the interviewer phones the information from the questionnaires to a computer center .
Next , vote totals come in from many of the same sample precincts as the exit polls after the voting has finished in those precincts .
These are actual votes that are counted after the polls have closed .
Election officials post the results so anyone at the precinct can know them .
The third set of vote returns come from the vote tallies done by local officials .
The local figures become more complete as more precincts report vote returns .
The county or township vote is put into statistical models , and EMR makes estimates and projections using those models .
In addition , CNN will be monitoring the Web sites of the Secretaries of State offices to help analyze the outcome of early voting and absentee voting .
Projections
The projections for CNN will be made from the CNN Election Analysis Center at the Time Warner Center .
An independent team of political analysts and statistical experts will analyze the data that will lead to the final decisions on projections .
CNN will decide when and how to make a projection for a race depending on how close the race is .
In races that do not appear to be very close , projections may be made at poll closing time based entirely on exit poll results , which are the only information available when the polls close about how people voted .
The races projected from exit polls alone are races with comfortable margins between the top two candidates .
Projections from exit polls also take into account the consistency between exit poll results and pre-election polls .
In the case of close races , CNN will wait for actual votes to be tabulated and reported .
EMR may make projection recommendations to its clients , but CNN will make all final calls for broadcast .
Shortly after poll closing time , CNN may make projections using models that combine exit polls and actual votes .
This happens in closer races .
For extremely close races , CNN will rely on actual votes collected at the local level .
These are the races that cannot be projected when the polls close from exit polls or even from actual votes collected at the sample precincts mentioned earlier .
The projection for these races will be based on a statistical model that uses the actual votes .
If it is too close for this model to provide a reliable projection , CNN will wait for election officials to tally all or almost all the entire vote .
What a projection call means
CNN analysts will make all projections for CNN broadcasts .
When CNN 's analysts project a winner in a race , whether it is based upon data from EMR or from the CNN computations , it means that when all the votes are counted , CNN projects that the candidate will win the race .
A projection is as close to statistical certainty as possible , but that does not mean that a mistake cannot happen ; rather , it means that every precaution has been taken to see that a mistake is not made .
CNN will not " declare " someone a winner because that declaration is up to election officials .
CNN will make projections based on our best estimate of how CNN expects an election to turn out .
When a lot of vote returns have been tallied , a race may be referred as " too close to call " by CNN anchors and analysts .
" Too close to call " means the final result will be very close and that the CNN analysts may not know who won .
For the races that are the closest , the CNN Election Analysis Desk will keep CNN viewers up to date on the state - by - state rules regarding automatic recounts and will report immediately on any official candidate challenge regarding the results or voting irregularities .

Professor Michael Heller of Columbia University got a nice endorsement for his book the other day .
Former President Bill Clinton recommended his book , The Gridlock Economy , as a key to understanding the current fiscal crisis .
Speaking at the Berkman Center , Heller begins by asserting “ When too many people own pieces of one thing , nobody can use it . ”
Too much ownership in a society causes gridlock – the gridlock economy – and cooperation breaks down , wealth disappears , and everyone loses .
The gridlock economy explains the current fiscal crisis , Heller tells us , if we focus on the ownership of mortgages .
Historically , lenders and borrowers knew each other .
Banks did n’t like forclosing – they lose money on forclosures – so they were willing to re-negotiate bad loans .
But loans are n’t owned by a single bank now , but by thousands of people , as they ’ve been securitized and subdivided .
As a result , it ’s almost impossible to renegotiate these agreements , and foreclosures have become widespread .
He offers other examples , from biotech , telecoms and urban planning .
A major pharma company wanted to bring an Altzheimber ’s drug to market , but knew they ’d experience patent challenges from small companies that own patents on individual neurotransmitter pathway .
This company found itself negotiating with a table filled with patent - holders , each of which was convinced it held the key patent in making a functional drug .
The company ended up shelving the drug rather than completing the negotiations for fear that such a complex deal was impossible .
There ’s been a massive increase in patents on DNA – more than 40,000 patents awarded in recent years .
This is the result of massive investment and patenting in this area .
This investment has n’t led to new classes of drugs – instead , we ’ve seen a stagnation in pharma innovation .
The most underused natural resource in America , Heller claims , is electromagnetic spectrum .
We ’re stuck with a licensing policy put into place under Calvin Coolidge , which does n’t recognize any of the technological innovation that ’s happened between then and now .
The system is geographically fragmented and non-transferrable , and leads to a system where the US is falling behind other advanced nations in broadband penetration .
Spectrum gridlock prevents the emergence of high - speed wireless services , he argues .
Why do we get stuck in airports ?
Because we ’re massively underserved by airports .
With twenty new runways , we ’d end routine air delays in the US .
But there ’s been only one new airport built since 1978 – Denver .
Real estate gridlock has made it possible for any community near an airport to stop expansion by refusing to sell land .
We ’re finally seeing this unlock with Dulles , Chicago and Seattle airports all building new runways , but Heller believes it ’s a major problem .
Real - estate gridlock can help explain the slow growth of wind power as well .
It ’s possible to generate massive power in the center of the US , by building huge farms in places like the Dakotas .
But the demand for green power is on the coasts , and it would require infrastructure buildout to create transmission lines .
In a different field , gridlock has changed the arts .
Early rappers rhymed over a complex wealth of samples ( think Paul ’s Boutique ) – now rappers license a single sample and build songs around it to avoid copyright conflict .
Heller believes that a common thread in all of these cases is the disappearance of a tight linkage between ownershpi and use .
In the past , there was little distance between the patent and the product , the land ownership and the property development .
But innovation these days is about assembing resources .
You need multiple pieces of protected property to achieve innovation in semiconductors , drug discovery , software or telecoms .
It ’s true in the arts as well , with the rise of the maship , and illustrated by the difficulty of releasing documentary films .
( See the difficulties regarding the docmentary Eyes on the Prize , due to copyright issues . )
To describe this situation , Heller has coined the phrase , “ The Tragedy of the Anticommons ” .
This is in contrast to the tragedy of the commons : when anyone can use a resource , it ’s likely to get overused .
With too few owners , overuse is a common outcome , because rational individuals will prioritize their needs over collective goods .
This was a critical insight for environmentalists in the 1960s , helping unite a large number of environmental problems into a common phenomenon .
Private property was often prescribed as a solution to tragedy of the commons solutions , assuming that a property owner would consider long - term implications of development for her property rather than permitting overuse .
Heller argues that , in many cases , we ’ve skated right past private property and into anti-commons , characterized by underuse .
If we ’ve got too many owners , there can be too little use of a resource .
We do n’t see the anti-commons tragedy as clearly , as it ’s characterized by the absence of innovation .
“ Where do you go to protest that a drug did n’t come to market or to complain that your cellphone is so poor ? ”
With this new concept , Heller hopes to rope together a set of disparate problems with a similar set of ownership structures .
There are solutions to the problem , Heller promises , though his talk stops short of exploring those in detail .
He hints that the discussions need to center on reforming patent laws invented for an age before DNA patents , or telecom patents and spectrum allocations appropriate to an earlier technological age .
Around the Berkman table there ’s some skepticism about the idea of anticommons .
Pushed on research in the field , Heller admits ( and is clear in his book ) that research on pharma companies reveals that they do n’t feel they ’re blocked by patent gridlock .
Heller argues that it ’s hard to ask practicioners about innovations they ’re not making – asking early airplane builders about passenger aircraft would have revealed skepticism about the whole proposition , not the problem of land use and public airports .
Yochai Benkler , who ’s written at length about the economics of commons production , pushes Heller for details , embracing the idea of the anticommons , but looking for specific ways out : do we need more commons ?
lower transaction costs ?
spot markets that make it easier to transact around property ?
Heller ( correctly ? ) summarizes his question , “ Very nice , but so what ? ”
He offers a possible way out : in cases of scarcity , private property makes sense , while in situations with no scarcity , a commons model makes more sense .
If it ’s possible to use telecoms whitespace in a non-rivalrous fashion , spectrum should be a commons ; if not , perhaps we need a more intelligent form of private property .
Heller worries that people are n’t taking suggestions for solving these problems seriously enough .
He ’s offered a solution for “ eminent - domain abuse ” , where the state can seize private property with compensation but not the owner ’s consent .
He argues that eminent domain is never fair to the property owner and always underprices – if the price was truly the price the owner wanted for the land , she ’d be willing to sell .
Heller authored a paper for the Harvard Law Review focused on “ land- assembly districts ” , a way in which communities could cooperate to assemble and sell their land and avoid expropriation .
He ’s concerned that the article , now out half a year , has n’t received a single comment , which makes him wonder about the value of articles versus books .
Benkler ultimately sees the problem about a mis-definition of the boundaries of property , suggesting that the gridlock scenario is a specific manifestation of poor definitions of property and a poor transactional system .
Clearly , that ’s the beginning of a much longer conversation , and one I ’m unqualified to act as scribe for .

If Obama campaign honchos David Axelrod and David Plouffe are worried about the next steps for their candidate , help is on the way .
With 51 days to go and polls showing that Republican nominee John McCain is either slightly ahead or tied with Barack Obama , there is plenty of advice this Sunday morning specifically geared to help the Democratic nominee .
Willie Brown , former Mayor of San Francisco , tells Obama to knock off the jokes .
And forget the comedy , Barack .
You are not naturally funny and you do not speak " street . "
You speak like a professor .
And you do not know how to set up a joke .
That " lipstick on a pig " line clearly backfired .
If you had said , " As John McCain said about Hillary Clinton 's health care ... lipstick on a pig is still a pig , " at least you would have had a frame of reference to fall back on .
You did n't , you left yourself left wide open and you got nailed .
Now everything you say will be double - examined for sexism .
Columnist Errol Lewis over at the New York Daily News says forget about Sarah Palin - focus your energy on John McCain .
Every day , in every speech , Obama needs to hammer home the Bush administration 's record of failure and remind voters that " McSame " has presented an astonishingly thin plan for rescuing the American middle class from lower wages , rising tuition prices and falling home values .
Obama 's message to swing voters infatuated with Palin should be : Sure , you like her , and why not ?
But teaching abstinence is n't going to lower your taxes , help with your kid's college tuition or save your job from being outsourced - and I have a plan that will .
Take a look .
Columnist Frank Rich at the New York Times says the Obama campaign needs to follow the advice of Karl Rove in dealing with Palin .
How do you run against that flashy flimflam ?
You do n’t .
Karl
Rove for once gave the Democrats a real tip rather than a bum steer when he wrote last week that if Obama wants to win , “ he needs to remember he ’s running against John McCain for president , ” not Palin for vice president .
Obama should keep stepping up the blitz on McCain ’s flip - flops , confusion , ignorance and blurriness on major issues ( from education to an exit date from Iraq ) , rather than her gaffes and résumé .
If he focuses voters on the 2008 McCain , the Palin question will take care of itself .
Joan Vennochi at the Boston Globe says do n't forget Senator Clinton .
Today , Obama needs Clinton .
He needs her to repeat often what she said to her supporters in Denver : " I want you to ask yourselves :
Were you in this campaign just for me ? "
It 's a good question for Clinton , too .
Just forget Palin says Toby Harnden over at Real Clear Politics .
It 's folly , of course , for Obama to be engaging with Palin .
It diminishes him by equating him with the number two on the other ticket .
And far from neutralizing the question mark over his experience , the discussion of her qualifications has ensured that his thin resume will remain front and center .
Obama should be giving Palin a good ignoring while his campaign hammers away at her record and McCain 's linkages to President George W. Bush - not his vetting process ( a Beltway preoccupation of no relevance beyond whether it missed anything damaging ) or her family .
What would Bill Clinton do ?
Politico's John Harris speculates that the former President could give Obama an eight - step guide to campaign success including step number seven :
Stop smoking whatever it is you are smoking .
One important thing to remember : Obama has never faced a serious race against a Republican .
His important victories in Illinois and this year have all been against other Democrats in nomination battles .
Some Clinton allies say this may tend to warp his perspective about how politics works and what kind of issues and stories matter in a presidential context .
Bottom line : it does not matter who is getting better coverage in the New York Times .
The Chicago Tribune 's Clarence Page says Obama needs to " get serious " and put the Clintons to work .
Obama should not let the niceties of liberal political correctness prevent his campaign from tying McCain and Palin to Bush .
Palin makes that easy .
She 's a harder hardliner than McCain .
The issue is not lipstick on a pig but a continuation of Bush years in high heels .
Obama also needs to put the Clintons to good use .
I do n't know what Obama and President Bill Clinton discussed in their private Sept. 11 lunch in New York , but Obama should have tuned in to advice from the master on how to reach those voters who have been the slowest to embrace Obama as " one of us . "
Comedian Paul Reiser over at the Huffington Post says there is only so much Obama can do .
Now everyone is calling for Obama to " get angry . "
" Get out there and frown this way , curl your lip that way , and clench your fist like so . "
And , I do n't know .....
That 'd be cool .
Sure .
But I do n't think the fix can come just from him .
There 's only so much the guy can do .
It 's going to have to be us .
I do n't know what exactly we need to do , but I know we 'll do it .
I have to believe -- I mean I really have to believe we 're big enough , strong enough and smart enough to reclaim what 's ours .
Finally , Michael Barone at U.S. News and World Report says the Obama campaign should n't look to the media for help .
Perhaps the Obama campaign strategists expected their many friends in the mainstream media to do their work for them .
Certainly they tried .
But their efforts have misfired , and the grenades they lobbed at Palin have ricocheted back and blown up in their faces .
Voters are on to their game .
Pollster Scott Rasmussen finds that 68 percent believe " most reporters try to help the candidate they want to win " and that 51 percent -- more than support McCain -- believe the press is " trying to hurt " Sarah Palin .
The press and the Democratic ticket are paying the price for decades of biased mainstream media coverage .
At the Sept. 26 debate , presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama were allowed by moderator Jim Lehrer to challenge each other directly .
Debates should be more than sound bites
Presidential debates are among the most watched broadcasts on TV , rarely surpassed by programming other than the Super Bowl and the most hotly contested NFL conference championships .
Given their popularity and importance , it is a shame that the debates , which promise so much , deliver so little .
Perhaps organizers could design a debate format that , even more than the one used throughout the 2008 campaign , gives the pretense of seriousness while diminishing the candidates for the highest office in the land and choking the flow of critical information to voters .
But debate organizers would have to apply their minds and summon reserves of inventiveness .

This year ’s presidential debates — along with the vice presidential debate , the endless primary debates and virtually all such debates in recent memory — are variations on a common format :
The candidates are limited to short answers , with few opportunities to elaborate on their ideas or respond to their opponents .
They face and address not each other but a moderator or panel drawn from the media .
The moderator or panel chooses and asks the questions , asks follow - ups , keeps candidates to their time and , in town - hall - style debates , serves as a buffer not only between the candidates but also between the candidates and the audience .
The system inflates the significance of the media , makes the candidates look small and weak , and squanders an excellent opportunity for the public to learn about the candidates ’ positions and their capacity for reasoned discussion .
In 2003 , the Debate Advisory Standards Project published “ The Debate Book , ” an extensive effort to establish “ fair and commonly accepted guidelines ” for political debates at the state and local level , drawing key lessons from presidential debates .
The advisory group found that 71 percent of voters believe debate rules should “ give candidates more time to explain their views on complex issues . ”
Voters , particularly undecided voters , were turned off by the spectacle of candidates having to jump from one difficult policy question to another while compressing their answers into 30 - to - 90 - second sound bites .
Nonetheless , debate organizers seem wedded to the idea that the number of topics in a debate should expand while the time to answer them shrinks .
Not one of 11 alternative debate formats outlined in “ The Debate Book ” allowed a candidate to speak for longer than three minutes at a time .
None of the two - candidate debate formats allotted more than 12 minutes for both to discuss a topic .
Many experts believe that media panels are ineffective , not least due to long - winded questions designed to provoke gaffes , corner candidates or simply show off the journalist ’s brilliance .
Inexplicably , moderators are still considered indispensable .
To provide voters — especially undecideds — a higher - quality discussion on the leading issues , presidential debates should increase the time devoted to discrete topics , eliminate moderators and panels , and enable candidates to challenge each other directly .
( John McCain and Barack Obama were allowed to question and challenge each other in the first debate , but they tended to address moderator Jim Lehrer instead .
Lehrer ’s repeated and often unheeded appeals for them to talk to one another only emphasized that direct exchange between candidates is hampered rather than helped by the presence of a moderator . )
Here ’s one way to do it :
Put both candidates at an oval table , half - facing each other and half - facing a single , stationary camera .
The 90 - minute debate would be divided into four 20 - minute blocks , each devoted to a single issue — such as the economy , health care , terrorism or education .
One minute would be given for one of the candidates , as determined by a coin toss , to pose a question at the start of the debate ; the candidates would then alternate questions for the next three rounds .
Instead of a moderator , a clock of the sort used in chess would be placed between the two candidates .
Once Candidate
A finished his questions , he would press the clock , which would turn off his microphone and activate Candidate B’s .
Candidate B could use whatever part of his 10 minutes he wished to answer .
When he finished , he would hit the clock , tossing the issue back to Candidate A , and so forth , giving each candidate 10 minutes to make his case and challenge his opponent .
The debate would continue in this manner through four rounds , ending with the candidates each delivering a three - minute concluding statement .
Such a format makes the candidates the main attraction .
It gives them time to lay out their positions and to probe an opponent ’s positions .
It allows the public to get a sense of the candidates ’ preparation on the issues and their ability to think on their feet .
It even has the potential to generate enough excitement and drama to catapult the presidential debates beyond the Super Bowl in the ratings .

One reason the latest bailout plan has n't worked yet ?
Banks have finally decided ( temporarily ) not to lend money to folks that can't pay them back .
That would be US consumers -- the customers who account for 70 % of the spending in the economy .

September Retail Sales Awful :
All major components of retail sales posted a drop in sales during September , with the exception
of a 0.1 % increase in gasoline and a 0.4 % gain in the health and personal care component .
Consumer Spending Will Decline In Q3 For First Time Since 1991
As Houses , Stocks Plummet , Consumers Getting Poorer At Astounding Rate :
The decline in net worth in the third quarter will mark the fourth consecutive quarterly reduction .
It is worth noting that during the three quarters ended in June 2008 , household net worth has fallen $ 2.69 trillion compared with a $ 3.19 trillion decline in net worth during the 2000 - 2002 period .
In other words , the latest three - quarter drop in net worth is a staggering 85 % of the reduction in net worth which occurred over a three year period .
Consumer Debt Still At Record Levels :
Consumer Saving Minimal :
Not pretty pictures .
As Asha observes , at a minimum , it will take several quarters for this situation to work itself out and for the economy to begin growing again .
And it 's hard to imagine banks rushing to lend all that new capital the US taxpayers will soon be handing them until the US taxpayers ' personal balance sheets are in better shape .

Banks will face new curbs on home repossessions to prevent families from being evicted when they fall into financial difficulties , the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has promised .
The pledge was made by Yvette Cooper in an interview with The Observer as the government braces itself this week for official confirmation that Britain is entering recession for the first time since the early Nineties .
Rising unemployment is expected to trigger a wave of mortgage defaults as people who lose their jobs find themselves unable to keep up payments on their homes .
Repossessions have already increased to 19,000 in the first half of this year - a 40 per cent increase on the previous six months .
Experts believe the figure will climb to 26,000 in the second half of 2008 .
The total number of people suffering negative equity is expected to rise to around two million as house prices plunge .
Ministers believe that after pumping billions of pounds of public money into rescuing banks , taxpayers will expect greater leniency from their lenders when they struggle to meet mortgage payments .
' We need a more responsible approach to repossessions , ' Cooper said in the interview .
' What we are looking at is something looking much more widely at all of the banks , because I think repossession needs to be lot rarer .
We need to do everything that we can to keep people in their own homes . '
However , with figures this week expected to show Britain 's economy shrinking over the last quarter - the first of what is widely expected to be the two quarters of negative growth required to confirm a recession - Cooper warned that the government could not stop the economic tide .
' It 's clearly going to be tougher times ahead .
I do n't think any government can prevent economic slowdown , faced with the kind of global problems that we have had , ' she said .
' What we can do is step in and , by dealing with the problems in the banking system , prevent the worst of the credit squeeze hitting people . '
Her words reflect a battle that is developing between Labour and the Tories over how to tackle problems in the real economy that are now squeezing ordinary Britons .
There were signs last night that Labour , more than the Tories , is benefiting from the crisis : a survey published today for the political website Politicshome.com shows the Prime Minister 's popularity ratings bouncing back to the levels he last enjoyed in April , before the summer 's leadership doubts .
And a separate ComRes survey for today 's Independent on Sunday shows the Conservative lead has been cut to just nine points - the smallest gap between the parties since last March .
Seeking to stop Brown's ' bounce ' ,
Tory leader David Cameron has called today for new measures to keep people in jobs , including a VAT holiday for small businesses , which would enable them to defer paying tax bills for up to six months , and putting pressure on councils to pay what they owe to small businesses faster .
Writing in The Observer , Cameron adds : ' We intervened to prevent the beating heart of our economy - the financial system - from collapsing .
We 've got to do the same for its lifeblood .
Small and medium - sized businesses employ over 13 million people and turn over £ 1,440 bn a year . '
The Tories will unveil further measures on jobs and homes , amid fears their consensus agreement with Labour over the banking crisis has left them sidelined .
But as President George Bush confirmed last night he would convene a summit of world leaders to address the economic crisis , following lobbying from EU leaders , Chancellor Alistair Darling sought to reinforce the message that Labour would help hard - working families through the looming recession .
He told the Sunday Telegraph : ' You will see us switching our spending priorities to areas which make a difference . '
Areas that could benefit include housing , energy and small businesses .
Capital projects , including two new aircraft carriers , as well as London 's £ 16 bn Crossrail transport project , would go ahead .

Dems get new crop of military voters
An interesting subtext to John McCain ’s defeat last week is what it means for the future of the Republican Party with respect to veterans and military voters .
With McCain facing a diminished role in the GOP , and Chuck Hagel retiring from the Senate , there are few prominent Republican leaders left with military bona fides .
This is in stark contrast to the Democratic Party , which has seen the emergence of a new generation of veteran leaders .
In the past two election cycles , Democrats have added ten new Democratic veterans to Congress .
Last week , President - elect Barack Obama helped close the gap among military voters , winning 44 percent of veterans as opposed to John F. Kerry ’s 41 percent in 2004 .

To anyone who survived the bruising campaigns of the 1990’s , the thought that the Republican Party would surrender its stranglehold on military voters seems unbelievable .
But the reality is that this image was never more than surface deep .
All those political operatives who seemed to care so deeply about the heroic service of Republican nominees in 1992 and 1996 thought nothing of denigrating and attacking the service of Al Gore and John Kerry when it was the Republican candidate who had avoided serving in Vietnam .
Republicans did not always have a lock on military voters .
Prior to Vietnam , military service was seen as an obligation of all Americans – regardless of political affiliation or wealth .
George H.W. Bush and John F. Kennedy were both sons of privileged , politically - connected families who served heroically in the military during World War II .
Back then , this was seen as your duty as an American – and no political party could lay an exclusive claim to the flag .
The GOP ’s ability to market itself as the “ Party of the Military ” grew in large part from schisms in the electorate arising during the Vietnam era .
For a generation , Republicans exploited George McGovern ’s 1972 campaign as a means to brand Democrats as unpatriotic and weak on national security – never mind the fact that McGovern flew 35 bombing missions over Europe during WWII and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross .
It was during these formative years as a budding Republican operative that Karl Rove learned the tools of the trade .
Ironically , Rove avoided serving in Vietnam so he could sharpen the political skills he would later use to brand Al Gore a fraud , Max Cleland a coward , and John Kerry a traitor .
Never mind that Al Gore enlisted in the Army ; Max Cleland left three limbs on the battlefield ; and John Kerry fought his way to three Purple Hearts and a Silver Star .
For decades , Republicans have worked to perfect the art of lapel pin patriotism – creating and exploiting iconic imagery for political gain while neglecting the substantive needs of our veterans .
We see the devastating effect of this focus on rhetoric over reality in the dismal treatment of our wounded heroes at Walter Reed , attempts to block the new GI Bill , and the Bush Administration ’s failure to adequately fund mental health care .
For all the GOP ’s patriotic imagery and testosterone - infused rhetoric , the sad truth is that most of the current crop of Republican leaders – Rudy Giuliani ; Mitt Romney ; Newt Gingrich ; Mitch McConnell ; John Boehner ; etc. – were all of age at the time of Vietnam but avoided serving in the military .
President Bush has almost single - handedly ended the GOP ’s lock on veteran and military voters through his tragic mismanagement of the war in Iraq .
I have seen the change among active duty members of the military firsthand .
Our families have been torn apart by the intolerable rate and length of deployments – and even many solidly conservative members of the military will privately question the competence of Republican leaders .
Now , it will be up to a Democratic president to rebuild a military that has been pushed to the breaking point by a Republican .
President - elect Obama will rebuild the military for the 21st Century by increasing the size of the Marine Corps and Army ; restoring the readiness of the National Guard and Reserves ; and fully equipping service members for the missions they face .
Domestically , the party that rushed us into war in Iraq has abandoned the needs of veterans here at home .
It was a Democratic senator , Jim Webb of Virginia , who led the successful fight against the Bush Administration for a new GI Bill .
It has been Democrats who have fought to expand health benefits for veterans , improve access to health care for reservists , and cut through the red tape at the VA .
The success of Democratic veteran candidates has reinforced this trend .
This new generation of leaders is making its mark on the Democratic Party and changing the conventional wisdom on political support among veterans and military voters .
This is not to say that Democrats are inherently more patriotic than Republicans .
There are honorable people from all walks of life and political affiliations serving in the military today .
But no longer will the party of Harry Truman and John Kennedy sit idly by while Republicans attack our commitment and dedication to our country .

The Atlantic :
( T) he Washington Post ’s James Grimaldi published a fairly damning piece suggesting , with a good deal of evidence , that John and Cindy McCain were beneficiaries of special treatment from Verizon and AT&T — the implication being that the companies had sought to curry favor with the former Senate Commerce committee chairman by erecting cell phone towers at the McCains ’ remote Arizona ranch .
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers responded that the towers were temporary , the result of a Secret Service request and , while conceding that Cindy McCain had made a separate , earlier request for the towers that predated her husband ’s status as Republican presidential nominee , added , “ Mrs. McCain 's staff went through the Website as any member of the general public would — no string pulling , no phone calls , no involvement of Senate staff . ”
Today , a Verizon spokesman , Jeffrey Nelson , took greater umbrage , attacking the Post story as “ wrong ” and stating that the company , after studying McCain ’s request , decided in August not to install a permanent tower at the ranch .
“ It does n’t make business sense for us to do that , ” Nelson told the Post .
So is this an innocent mix - up , or did McCain get special treatment from Verizon ?
The Post piece points out that Verizon ’s CEO Ivan G. Seidenberg is a McCain bundler who has raised more than $ 1.3 million , and the company ’s head Washington lobbyist , Robert Fisher , is a former McCain staffer .
That alone is intriguing , but not , of course , evidence of any wrongdoing .
But putting up a cell phone tower is a process that entails many legal and regulatory hurdles that create a lengthy public record ( some of which Grimaldi draws on for his piece ) .
And the closer you look , the less satisfying McCain ’s — and especially Verizon ’s — account of the towers turns out to be .
Whatever its motivation , Verizon plainly went to considerable effort and expense to pursue building a permanent tower on the McCains ’ ranch .

Director files complaint about UC Davis band

When he was hired as director of the loud , rowdy Cal Aggie Marching Band at UC Davis , nobody told Tom Slabaugh about the tradition of " naked van . "
But on last year 's road trip to the football game with Portland State , a trumpet player yelled " naked van ! " and everybody in the vehicle - men and women alike - stripped to their underwear .
Slabaugh ordered band members to put their clothes back on , but they ignored him , he said in a memo to university officials .
Meanwhile , a sousaphone player and a clarinetist wrote " I BOOBS " in masking tape on the van 's window , causing a motorist who saw the van on I - 5 in Oregon to complain to the university .
The naked van episode was one in a series of " ridiculous , disturbing and offensive " incidents , some of them alcohol - fueled , that Slabaugh says he witnessed in his year with the Cal Aggies , according to a copy of his memo obtained by The Chronicle .
On the band 's fall retreat in 2007 , four drunken band members were caught urinating in a dormitory elevator , and at band picnic day , four others took their uniform pants down and simulated the incident for a photographer .
At outdoor rehearsals , male band members dropped their pants to get a laugh , while women sometimes stripped to their bras , he wrote , and one evening practice was disrupted when a bass drummer began performing lap dances .
' Sexualized ' comments
Drunken hazing of band members also occurred , he said , and posters tacked to the walls of the rehearsal room were defaced with crude and " sexualized " comments .
When Slabaugh tried to get the band to behave , he said he faced a barrage of obscene insults and gestures - even a lewd Christmas card from the trombone section .
Frustrated because he did n't have the power to expel out - of - control musicians from the student - run band , Slabaugh took the unusual step of filing a sexual harassment complaint with the university in May .
The Cal Aggie band is a " hostile work environment , " he wrote .
Members of the band 's leadership council declined to be interviewed for this story .
" I 'm not really willing to talk about anything anyone has done , " one said .
Meanwhile , Slabaugh is on stress leave and unavailable for comment , said his lawyer , Chad Carlock .
When Slabaugh was hired , he knew there were " issues " with the band , the lawyer said , but he believed the university would give him the power to clean the problems up .
" We 're still hopeful that 's the case , " the lawyer said .
" I 'd like to get him back to work . "
' Over the cliff '
Through the years , marching bands at many colleges have gotten in trouble for wild behavior - Stanford 's band , for example , has repeatedly been suspended .
But what 's going on at UC Davis may be uniquely problematic , said Wayne Erickson , western division president for the College Band Directors National Association .
" I 've never heard of it getting to that point , " said Erickson , who is also band director at Utah Valley State College .
" It sounds like they 've driven in the ditch and over the cliff . "
In response to Slabaugh 's complaints , Lisa Brodkey , a university sexual harassment officer , gave sexual harassment training to the band , she said in an Aug. 12 letter .
Brodkey also did a walk - through of the band room and ordered offensive " signs , pictures , condoms , etc. " removed from the walls , she wrote .
UC Davis was considering whether to give Slabaugh the power to expel unruly band members , she wrote .
Band in trouble before
Vice Chancellor Janet Gong declined to comment on the band director 's complaint or the band 's behavior , saying she was prohibited by privacy laws .
Slabaugh , 44 , is a veteran band director and music educator who is completing a doctorate in musical arts from the University of Washington .
In 2007 , he was hired to teach in the UC Davis music department as well as to direct the Cal Aggie band , which prides itself on loud music and exuberant behavior .
The band 's 2002 CD was titled " Noise Violation . "
At performances , the public - address announcer introduces the ensemble as : " Fast , furious and foaming at the mouth ... bold , blue and bitchin ' ... the pride of the Regents of the University of California ... the spirit of the Davis campus . "
The band also has been in trouble before .
In 1992 , after a woman accused the student band leader of sexual harassment , the university put the band on probation and ordered reforms , the Sacramento Bee reported .
Run by students
Nevertheless , the band remains a student - run organization with almost all activities - including even conducting rehearsals - the responsibility of a council of 12 band members , according to the band 's Web site .
When Slabaugh arrived , the band had n't had a faculty director in four years .
From the start , Slabaugh found rehearsals disrupted by " impolite talking , inappropriate and obscene gestures , dropping of pants and women removing their shirts , " he wrote .
He said he could n't get the band to shape up because students ignored his admonitions .
Problems with horn section
That left him the choice of turning his back on outrageous behavior or reporting it to the administration .
When he reported bad conduct , he said the university would n't back him up , and the band got mad at him .
For example , in April , while marching to practice , a trumpeter deliberately broke a wooden security gate on the street near the Plant Sciences Building , and Slabaugh called the campus police , according to the memo .
But no arrest was made , and the incident angered another trumpeter , who later made obscene hand gestures at Slabaugh during practice and rammed his shoulder into the band director when they met in a hallway , the memo states .
' We are adults '
On another occasion , Slabaugh said he found a bass drummer drinking beer in the drum room and urged the band council to punish her .
After she was suspended for two weeks , her friends blamed Slabaugh .
" We are adults and you need to respect that , " a trumpeter e-mailed him .
" You owe the band an apology for your attitude since the beginning of your employment here . "
The band 's rudeness took other forms .
When Slabaugh brought his 9 - year - old daughter into the band room to sell Girl Scout cookies , someone had written " F- Slabaugh " on the whiteboard .
The director wrote that he did n't bring his family around after that .
Lewd Christmas card
At Christmas , he received a card signed by trombone players with a picture of Santa Claus .
" I saw you masturbating , " the message read .
In his memo , and in meetings , Slabaugh urged UC Davis to give him the power to remove bad actors from the band .
In her August letter , the sexual harassment officer agreed that " this is a critical area to be resolved , " but nothing was done .
The band director went on leave in September .
Attached to Slabaugh 's memo were photos of the band from picnic day in April .
They included the shot of the four musicians pretending to urinate ; a photo of band members with their uniform pants down ; and another photo that he said showed the equipment manager " simulating oral copulation " on a trombone player .
The photos were for sale on the Internet , he wrote , although recently some have been taken down .
Earlier on Boing Boing , Cory blogged that President - elect Barack Obama has appointed Net Neutrality advocates and " virtual worlds nuts " Kevin Werbach and Susan Crawford to co-chair his FCC transition team .
Okay , so we might know the guy as Kevin Werbach out here in meatspace , but to his Terror Nova Guild buddies , he 's better known as Supernovan Jenkins ( the first name presumably a reference to Werbach 's Supernova tech conference series ) , and he 's a Level 70 Tauren Shaman .
Livejournaler Waltermonkey opines on the deeper meaning of Werbach 's WoW identity :
What does this tell us about him , as a person , as a gamer , as a government official ?
I will attempt to translate all the dorkese .
1. – CULTURAL RELATIVISM
Every player in WoW belongs to one of two warring factions , Alliance or Horde .
Werbach is Horde .
Children often choose to be Alliance because they perceive them as " the good guys " , but students of history ( both ours and Azeroth 's ) recognize that Alliance culture is based on medieval European culture and Horde culture is based on the indigenous cultures that were supplanted by the West .
Werbach is a Tauren ( a minotaur ) , which basically makes him a Native Kalimdorian .
The Tauren revere nature , living in wigwams near giant totem poles .
As a Shaman ( see below ) , he could also have chosen a troll ( blue - skinned Jamaican - like monster ) or an orc ( green - skinned Klingon - like monster ) , so there must be something about the cow - man that appeals to his liberal guilt .
The house sparrow feeds on insects like aphids during the summer months
The population of house sparrows in Britain has fallen by 68 % in the past three decades , according to the RSPB .
A report by the charity said the paving over of front gardens and removal of trees had caused a big decline in insects that the birds eat .
It suggests sparrows are now disappearing altogether from cities such as London , Bristol and Edinburgh .
Dr Will Peach , from the RSPB , said many gardens had become " no - go areas for once - common British birds " .
Starving chicks Scientists from the RSPB joined forces with De Montfort University and Natural England to investigate the decline of the house sparrow .
They studied numbers in Leicester over a three - year period and found that they fell by more than two thirds .
Dr Peach said every pair of house sparrows must raise at least five chicks a year to maintain the population , but many were starving to death in their nests or were too weak to live long after fledging .
The study did find that chick survival was higher in areas where insects , such as aphids , were more abundant .
[ Gardeners can help by ] being lazy , doing nothing and allowing the garden to be a little bit scruffy
Dr Will Peach , RSPB Dr Peach said : " Peanuts and seeds are great for birds for most of the year , but sparrows need insects in summer - and lots of them - to feed their hungry young .
" Honeysuckle , wild roses , hawthorn or fruit trees are perfect for insects and therefore house sparrows .
" The trend towards paving of front gardens and laying decking in the back , and the popularity of ornamental plants from other parts of the world , has made many gardens no - go areas for once common British birds . "
He said gardeners could help sparrows by " being lazy , doing nothing and allowing the garden to be a little bit scruffy " .

The study , published in the journal Animal Conservation , concluded that the decline in house sparrows in Britain began in the mid-1980s .
In London , numbers fell by 60 % between 1994 and 2004 .
The house sparrow has been added to the list of species identified by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan as in need of greater protection .

New Solar Power Material Can Capture Every Color of the Rainbow
October 19th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Scientists have created a new material that could dramatically increase the efficiency of solar cells , by literally capturing every color of the rainbow .
Whereas other materials only catch a small range of light frequencies , and therefore only a small fraction of the potential energy , the new invention is capable of absorbing all the energy contained in sunlight .
According to team leader , Prof. Malcolm Chisolm , “ There are other such hybrids out there , but the advantage of our material is that we can cover the entire range of the solar spectrum . “
The discovery , made by an elite team at Ohio State University , opens the door to the development of a new generation of hyper - efficient solar cells .
Although at this point the material is said to be some years from commercial development , the university has enough confidence in its potential to commit a large slice of its $ 100 million ‘ high impact ’ research budget to the research team over the next five years .
Such long - term investment lends a great deal of credibility to the project , and is likely to increase the chances of the invention moving from the laboratory towards commercial development .

Obama 's plan to " spread the wealth " sounds especially good to those who do n't have a pot to -- let me rephrase that -- sounds especially good to those who do n't have an urn to urinate in .
" Why , " the urn - less say , " should some have so much while I have so little ? "
Why indeed ?
Not only should Obama spread the wealth , I also hope he might find a way to " spread the health . "
" Why , " many ask , " should some be healthy while I am plagued by a litany of infirmities and disease ? "
I discussed this with the leading liberal in our neighborhood , Al the Athlete , who is a picture of vitality and envied by everyone .
" Al , " I said , " if Obama could find a way -- and surely he can -- would you be willing to spread your health around ? "
" How so ? "
Al asked , sipping carrot juice and jogging in place .
" From now on , " I said , " instead of feeling great all the time , would you agree to accept a couple of bad colds a year , some respiratory problems , joint pain , higher cholesterol and maybe even a touch of diabetes ? "
" Why would I do that ? "
Al asked .
" I 'm healthy because I run six miles a day , do n't drink or smoke , lift weights , eat sensibly , go to bed early and do all things in moderation . "
" You would do it , Al , " I said , getting impatient , " because it just is n't fair some people are healthier than others .
We should all be a little bit healthy , and all be a little bit sick . "
" Well , if Obama says it 's the right thing to do , I will , " Al said .
" But if we 're going to spread the health I 'm not busting my butt anymore .
No more running , no more weightlifting , no more nothing !
Have you got a smoke ? "
" Sure , Al , " I said , " and how do you take your bourbon -- straight up or on the rocks ? "
Things just got even tougher in Texas .
The Lone Star state , which prides itself on its macho Western cowboy image , is now to have the first school district in America in which teachers can carry concealed guns .
The tiny community of Harrold , in the far north of the state , has recently approved a local decision that allows its teachers to bring firearms to school to protect against possible shootings .
So when the school re-opens after the long summer holiday , any of the college 's 50 or so staff could bring pistols to their classrooms .
The decision is likely to provoke uproar in other parts of America and will shock gun control advocates , who argue that teachers with guns in class actually escalate the chance of a shooting .
However , those arguments have cut little ice with the authorities in the Harrold school district .
They are worried that a steady stream of shootings in schools and colleges in America will eventually reach their small , isolated region .
Although that seems unlikely , school shootings are a real problem in America .
Last month , three people were wounded at a shooting in Phoenix , Arizona .
Local officials have argued that the single campus in their 110 - student district is too far away from the nearest sheriff 's office if there were an emergency .
They have also said that a nearby main road might increase the chances of a dangerous gunman attacking the school .
In a local newspaper interview , David Thweatt , the superintendent of the Harrold Independent School District , defended the decision and said keeping guns out of schools was more dangerous than having them in .
' When the federal government started making schools gun- free zones , that 's when all of these shootings started .
Why would you put it out there that a group of people can't defend themselves ?
That 's like saying " sic em " to a dog , ' Thweatt told the Fort Worth Star - Telegram .

Fast food a potential risk factor for Alzheimer's
Katarina Sternudd , Karolinska Institutet Informationsavdelningen / Communications Department

28.11.2008 10:51
Mice that were fed a diet rich in fat , sugar and cholesterol for nine months developed a preliminary stage of the morbid irregularities that form in the brains of Alzheimer 's patients .
The study results , published in a doctoral thesis from the Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet , give some indications of how this difficult to treat disease might one day be preventable .
Alzheimer 's is the most common form of dementia , there being roughly 90,000 patients with the disease in Sweden today .
The underlying causes of Alzheimer 's disease are still something of a mystery , but there are a number of known risk factors .
The most common is a variant of a certain gene that governs the production of apolipoprotein E , one of the functions of which is to transport cholesterol .
The gene variant is called apoE4 and is found in 15 - 20 per cent of the population .
For her doctoral thesis , Susanne Akterin studied mice that had been genetically modified to mimic the effects of apoE4 in humans .
The mice were then fed for nine months on a diet rich in fat , sugar and cholesterol , representing the nutritional content of most fast food .
" On examining the brains of these mice , we found a chemical change not unlike that found in the Alzheimer brain , " says Ms Akterin , postgraduate at KI Alzheimers 's Disease Research Center .
The change in question was an increase in phosphate groups attached to tau , a substance that forms the neurofibrillary tangles observed in Alzheimer 's patients .
These tangles prevent the cells from functioning normally , which eventually leads to their death .
Ms Akterin and her team also noted indications that cholesterol in food reduced levels of another brain substance , Arc , a protein involved in memory storage .
" We now suspect that a high intake of fat and cholesterol in combination with genetic factors , such as apoE4 , can adversely affect several brain substances , which can be a contributory factor in the development of Alzheimer 's , " says Susanne Akterin .
Previous research has shown that a phenomenon known as oxidative stress in the brain and a relatively low intake of dietary antioxidants can also increase the risk of Alzheimer's .
Ms Akterin has now demonstrated in her thesis that two antioxidants are dysfunctional in the brains of Alzheimer patients , which can lead to nerve cell death .
" All in all , the results give some indication of how Alzheimer 's can be prevented , but more research in this field needs to be done before proper advice can be passed on to the general public , " she says .

The first thing you have to do is make it a proper function that you can work with for the slope formula .
You want to change it so that it is set equal to y .
8x=4y - 4
8x+4=4y
( 8x+4) /4=y
y= ( 2x+1 )
Then , you want to graph the function and find two points on the line .
( 0,1 ) and ( 1,3 )
Then , you want to apply the equation to the slope formula
m ( slope ) = ( y2 - y1 ) /(x2-x1 )
x1=0 x2=1
y 1=1 y2=3
m=( 3 - 1 ) / ( 1-0 )

A teacher has been found guilty of dangerous driving after being stopped by police for having 13 people travelling in his Volvo car .
Abraham Gniwosch , from Tottenham , north London , pleaded not guilty to dangerous driving in Llandudno , Conwy , on 8 August last year .
He was given a 12 month driving ban and ordered to pay over £ 900 in a fine and costs by Llandudno magistrates .
Gniwosch , 31 , was also ordered to take an extended driving test .
Magistrates heard how his Volvo S70 was meant to carry five passengers only and the prosecution asked for the car to be confiscated .
However the magistrates decided against it .
Overloading
Traffic policeman , Pc Roger Brazel told the court he had stopped the car just as it turned into a farm park near Mostyn Avenue in the town .
The court heard Abraham Gniwosch had been driving for five years
He said he had done this because of the " serious dramatic overloading " in Gniwosch 's red Volvo saloon .
The court heard how an adult male and a boy were sitting in the passenger seat .
In the back there were two women with infants on their laps , the other six passengers , all young children were either sitting or standing in the centre section of the back seat .
None of the passengers was wearing a seatbelt .
Slow driving
The defendant denied his action was dangerous saying he had been driving sensibly at no more than 20 mph .
" I 'm not a quick driver , I 'm a slow driver , " he said .
" I 've been silly in what I 've done , but not dangerous . "
Chairman of the bench , Sandra Walker , said they had taken into consideration Gniwosch 's good character .
" This is a very unusual case of gross overloading where a financial penalty was appropriate , " said Ms Walker .
" Buffling outside of the office could be due in part to the explosion in business reality TV shows , such as Dragons Den , The Apprentice and more recently , Natural Born Sellers , where buffling is commonplace and often positively encouraged among those fighting it out for fame and the best job .

Everyone ’s got the candy of their generation , their neighborhood , and their tastes .
What sugary delights sent young minds to greats heights when you were a kid ?
Well , let ’s share .
Here are some highlights from fourth grade :
9. Lotsa Fizz .
Also known by its more convenient nickname ‘ Fizz ’ , these candies masqueraded as a regular ol ’ hard candy , the kind you might find in a doctor ’s office or a crystal dish in your grandma ’s front foyer .
Other than the snake - like packaging , linking individually - wrapped pieces together , there appeared to be nothing special about them .
However , once you crunched into them , they released a tingly , carbonated bubble - liquid that sizzled and frothed on the tongue .
A real advancement in the candy surprise effect .
8. Massive , fist - sized Jawbreakers aka Dinosour Eggs .
The big question here was who could fit these in all the way ?
Occasionally , a local big mouth would manage to squeeze it up in there , and then proceed to nearly suffocate while trying to simultaneously breathe and speed - suck the jawbreaker down to a smaller size with drool flying everywhere .
It was n’t pretty .
You were actually watching them OD right in front of you .
Of course , others would simply leave the giant jawbreaker on their night table and have a few licks before bedtime , spending a year or so patiently turning the smooth sphere it into a faded , rubbed - out rainbow of dried spit and sugar .
Whatever you think about these things , they definitely came out on top of the Total Candy Minutes Per Dollar ranking .
7. Pez .
Was it just me , or did Pez have a kind of weird taste ?
Do n’t get me wrong — the dispenser alone was enough for some great memories , despite some questionable versions over the years .
6. Tear Jerkers aka Sour Balls .
At the time , Tear Jerkers were a futuristic advancement in Artificial Souring Technology .
They caused a massive sugar high epidemic at my grade school , with kids running over to the variety store at lunch to grab a new bag , daring each other to eat two or three at a time .
The gum that remained after the sour powder was gone was always a wet , syrupy disappointment , and usually ended up in the trash to make more room in your mouth .
But that sour powder packed a punch and it often left the insides of your cheeks all inflammed and torn up for the rest of the week .
And of course , there was always the big question : who has the guts to eat the leftover patch of sour powder in the corner of the bag ?
5. Fun Dip aka Lik - M- Aid .
Fun Dip was an entirely new way to eat your candy :
Lick an edible candy stick and then use your own spit as glue to collect all the sugar - powder below .
Well , it was a great long - lasting treat , as long as your stick did n’t come broken when you bought it .
If that happened , you had to dive in with your wet finger instead .
But you had to be careful , because it was that mark of the stained , purple finger that gave away why you were n’t hungry at dinner time .
A lot of people would finish off by eating the actual stick itself for good measure which is sort of like eating your fork after finishing your pie .
4. Hot and Cold Nerds .
Nerds was always a decent backup selection — it filled up the candy bag but was rarely the first pick .
Sure , that little box of tiny , hard , asteroid - shaped candy offered two flavors in one box , but there was nothing too special about picking up Watermelon and Grape or Strawberry and Lemon .
That is , until Nerds came out with the temperature - themed Hot and Cold Nerds box in the late 80s .
Sure , maybe it was just bright , red cinnamon and bright , blue wintergreen , but it sure was fun alternatingly burning and freezing sensations in your mouth .
Of course , there were always two kinds of Nerds kids — the slow , tantric , shake - it - in - your - hands - and - savor - it kids , and the minute men who instead preferred the all - in - one - go , head - tilt , box - shake manouver .
3. Bizarre Forms of Gum .
Remember the glory days where gum came in so many different forms ?
There was baseball card gum , shattering and cutting the inside of your mouth like glass when you bit into it .
There was Big League Chew , the shredded chewing tobacco gum .
And of course there were Bubble Jugs , Bubble Tape , and even Bubble Gum Squeeze Tubes , which you pushed into your mouth like toothpaste , though with the exact opposite effect .
2. Pixy Stix .
I always admired the straight - shooting style of Pixy Stix .
Unlike the other candies , they did n’t dress up and pretend to be anything besides sugar .
They were the real deal , straight up , just sugar in a straw .
You want something gummy , sticky , sour , or chewy ?
Try the other guys .
Now , if you want plain sugar , you ’ve come to the right place .
Available in regular size and occasionaly a Super Jumbo Straw version .
Just be careful you do n’t get dry - throat and gag on it when your brother pours a strawful down your throat .
1. Popeye Cigarettes .
These ones were the real deal , before they took off the red tip at the end and rebranded them as ‘ Popeye ’s Candy Sticks . ’
Yes , after a dark , moody stint with the patch , Popeye managed to finally kick the habit .
But good thing , or he probably would n’t be with us today .
Yes , finding and chowing down on some of the candies you grew up with is like sucking on sugary memories .
Because how did it feel walking out of your local corner store with a wide smile pasted across your face , an empty wallet , and an armful full of candy ?
I think we all know the answer to that .
AWESOME !

Here is every loan series the Federal Reserve Band of St. Louis finds it worthwhile to report in FRED ( the title of the section is " Banking : Loans " ) .
These are all percentage changes in quantities ( expressed in billions of dollars ) from a year earlier , not prices :
Do either of the cited links present any data at all on the quantity of credit ?
No .
Many people cite prices / rates / spreads as evidence for the crisis but what we ultimately care about is quantity not price .
The Fed. piece had lots of data on the quantity of credit .
Where is the rebuttal ?
I suppose now I 'll get told why the St. Louis Fed data does n't answer the question , or something , but if it 's evidence of a decline in loan growth that Alex is after , I do n't think it 's hard to find .
[ Update : I realize that growth rates are still positive and relatively high in some cases -- even real estate loan growth remains above previous troughs -- and that can be interpreted as lack of evidence of a big problem .
But I thought the claim was there is no evidence of a fall off in loan activity .
The graphs above show there has been an impact , it 's not negative yet , but there has been a sharp downturn .
It also suggests that if the downturn follows previous patterns - and hopefully Fed intervention or private sector adjustment will prevent that ( see the hopeful signs at the end of some of the series above ) - but if it does repeat the pattern , we still have a long way to go before things turn around . ]
Update : See Tyler Cowen 's evidence in There is a Credit Crunch .
Yet still , the Bank must slash rates , we 're told , because of " the spectre of deflation " .
I say Boo ! to that ghost .
Our political elite are talking about deflation not because it's a real danger , or because they know much about it , but because " deflation " is a good excuse for yanking monetary policy back from the Bank of England and nailing interest rates to the floor in the desperate hope such drastic moves will solve our problems .
They have n't won the White House or cemented a filibuster - proof , 60 - vote Senate majority , but confident Democrats are already looking past November 4 to Election Day 2010 .
Their goal is to avoid mistakes while pushing a bold , voter - savvy plan that could break history 's pattern and help them build on their majority .
The gee - whiz idea : balancing the federal budget .
" Nobody would think we could do it .
That 's why it 's so bold and a winner for us , " says a key Democratic Senate aide .
And , he says , it 's better than the alternative :
If the Dems do get 60 senators and squander their advantage , they fear voters will sack them in 2010 .
Police could have avoided 5 percent of their shootings if cops were carrying stun guns instead of just their service weapons – and the NYPD is now considering equipping its entire force with the devices , officials said .
A study by the RAND think tank found that in 25 cases , from 2004 to 2006 , NYPD officers could have subdued suspects by using Tasers instead of bullets .
“ In a small number of cases . . . the outcomes might have been different if the officers had a less - than - lethal device other than pepper spray , ” analyst Dr. Bernard Rostker said .
Of those cases , three resulted in a fatality .
But they represent just a fraction of the 455 police - involved shootings , 45 of which were fatal , that were examined in the $ 350,000 RAND study .
Race – either of the victim or cop – was n’t considered .
Most of the suspects in the police - involved shootings were already in a gun battle with cops , one official said .
“ The others were either shooting or stabbing someone else , or armed with axes , guns and knives , ” he said .
The NYPD requested the report in the wake of the Sean Bell shooting – which was not considered – to examine its firearm training and discharge review process .
The think tank looked at three years ’ worth of police - involved shootings examined by the NYPD ’s firearms - discharge review board .
In the cases where Tasers could have been used , there was n’t an issue with the legality of the shooting but rather the escalation of the situation to gunfire could have been avoided , Rostker said .
Researchers found “ Tasers reduce injuries to citizens , reduce injuries to police and reduce the use of firearms ” and are primarily used in situations that involve emotionally disturbed persons .
The researchers also suggested the NYPD change its training to prevent officers ’ reflexive shooting – or firing because they heard shots or shouts of “ He ’s got a gun ! ”
It was once thought reflexive shooting played a role in the number of shots fired in the Bell case .
The report did not find any instances of reflexive shootings in the cases it studied .
The study also found that officers whose records show more than three negative marks – which result from anything from a suspension or an unpaid parking ticket – were three times more likely to use their guns .
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the implications for the NYPD were not immediately clear .
“ I think were tying to find out what that finding means , ” he said .
The study also suggested the NYPD might not be able to do anything about it .
“ It ’s not actionable in the sense that you could not restrict these officers from performing their duties , ” Rostker said .
Researchers said the NYPD should pay special attention to whether cops involved in shootings also rack up more than three negative points on their records a year .
Of the more than 2,600 officers in that category , only 16 have been in a gun battle .
The department already has 350 Tasers with another 170 on the way and is considering a pilot program to put them in the hands of every officer on patrol , Kelly said .
The move comes despite concerns by groups about overuse and lethality , Kelly said .
“ We are still relatively conservative when it comes to Tasers , ” Kelly said .
“ For the moment , we feel it ’s best to restrict them to supervisors who are required to respond to incidents involving emotionally disturbed persons . ”
The $ 400 devices , which are yellow and shaped like guns , will be worn by sergeants on their belts opposite their service weapons .
When the Tasers , which include laser sights , are fired , they unleash a 1,500 - to 3,000 - volt shock that “ briefly involuntarily incapacitates most subjects , ” according to the report .
They have a range of up to 25 feet .
The devices may be used in “ situations where officers have to take control of an individual , either for the safety of the individual , the safety of the public , or the safety of the officer , ” Kelly said , but they are not a substitute for a gun .

TV BLOG : What Are You Paying For Cable ?
Tell us !
Students at New York University are marching forward on their plans for a Bike - Share , first reported by StreetsBlog back in May .
Under the still - in - progress plan , " Bicycles would be kept at two locations – a dorm on East 7th Street and the bike parking lot at Tisch Hall on West 4th Street – and those who want to borrow one would reserve a time on a Web site by entering their NYU ID number . "
All they have to do then is show up and swipe their card , which magically releases a key to unlock the bike .
Then , they 've got 3 hours to do as they please ( 6 hours on weekends ) .
So awesome .
Yo , New York !
Ca n't we get rolling with something like this ?
Yes , the good news is such a program is on their radar .
The New York Times reported back in July that the DOT is sleeping on the idea .
According to the article , only 1 % of the city 's commuter trips are made by bicycle .
The city aims to hit 2 % by 2015 and 3 % by 2020 .
But last we heard , the city issued a request for expressions of interest , " seeking proposals from companies and other groups interested in implementing a bike - sharing program " .
Given the recent economic downturn , I can't imagine a Bike Share is high on Bloomberg 's list of " to - dos " .
But , back at NYU , things are still cranking forward .
In today 's AM New York article , NYU Bike Share project coordinator Lindsi Seegmiller said , " “ Every time someone hears about it they want to sign up , It ’s a perfect campus for a bike share because we ’re spread out but we ’re not too spread out . ”
They 're not sure when it 's going to get off the ground however .
They 've purchased thirty bikes and are working on getting the computer system in place .
But given the impending winter , we 're guessing it wo n't be until spring 2009 that NYU starts seeing the bikes around campus .
City , here 's your call to arms .
Get your bikes in gear ( heh. ) and hook us up with some wheels !
If left by themselves , bugs can breed really rapidly and very soon , it is going to trigger significant damaging implications to your health or residence .
As roaches will constantly be searching for water , popular areas of inhabitancy would be the washroom or the kitchen .
You may find that the normal pesticides for other insects are unsuccessful when used on roaches since they have a higher level of resistance towards light poison .
Toxic baits or traps produced specifically to get rid of roaches will likely be necessary for successful outcomes .
You need a specific bait to kill a roach fast and get rid of the entire roach colony .
Simply killing the one roach you see wo n’t help .
Once that ’s accomplished , you must take precautionary steps like sealing off any holes within the walls as roaches can readily breed in dark as well as cramped spots .
Dangerous bacterias like E. coli may be transferred on to your kitchenware too if roaches were to crawl on them .
Most of these germs can bring about dehydration or even bacterial infections .
An extension of the infestation by the bugs is quite likely to occur as they can hide in our belongings while we move them about .
It ’d be pretty much impossible to deal with a serious bed bug infestation all by yourself so you should get a pest control service to do it in your case .
It is completely essential when it comes to a bedbug infestation simply because they can easily infest an enormous area , rather than just being centered in small and specific areas of your house .
In extreme cases , a bed that ’s infested might have to be isolated in that room from the rest of the property for a long time up until the infestation is treated .
Plenty of people had resorted to throwing out their whole bed in their desperation to eliminate these pests , but that is not often the optimal remedy .
A rough evaluation or perhaps guess on the type of pests that are existing within your house is n’t good enough .
You ought to be absolutely sure .
You might also want to look out for this element when you are buying a new home to live in .
You need to really watch out for signs of an infestation before deciding to live in the house .
Several of the indications of an infestation include things like bug droppings in the home or even sightings of the bugs themselves .
Lots of people erroneously believe that pests will almost always be present because they may have wandered in to the house from the outdoors , but that ’s simply untrue .
A recently established bug nest within or perhaps right outside your home is more likely here .
The nests of those pests are definitely not hard to find if you try looking in the proper spots .
A bug nest will normally be constructed in between wall surfaces or perhaps floor tiles if there ’s a fracture or hollow space .
Should you have a deserted structure or an area of the house such as the attic room which is hardly ever utilized , the chances are that some bug might have made that location its home already .
Inactivity and clutter will heighten the probability of a bug infestation in a significant manner so keep the house clean .
A good example of an extremely common bug in the United States is the ant .
Ants breed quickly and if you dismiss them , you ’ll need to handle numerous nests later on .
Simply because an ant queen can develop as much as 800 offsprings within just one day , it should not be astonishing that they may build up multiple colonies all over your residence in a very short period of time .
Killing ants while using typical techniques like bug sprays or by swatting them are typically futile efforts due to the fact that there ’s simply far too many of them around .
To kill every one of the ants totally , you should use poison that could be carried by the ants to their colonies to infect all the others .
Exactly the same can be said in relation to termites which can be associated with ants .
Regardless of how similar they appear nevertheless , they ’re in fact fairly distinct when it comes to their attributes .
Ants are continually looking out for food which we inadvertently leave behind .
Termites will not act in the same manner as ants mainly because they can survive off of a greater selection of food items .
Termites can eat grass , foliage and even timber .
Due to this specific reason , termites can simply bring about increased damage in comparison with ants .
Furniture or large structures could be destroyed by these bugs completely if they ’re made from timber .
The foundation that sustains the base of the house as well as constructions like wooden beams and also pillars supporting the rooftop may be chewed through by these bugs .
The fact is , it has been reported that entire properties have collapsed as a result of the destruction that termites had caused .
Yet another really troublesome pest that lots of people are terrified of would be the roaches .
Mainly because roaches contain the capacity for carrying tons of bacteria that may cause multiple illnesses , they are generally dreaded .
Their excrement could potentially cause serious infections or ailments including food poisoning , vomiting , diarrhea and even more .
An asthmatic condition can also be activated just by breathing in the bacteria brought on by roaches .
Fixing the No Child Left Behind
Act has so far proved tricky , and Congress abandoned the effort after sharp divisions over how much revision was warranted .
But one little - noticed part of the school accountability law is easily corrected : Congress needs merely to delete the provision that gives the military access to personal information about high school juniors and seniors , who are then surprised at home by telemarketing recruiters .
Obviously , this provision has nothing to do with raising school standards or closing achievement gaps .
If it did , it would require such access for college recruiters as well .
Parents can opt out of the provision by stating in writing that they do not want information about their children going to the armed services .
Many school districts make this easy by sending home a standard checkoff form at the beginning of the school yearthat asks parents to grant or revoke permission for disseminating personal information to colleges , potential employers and media as well as the military .
Students then hand them in to teachers along with all of their other back - to - school forms .
In some districts , though , such as Conejo Valley Unified in Ventura County , the process is more complicated .
Because the district does n’t release student information to any other outside agency , it created a special form for the opt - out , which it mails to students ’ homes and which must be mailed or faxed back to the district .
Low - income families and those who are not literate in English are least likely to return such forms .
It ’s legitimate for Congress to consider new ways for the military to recruit .
The armed services are an attractive option to many high school students , who can get a leg up on vocational training , or paying for college , or starting a lifelong career for themselves while serving their country -- though parents also must retain a powerful say about who is allowed access to their underage children .
The trouble here is the device : If Congress wants the military to have access to students ’ home phone numbers , it should openly legislate it , rather than surreptitiously slipping such a provision into an unrelated law .

Masters of disguise : Stunning pictures of the tricks used by creatures to camouflage themselves
Hiding under lily pads and blending into their environment these species of the animal kingdom are masters of disguise .
With the ability to fade , blend and merge these animals use the art of concealment as a means of survival in the natural world .
Animals use two basic methods to conceal themselves in nature : general resemblance and special resemblance .
A Green frog emerging from the duckweeds in St Omer , France
With general resemblance animals use colour to blend in with their habitat so that they 're almost invisible .
Waiting patiently underneath this lily in the Australian swamplands , this young crocodile uses his deep green skin to blend in perfectly with its habitat , waiting to strike .
In contrast the three toed sloth in Costa Rica is almost invisible as it clings effortlessly to this tree trunk .
A Mimic Octopus blends into the sand off the coast of the Maldives
A Harlequin Crab blends in seamlessly as it stands on a sea cucumber in Indonesia
An endangered species , the pygmy three - toed sloth is characterised by usually blotchy , pale grey - brown fur and a tan - coloured face with a distinctive dark band across the forehead , from which long , shaggy hair hangs over the face , giving a hooded appearance .
Sloths have an unusual means of camouflage to avoid perdition ; their outer fur is often coated in algae , giving the pelage a greenish tint that helps hide them in their forest habitat .
Others , like the two month old cheetah hiding under a wheel in Kenya 's Masa Mara , and the grizzly bear in the snow North America , simply use their cunning and guile to remain hidden .

A Grizzly bear hides in the snow - covered bushes of North America
With special resemblance animals use a combination of colour , shape and behaviour to help them appear like something in their habitat .
Sitting in an iris flower , this goldenrod spider in France , this goldenrod spider is a member of the crab spider family .
It is best known for its ability to change its colour from white to yellow in order to camouflage among flowers .
Usually found wherever there are yellow and white flowers , especially goldenrod and daisies , they eat insects , either by hunting on the ground , or by ambushing from a flower .
A young Marine crocodile hides under a water lily in Australia
A Malaysian orchid mantis blends perfectly with a flower
A Locust mimicks a blade of grass in Burkina Faso
However the master of disguise is the mimic octopus , shown here in the Maldives .
Like the harlequin crab , they use their colours to merge into their surrounding environment .
But unlike the harlequin crab , the mimic octopus can undergo startling transformations into deadly or inedible animals so that predators avoid them .
The octopus ' abilities have only recently been discovered and have been the subject of several scientific studies in recent years .
A Grey Cicada hides on pine bark in France
A Rock Ptarmigan chick in its nest in Norway
A Crab spider hides on a Geranium flower in France
Like the mimic octopus , merlet 's scorpionfish , seen here in the Lifou Loyalty Islands , New Caledonia , harnesses the art of concealment to perfection .
This species tend to be dominated by colours that mimic their surroundings .
Additionally , these species are covered with numerous cirri , fleshy appendages , spines , and ridges ; these appendages provide additional camouflage .
Like its name , the orchid mantis has white and pink projections over their legs , neck , and abdomen , allowing them can make a fantastic camouflage when placed on an orchid .
Regardless , these animals are so adaptable it would be easier to find Wally amongst these maters of disguise .

In what CEO Shantaru Narayan describes as his company 's largest - ever product launch , Adobe on Tuesday formally unveiled all six flavors of version 4 of its Creative Suite , ranging in price from $ 999 to $ 2499 and slated to ship next month .
In an online presentation that went live this morning , John Loiacano , senior VP for the Creative Solutions Business Unit , divided Adobe Creative Suite 4's improvements into three categories : increased speed and efficiency , better Macromedia integration , and new " wow factor " features .
Improved asset management is one of CS4's emphases , as are mobile application development and project collaborations , and Loiacano briefly touched on Adobe 's trend toward hosted services such as Acrobat Connect .
The CS4 interface is newly tab - centric , and files and objects can be shared across suite components ' various tabs .
Behind the curtain , there 's improved GPU support for faster rendering .
Out in front wowing the crowds , the new Content - Aware Scaling functionality can intelligently re-scale portions of an image without distorting the important parts ( e.g. , stretching background scenery without distorting the human standing in the foreground ) .
And with an eye toward the upcoming Version 10 , Flash developers get new animation capabilities including inverse kinematics -- the ability to animate still images by building jointed , moveable " Bones " skeleton overlays .

The six CS4 flavors range in price and complexity from the $ 999 Web Standard edition , which comprises Adobe Flash CS4 Professional , Adobe Dreamweaver Professional , Adobe Fireworks CS4 , and Adobe Contribute CS4 ; through a premium Web edition ( $ 1699 ) ; standard ( $ 1399 ) and premium ( $ 1799 ) design editions ; the Production Premium edition ( $ 1699 ) ; and to the 13 - product , $ 2499 Master Collection .
All versions include Adobe 's Bridge media manager and Device Central software for testing mobile apps , and all versions but Production Premium include Adobe 's Cue file - management system .
One of the more intriguing special file - management capabilities turns up in the Production Premium edition , which is aimed at video folk .
In that edition , Adobe partnered with Autonomy to add that firm 's Intelligent Data Operating Layer ( IDOL ) -- rich - media management tech familiar to users of such products as SharePoint and the iPhone -- in a new tool called " Speech Search , " which transcribes audio ( including video audio ) , making it indexable and quickly searchable .
Beta versions of the bundled Dreamweaver , Soundbooth , and Fireworks software have been available in beta form since late May 2008 , and BitTorrent users were reporting allegedly leaked CS4 code as early as March .
Anticipation for the product appears to be running moderately high in the blogosphere , though there are scattered concerns that Adobe has yet to clean up various glitches in CS3 .
In addition , some development partners say they have n't had sufficient time to get CS3 extensions in fighting trim for CS4 .
Loiacano responded on Tuesday with a bit of heat to claims that CS4 is merely a dot - release of CS3 , saying that he estimates that " over 1700 person - years " went into CS4's development .
CS4 comes relatively hot on the heels of Version 3 , which Adobe started shipping in April 2007 , releasing final versions of the spendy Production Premium and Master Edition versions just 14 months ago .
The relative rush means that only Windows Vista and XP users -- not Mac users -- will be getting 64 - bit Photoshop in CS4 , since in June 2007 Apple announced that it was stopping support of 64 - bit development for the Carbon architecture , switching instead to Cocoa .
CS3 was built on Carbon .
In April of this year , John Nack , Adobe 's product manager for Photoshop , explained in his blog , " We 'll need to rewrite large parts of Photoshop and its plug-ins ( potentially affecting over a million lines of code ) to move it from Carbon to Cocoa . " 64 - bit support for Mac ( as illustrated by this PDF available here ) is therefore not expected until perhaps CS5 , the release date of which is currently unknown .
Nack 's blog on Tuesday reflected palpable relief at CS4's launch .
A proposal to create a free , national wireless Internet service got a boost as Federal Communications Commission engineers concluded that concerns are overblown about such service interfering with other carriers .
The report clears the way for the FCC to move forward with a plan to auction off airwaves to a bidder who agrees to offer free , national wireless Internet service .
The FCC is expected to finalize rules this year and could begin auctioning off airwaves in early - to - mid 2009 .
The report released Friday was bad news for T - Mobile USA , a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG , which uses airwaves that abut the chunk of spectrum that 's set to be auctioned off .
T - Mobile USA bought its spectrum for about $ 4 billion a few years ago .
T- Mobile has fought FCC Chairman Kevin Martin 's proposal to encourage development of free Web access by raising concerns that the service would disrupt the company 's 3G wireless network , for which it charges customers .
But FCC engineers said recent tests in Seattle showed the airwaves could be used for a wireless broadband service " without a significant risk of harmful interference . "
" This report confirms that we 're able to move forward with broadband services as proposed by Chairman Martin without causing harmful interference to license users of adjacent spectrum , " said an FCC spokesman .
American soldiers can hump 60 - pound packs through the broiling desert , kill for their country and die for it , but they ca n’t always vote for their commander in chief .
A solution has long been proposed : Just get rid of the byzantine process which forces those in far - flung battle zones to vote by mail that must be delivered to thousands of local election districts across the United States .
But the Pentagon has found that bringing military voting into the 21st century is not so simple .
The number of absentee military ballots applied for that ultimately get counted is consistently low .
In the last federal election , only about 30 percent of overseas military ballots were tallied , according to data from the federal Election Assistance Commission , which monitors election problems , and the Pew Center on the States .
Change wo n’t come in time for the November presidential election , when record numbers of voters are expected to decide between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama .
For soldiers , the stakes could n’t be higher .
The winner may well decide how long they stay in battle , and how soon they come home .
No one knows why some 70 percent of overseas military ballots were n’t recorded in 2006 .
No one keeps centralized records on military ballots or voter turnout .
But anecdotal evidence collected from local voting districts , which number more than 7,000 , points to ballots that arrived late , ballots not properly filled out and ballots mailed to the wrong location - most of which get discarded .
Then there are the ballots of troops who , for whatever reason , never mailed them back at all .
Contributing to the confusion are states and local election districts with competing and sometimes confounding rules governing overseas ballots .
And the mail - in process can take up to 60 days from start to finish , even though many absentee ballots were n’t available until this month .
Because she would like to see the Iraq war end , Army Capt .
Holly Landes , a 29 - year - old veterinarian from Augusta , Ga. , wants her vote to count .
“ I do know that this war is taking a toll on the country , and I would be happy to see it shortened , ” she said at Camp Speicher , a military installation near Tikrit in northern Iraq where she cares for bomb - and drug - sniffing dogs .
But Capt .
Landes , an athletic soldier who wore camouflage and a handgun strapped to her thigh as she negotiated a spitting sandstorm , was n’t sure her first - time vote from abroad would arrive in her home county on time , based on complaints from fellow soldiers .
“ Some of them have expressed concerns that they have n’t gotten the ballots until the day before elections , ” the captain said .
Voting in this election is particularly important , she said , “ because it ’s a difference between staying in and pulling out …
So it would be nice if it were a little easier and they had more confidence in the system . ”
Her concerns are mild in comparison to comments from reservists far from active duty , who can comment publicly without fear of reprimand .
“ Why are we imposing on military personnel a system that is more onerous than the ones civilians use ? ” asked Bob Carey , a senior fellow at the National Defense Committee , a private advocacy group .
Mr. Carey , a 23 - year Navy reservist who participated in Desert Storm , blames politicians and Pentagon bureaucracy with failing to find a process that works .
“ I can speak out , ” Mr. Carey said .
“ The active duty soldier cannot .
They are not allowed to publicly chastise their superiors , with good reason .
It ’s called mutiny . ”
Voting problems have been around since the Truman administration , Mr. Carey said .
“ This has been going on for 50 years and nothing has changed .
Politicians and elected officials have not done anything .
The DOD ( Department of Defense ) has said there is no problem . ”
This is how military overseas voting works :
A registered voter must request , in writing , an absentee ballot from the local election district where he or she last lived .
That can take up to 30 days .
The soldier waits to receive a paper absentee ballot , then fills it out and mails it back .
That can take another 30 days .
There is a long list of things that can wrong with that process - starting with mail getting lost in the U.S. Postal Service or in the Military Postal Service Agency , which ships correspondence by military channels .
Mail can sit undelivered if heavy fighting stops supply convoys , or if limited space requires something more important be delivered - ammunition , for example .
And because the military is often on the move , ballots can arrive on bases where soldiers are no longer assigned .
Mr. Carey favors Internet voting - something the Pentagon championed in 2004 only to abandon after spending $ 25 million and meeting critics who said online ballots were vulnerable to fraud .
But in military camps in Afghanistan and Iraq , Internet access is often more prevalent than indoor toilets and phone service .
Mr. Carey is working with The Pew Center on the States to craft a nationwide military voting law that would eliminate conflicting local regulations about such issues as whether ballots can be faxed or sent as an attachment via e-mail .
Seventeen states and territories allow some type of e-mail service to soldiers , but the rules greatly vary .

Kucinich : Bailout opened ' financial whirlpool of insatiable greed '
RAW STORY
Published : Monday October 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Dennis Kucinich opposed the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout that went into effect Monday , and now that the stock market continues to fall he 's warning that the attempt to rescue the economy missed its mark .
The Ohio Democrat says any government efforts need to focus primarily on putting more money into the pockets of middle - and lower - income Americans struggling to keep their homes and jobs , not to Wall Street institutions .
 If Wall Street does come back for another bailout , we must be prepared in advance to say NO ,  Kucinich said in a press release Monday .
 The bailouts of Wall Street must stop .
It will never be enough .
When the Federal Government gets involved in picking winners and losers on Wall Street , we open up a financial whirlpool of insatiable greed . "
As the government began enacting its financial rescue program Monday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 800 points during the day before settling down around 350 points at closing .
The Dow dipped below 10,000 for the first time since 2004 .
 The fundamental problem that led to the credit crisis is that millions of homeowners are in jeopardy , and millions of people are out of work .
Congress rushed to bail out Wall Street but sits on its hands when millions of homeowners are at risk ,  he continued .
 The only way to prevent another bailout is to take action which will directly impact the market stress at its root - - the millions of homeowners who face default on their mortgages .
This is the path toward market stabilization . 
Kucinich says he is preparing a bill to " prime the pump of the economy " by giving the government controlling interest in mortgage backed securities to allow homeowners to renegotiate the payments , interest and principle loans they are unable to pay .
 We are now facing the perfect financial storm .
The elements are the deficit spending for the war ... the lack of serious investment in our country and now $ 700 billion to Wall Street .
We are being hollowed out , " he said .
" We are going to see more unemployment and more people losing there homes .
...
Now we must invest in homeowners to prevent any additional bailout . 

A new Politico / Insider Advantage survey finds he leads in four key counties , an advantage that could determine the winner of four vital swing states .
Poll : Obama ahead in critical counties
Sen .
Barack Obama holds leads in four key counties that will go a long way toward determining the eventual winner in four important swing states — Missouri , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Virginia — according to a new Politico / Insider Advantage survey .
Obama is poised to expand on recent Democratic gains in three populous suburban counties — Pennsylvania ’s Bucks County , Missouri ’s St. Louis County and Virginia ’s Prince William County .
In a fourth , Ohio ’s Franklin County , home to Columbus and its suburbs , the survey also found Obama with the lead .

In Bucks County , a politically competitive but historically Republican suburb that shares a border with Philadelphia , Obama is running ahead of McCain , 47 - 41 percent .
In 2004 , Democrat John F. Kerry carried the county by a slim 51 percent to 48 percent .
Obama bests McCain 50 percent to 42 percent in Prince William County , a Washington , D.C. , suburb that voted for George W. Bush in both 2000 and 2004 .
Between 1976 and 2004 , Prince William County supported Republican presidential candidates by an average margin of 18 points .
Obama also has opened up a wide 53 percent to 37 percent advantage over McCain in suburban St. Louis County , which does not include Missouri ’s second - largest city , St. Louis .
In 2004 , Sen . John F. Kerry , the Democratic nominee , carried St. Louis County , the most populous county in the state , 54 percent to 45 percent .
In Ohio ’s Franklin County , the state ’s second - most populous county after Cleveland ’s Cuyahoga County , Obama leads by a narrower 45 percent to 40 percent margin .
Kerry carried Franklin County 54 percent to 45 percent in 2004 .
InsiderAdvantage pollster Matt Towery explained Obama ’s success in these areas is a result of his strength among independents and voters between the ages of 30 and 44 .
“ That is the most angry group of voters that we have this year , with regard to the Republicans , ” Towery said .
“ I see that in almost every poll I look at . ”
In Prince William County , Obama leads in this age group , 58 percent to 33 percent , and takes independent voters by an even wider , 55 - percent - to - 25 - percent margin .
McCain is scheduled to appear in Prince William Saturday , a nod to his vulnerability there and also to the electoral importance of that traditionally Republican area .
Obama ’s advantages in Prince William County hold up in competitive locales across the country , with independents consistently picking him over McCain .
“ The big swing , again , is that Obama ’s picking up the lion ’s share of the independents , ” Towery added .
Independents in Pennsylvania ’s Bucks County support Obama 46 percent to 32 percent , and 30 - to - 44 - year - olds pick him by a 10 - point margin , 49 percent to 37 percent .
In central Ohio ’s Franklin County , he takes 30 - to - 44 - year - olds by a smaller , but still decisive 49 percent to 34 percent gap , and wins independents , 43 percent to 19 percent .
Missouri’s St. Louis County , where Obama is safely ahead of McCain , features Obama ’s narrowest lead among 30 - to - 44 - year - olds : he ’s ahead there by 49 percent to 40 percent .
Independents are breaking for Obama by a more convincing , 47 - percent - to - 31 - percent margin .
During the Democratic primary , Obama won just a handful of counties in Missouri , but by running up big margins in the city and county of St. Louis , he was able to pull out a narrow statewide victory over Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Kerry ’s 9 - point margin in St. Louis County and his landslide 80 percent win in the city of St. Louis were not enough to overcome George W. Bush ’s lead elsewhere in the state .
But if Obama can maintain his commanding advantage there , it could help tip the state into the Democratic electoral column .
Currently , Towery said , McCain is headed for a major defeat in the area .
“ In this county , he ’s not even doing well with the 65 - and - over crowd , ” he said .
“ This is a wipeout . ”
Unlike in St. Louis County , Obama did not perform well in Bucks County in Pennsylvania ’s Democratic primary .
Though the Philadelphia suburb was seen as favorable terrain for the Illinois senator , Clinton handily defeated him there , 63 percent to 37 percent .
Obama ’s lead in Bucks County is within the poll ’s margin of error and he is not performing as well among women as he is in the other counties surveyed .
In Bucks , he has just a 4 - point edge with female voters , compared with a 16 - point spread in the Columbus , Ohio , area .
According to Towery , this can partly be attributed to McCain ’s strong performance among middle - aged women .
“ You ’ve got an unusually high number for McCain in that 45 - to - 64 age group , and that ’s got a lot of women in it , ” Towery explained .
Among voters in that age interval , McCain leads Obama 53 percent to 37 percent .
That Obama is ahead of McCain in Bucks County , anyway , suggests that he has been more successful than his opponent in reaching out to the suburban swing voters who dominate areas such as these .
A September poll commissioned by Hofstra University ’s National Center for Suburban Studies showed McCain leading Obama among suburban voters , nationwide , by a 48 percent to 42 percent margin .
The poll was conducted Sept. 15 - 21 .
But whatever the national trend among suburbanites , Obama has edged ahead in key areas that are likely to influence the outcome of the election .
Recent public polling has shown Obama winning all four states in which these county - level polls were conducted .
The RealClearPolitics polling average has Obama ahead by 14 points in Pennsylvania , Virginia by 8.1 percent , 3.2 percent in Ohio and 1.8 percent in Missouri .
This is the second round of Politico / Insider Advantage polling in critical counties .
The first round results , published Tuesday , showed Obama tied or leading McCain in Jefferson County , Colo . ; Washoe County , Nev. ; Wake County , N.C. ; and Hillsborough County , Fla .
The Politico / InsiderAdvantage telephone surveys in St. Louis County and Franklin County were conducted Oct. 13 .
The St. Louis County survey included 542 likely voters , with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent .
The Franklin survey included 376 likely voters , with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percent .
The Politico / InsiderAdvantage telephone surveys in Bucks County and Prince William County were conducted Oct. 14 .
The Bucks survey included 320 likely voters and the Prince William survey included 308 likely voters , both with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percent .

One of the world 's biggest hedge fund managers , Citadel , told clients last night that two of its main funds have lost 35 % of their value this year after rumours swept the market about its financial position .
The Chicago - based firm , which has $ 20 bn ( £ 12.5 bn ) of funds under management , blamed " panic " and " dislocation " on global exchanges for its predicament .
Citadel is run by 40 - year - old billionaire Kenneth Griffin , an investment prodigy who was married at Versailles palace and who once spent a reported $ 60 m on a Cézanne painting .
On a conference call with investors , Citadel 's executives said the firm 's liquidity remained strong , with $ 8bn of unused credit lines available .
" We 've made it through 18 years , " Griffin said .
" We will make it through the next six to eight weeks . "
Troubled hedge funds have been blamed for aggravating recent falls in stockmarkets as they liquidate investments to fund withdrawals by clients .
On Wall Street trading floors yesterday , a rumour circulated that Citadel was approaching the US government for help .
But a Citadel spokeswoman denied this : " These rumours are categorically false and we continue to invest and operate . "
Griffin began trading from his dormitory room at Harvard University two decades ago and has long been viewed as one of the sharpest operators in the industry .
Citadel employs 1,200 people in the US , Bermuda , London , Hong Kong and Tokyo .
A US analysis firm , Hedge Fund Research , reported last week that the industry had suffered the worst quarter in its history , with investors withdrawing $ 31bn to reduce funds under management to $ 1.72tn .
Some 350 hedge funds have shut down this year .
Although a handful of hedge funds have prospered by " shorting " banks and mortgage companies , many risk - taking investment firms have struggled to cope with unprecedented volatility in the markets .
Meanwhile , Georgia 's Alpha Bank and Trust yesterday became the 16th US lender to fail this year and a Minnesota bank will take over its $ 346 m of deposits .
FBI , SEC , Federal Reserve ' Failed to Connect the Dots ' to Wall Street Federal agencies missed clear warning signs of financial crisis .
Oct. 6 , 2008  --
As Congress opens hearings this morning on who is to blame for the financial crisis , an ABC News investigation has found that the FBI and other federal agencies failed to spot the warning signs of massive fraud in the home mortgage business that led directly to Wall Street .
" The failure to connect the dots , " Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal told ABC News , " is completely reprehensible and should now lead to strong and effective indictments and prosecutions for fraud . "
Evidence of widespread fraud and deception in the home mortgage business was presented to the FBI , the SEC and the Federal Reserve Board chairmen , Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke , over the last five years but resulted in no comprehensive or coordinated federal reaction , according to Blumenthal , other officials , business leaders , class action lawyers and civil rights activists .
In July , 2007 a coalition of civil rights groups met with Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke in Washington , D.C. , to present concerns that minority homeowners were being particularly hard hit by predatory lenders whose tele - marketing schemes resulted in hundreds of thousands being tricked into mortgages they could not afford , and ultimately were forced into foreclosure .
" I 'm disappointed more could not , or was not done in the aftermath of that meeting , " said Wade Henderson , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , who arranged the meeting with Bernanke .
Henderson said he credits Bernanke for at least showing some concern , unlike his predecessor as Federal Reserve Chairman , Alan Greenspan , who Henderson said completely ignored the problem .
" Alan Greenspan , of course , had denied the existence of the problem and certainly resisted any government intervention during his tenure , " said Henderson .
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board responded by noting studies show " slightly more than half " of sub - prime mortgage loans were made by state licensed " lenders " not subject to regulation by federal authorities .
And as evidence of the Fed 's awareness and concern about the problem point to Chairman Bernanke 's appearance on Capitol Hill last September when he warned lawmakers of a " dramatic " increase in foreclosures and outlined steps the Fed was taking to " help consumers defend against improper lending " .
Mortgage Lending Fraud
Evidence of widespread fraud also emerged during a series of civil law suits brought against mortgage brokers affiliated with Lehman Brothers , the New York investment banking firm that was forced to declare bankruptcy .
Lawyers involved in the cases say despite damning jury verdicts , there was no follow up interest from the FBI or the federal prosecutors in pursuing criminal cases , as often results from large civil suits .
The FBI has now announced it will begin criminal investigations involving allegations of fraud involving Lehman Brothers and other major Wall Street financial institutions .
" The verdict should have been the canary in the coal mine , " said Don Barrett , a lawyer who won a class action lawsuit in 2003 brought against Lehman Brothers and a now - defunct mortgage broker , First Alliance .
Barrett says not only did the FBI ignore the findings in the case , but so too did Lehman Brothers which continued to do business with suspect mortgage brokers , repackaging the bad loans and selling them as high - interest paying investments to banks around the world .
" They felt there was nobody to regulate them , they could get away with anything , " said Barrett .
" As it turns out , they were correct . "
The former CEO and chairman of Lehman Brothers , Richard Fuld , is scheduled to be one of the first witnesses this morning before a Congressional investigating committee , chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
Fuld bears directly responsibility , according to Barrett , the class action lawyer .
" Top management knew precisely , exactly what it was doing , " he said of Fuld .
Fuld who made an estimated $ 466 million in salary during Lehman 's heyday , not counting stock options , declined , through a spokesperson , to comment .
The spokesperson said Fuld subsequently lost more than $ 800 million in the value of his Lehman Brothers stock when the firm declared bankruptcy .
Connecticut Attorney General Blumenthal , without naming Lehman Brothers directly , says there was more than enough evidence for a criminal investigation into Wall Street 's connections to shady brokers who wrote tens of billions of dollars worth of mortgages .
Toxic Loans Led to Credit Crisis
Blumenthal says those mortgages , while initially highly profitable , set the foundation for hundreds of billions of dollars of " toxic loans " that have now led to the credit crisis .
" There was clear reason to investigate , probably to prosecute some of the practices that were ongoing , " Blumenthal told ABC News .
" There was failure to disclose material information that could have , and probably should have led to investigation and prosecution . "
The Securities Exchange Commission , the SEC , should bear the largest share of the blames , says Blumenthal , because it has direct jurisdiction over such investments .
" The signs were there , there were clear red flag warnings , but they failed to take action to stop the sales of these flawed investment instruments to public in general , " said Blumenthal .
" They were asleep at the switch . "
A spokesman for the SEC declined to respond directly to Blumenthal 's criticism , referring reporters to last week 's statements by Chairman Christopher Cox calling for an end to the SEC's " voluntary regulatory program " which Cox himself acknowledged had serious failures .
But the spokesman also said it was important to understand the underlying real estate transactions at issue were " done entirely outside the regulatory authority of the SEC . "
Blumenthal said it is almost certain now that a number of Wall Street 's once top CEOs will face criminal prosecution .
" Without singling out any one of them , my strong prediction would be that prosecutions are well justified . "

Unlocking the Verizon Wireless xv6800 ( HTC Titan ) GPS
Skywing
In August 2008 Verizon Wireless released a firmware upgrade for their xv6800 ( rebranded HTC Titan ) line of Windows Mobile smartphones that provided a number of new features previously unavailable on the device on the initial release firmware .
In particular , support for accessing the device 's built - in Qualcomm gpsOne assisted GPS chipset was introduced with this update .
However , Verizon Wireless elected to attempt to lock down the GPS hardware on xv6800 such that only applications authorized by Verizon Wireless would be able to access the device 's built - in GPS hardware and perform location - based functions ( such as GPS - assisted navigation ) .
The mechanism used to lock down the GPS hardware is entirely client - side based , however , and as such suffers from fundamental limitations in terms of how effective the lockdown can be in the face of an almost fully user - programmable Windows Mobile - based device .
This article outlines the basic philosophy used to prevent unauthorized applications from accessing the GPS hardware and provides a discussion of several of the flaws inherent in the chosen design of the protection mechanism .
In addition , several pitfalls relating to debugging and reverse engineering programs on Windows Mobile are also discussed .
Finally , several suggested design alterations that would have mitigated some of the flaws in the current GPS lock down system from the perspective of safeguarding the privacy of user location data are also presented .

Using dual - mappings to evade automated unpackers
skape
Automated unpackers such as Renovo , Saffron , and Pandora 's Bochs attempt to dynamically unpack executables by detecting the execution of code from regions of virtual memory that have been written to .
While this is an elegant method of detecting dynamic code execution , it is possible to evade these unpackers by dual - mapping physical pages to two distinct virtual address regions where one region is used as an editable mapping and the second region is used as an executable mapping .
In this way , the editable mapping is written to during the unpacking process and the executable mapping is used to execute the unpacked code dynamically .
This effectively evades automated unpackers which rely on detecting the execution of code from virtual addresses that have been written to .

— Play - Doh and LEGO are compared and constrasted , and then put forward as a metaphor for comparing Ruby and Java .
The reader is encouraged to embrace the strengths of each environment — 18 - minute read
This article is based on a talk I gave at the 2008 RubyConf in Orlando , Florida , entitled “ Recovering from Enterprise : how to embrace Ruby ’s idioms and say goodbye to bad habits ” .
The other day I went to Target with my son .
Like most kids , I think , he ’s convinced that Target is a toy store , which just happens to sell towels and shoes and cleaning supplies , too , so in his eyes it ’d be criminal to not walk through the bare handful of toy aisles .
Besides , the toy section is across from the electronics section , which all geeks know is where the real toys are .
So , we went to the toy section and started browsing .
I ’ve always loved LEGO sets , and it ’s a good thing they ’re so expensive or I ’d come home with a new box of bricks every time .
At the Target near our home , they have half of an entire aisle devoted to boxes and boxes of LEGO sets .
Need a battle - axe - wielding LEGO dwarf figure ?
A LEGO shark ?
How about a giant LEGO skull , a la Indiana Jones ?
And who could pass a LEGO Star Wars ’ Star Destroyer model without a wistful thought or two ?
It struck me at that time , though , how incredibly specific so many of these pieces are .
With all of those sets in your possession , you could build a secret agent headquarters with a boulder trap that crushes angry battle - axe - wielding dwarves as they drive by in Martian exploration buggies .
Which themelves are adorned with flower beds and creeper vines .
And you could do all that in under 10 LEGO bricks !
( Or , maybe a few more than that . )
Did you know that LEGO currently produces over 900 distinct LEGO pieces , or “ elements ” as they call them ?
Over the course of their history , there have been almost 13,000 distinct elements created .
Now , that number includes variations in color and material , but even if you exclude those permutations , you ’re still left with a staggering 2,800 different elements in the LEGO line .
It ’s interesting that LEGO tends to encourage the use of specific pieces , rather than letting you build those pieces from more fundamental parts .
It means that in order to master LEGO brick building , you have to know all of the pieces available to you , and have a good intuitive feel for how and when they should be used .
That ’s …a lot of information to keep tabs on .
Myself , I just keep to the standard rectangular blocks and plug an exotic or two on as an afterthought when I see one that looks cool .
Also , if you ’ve built up a model , and decide later that you want to change or extend some part of the model , you ’ll often have to dismantle part ( or all ! ) of it in order to do so .
Kind of a pain .
Regardless , I still love building with LEGO bricks , and I suspect I always will .
Play - Doh
Now , my son being all of 6 years old , his attention span requires us to spend no more than a few minutes in any one toy aisle .
So , long before I was ready to tear my eyes away from the LEGO sets , we found ourselves in the next aisle over .
This was a much more colorful aisle , with bright pastels coloring various pre-school toys .
My son , though , has nothing against pre-school toys , and was more than willing to drag me through them .
My eyes caught on the Play - Doh section .
The Play - Doh section at this Target is small , maybe 8 different hangers and a few square feet of shelf - space .
You can get Play - Doh in as many as 50 different colors , but regardless of color , it ’s all still the same thing : a bucket of malleable dough that you can pound , press , pinch , roll , and sculpt .
( And rub into the carpet .
And hair .
And clothes .
But we wo n’t get into that . )
Honestly , Play - Doh has a bad rap as a pre-schooler toy .
It ’s remarkably fun to play with .
You can do all kinds of things with Play - Doh that you just ca n’t do with LEGO bricks .
For example , the other day I built an arch out of cubes of Play - Doh that were held together only by friction .
( You may not be impressed , but my 6 - year - old was . )
The best part is that it does n’t require so much memorization to become proficient in Play - Doh , though it might require more of an artistic streak than LEGO bricks do .
Since I ’m more engineer than artist , my Play - Doh creations tend to come out blocky and functional , rather than elegant and designed , but then , so do my LEGO creations .
Also , where LEGO models require significant work to alter or extend , Play - Doh models are dead - simple .
If you want to add something to the base of your model , just graft more Play - Doh onto it .
Want to change the shape of the keystone of your arch ?
Just pinch and mold in place .
Simple !
Interestingly , I ’ve found that while you ca n’t build with LEGO bricks using Play - Doh construction techniques , you can build with Play - Doh using LEGO construction techniques .
Just build bricks out of Play - Doh .
It ’s unwiedly and impractical , but it can be done .
The real question is : why would you want to ?
It ’s pretty obvious that to build with Play - Doh , you should just embrace Play - Doh ’s own strengths and run with it .
As obvious as that may seem , the lesson did n’t click for me for a long time .
It ’s not that I went about building Indiana Jones sets out of Play - Doh , one brick at a time .
Rather , I did n’t realize that the same lesson applied to programming languages .
Java and LEGOs
Consider Java .
Most would consider it the poster child of “ enterprise ” environments ( though .
NET is giving it a run for its money ) .
And would you believe , Java and LEGO bricks have several things in common ?
As of Java 1.6 , there are well over 11,000 different classes and interfaces available to programmers in the standard library .
( That ’s not even counting the inner and anonymous classes that are usually not publicly documented . )
Eleven .
Thousand .
Classes .
This is readily apparent when you consider the set of collection implementations that Java ships with .
Collection
Set
List
Queue
Deque
Map
SortedSet
SortedMap
NavigableSet
NavigableMap
BlockingQueue
BlockingDeque
ConcurrentMap
ConcurrentNavigableMap
HashSet
TreeSet
LinkedHashSet
ArrayList
ArrayDeque
LinkedList
PriorityQueue
HashMap
TreeMap
LinkedHashMap
WeakHashMap
IdentityHashMap
CopyOnWriteArrayList
CopyOnWriteArraySet
EnumSet
EnumMap
ConcurrentLinkedQueue
LinkedBlockingQueue
ArrayBlockingQueue
PriorityBlockingQueue
DelayQueue
SynchronousQueue
LinkedBlockingDeque
ConcurrentHashMap
ConcurrentSkipListSet
ConcurrentSkipListMap
AbstractCollection
AbstractSet
AbstractList
AbstractSequentialList
AbstractQueue
AbstractMap
Yes , that is FORTY - SIX different interfaces and implementations related to collections .
Now , just like LEGO construction , having this volume of distinct elements on hand affects how you architect things .
Writing software becomes more of a smorgasbord , where you pick and choose the specialized bricks you need , fitting them together just so .
It also means that , in order to master Java , you need to have that intuitive grasp of how and when to use those thousands of classes .
When do you use a HashSet versus a TreeSet ?
When would you use an ArrayDeque , and when would you want to subclass an AbstractQueue ?
It ’s all part of the job .
Also , IDE ’s are popular with Java in part because of the pain of refactoring .
If you want to extend or modify a Java application , it can involve ( like LEGO models ) a lot of dismantling and reassembling .
Ruby as Play - Doh
But if Java is the LEGO of programming languages , then it could be argued that Ruby is the Play - Doh .
Just as Play - Doh has been typically considered a pre-school toy , so Ruby has had a bad rap as a “ toy ” language , not fit for the “ real world ” .
Also , compared to Java ’s library of 11,000 classes , Ruby ’s meager 1,400 classes ( which number does include internal and anonymous ones , but not modules ) seems paltry .
And collections !
Look what Ruby has to offer :
Modules :
Enumerable
Comparable ( for elements within a collection )
Classes :
Hash
Array
Set
SortedSet
Just 6 options , to Java ’s 46 .
What if you need a queue ?
Well , Ruby ’s Array class has a queue - like interface ; you could just use that .
What about a sorted map ?
In that case , you might need to make do with a sorted set , or you could write your own , but it ’s not hard .
Most data structures are not rocket science , and for those that are , you can bet someone else has implemented it already .
But when you need to extend or modify your application , Ruby is a dream .
Like Play - Doh , you can often just “ pinch and mold ” in place , grafting new code on or pulling old code out .
Ruby ’s philosophy is like that of Play - Doh ’s : provide a basic set of tools and make it relatively simple to build something complex with them .
The very Ruby language itself is designed for this : closures , super - simple introspection of objects , runtime modification of existing objects , and the use of modules for extending classes and objects all tend to result in an environment that is simple , malleable , and extensible .
And just as you cannot use Play - Doh construction techniques with LEGO bricks , you also really cannot use Ruby programming techniques with Java .
Using closures for delayed execution , or iteration , is tricky ( at best ) in Java , when it ’s possible at all .
Extending objects at runtime typically requires bytecode modification .
And Ruby ’s use of modules to extend classes and objects , while similar to both inheritance and interfaces , is slightly different ( and arguably more powerful ) than either .
You can write Ruby programs using Java programming techniques , but just as using LEGO techniques with Play - Doh is unwieldy and overcomplicated , so is mimicking Java in Ruby .
This is the lesson that I was slow to learn .
Copland
Consider exhibit A , from my Copland library .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # copland/configuration/loader.rb ( collapsed ) module Copland module Configuration class Loader attr_reader : search_paths attr_reader : loaders def initialize ( search_paths = [ ] ) def add_search_path ( * paths ) def add_loader ( loader ) def load ( options={} ) def load_path ( path , options ) def use_library ( name ) end end end
Copland was my first stab at a dependency injection ( DI ) framework , and is more - or - less a feature - for - feature port of the HiveMind project in Java .
( Ironically , it was the subject of my first presentation at a Ruby conference , in 2004 ! )
It was designed to automatically scan directories in the load path for YAML configuration files ( I ’ll mention those shortly ) , and load them up and parse them .
The thing is , I imagined a case where someone might want to use XML instead of YAML .
I could n’t just leave these folks behind !
So I made the whole configuration loading framework extendible .
Want XML config files ?
Fine !
Just implement an XML parser system and register it with the configuration loader framework , and you ’re good to go !
That ’s just wrong on so many levels .
Always , always , always build just what you need , and only when you need it .
You ’re in Ruby , the Play - Doh of programming languages , and the cost of adding features later is really , really low .
Remember YAGNI !
Obviously , this principle holds in Java , too , but it really seems like the opposite philosophy has become the standard among many Java projects .
It ’s too bad , because it has contributed to a bad reputation that Java probably does n’t entirely deserve .
Here ’s a classic Java pattern that just really does n’t translate to Ruby :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 # copland/class-factory.rb module Copland class ClassFactory include Singleton def initialize @pools , @constructors =
Hash .new , Hash .new end def create_pool ( name , & block ) block ||= proc { |k, *args | k.new ( * args ) } @pools [ name ] =
Hash .new @constructors [ name ] = block end def get_pool ( name ) pool = @pools [ name ] or raise NoSuchPoolException , name return pool end def register ( pool_name , name , klass ) pool = get_pool ( pool_name ) pool [ name ] = klass end def get ( pool_name , name , * args ) pool = get_pool ( pool_name ) klass = pool [ name ] raise NoSuchRegisteredClassException , " #{ pool_name } : #{ name } " unless klass constructor = @constructors [ pool_name ] return constructor.
call ( klass , * args ) end end end
This is an implementation of a class factory .
In Ruby .
The HiveMind project had a class factory , so the Copland project needed one , too !
But you know , class factories are absolutely pointless in Ruby .
There are plenty of reasons for these in Java , but they just are n’t necessary in Ruby .
Want a namespace ?
Declare the class in a module .
Want the class to exist in multiple namespaces ?
Use constant assignment within whatever modules you desire .
Need a dynamic lookup ?
Try #const_get .
In the very worst case , just use a Hash if you need to map arbitrary strings to classes .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 module
A class B end end # method # 1 , use const_get to dynamically look up classes name = " B " klass = A .const_get ( name ) object = klass.new # method # 2 , use a hash to map arbitrary strings to classes map = { " bimpl " => A :: B } map [ " bimpl " ] .new
Seriously .
You do n’t need explicit class factories in Ruby , because anything can be a class factory , implicitly .
I ’ll mention one more painful Javaism that I ported to Copland .
It ’s so painful that I wo n’t even bother pasting it here — if you ’re following along , look at examples / solitaire - cipher / lib / package.yml in the copland distribution .
If you do , what you ’ll see are 106 lines of YAML describing how different Ruby objects in a simple , 250 - line program should be initialized and connected .
Yes. 106 lines of YAML .
For 250 lines of Ruby .
Now , do n’t get me wrong .
YAML can be great for configuration .
Rails , for instance , uses it for database connection information .
The problem here , in Copland , was that I was using a static configuration for what would be better served with a block of code .
Ruby reads elegantly ; a YAML configuration file does not .
Fortunately , those wiser than myself showed me the way .
RubyConf 2004
I still remember Rich Kilmer , sitting in the front row in the October 2004 RubyConf .
As I wrapped up my presentation on Copland and dependency injection , I asked if there were any questions .
Rich raised his hand .
“ Why did n’t you just use Ruby ? ”
I was confused by his question , and he had to explain .
Why did I use YAML instead of just doing the configuration in Ruby code ?
I think I mumbled something like “ that would be a neat idea ” .
To me , it was a novel concept .
I ’d never heard of it before .
You ’d never see a Java program that was configured by writing Java code .
That screams “ hard coding ” !
But Ruby , you see , is different .
Ruby lets you write these beautiful little mini-languages .
You ’ll hear them called “ Domain Specific Languages ” , or DSL’s .
They are subsets of the Ruby language , and you ’ll find them in Rake , Capistrano , rspec , shoulda , and more .
They ’re really everywhere in Ruby , to varying degrees .
Although Rich tried to open my eyes , I think I would have continued to try and push Copland if it were n’t for Jim Weirich .
Jim took the idea of a Ruby - ish DSL for dependency injection and made something concrete of it .
A few days after the conference he forwarded me a draft of an article he was writing , in which he described dependency injection and gave a very simple ( and very elegant ) implementation of a DI framework in Ruby .
Instead of static configuration , he ’d written a basic DSL for declaring how the dependencies related to each other .
It was a moment of epiphany for me .
Suddenly , I got it .
I understood what DSL ’s were about .
I asked Jim for permission to take his simple implemention and build upon it .
The result was Needle .
Needle
Now , I ’m much prouder of Needle than of Copland , because it is much closer to Ruby ’s philosophy than Java .
There are some pretty cool designs in there , too , though I use the term “ cool ” here to mean “ neat without having any real practical application . ”
Needle , though better , was still far from the mark .
As an example of why it misses the mark , consider Needle ’s “ pipeline ” concept .
Conceptually , it allowed you to specify a sequence of post - processors that operated on an object , allowing you to wrap code around it and mimicking ( among other things ) AOP - like operations .
It also let me ( as the author of the library ) easily implement things like deferred instantiation , singleton services , and the like .
For example , suppose you wanted to declare a “ deferred singleton ” service , that logged all accesses to one of the methods .
Underneath , Needle will create a pipeline of processors that operate on the service , returning a proxy object .
The first time the proxy is accessed , it will check to see if the object has been instantiated yet .
If it has n’t , it ’ll instantiate it ( and cache it ) .
The instantiation , though , actually just hands control to the next element in the pipeline , which in this case checks to see that the “ singleton ” constraint is enforced ( e.g. , all requests for this service return the same object , rather than instantiating a new object ) .
The next pipeline element in the chain will wrap the interceptor code around the method in question , and yet another pipeline element would perform the actual object instantiation .
Pipelines really were pretty slick in Needle .
The problem , though , is that instead of leaving them as an implementation detail , I advertised them as one of Needle ’s features .
“ Implement your own service models ! ” I cried .
But , how often , really , is that likely to happen ?
Instead of exposing only the bare minimum of Needle ’s API , I exposed as much of it as I could , because I could .
That ’s a bad idea .
Expose only what you need .
The rest can be there , available , but not formally exposed .
Only when ( and if ) you discover a need to expose more , should you expose more .
This helps for several reasons .
A smaller API is easier to describe , document , and support .
is easier to describe , document , and support .
A smaller API is easier for people to learn .
is easier for people to learn .
A smaller API is easier for you to test .
is easier for you to test .
Extending a small API is much less onerous on your users than changing or restricting a larger API .
Net :: SSH 1.x
Now , I ’ve since come to my senses , but at one time I was completely head - over - heels in love with dependency injection .
Like any schoolboy crush , it embarrasses me now to think about it , but there ’s no denying it .
The proof is everywhere in my project history .
Net :: SSH , in particular .
At the time , I was looking for a good demonstration of the flexibility and power of dependency injection , and since Net: : SSH was another of my pet projects at the time , it seemed like the perfect candidate .
I was still stuck in the “ just in case ” mindset , though , and Net : : SSH 1.x reflected that .
Badly .
For instance , I isolated all the OpenSSL crypto interfaces into their own module , because “ what if someone wanted to plug in a different crypto lib ? ”
Nevermind that there was no other crypto lib for Ruby ( and still is n’t , 4 years later ) .
But WHAT IF ?!?
Now , separation of concerns and modularity are good things , when used in moderation .
But like any design pattern , it becomes evil when taken to extremes .
Too much modularity and you wind up with component soup ( and I hope you ’re hungry , because you ’re going to have a lot of it ) .
With lots of tiny components , the interactions between those components can become difficult to test .
It also fuzzes the line between the public , documented API and the internal , private API .
When you have two large components , it is very easy to say “ A is public , and B is private ” , but when you have two hundred components , where do you draw the line ?
It ’s far too easy to let the “ public ” boundary meander a bit further into “ private ” territory than it should .
Even worse , when I added dependency injection to the mix , it became very , very difficult to follow the the flow of the program , and to understand the dependencies .
Pull up Net:: SSH 1.1.4 , for instance , and find net / ssh.rb .
Just try and figure out how a connection session is instantiated .
It ’s a mess .
Unless you ’re familiar with Needle , it ’ll probably take you a long time to discover that the actual services are configured in the various services.rb files , but even after you figure that out , you still have to figure out how the different services interrelate .
It ’s a mess .
But , is n’t that the opposite of what DI is supposed to do ?
Is n’t DI supposed to improve the maintainability and testability of your code ?
Yeah .
The problem , though , was three - fold .
First , Net:: SSH , though complex in its way , was not really complex enough to need a dependency injection framework .
DI itself adds complexity , and a framework for doing dependency injection adds even more , so before you go that route you need to be very sure that the trade - off in complexity is worth it .
If your project is too small , you ’ll actually increase the complexity of your project by adding a framework for doing DI .
Secondly , I was using a DI framework at a level that was really too granular .
I was using the framework to wire together everything .
No component was too small !
No object too insignificant !
I was on the dependency injection horse , and riding it for all it was worth .
If I ’d taken the time to really understand the pattern , though , I would have learned that though the pattern itself may be applied at the micro level , using a framework to do so is like nuking a mosquito — it works , but it leaves a mess behind .
Which leads to the last problem with Net: : SSH ’s use of Needle : it is really only appropriate for wiring together components of an application .
Very , very few ( Ruby ) libraries will ever be complex enough , in themselves , to justify adding a dependency injection framework to them .
Rather , let the application wire the libraries together as ( and when ) it needs to .
Any more granular than that , and you ’ll run into the same quagmire I did , I promise you .
Dependency Injection in Ruby
So , is there no room for DI in Ruby ?
There definitely is .
I use DI nearly every day in Ruby , but I do not use a DI framework .
Ruby itself has sufficient power to represent any day - to - day DI idioms you need .
Consider this one :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class A end class B def new_client ( with= A ) with .new end end
Here , B declares a factory method for generating new client objects .
Because Ruby lets you declare default values for method arguments , you can let the default client implementation be A , which is the common case .
But for testing , you can easily inject a mock into that method by passing an explicit parameter .
For cases where that does n’t work , you can use a second factory method :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 class
A end class B def new_client client.new end def client A end end
Then , in your tests , you can subclass B , overriding the client method to return your mock client implementation .
It ’s dependency injection , Jim , but probably not as you ’ve known it .
Hashes , too , are your friend .
You can allow optional arguments via hashes to specify implementation classes , defaulting to the standard implementation classes but allowing clients to inject their own implementations where needed :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 class
A end class B def initialize ( options={} ) @client_impl = options [ : client ] || A end def new_client @client_impl .new end end
“ Loose coupling ” and “ high cohesion ” are terms you ’ll hear bandied about in defense of dependency injection , and those traits are certainly desirable .
But strike a balance with pragmatism .
There will be some who call me heretic for saying this , but do n’t be afraid to introduce tighter coupling when it makes sense .
Loose coupling everywhere is what I had with Net: : SSH 1.x , and the result was nearly unmaintainable .

If you read nothing else from this article , take to heart these bite - sized bullet - points :
Direct translations are rarely accurate .
Try using the Google translator to translate a paragraph from English , to Italian , to Japanese , and back to English , and you ’ll see what I mean .
The same is true of programming languages .
Each language has it ’s own idioms , and trying to take what works well in one language and force it directly into another language is doomed to fail , more often than not .

Research that has provided a deeper understanding into the centre of planets could also provide the way forward in the world 's quest for cleaner energy .
An international team of scientists , led by the University of Oxford , working alongside researchers at the Science and Technology Facilities Council 's ( STFC ) Central Laser Facility , has gained a deeper insight into the hot , dense matter found at the centre of planets and as a result , has provided further understanding into controlled thermonuclear fusion .
The full paper on this research has been published , 19 October , in the scientific journal , Nature Physics .
This deeper insight into planets could extend our comprehension of fusion energy – the same energy that powers the sun , and laser driven fusion as a future energy source .
Fusion energy is widely considered an attractive , environmentally clean power source using sea water as its principal source of fuel , where no greenhouse gasses or long lived radioactive waste materials are produced .
Using STFC 's Vulcan laser , the team has used an intense beam of X - rays to successfully identify and reproduce conditions found inside the core of planets , where solid matter has a temperature in excess of 50,000 degrees .
The understanding of the complex state of matter in these extreme conditions represents one of the grand challenges of contemporary physics .
The results from the Vulcan experiments are intended to improve our models of Jupiter and Saturn and to obtain better constraints on their composition and the age of the Solar System .
Using inelastic X - ray scattering measurements on a compressed lithium sample , it was shown how hot , dense matter states can be diagnosed and structural properties can be obtained .
The thermodynamic properties – temperature , density and ionisation state , were all measured using a combination of non-invasive , high accuracy , X - ray diagnostics and advanced numerical simulations .
The experiment has revealed that the matter at the centre of planets is in a state that is intermediate between a solid and a gas over lengths larger than 0.3 nanometres .
To put this into context , 1 nanometre equates to less than 1/10000th of a human hair !
Results showed that extreme matter behaves as a charged liquid , but at smaller distances it acts more like a gas .
Dr Gianluca Gregori , of the University of Oxford and STFC's Central Laser Facility said : " The study of warm dense matter states , in this experiment on lithium , shows practical applications for controlled thermonuclear fusion , and it also represents significant understanding relating to astrophysical environments found in the core of planets and the crusts of old stars .
This research therefore makes it not only possible to formulate more accurate models of planetary dynamics , but also to extend our comprehension of controlled thermonuclear fusion where such states of matter , that is liquid and gas , must be crossed to initiate fusion reactions .
This work expands our knowledge of complex systems of particles where the laws that regulate their motion are both classical and quantum mechanical . "
Professor Mike Dunne , Director of the Central Laser Facility at STFC said : " Using high power lasers to find solutions to astrophysical issues is an area that has been highly active at STFC for some time .
We are very excited that the Vulcan laser has contributed to such a significant piece of research .
The use of extremely powerful lasers is proving to be a particularly effective approach to delivering long - term solutions for carbon - free energy . "
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis took to FOX
News this morning to defend the dangerous , out of control vitriol coming from McCain 's rallies .
His argument ?
John McCain was a POW !
" Look , Chris , I think we have to take this very seriously .
The kind of comments made by Congressman Lewis , a big Obama supporter , are reprehensible .
The idea that you 're going to compare John McCain to the kinds of hate spread in the '60s by somebody like George Wallace is outrageous .
Where was John McCain when George Wallace was spreading his hate and segregationist policies at that time ?
He was in a Vietnam prison camp serving his country with his civil rights also denied .
" Nobody knows sacrifice like John McCain does , and the idea that Barack Obama did n't address this issue directly , had his campaign walk out there with a half - baked statement that did n't even address the comments made by Lewis as related to John McCain .
Barack Obama should apologize to John McCain directly for the kinds of comments made by John Lewis yesterday and that should be the end of this sordid affair . "
What a WATB .
The McCain campaign 's central message is that Barack Obama is a an un-American terrorist sympathizer .
Who the hell are they to complain when a civil rights pioneer rightly condemns them for creating a hateful atmosphere not seen since the tense days of forty years ago .
McCain was right when he told Rick Warren that John Lewis was one of the wisest men he knows .
It 's just a shame that he now wo n't heed his advice .
What this is about
After learning how to build a Flex client and a Python server running on Google App Engine , I decided to try a pure - Web , pure - Python alternative .
I chose Django , a first - class Web framework .
I went through the tutorial and read the excellent book Practical Django Projects .
The next step is building a website with some applications .
Fortunately , I found out about the Pinax project .
It builds a website framework over Django and provides patterns for interoperable applications .
I decided to learn how to leverage it so I can learn best practices and use some of its nice features like notifications .
I will do my learning in the open , as I did before , sharing my path and my discoveries .
This is a journey from the eyes of a n00 b that knows very little about Python , Django and Pinax .
I found out that this process helps me focus and structure my self - learning .
I hope it may be useful to someone that follows the same path .
And maybe someone more knowledgeable will correct one or two of the bloopers I make .
Installing Pinax
I started in a development environment that was already configured to run Django applications and had its fair share of tools , like a Subversion client and sendmail .
You will have to refer to basic Django and Python material if you need to learn how to get to this point .
Also , all my work is being done on Ubuntu 8.10 , so you may need to adjust some commands if you use other environment .
Making a directory for Pinax :
$ mkdir ~/opt/django -p $ cd ~/opt/django
Downloading Pinax and associated applications and libraries :
$ svn checkout http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/trunk/
pinax
I am using version 0.5.0rc1 .
Things might be different if you use a newer version .
Creating a sample project
Edit : I changed these instructions twice , first to reflect best practices , thanks to a tip by Bob Haugen and later when Pinax was updated to require only changes in settings.py and not in manage .py .
Pinax comes with a sample project that can be used directly , but I will create an independent clone that I can change at will without getting in trouble with repository updates later .
$ cd pinax / projects / $ svn export complete_project / ~/ Projects/exploring_pinax
Now we must edit settings.py to reflect the directory where we installed Pinax :
$ cd ~/ Projects / exploring_pinax $ vi settings.py
Change PINAX_ROOT to the main Pinax directory .
For instance :
... PINAX_ROOT = ' /home/fernando/opt/django/pinax ' ...
Also set ROOT_URLCONF using the name of the directory you exported the website project to :
... ROOT_URLCONF = ' exploring_pinax.urls ' ...
After that , save settings.py .
If we want , we can also create a file for future local settings like database passwords .
I wo n’t use it now , but it may be handy to have it already created :
$ touch local_settings.py
Now create the local sqlite3 database :
$ python manage .py syncdb
When asked , create a superuser ( admin ) .
Starting the website
$ python manage .py runserver
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser .
You should have a Pinax website running .
Congratulations !
Login with your superuser and explore at leisure .

NEW YORK , Oct 12 ( Reuters ) -
The average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States recorded its largest drop ever as consumer demand continued to wane and oil prices slid , a prominent industry analyst said on Sunday .
The national average price for self - serve , regular unleaded gas fell 35.03 cents to $ 3.3079 a gallon on Oct. 10 from $ 3.6582 two weeks earlier , according to the nationwide Lundberg Survey .
It was the lowest national average price since March 21 , 2008 .
Since peaking at $ 4.1124 on July 11 , the average cost of a gallon of gas has receded by 80.45 cents .
Diesel fuel fell 21 cents to $ 3.95 a gallon , the first time since March that it has been below $ 4.00 a gallon .
“ Plummeting oil prices and caving gasoline demand have combined to bring the biggest retail gasoline price cut in the history of the market , ” Trilby Lundberg , who compiles the survey , said in an interview .
“ We ’ve been doing this 58 years .
This is truly the biggest price drop . ”
On Friday , fears of a global recession helped drive down U.S. crude oil futures prices more than 10 percent to the lowest settlement since September 2007 .
U.S. crude for November delivery CLX8 settled on Friday at $ 77.70 a barrel , down $ 8.89 , or 10.27 percent , on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Meanwhile , travel on all U.S. roads fell 3.6 percent , or nearly 10 billion vehicle miles in July , compared with the same period last year , according to the most recent figures provided by the Transportation Department .
It was the ninth straight month of declining driving activity .
HOW LOW CAN THEY GO ?
Lundberg said the average gasoline price could fall below $ 3.00 a gallon as early as December .
“ If crude oil prices do n’t spike , we can expect further price cutting for two reasons , ” Lundberg said .
“ Gasoline demand will continue to shrink in our weak economic condition , and retailers , who have been receiving deep buying price cuts , will be anxious to pass through any further price cuts they receive quickly .
They need the sales . ”
According to the Lundberg survey , drivers in Honolulu paid an average of $ 3.91 a gallon for unleaded gas , the highest price in the nation .
The Wichita , Kansas , region had the lowest average price , at $ 2.79 a gallon .
The Lundberg survey evaluates prices at about 5,000 gas stations .

Generic C# WinForms
When Generics was first released in .
Net 2.0 , I was kind of surprised how few built in generic types there were .
A List , a dictionary , a event handler ; but not much beyond that .
Nothing like what you see with C++ STL , ATL , or WTL .
( turns out there are some reasons for that , C++ Templates can do things that C# Generics just can ’t ) .
But no matter , we can invent our own .
In my current desktop app , I have a reoccurring need for an OK / Cancel form .
Plus I had a number of things I wanted preset for me .
The first problem is working with the Generic portion of the C# language .
I want to be able to create the OK / Cancel form like this :
1 : var dlg = new OkCancelForm< MyDisplayControl >( ) ; 2 : if ( dlg.ShowModal ( ) == DialogResult.OK ) 3 : { 4 : // do something here ...
5 : }
Also , I need to be able to retrieve , or load the user control that is being displayed .
I created a property called DisplayControl .
So now I can load and retrieve values from the display control .
I ’ll expand my sample :
1 : var dlg = new OkCancelForm< MyDisplayControl >( ) ; 2 : dlg.DisplayControl.Data = MyData ; // dlg.DisplayControl will be of type MyDisplayControl 3 : // data is a property of MyDisplayControl 4 : var result = dlg.
ShowDialog ( ) ; 5 : if ( result == DialogResult .
OK ) 6 : { 7 : var data dlg.DisplayControl .Data ; 8 : // now do something with the data 9 : }
OK , so that was how I wanted it to work , now onto some real code .
The Implementation
First thing to do is to just create a new form and call it OkCancelForm .
Put on an OK and cancel button just like you normally would .
For a bit of advice on this : I start with two panels , one on the bottom ( containing the OK and Cancel buttons ) docked to the bottom .
And the other docked to Fill in the middle .
This will host your custom control .
Now C# creates forms with 2 files , OkCancelForm.cs and OkCancelForm.designer.cs .
We first want to look at the OkCancelForm.cs , and change the class declaration to what you see below :
1 : public partial class OkCancelForm <T > : Form where T : ContainerControl , new ()
If you compile after doing that , you will see errors ( if you are using ReSharper , you wont even have to compile , you ’ll just see errors ) .
Turns out we have to change the other half of the partial file implementation that makes up a WinForms form .
So open up the file named OkCancelForm.designer.cs , and change the declaration to match this :
1 : partial class OkCancelForm<T >
Even though the class names were the same , because one class was a generic class and the other was not , they did not match .
But , diving into the syntax a bit from the first sample .
After the form declaration you see this code : “ Form where T : ContainerControl , new ( ) “ .
This code tells the generic ( T ) that T must be of type ContainerControl , and must have a default constructor that takes now parameters — because this class is going to create a new instance of T when OkCancelForm is created .
You ca n’t be passing in stuff through the controls constructor .
It just wont work .
Now for some more changes to OkCancelForm.cs .
Here you can see we are adding InitializeDisplayControl ( ) to create a new copy of the display control , and we have added a property called display control of type T ( which must be a ContainerControl , remember ) .
The other little trick we are doing there is making the control full screen .
You will also see a reference to displayPanel on like 14 .
That is one of the two panels I mentioned previously that is docked to the form in fill mode ( the other is docked to the bottom of the form and holds the OK and cancel buttons ) .
1 : private T _displayControl ; 2 : public OkCancelForm ( ) 3 : { 4 : InitializeComponent ( ) ; 5 : InitializeDisplayControl ( ) ; 6 : } 7 : 8 : public T DisplayControl { get { return _displayControl ; } } 9 : 10 : private void InitializeDisplayControl ( ) 11 : { 12 : _displayControl = new T( ) ; 13 : _displayControl .Dock = DockStyle .
Fill ; 14 : displayPanel.Controls.Add(_displayControl ) ; 15 : }
That is the basics of what you need .
Still undone in this sample is validation .
But the tricky part ( knowing how to make a partial class generic ) is pretty well spelled out for you here .
Enjoy .
And if you have any questions , please leave them in the comments .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Who ’s next ?
Hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve threw an $ 85 billion lifeline to American International Group Inc , Wall Street workers took little comfort from the massive rescue and instead tried to guess who would get swept away next .
Even staff at Goldman Sachs Group Inc , among the few investment banks largely unscathed by the credit crisis , signaled fear as the firm ’s stock plunged .
“ We ’re all in this together , ” said one Goldman employee who has been with the firm for six years and currently works in its asset management unit .
She declined to give her name .
“ We are still concerned since we work on Wall Street .
We are not secure .
Nobody is secure . ”
Such worries had already gripped investors , who slaughtered the shares of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , who are seen as the next possible victims of a financial industry crisis after AIG was bailed out and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy protection .
Goldman , which made billions of dollars last year with a timely bet the housing crisis was going to worsen , fell as much as 26 percent .
Morgan Stanley took a 42 percent hit .
Instead of quelling concerns , the AIG rescue seemed to have ignited fears that more bad news is to come .
At stake for tens of thousands of Wall Street employees are highly - paying jobs that help prop up New York City and the wider U.S. economy , as well as billions of dollars in personal stock wealth and bonuses that may be erased .
Across from AIG ’s office near Wall Street , Deutsche Bank AG employees were also fearful of a financial tsunami .

“ I have not read much about us in the papers , but that makes me nervous , ” said one Deutsche staffer , who said she had just returned from vacation .
“ I only heard all these things about AIG from last week , ” she added , pointing out how the global insurance giant ’s status seemed to have evaporated overnight .
Still , some Deutsche employees said the firm may not be in the direct line of fire .
“ We are solid .
We do n’t fool around with mortgages and double mortgages , ” said Juan , a Deutsche Bank employee for 14 years , who said he knew people at AIG .
He declined to give his last name .
WHY AIG ?
The consensus among many Wall Street workers was that the Fed was right in jumping to AIG ’s rescue .
“ It ’s a good thing , ” said Deutsche Bank ’s Juan .
“ Otherwise they would have gone down too , like Lehman .
Forty thousand jobs is too many to lose .
Let ’s hope this is right . ”
The AIG bailout came just days after the Fed refused to help a struggling Lehman Brothers .
Cornered , Lehman filed for bankruptcy earlier this week .
“ You cannot compare the two , given our breadth of products , size of the company and how far - reaching we are , ” said one AIG employee in its insurance unit .
“ They did what was in the best interest of the economy , the best interest of the people and the best interest of the marketplace . ”
But some staffers were confused as to what the rescue meant for them .
“ I do n’t know what to make of it , ” one AIG employee said when asked if she expected any job cuts .
At AIG ’s offices in downtown Manhattan , employees said it was business as usual until they heard otherwise .
Many stood outside their buildings with co-workers and mulled how long the bloodshed in the financial markets would last .
“ I wish this could be the end of it , ” said the AIG insurance employee outside the company ’s office on Water Street .
“ But realistically , it is somewhere in the middle . ”

A factory in Germany has launched production of a super thin electronic reader that was developed at Cambridge University .
Steve Rosenberg reports .
… I saw this NYT article .
Apparently , for the low low price of $ 10 mil , scientists think they could gradually introduce woolly mammoth DNA into an elephant fetus , and eventually give rise to a critter a whole lot like a woolly mammoth .
( I do n’t know whether the critter would ACTUALLY BE a woolly mammoth , vs. a weird woolly elephant , vs. something - we - have - yet - to - name .
Actually , I think the example pretty much obliterates rigid species - bound thinking .
But I digress . )
That ’s nuthin’ , however , compared to what these scientists also think they could do : give rise to a critter a whole lot like Neanderthal .
The article says that ethical considerations would keep that experiment from taking place .
Here I am torn .
Yes , I feel that it is wrong to ‘ monkey ’ with human DNA ( har , har ) , unless there are compelling medical reasons to do so .
I think the threat of a slippery slope is very real .
On the other hand , would it not be exceedingly interesting — nay , totally friggin ’ awesome — to have a Neanderthal around ?
to see what cognitive skills they possessed ?
to be able possibly to talk to ( some version of ) a non-human ?
Actually , the article raises another possibility .
Perhaps the Neanderthal DNA could be spliced into a chimp ’s DNA , and the fetus could be brought to term in a chimp mother .
Does that satisfy the ethical qualms , or introduce new ones ?
Let ’s vote .
How do you feel about the possibility of manufacturing a quasi-Neanderthal ?
We now know that blacks probably did n’t tip the balance for Proposition 8 .
Myth busted .
However , the fact remains that a strikingly high percentage of blacks said they voted to ban same - sex marriage in California .
Why ?
There was one very telling ( and virtually ignored ) statistic in CNN ’s exit poll data that may shed some light :
There were far more black women than black men , and a higher percentage of them said that they voted for the measure than the men .
How wide was the gap ?
According to the exit poll , 70 percent of all blacks said that they voted for the proposition .
But 75 percent of black women did .
There were n’t enough black men in the survey to provide a reliable percentage for them .
However , one can mathematically deduce that of the raw number of survey respondents , nearly twice as many black women said that they voted for it than black men .
Why ?
Here are my theories :
(1) Blacks are much more likely than whites to attend church , according to a Gallup report , and black women are much more likely to attend church than black men .
Anyone who has ever been to a black church can attest to the disparity in the pews .
And black women ’s church attendance may be increasing .
According to a report issued this spring by Child Trends , a nonprofit research center , weekly church attendance among black 12th graders rose 26 percent from 1993 to 2006 , while weekly church attendance for white 12th graders remained virtually flat .
In 2006 , those black teenagers were nearly 50 percent more likely to attend church once a week than their white counterparts .
And it is probably safe to assume that many of them were going to church with their mothers since Child Trends reported that around the time that they were born , nearly 70 percent of all black children were born to single mothers .
Sarkozy threatens to sue over ' voodoo doll ' that tells people to stick pins into President 's body
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to sue a publishing company unless it withdraws a Sarkozy doll that comes with a " voodoo manual " telling readers to plant pins in it .
The doll is emblazoned with some of Sarkozy 's most famous quotes such as " Get lost you pathetic a *** hole " -- his words to a bystander who refused to shake his hand at a farm show last year .
Readers are encouraged to plant pins in the quotes .
The Sarkozy voodoo doll encourages people to stick pins into the model of the French president
" Nicolas Sarkozy has instructed me to remind you that , whatever his status and fame , he has exclusive and absolute rights over his own image , " his lawyer Thierry Herzog wrote to publishers K&B in a letter published by newspaper Le Monde .
Nicholas Sarkozy has issued legal proceedings against the firm
Herzog said Sarkozy would sue the publishing firm if it did n't respond and pull the product .
K&B has issued 20,000 copies of the manual and doll .
The company has also issued a Segolene Royal doll representing Sarkozy 's rival in last year 's presidential election .
Her lawyer said she was also considering legal action .
Voodoo is a religion rooted in West Africa that is practised in parts of the Caribbean , especially Haiti , and parts of the southern United States .
According to a widespread belief , voodoo worshippers can plant pins in dolls representing their enemies to curse them from afar .
However , voodoo experts say the practice has been widely misunderstood and misrepresented by outsiders .

Introduction
' Anyone can speak Troll , ' said Fred dismissively , 'all you have to do is point and grunt . '
" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire " - J.K. Rowling ( 2000 )
There are too many Trolls that infest Newsgroups and discussion forums - this site gives you some ideas about how to stop their antics permanently .
Before we begin , though , understand this : the best way to deal with a Troll is to ignore them entirely .
They are not worth your time , however you may feel about their comments .
However , this site recognises that sometimes you may be unwittingly drawn into a ' conversation ' with them .
This site will help you to deal with that situation .
" How To Handle A Troll " is updated on a semi- regular basis .
You might like to visit this page again to learn new tactics against the Trolls .
Similarly , you might like to let your friends know about the site .
After you have finished reading , please link to this guide from your website .
Do n't let anyone get destroyed by the Trolls !
What is a Troll ?
The best way to know what a Troll is , is to see what they do .
The following link is a humourous look at how to Troll , even encouraging people to take up the habit .
Note how the author himself distinguishes between the Trolls who are just trying to gain attention , or are trying to create havoc .
Yet the author has made a fatal flaw :
He fails to see that ALL Trolls crave attention .
That is the sole reason they exist - whether or not they want to feel that they have achieved something ( even if it is destruction ) or to be recognised for doing something deviant , they want just a little attention in their direction .
Remember : Without attention , Trolls are nothing .
They have no audience , and no victim .

NOTE : The previous website has been removed .
I will try to find a replacement site that demonstrates Troll mentality , but until then , you 'll have to make do with my explanations , sorry !
I would encourage you to read the whole page .
We 'll come back to it later , but it is well worth it anyway .
The mentality of a Troll is obvious - he wants a cheap laugh , and that is all .
The offense that may be caused is of no concern to him , as are any other ramifications of his actions .
This Usenet post describes what many people consider to be trolls .
There are hundreds of such definitions across the 'net , on various different websites ( including this one , and many that are linked on this site ) .
Ultimately , these many definitions of trolls , all vary slightly , but they all sum up to this :- Trolls are a nuisance .
They purposefully cause annoyance to other users , but their approach can , and does , vary .
Some trolls are obvious , some are not .
This website attempts to show you some of the different approaches that trolls take - to keep you , as an Internet user , prepared .
Are there different sorts of Trolls ?
Yes .
There are several types of Trolls , and each is discussed on in more depth later in this site .
They are : The Bored's , The Liars , The Confrontationalists and The Controversials Many Trolls just want to be a nuisance .
They 're kids who are n't mature enough to have a sensible conversation .
These Trolls fall under The Bored 's category , but that does not necessarily mean that all Trolls are children .
Many " mature " adults find enjoyment in Trolling groups .
But there are other trolls who set out to cause havoc .
This may include posing as a regular poster in the group ( then acting in a way to deflame that person 's good name ) .
Or it may be to draw members of the group into an argument .
You can read about that sort of behaviour here .
Here , a Troll has managed to draw people into an off - topic discussion that has resulted in an innocent poster losing his ISP access .
This is all part of the entertainment for the Troll .
NOTE : The previous website has been removed .
I will try to find a replacement site that demonstrates
Troll mentality , but until then , you 'll have to make do with my explanations , sorry !
Why do n't people like Trolls ?
Surely they 're just having fun !
Trolls are a nuisance , as they frequently set out to antagonise other people who post in the same forum .
For example , take the following post by " Drew " in the Usenet foum alt.tv.star-trek.enterprise LOW RATINGS NOBODY WATCHES IT LIKE STNG STNG HAVE THE MOST RATINGS .
By the way , you can Click Here to see the message on Google
The above message is a prime example of a Bored Troll post .
It is almost unreadable , atrocious grammar , and blatantly insults the show that the newsgroup focuses upon .
The Troll is probably a bored teenager .
STNG is supposed to read ST : TNG ( or , Star Trek : The Next Generation ) .
The bad spelling is a part of the Troll - attempting to provoke insults from the regulars about his spelling .
Responses such as " You 're an idiot .
You can't even spell . " is what the Troll is hoping for .
This way , he can draw you into a prolonged argument about who is the bigger idiot .
Sensible ways to respond ( if you have to at all ) are discussed below .
Trolls who throw insults across the ' net are Confrontationalists and relish seeing any response that indicates the respondee is wound up , or aggravated by their Trolling .
It is fair to assume that people who regularly post to an Enterprise newsgroup will be fans of the show .
By saying that the show is not up to par , " Drew " is hoping for other posters to get angry with him , degrading themselves to the mentality of schoolchildren in the process .
Trolls are the Usenet equivalent of the School bully .
They do n't have to be that big , hard , or clever to throw their weight around - but they do enjoy watching the over reactions of the other posters .
Their messages are poorly laid out - usually on purpose , with bad grammar , spelling , and , more often than not , written entirely in caps .
Some Trolls can be entertaining , but that may not be their intention , nor may that be the intention of any troll .
The Troll Sukami Master infests the newsgroup alt .
fan.harry - potter ( among others ) , and after one post titled " Trollness " , OnsenMark followed up with ... ( click here for google ) serj_tankian , you are n't .
Hell , even the freakin ' * Boinger * is more entertaining than you , and s/he misspells every single word !
But Sukami Master is n't trying to entertain the group .
He ( it is usually a he ) is trying to entertain himself .
Perhaps this highlights just how shallow Trolls really are .
So , in response to the question ( finally ) , yes , trolls are just having fun , but at the expense of every one else in the group .
Trolls will happily do the exact opposite of what you want them to do .
Sukami Master might be accused of being a " boring " troll , but he gains a reaction every time , because he does not act how people expect a troll to act .
How do people respond to Trolls ?
Usually the most obvious way - they get offended .
" Drew " 's post was not as offensive as many you may have come across .
Others pick on individuals - either by name calling , personal insults , or by posing as that person to degrade their character .
Naturally , people do n't like this !
Who would ?
And so , the general result is a range of insults flung across the Internet which does nothing but antagonise the regulars on the board , and entertain the Troll .
What is a good way to deal with a Troll ?
It depends upon the Troll - If you realise that a Troll is just trying to wind you up , or offend you , Be Calm .
Do n't rise to them .
Let 's take the example of " Drew " again .
How would you react ?
These are three responses to " Drew " ... yeah right .
do you trolls really thing your lies are even SEMI BELIEVEABLE ????
enterprise has a guaranteed 6 years .
ratings might not be great , but what 's UPN going to replace it with ?
the Hughleys ?
This is possibly not the worst way to respond - but it does show the Troll that you have been wound up by their post .
There is a certain amount of gratification for him in that !
Quoting your side of the argument to him will not help .
Even quoting facts will not help .
Across the great Internet divide , facts may as well be nonsense figures .
By " SHOUTING " you are expressing your anger , which to him is humourous .
He is safe in his room , and so such agression means nothing to him .
ST : TNG was a first run syndication show .
Ratings work different for syndicated shows , than network shows .
High ratings for a syndicated show could be considered low for a network show .
Believe me when I say that there will be a season 2 of Enterprise , and I imagine a season 7 .
Again , quoting facts will do nothing , except possibly force an argument that he will relish in , and , whether or not you win intellectually , he will draw out until you could n't stand it any longer through mis-quotes ( of your posts ) , lies , and perjorative comments .
Facts and arguments are a waste of time .
You may have a valid point about the low ratings , in comparison to some shows that have had a few more seasons to be developed .
ST - TNG definately was a very popular show a few seasons into its run !
However , could you not use capslock all the time , as it can be rather difficult to read , and to some , it can seem like you are shouting .
Start with a compliment !
As shown above , accept that they may well have a valid argument , and therefore have a necessary place within the forum .
Keep Calm !
Do n't let your anger show through .
Compliment them before any criticism - and keep that criticism to a minimum .
They do n't how to react .
Before long , they may find themselves drawn into sensible conversations with the group .
If possible , make any criticism sound like a criticism of yourself , not them .
Here , the responder has made the caps problem seem like the readers fault , rather than the posters .
What about other types of Trolls ?
Some Trolls will pose as regular members of a forum - either by pretending to be someone else , or by joining in some conversations , letting their subversiveness slip through very slowly .
For example , this Troll started by joining in some conversations on the alt.movies .
spielberg group .
" Togetherinparis " slowly began to lie , about progressively implausible situations , until eventually most regular posters left the group .
Now , several years on , the Troll appears to be the only person left in the group - still proclaiming that he came up with the ideas for Minority Report , The Force ( as in Star Wars ) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
How is the best way to deal with this ?
It may be difficult to recognise his lies to begin with , and then it is easy to fall into the trap of outright believing him .
As soon as you recognise a Liar , do n't try to get him to prove his facts - it 's impossible across Usenet , and he knows this .
You may like to try some of the above tactics - try to draw him into a sensible conversation , without dropping to his level .
But , ultimately , there can be only one way to deal with him : Killfile him .
Do not let yourself be seduced into having an argument over the validity of his " facts " .
Other Trolls will try to draw you into a futile argument by a variety of means , but usually by saying something controversial .
A Trolls message may be as simple as " Prove that God does not exist " that has been crossposted to a range of religious newsgroups .
A Troll is usually idnetifable , as he will often refuse to take a stance on either side - at one time arguing that God exists , and another that He does n't .
These Trolls are Controversials .
A Trolls message will often be crossposted to one or more newsgroups that have nothing to do with the subject .
By clicking here you can read a Troll thread that spanned for more than four hundred messages - just because it was a controversial subject , and in spite of the fact that the subject had nothing to do with one of the forums in which it was posted .
Trolls revel in their threads lasting such a long time - the longer a thread is , the more legitimate users have been sucked into their little game .
All Trolls , Controversials , Liars , Boreds and Confrontationalists use " Logical Fallacies " - in other words , they lie , change their minds , or otherwise simply claim any perspective other than the concensus .
Logical Fallacies can be a legitimate form of discussion in many instances .
But Trolls can use this to their advantage , suggesting that fallacies arise in their " opponents " arguments , where , in truth , those fallacies may , or may not exist .
For example , in the following theoretical trollish encounter , the USER follows some of the above steps when approaching the troll ...
In Newsgroup alt.movies .
spielberg ...
TROLL : SPIELBERG'S FILMS SUC !
USER : Do you think so ?
I have always felt that the critique of a film - maker lies with their audience .
Personally , I quite enjoy Spielbergs films , however it is good to see an opinion other than a positive one addressed .
At this point , it is unlikely that the Troll would respond - he has made his statement , and enough people may have argued against him that he is wrong , causing havoc in the group , that his work has already been done for him .
We will presume , however , that the troll wishes to create a prolonged thread about Mr. Spielbergs work .
TROLL : You know that Spielbergs films suck !
If one meber of the audience dislikes the film , then it sucks for them .
Therefore , Spielbergs films SUCK !
Arguing with the troll will get you nowhere .
The counter - argument misses half the point , and they will claim the same of you .
What 's the best way of dealing with this sort of Troll ?
Ignore it .
Killfile the thread .
Others will join in , undoubtedly - but the more people ignore it , the better .
Even by acknowledging to the Troll that you know what it is ( " You are a Troll !
Go away ! " ) will boost his ego .
Like the best way of winning a fight , the best way of beating a Troll is to not get involved .
That way , you can't get hurt .
So , in brief ...
BE CALM - Do n't rise to their antagonising attitude .
DON'T LOWER YOURSELF TO THEIR LEVEL - Do n't start throwing insults at them .
It 's what they want .
PAY A COMPLIMENT -
It is the last thing they are expecting - and the opposite of what they want .
ENCOURAGE THEM TO JOIN IN - Let them know they have valid points , and make their faults seem like yours .
But , above all else , USE YOUR KILLFILE -
It is there for a reason , and it is your most powerful weapon .
Will this advice get rid of all Trolls ?
No .
There will always be the persistent ones , and their will always be people in the discussion forum who will inadvertently feed the Trolls ego .
But even for the Trolls that do n't completely disappear , your actions will sow the seed of doubt in their minds about their passtimes .
For Trolls that just wo n't go away , there is always the ultimate weed - killer application - The Killfile !
If worse comes to worst , however , do n't say anything .
Ignore them .
Killfile them , and any thread that gets created by the topics they start .
Frankly , they are not worth the time of yours that they will waste .
A new word is added to the English language every 98 minutes , says the Global Language Monitor , a descendant of yourDictionary.com .
( Ironically , the group 's " about " page has " dictionary " misspelled as " dictioanry " in one place . )
According to the Global Language Monitor 's best estimate , the millionth English word will be coined sometime next April .
However , the Global Language Monitor is a bit looser with its acceptance of new words than most dictionaries .
For example , unabridged dictionaries include about 600,000 words , compared to the 900,000 tracked thus far by the Global Language Monitor .
From Smithsonian :
" We went back to the Middle English and saw that the definition of a word was ' a thought spoken , ' " said Paul JJ Payack , president and chief word analyst at the Monitor , " which means if I say a word , and you understand me , it 's a real word . "
Payack counts staycation , Facebook and Wikipedia as words .
But he also follows some of the old rules .
For example , words that are both noun and verb , such as " water " are counted only once .
He does n't count all the names there are for chemicals , because there are hundreds of thousands .
Once the Monitor identifies a word , it tracks it over time , watching to see where the word appears .
Based on that measurement , they decide if the word has " momentum , " basically , whether it 's becoming more popular or if it's a one - hit wonder of the linguistic world .
At first glance , this seems a lot like a dictionary 's system .
" It 's the same as the old [ method ] , just recognizing the new reality , " Payack said .
The Monitor 's method gives a lot more weight to online citations .

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP
) --
Facebook has won $ 873 million judgment against a Canadian man who bombarded the popular online hangout with sexually explicit '' spam ' ' messages .
The victory , sealed with a judge 's order issued last Friday , probably wo n't yield a windfall for privately held Facebook Inc. , whose revenue this year is expected to range between $ 250 million to $ 300 million .
Court records indicate the alleged spammer , Adam Guerbuez of Montreal , has been difficult to find since Facebook sued him four months ago .
But Facebook is hoping the size of the judgment will scare off other spammers who might be tempted to target the Palo Alto , Calif . - based company 's audience of more than 120 million users .
'' Everyone who participates constructively in Facebook should feel confident that we are fighting hard to protect you against spam and other online nuisances , '' Max Kelly , Facebook 's director of security , wrote Monday on the company 's blog .
Efforts to reach Guerbuez for comment on Monday were unsuccessful .
The case against Guerbuez and his business , Atlantis Blue Capital , illustrates how Internet rogues can manipulate Facebook 's communications system to unleash massive marketing blitzes .
According to Facebook , Guerbuez fooled its users into providing him with their usernames and passwords .
One method was the use of fake Web sites that posed as legitimate destinations .
After Guerbuez gained access to user 's personal profiles , he used computer programs to send out more than 4 million messages promoting a variety of products , including marijuana and penis enlargement products , during March and April of this year , Facebook said .
'' Despite the resources dedicated to spam eradication , current available technology does not permit Facebook to completely prevent the transmission of spam on its site , '' the company 's lawyers wrote in the case against Guerbuez .

Are you comfortable with your life ?
Are you excelling in your life ?
The majority of people ca n’t answer “ yes ” to both questions .
They ’re either pushing their boundaries to the limits and hence are uncomfortable , or they ’ve become comfortable and stopped pushing .
The problem is that the “ standard track ” tends to push people towards comfort and away from excellence .
I know I ’ve recently railed against American culture and our ideological inconsistencies , but the impetus of this post is not from that , but rather Steve Kennedy ’s comment in “ Why Productivity is Bunk . ”
In that comment , he says :
I think that my main problem is not having defined goals that have to be accomplished to pay the rent .
I have a high - paying day job that provides me with a level of comfort that does n’t force me to be focused and productive with my ideas .
Unfortunately , that day job does n’t provide me with the feeling of accomplishment that I am constantly seeking .
Steve is further along than a lot of people , for he recognizes the problem .
But it goes much deeper than that .
Pushing Yourself is Hard Work
Pushing yourself into new frontiers takes a lot of work .
I ’ll just use blogging as the example of pushing those frontiers .
There ’s a period most bloggers go through that ’s incredibly hard to work through .
During this period , you ’re writing in the dark , your readership and pageviews are low , and you ’re not making much money ( if that ’s what you ’re trying to do ) .
From what I can tell , this period usually last three or four months .
A lot of this has nothing to do with the quality of your content .
I ’ve watched some blogging phenoms take off in six or eight weeks , but there were a lot of contributing factors to their success that many of us should n’t really count on .
Back to the comfort bit .
It ’s really hard to go to work , come home , do chores , and then spend another two to four hours working on something that does n’t seem to be progressing .
It ’s much easier , and more comfortable , to come home , do our chores , have a little leisure , and then go to bed .
Rinse and repeat for a few decades until retirement .
The problem , of course , is that that track wo n’t lead to our excellence .
Our energy , ideas , and time will be spent on other people ’s projects and goals and not our own , and we ’ll never push our own boundaries and become excellent .
We ’ll never learn that thrill when something that ’s through - and - through ours takes off and the fear that it will stink and plummet .
Blogging was just the example .
Almost any new endeavor is like this .
At some point you either have to get risky and quit to do what ’s making you excel full - time , or you have to put in a lot of extra work to maintain your full - time job and build your new endeavor .
It ’s hard as hell to do , and faced with the secure comfort provided by the full - time career and the risky - as - hell prospect of doing what we love on our own , a lot of us buckle for comfort .
Do You Have Room to Grow ?
A few of us are lucky enough to be in an employed position that allows the same thrills and spills that I ’m speaking of .
They go to work challenged and leave exhausted not from watching the clock or spending their energy on someone else ’s projects , but rather the exhaustion that comes from throwing themselves at a task or project that they ’re fully invested in .
Most of these people have a work culture , though , that praises the individual ’s contribution to the project .
( Google ’s corporate ethic comes to mind on this one . )
If you ’re in the position in which you can push the boundaries while being employed by someone else , then kudos .
Push it , start excelling , and smile upon your fortune .
Someone will pay you to be excellent !
If you ’re not in that position , you have got to come to terms with either being comfortable or being excellent .
At the end of the day , the choice is yours .
What ’s It Like on the Other Side ?
I ’ve said this to a lot of people , and I do so because it ’s true .
If you find that thing that makes you come alive , you will wake up early and stay up late working on it .
You will come alive from the inside , and even though you ’re risking it all , it ’ll ( mostly ) feel like you ’re risking more by not doing it .
If you do n’t get up early excited about the possibilities of the day , you ’re not excelling .
If you do n’t smile when you think about what you do , you ’re not doing the right things .
If you do n’t want to talk about what you ’re doing with other people , you ’re not excited enough about it yourself .
The only person that can really make the change is you .
It ’s not your boss ’s responsibility to give you something to do that lights your inner fire .
It ’s not your family ’s or friends ’ responsibility .
The honest and sad truth is that they ’ll likely get in your way .
They mean well ( they really do ) , but the choice is yours and yours alone .
So : Will you excel , or will you remain comfortable ?

A short treaty on high - performance session caching .
Using memcached for sessions is naive ( faster is not always better ) and prone to huge issues with random log-outs .
In - fact , as your site become more critical and has higher traffic then although it is counter intuitive you need to abandon RAM based caching solutions as users will quickly overwhelm the available storage .
Database sessions provide a reasonably robust solution for badly designed server farms that do not use consistent server forwarding for a given user .
Consistently forwarding a given user to a given server using file sessions is more efficient , with the only issue being the potential loss of the server and hence a random logout when another working server is selected - but that is a ' blue - moon ' issue .
However , this issue is tiny in comparison to the loss of the session server database storage which would take down the entire site .
There is also the option of using MCache sessions which access a session server .
Distributed session servers are the best option for high - traffic multi-server installations and require only simple server forwarding rules .
Distributed = robust , and caching is multi- level moving from RAM to disc and eventually to oblivion ( GC ) as usage of the session data ages through lack of access .
In the end each solution has a number of points of failure .
Memcached is better used for less critical and far more efficient caching of data that can easily be recreated without user intervention .
An extra moment to re-cache a lost page or query result is of no consequence to a user ; having to log in again because session data was lost is highly annoying and leads to users giving up on the site ( Google ' evony login ' for a high profile example )
Overall experience in server farms using from ten to over five hundred servers has led us to this recommendation .
1 . Make sure your load balancing rules send the same user to the same server consistently .
This results is very efficient use of both database and memory caching .
This allows for efficient file caching of sessions using the power of disc caches .
2 . Even if you can do ( 1 ) above then there is still merit in using some form of persistent and properly garbage collected session caching .
memcache and memcached both will create random log-outs for users and should be avoided for reasons given in the narrative .
Database session handling is robust across multiple servers , but its speed ( or lack thereof ) is the reason for this entire discussion .
Here mcache ( which does * not* stand for memory cache ) provides a session server with all the benefits of both memory caching for recent sessions and disc backup for swapped out session data .
Of course , the overhead in setting up mcache is higher - you may actually have to read a manual rather than using someone else 's example from the interweb ;-)

Premier Gordon Campbell did n’t bill it as the 10 Commandments .
But his economic address tonight was clearly designed to prevent two B.C. Liberal by - election candidates from wandering in the political desert for the next 40 years .
The timing of the premier ’s speech — which included 10 “ key actions ” — could n’t have been better for Arthur Griffiths and Dr. Margaret MacDiarmid , who are running as B.C. Liberal candidates in Vancouver - Burrard and Vancouver - Fairview , respectively .
On Wednesday ( October 29 ) , Griffiths squares off against New Democrat Spencer Herbert in the downtown constituency that Lorne Mayencourt held by a hair in 2005 .
MacDiarmid faces New Democrat Jenn McGinn in a west side constituency that Gregor Robertson narrowly won in 2005 .
The Greens are running their leader Jane Sterk in Vancouver - Fairview , and their vice chair Drina Read in Vancouver - Burrard .
If the B.C. Liberals lose both by - elections to the New Democrats , it will give NDP Leader Carole James and her caucus tremendous momentum moving toward the general election in May , 2009 .
Do n’t kid yourself .
By - elections are important on the eve of a general election .
In 2004 , the NDP won a landslide victory in Surrey - Panorama Ridge , which helped the party marginalize the Greens and eventually take 33 seats in the 2005 general election .
In 1981 , the Social Credit won an upset win in Kamloops , which strengthened the party as it headed toward the 1983 general election .
A by - election win can motivate campaign workers , encourage donors to contribute more money , and influence subsequent media coverage .
Campbell 's announced actions — which included a three - percent personal - income - tax cut retroactive to January and a 2.5 - percent small - business tax cut effective January 1 — were probably cooked up in part to give the B.C. Liberals a boost in the upcoming by - elections .
His promise to provide unlimited deposit insurance in B.C. credit unions ( previously , deposits were guaranteed up to $ 100,000 ) is another vote getter for wealthier residents , many of whom are more likely to vote Liberal .
The problem for Campbell is that a by - election offers an opportunity to voters to express their disapproval of him without worrying about any change in government .
And for that reason , the premier 's 10 Commandments probably wo n’t be enough to roll back the NDP tide next Wednesday .

“ Are you joking ? ”
That was one of Sen .

Barbara
West conducted the interview for WFTV - Channel 9 and asked the Democratic vice presidential candidate if Sen. Barack Obama was a “ Marxist , ” referenced a recent statement Obama made in Ohio to Joe the Plumber about “ spreading the wealth around , ” and was Biden “ embarassed ” about Obama ’s alleged ties to ACORN .
“ You may recognize this famous quote , ” West said .
“ ‘ From each according to his abilities to each according to his needs . ’
That ’s from Karl Marx .
How is Sen. Obama not being a Marxist if he intends to spread the wealth around ? ”
Biden did not immediately take the question seriously .
“ Are you joking ?
Is this a joke or is that a real question ? “
Biden said .
“ It ’s a ridiculous comparison with all due respect . ”
For her final question , West asked Biden what he would say to the people “ who are concerned that Barack Obama will want to turn American into a socialist country , much like Sweden ? ”

And Hurricane
Ike did not provide the worst - case test the laboratory will someday face , some critics say .
Ike ’s 100 - m.p.h. winds were on the low side for a hurricane , yet it still flooded most of the island ’s buildings .
The university ’s teaching hospital , on the same campus as the lab , has been shut down for more than a month .
Image Researchers working in the Robert E. Shope Medical Laboratory at the University of Texas in Galveston .
The school built the smaller laboratory as part of its efforts to procure the national laboratory .

“ The University of Texas should consider locating its biohazards lab away from Galveston Island and out of harm ’s way , ” Ken Kramer , director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club , said .
“ As destructive as it was , Hurricane Ike was only a Category 2 storm .
A more powerful storm would pose an even greater threat of a biohazards release . ”
The laboratory is one of two the Bush administration pushed after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The second is being built at Boston University Medical Center , where it met stiff community resistance .
Not so in Texas , where there was hardly a whimper of protest .
For starters , the University of Texas Medical Branch is one of the largest employers on the island of 57,000 people .
In addition , the leaders of the medical school skillfully sold community leaders and politicians on the high - tech safety measures at the lab and on the economic boon to Galveston , an impoverished town in need of the 300 jobs the laboratory would bring .
University leaders met twice a month with community leaders for several years to dispel fears of pathogens escaping .
Then they created a permanent advisory committee of residents that included some of their critics .
The campaign to win over residents was effective .
In 2004 , the university built a small laboratory and won federal approval to study extremely lethal pathogens there .
The smaller laboratory  named for Dr. Robert E. Shope , a virus expert  helped persuade federal officials it was feasible to erect the national laboratory next to it .
So on Tuesday at about 1:30 PM , I will be going to do the ultimate stress test .
It ’s totally nuclear dude .
It promises to light me up like a town full of lights at midnight .
Am I ready for it ?
Hell yeah because I want to know what I need to do to get back to my “ normal ” self .
So in view of the big day tomorrow , I thought a little celebration is in order .
How bout some music ?
So I hope you enjoyed the post .
I hope to see you all tomorrow evening .
Just in case though , it ’s been a great ride .
To Tom and Cuz , hang in there guys , it ’ll get better .
To all of my Cowboy ’s fans friends on MySpace , let me know how the new stadium looks when it opens .. lol .

Chief Alaska Trooper says potential witness tampering in Troopergate " serious " State Legislator Follows Up On Trooper Letter To Call for Independent Investigator Today an Alaska legislator called on the State 's Attorney General to appoint an independent investigator to look into possible criminal witness tampering by McCain - Palin campaign staff in Alaska .
Rep. Gara 's call came at the suggestion of the Director of the Alaska State Troopers , who called the potential of witness tampering matter " serious . "
Director of the State Troopers , Colonel Audie Holloway , suggested in his letter that the state call on the State Troopers to hire an independent investigator .
The letters from Rep. Gara , and from the State Troopers are attached .
Trooper response letter 10-02-08.pdf ( 219KB )
10.20.2008 Witness Tampering Independent Investigator.doc ( 79KB ) Over the past two months McCain - Palin campaign staff tried to stop the Alaska legislature 's bi-partisan Troopergate investigation , which recently concluded with a report that that state 's ethics law was broken .
See Michael Isakoff , Newsweek , " Can He Stop Troopergate ? " ( Sept. 16 , 2008 ) .
" Until Senator McCain sent campaign staff up here on August 29 , everyone , including the Governor , agreed the Legislature 's investigation was proper .
After the McCain staffers arrived , people who were willing to testify starting violating their subpoenas .
It 's not rocket science that someone worked to change their minds , and that 's a crime under Alaska law , " said Rep. Gara .
The legislative investigation was initiated by a bi-partisan committee of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats in July , before Governor Palin was named to the McCain ticket .
On October 10 that committee voted unanimously to release the independent investigator 's report finding one ethics violation , and finding that the Attorney General had improperly withheld documents .
Alaska 's witness tampering law makes it a crime to " attempt " to " induce " a person not to show up for a legislative subpoena .
See statutes below .
Approximately 10 witnesses failed to show for subpoenas during the Legislature 's investigation into whether Governor Palin or her staff acted improperly in seeking the firing of her former brother - in - law , a State Trooper .
After failing to cooperate with subpoenas , these witnesses have since provided written statements .
Starting on August 29 the McCain campaign tried to create public pressure to stop the investigation with near - daily press conferences , and participated in unsuccessful legal efforts to try to stop the investigation .
The independent investigation concluded on October 10 , 2008 , when the investigator 's report was released by a unanimous vote of the Alaska Legislature 's Legislative Council .
A separate investigation by the State 's Personnel Board is ongoing .
For further information , contact Rep. Les Gara with questions at ( 907 ) 250-0106 .
Alaska 's witness tampering statutes follow : Alaska Statute 11.56.545 - " ( a ) Tampering with a witness in the second degree : A person commits the crime of tampering with a witness in the second degree if the person knowingly induces or attempts to induce a witness to be absent from an official proceeding , other than a judicial proceeding , to which the witness has been summoned .
( b ) Tampering with a witness in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor .
( Emphasis added ) .
AS 11.56.540 has similar elements , and is a felony .

What does not get as much coverage is now many suits get filed in the other direction , as the fast food corporations prove they can think up far stupider reasons to sue than their customers can .

In 1990 , two UK versions of hippies were handing out pamphlets on the streets the way hippies ( and various cults ) tend to .
The pamphlets made wild accusations about how McDonald 's sells unhealthy food and creates pollution .
McDonald 's was not amused and filed a libel suit , which is good for them because a sequel to the pamphlet detailing how McDonald 's burgers are made from goat scrotum and how the Hamburglar made a series of gloryhole videos called " Robble Gobble " was already in the planning stages .
The Result :
The case went to trial and pretty much became the biggest , most embarrassing thing it possibly could have been for McDonald's .
The two hippies , an out - of - work mailman and a gardener , represented themselves and proceeded to fuck McDonald 's six ways from Sunday for seven straight years .

They called 180 witnesses to back up the claims they had made in the pamphlet , and cost McDonald 's millions in legal bills .
In the end , the defendants had managed to prove three - fifths of their claims , but were found guilty of libel on the rest .
However , that managed to prove McDonald 's guilty on a number of counts and also made them look like epic assholes .
An appeal by the defendants went on to fuck McDonald 's further and make them look even more like a faceless corporation of death bent on killing children with Happy Meals , to the point where McDonald 's basically folded and said they would not seek to collect on the money owed .

6 Carl 's Anus Burger chain Carl's Jr. sued rival Jack in the Box over an ad campaign that implied Carl 's Jr. made their burgers out of the tender meat of the anus .
Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy Carl 's Jr. boasts that their burgers are made of " Angus " beef and Jack in the Box staked their entire campaign on the fact that " Angus " sort of sounds like " anus . "
Carl 's Jr. sued on the grounds that people may be too retarded to know that Angus beef does not come from a cow 's ass and they wanted to protect that loyal base of retarded customers from being led astray .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement The Result :
In July 2007 , a judge denied Carl 's Jr. an injunction to stop the ads from running .
A suit is still pending but obviously it 's moot because if Carl 's Jr. wins , Jack in the Box can't go back and erase the ads from the customers ' memory .
By the way , Carl 's Jr. provided survey evidence to show that 36 percent of people thought Angus meat came from cow ass , which begs the bigger question of why they sell Angus burgers at all if they acknowledge a third of people think that .

How to make clothes , bedding last longer 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
We all know how to keep our clothes and bedding and towels looking unfrayed and unfaded :
Do n't wash them and , especially , do n't dry them .
Of course , then they end up looking soiled and smelling worse , and even a bad economy does n't seem like excuse enough for that .
It 's a trade - off , and that 's what making things last is all about :
Would you rather spend more money for a jacket that keeps its shape or shop at Wal - Mart ?
Buy a pricey and complex detergent or a greener one ?
Devote more time to sorting and prepping laundry or watch " Grey 's Anatomy " ?
Use more water per load or meet East Bay rations ?
Build an extra closet to give clothes more breathing room or unload stuff ?
Dial up the gentle cycle and cold water or opt for the clean white look that only hot water and bleach bring ?
" Just think of how many things affect the wear of a garment , " said Harold Baker , the chemist and associate research fellow Clorox refers to as its Dr. Laundry .
" Man , there 's a ton of things that go on - from the wearing phase to the washing phase to the drying phase , I can screw it up in a lot of ways .
You have to consider the variables . "
We screw up when we buy an article of inferior quality .
It 's not so easy to judge the quality of fabrics , but here 's a tip from Lori Baird and Yankee Magazine 's " Do n't Throw It Out : Recycle , Renew and Reuse to Make Things Last " :
" The more industrialized the country , the less likely it is that the garment will shrink or bleed . "
That would favor the likes of Italy , China and the United States over India and Moldova .
Yet the chemists behind Procter & Gamble 's new Tide Total Care with Protective Fiber Complex advise against linking longevity and price .
" The higher quality garments are n't necessarily immune to fiber wear , " said Dawn French , director of research and development for fabric care .
" But we 've worked with the $ 5 Wal - Mart T - shirt and the $ 50 T - shirt from Saks - and the new products can benefit both , especially over time . "
Fibers start to wear when we put clothes on wire hangers in a crowded closet .
When we pull on a sweater and move around , fibers rub against each other .
When we sleep on the sheets , we begin the fraying process .
Washing , says Dr. Laundry , wears them further - between the agitation and the detergent and , especially if we 've overloaded , the friction of the clothes rubbing against each other .
Yet , if we can't get them clean , they 'll soon look dingy and unpresentable , especially if we put them in the dryer when they 're still soiled .
Dr. Laundry 's company makes several kinds of bleach , which according to environmental reports is not all that un - green to use around the house .
It begins as common table salt and ends that way - and though in its undiluted bleaching stages it can bore a hole through your favorite T - shirt , experts generally have concluded that it cleans and disinfects like nothing else and household use does n't contaminate groundwater , generate dioxins or significantly harm the environment .
The latest bleach from Clorox , HE , is designed for the tiny compartments on the front - loading ( high - efficiency ) washing machines we 'll all be using eventually .
HE is thick , so it 's less likely to splash when poured - and , it helps stop bacteria growing in these super - water - tight machines that do n't completely drain .
The new Tide ( $ 6.99 for 20 ounces ) contains silicone , polymer and " chlorine scavengers . "
That 's because while chlorine is good for cleaning , it 's less beneficial when it comes to preservation of fiber and dyes .
Tide Total Care coats fabric to protect it - and for those who think washing ought to remove substances , just think of the effect that conditioner has on hair or moisturizer has on skin , two products hardly any woman lives without today .
Women are the targets of the new laundry technology , which the company developed in response to focus groups that studied women 's relationship with clothes .
" There were all of these emotional stories the women had about favorite items of clothing that ended up in the Goodwill box , " French said .
" A very clear pattern emerged that we called demoting :
You wear something every day , then you wear it only on weekends , then you wear it only for gardening , then it 's in the box . "
When money 's tight , it 's practical to try to lengthen each phase before demoting .
See the tips from the experts and decide which trade - offs suit your sensibility .
Bedding --
For comforters , choose the highest fill ( American Standard Testing : the space 1 ounce of down occupies in cubic inches ) you can afford .
Good : 550 and up .
( 1 , see Source list below right ) --
White sheets made of cotton not treated for wrinkles look best longest .
( 3 ) --
Sateen sheets tend not to be as long - lasting as plain and twill weaves .
( 3 ) --
Tie - dye otherwise usable sheets to disguise fades and spots .
( 1 ) Towels --
Wash towels without softeners , wash colored towels without bleach , and wash white towels separately .
--
If towels get stiff , add white vinegar to the wash .
Shoes --
Shop for wooden heels , especially on boots - they hold up better than heels covered in leather .
( 2 ) --
Make old ones smell better by filling socks with kitty litter and letting them sit in shoes overnight , or fill the shoes with baking soda and freeze them overnight .
( 1 ) --
Help canvas shoes stay clean longer by spraying on a coat of starch .
( 1 ) Sweaters --
In the store , rub the fabric to see if it pills or loses fibers .
( 1,2 ) --
Make sweaters last by tracing their outlines on an old screen or towel and " blocking " them to dry - manipulating the fabric to fit within the outlines .
--
Tighten cuffs and waistbands with a hot water soak , then blow - dry .
( 1 ) --
Use a mesh bag to protect sweaters or delicates from agitator wear .
Jackets --
In the store , squeeze the fabric on the back of a wool blazer for 15 seconds , then see if it unfolds cleanly .
( 2 ) -- Restore worn leather by applying castor oil .
( 1 ) -- Spot clean to lengthen the time between launderings .
( 3 ) Clothes in general -- Look for prewashed jerseys and knits ; they are less likely to lose shape .
--
Find a local tailor who can help garments keep up with growth and weight changes .
--
When a stain mars a favorite garment , cover the spot with decorative trim or buttons .
( 1 ) -- Read labels , follow care instructions .

OTTAWA– Prime Minister Stephen Harper , teetering on the brink of defeat , has won himself a one - week reprieve in the face of extraordinary opposition efforts to form a coalition government to replace his minority Conservatives .
But opposition MPs appear unbowed by Harper 's bid to delay their move to defeat his six - week - old government .
Negotiations on the shape , form and leadership of the coalition government are expected to continue through the weekend .
In a stunning revolt just one week into the 40th Parliament , the three opposition parties revealed yesterday that formal talks were well underway to replace the minority Conservative government .
Late in the afternoon , an angry Harper was forced to publicly announce that he will delay until Dec. 8 any parliamentary vote that could topple his government .
That includes a vote on a ways and means motion flowing from the government 's fiscal update Thursday and a motion of non-confidence introduced by the Liberals yesterday , which had both been scheduled for Monday .
The opposition parties unanimously oppose Harper 's provocative economic update , which contained billions of dollars in spending cuts , the suspension of the right to strike by public servants , a clampdown on pay equity and a small but significant reduction of public funding for political parties .
Harper 's announcement was ostensibly made to give Canadians more time to absorb the extraordinary developments that could result in an NDP - Liberal coalition government .
It buys time for Harper to get himself out of his self - made crisis – but also allows the opposition parties time to negotiate just who will lead the " alternative " government that would be proposed to Governor General Michaëlle Jean .
One Liberal strategist said an agreement had been reached to have Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion at the helm – but that could change quickly if the Liberal leader proves a liability for a new government .
A senior Liberal added the coalition leader would not be any of the three Liberal leadership contenders – MPs Michael Ignatieff , Bob Rae and Dominic LeBlanc .
The strategist also noted the Liberal caucus has not given its blessing to Dion as coalition leader and predicted the proposal could run into trouble among MPs and senators .
Dion was holed up in Stornoway yesterday and was not available for comment .
It is expected that NDP Leader Jack Layton would have a place in the new cabinet , and " various players would play different roles , " an NDP official said .
The Liberals and NDP are entertaining the demands of the Bloc Québécois , which would not formally be part of a coalition , but would support it as long as Quebec 's interests are met .
" We said that we wo n't be part of a coalition and having ministers from the Bloc ; this is very clear .
But we 'll consider a coalition that would respect more Quebec values and interests , " said Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe .
Talks between the NDP and Liberals began Thursday evening after former NDP leader Ed Broadbent and former Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien stepped in to act as intermediaries .
Layton contacted Broadbent Thursday night to seek his counsel as a " statesman , " party spokesperson Karl Belanger said , and asked him to contact Chrétien to attempt to chart a way forward .
Broadbent declined to discuss any specifics of their conversation , as did Chrétien .
" He and I both discussed what would be a good situation here for the people of Canada , for Parliament and we 'll see what happens , " Broadbent told reporters after a morning meeting in Layton 's office .
It is clear the Conservatives were caught off guard by the vehemence of the opposition 's attack on the economic update .
Yesterday afternoon , Harper attempted to paint the opposition bid as an undemocratic attempt to usurp power from his newly elected government through a " backroom deal . "
" The opposition has every right to defeat the government but Stéphane Dion does not have the right to take power without an election , " Harper said .
" Canada 's government should be decided by Canadians , not backroom deals .
It should be your choice , not theirs . "
Harper said his party has acted " to keep cutting job - killing business taxes , " accelerated construction of roads bridges and other infrastructure projects , injected " tens of billions " of liquidity into Canada 's credit markets , and " acted to ensure a long term structural balance in the federal budget . "

But Liberal MP John McCallum ( Markham ) echoed the Liberals ' complaint that the Conservative economic statement delivered on Thursday was silent on big - ticket measures to boost the flagging economy .
" We in the opposition believe that the Canadian economy needs support from the government .
Stephen Harper does not .
That is the essential difference between us , " McCallum said .
McCallum said a new government would roll out a stimulus package that was " a whole lot faster and a whole lot bigger than anything they would provide . "
He even tried to reassure investors jittery about a possible change in the country 's leadership .
" I want the business community and the financial community to know that should we form the government , the stability of our financial system and of our economy will be uppermost in our mind every step of the way , " McCallum said .
Many Conservatives had been gleeful about the " poison pill " item in the update : the plan to slash $ 30 million in taxpayer subsidies for political parties .
But as the political fallout takes hold , Harper 's move is widely seen as a terrible political miscalculation .
A Conservative government source said yesterday the idea was Harper's .
Sources said " most " of the Conservative caucus is perplexed why the government moved to put such controversial measures in now .
" It makes no sense , " said one .
" To date , Harper has been a master at dividing and conquering his opponents , " said Conservative author Bob Plamondon .
" But by moving to end the subsidy to all political parties , he has given the three opposition parties unity and purpose .
It is a rare strategic blunder for Harper and a miscalculation not seen since ( former PC prime minister Joe ) Clark toppled himself in 1979 . "
Conservative insiders across the country were flabbergasted .
" It is 1979 bravado with 1985 facts , " said one plugged - in Tory , referring to Clark 's bungled confidence vote in 1979 and the 1985 Liberal - NDP accord that ended 42 years of Tory rule at Queen 's Park .
" The government will fall , " he lamented .

Man Gets Nut Stuck Around Penis
So last month we broke the story about how one lonely , Viagra induced , Hong Kong resident almost lost his penis trying to make love to a metal bench .
It would appear the news did not reach one poor Malaysian man , who in an effort to increase his size , put a heavy welding nut on his penis and then accidentally got an erection which almost lead to him losing his penis .
The unnamed welder in his 20’s was attempting to lengthen his penis before his engagement next week by placing a heavy welding nut on then end of his penis in hopes it would stretch him out and make him longer .
During the process he gave himself an erection which caused the nut to become stuck on his penis , forcing him to call for help .
Fire and Rescue arrived on the scene but where unable to assist the man and were forced to take him to the hospital .
Sultanah Aminah hospital staff had to removed the top layer of his penis in order to get the welding nut off the poor guys penis .
Have to give it to this guy .. he had nuts of steel .

- Over the weekend of September 13 and 14 , a historic gathering in Andover , Massachusetts , took place and garnered little media attention .
But at that two - day conference , serious plans were laid for a war - crimes trial of the Bush administration .
Convened by Lawrence Velvel , dean of the Massachusetts School of Law , the scheduled participants included two people who have been cited as authorities in this column . . . This was no ranting MoveOn.org event - instead , its goal is a war - crimes trial beyond anything that has ever been attempted in American judicial history , a goal that echoes the words of Jackson himself :
" The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people .
It must also reach men [ and women ] who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched . " . . . The conference set about planning trials to determine the guilt of key actors in the Bush administration ( and their authorizing lawyers ) for having committed war crimes under both American and international law , and to determine the appropriate punishments .
Among the items on the conference 's agenda : " Creating an umbrella coordinating committee with representatives from an increasing number of organizations involved in war crimes cases ; creating a center to keep track of and organize . . . relevant briefs and facts on war crimes and prosecutions of war criminals ; establishing a chief prosecutor 's office such as Nuremberg's .
" Keeping in mind the high likelihood that a domestic trial would take much more time and be subject to far more pressure as the full scope of the administration 's appalling war crimes was revealed , the conferees also sought to find out " which international tribunals , foreign tribunals and domestic tribunals ( if any ) can be used and how to begin cases and / or obtain prosecutions before them . " . . . Opening the Andover conference , Dean Lawrence Velvel of the Massachusetts School of Law said : " The goal will be to engage in action so that the conference will not have been . . . merely an exercise in self - expression . "
( Remember , there is no statute of limitations on murder and many international crimes . )
Velvel listed some of the proposals for action that were raised during the conference .
I 'll keep score on them and others in this column .
Here are some :- " Requesting state bar authorities to disbar the lawyers who were part of the executive cabal to authorize torture and other abuses that are crimes under international law , domestic law , or both . " . . .-
" Obtaining inspector general reports of what was done in given federal departments , like the Department of Justice , the Pentagon , the State Department , the CIA , etc . "
This wo n't work , however , unless there is insistent public pressure from such groups as the American Bar Association , the ACLU , the Bill of Rights Defense Committee , the Electronic Privacy Foundation , and the Constitution Project , among others , insisting that inspector generals be appointed who are fearlessly independent . . .
-" A march of many thousands of American lawyers on the Department of Justice - a la civil rights or Vietnam War marches or the Million Man March .
The purpose of the march would be to highlight lawyers ' belief that crimes were committed and must be published . "
American lawyers already have an honorable working model for such a march .
Large numbers of Pakistani lawyers took to the streets to protest against then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf when he removed all the country 's Supreme Court justices , and placed the chief justice under house arrest for having resisted Musharraf 's gutting of Pakistan 's Constitution and rule of law .
Nine Xbox 360 Games you NEED to have this Christmas ( 2008 )
# 9 - Far Cry 2
# 8 - Guitar Hero World Tour
# 7 - Rock Band 2
# 6 - Fable II
# 5 - Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe
# 4 - Call of Duty : World at War
# 3 - Fallout 3

Christmas season is upon us , and like most years , 2008 is jam packed with some amazing video game titles to keep any kid ( or grown man ) happy for months !
The top games this season almost all feature some form of multiplayer mode , however it is n't the only thing that makes any of these games fantastic .
I 've hand selected nine of the best games that are to be released this year and have provided detailed information as well as screenshots to help you make the most informed decision on either what games to get yourself or what games to get your loved ones .
Release Date : Oct 21 , 2008 Genre : ActionDeveloper : Ubisoft MontrealESRB
Rating : MatureI am kind of confused why the developers of Far Cry 2 decided to call this game Far Cry 2 since the game has absolutely nothing to do with the original Far Cry .
Once you get beyond the fact they only called it Far Cry to leverage the name brand , the game itself is actually quite amazing .
Following the open world philosophy Far Cry 2 allows you to go virtually anywhere , which is generally pretty cool , although it can be frustrating too .
While the multiplayer mode is somewhat standard , the thing that makes it stand out beyond other games is that it comes with a really easy to use map editor .
This means you can create maps , share them with your friends and have endless different battlefields .
While , I 'd probably buy one of the other shooters on this list before Far Cry 2 , it is a great addition to a game collection if the gamer in your family already has the other titles .
Release Date : Oct 26 , 2008 Genre : SimulationDeveloper : NeversoftESRB Rating : TeenWhile Guitar Hero World
Tour did n't get the most amazing reviews , it is definitely a must have for any gamer who loves music games .
Guitar
Hero finally picks itself up out of the dust where Rock Band left it and adds in drums and singing .
Unfortunately , they were n't nice enough to make the Rock Band drums compatible with Guitar Hero , so you are going to have to buy the Guitar Hero World Tour drums as well if you want to play drums .
Release Date : Sept 14,2008
Genre : SimulationDeveloper : Harmonix Music SystemsESRB
Rating : TeenRock Band 2 more or less nailed the formula on the second release .
They gave gamers a ton of new music and added the ability to port your songs over from the original Rock Band .
If you hate having wires everywhere from the Original Rock Band instruments , the full Rock Band 2 set comes with wireless instruments to further reduce the clutter in your house .
The song selection on this game is great tunes ranging from Modest Mouse to System of a Down .
Release Date : Oct 21 , 2008 Genre : RPGDeveloper : Lionhead StudiosESRB
Rating : MatureFable II is a HUGE step up from the first Fable .
Fable II has expanded and improved on almost every aspect .
You can buy any property in the game , which you can then turn around and rent out to make some extra cash .
You can wed , have babies , and do just about anything .
You even get a dog , who is actually your guide through the game , and a very useful guide at that .
The combat system is simple , one button for sword , one for gun and one for magic , but allows for good diversifying with different combos .
The only real negative in the game is the multiplayer .
You can bring friends into your game to serve as your henchmen , but you friend 's character comes over lacking all his armor and his distinct look , instead taking on a default model .
All in all Fable II offers much more in the positive than in the negative and is definitely worth your time .
Release Date : Nov 16 , 2008 Genre : FightingDeveloper : MidwayESRB
Rating : TeenMost people never would have expected this game to ever exist , but fortunately for us it does !
Choose from a range of classic Mortal Kombat characters or pick one of the many DC Comics super heroes and beat the living hell out of each other .
The only issue I find in this game , is that once you become good with the controls it becomes really easy to side step a long range attack ; aside from that , the game is awesome .
Release Date : Nov 11 , 2008 Genre : ActionDeveloper : TreyarchESRB
Rating : MatureCall of Duty 4 sold so well , its a no brainer that this game is going to fly off the shelves .
The multiplayer mode alone makes this game worth buying .
Fight battalions of 12 year olds on Xbox Live to see who is the ultimate Call of Duty warrior .
While the last Call of Duty took place in a more modern time frame , Call of Duty 5 returns to its roots and brings us back to World War II .
If multiplayer is n't your cup of tea , the single player mission is so intense you might actually have nightmares that you are actually in World War 2 .
If you loved the previous Call Of Duty games , you definitely owe it to yourself to slide this bad boy in your own stocking !
Release Date : Oct 28 , 2008 Genre : RPGDeveloper : Bethesda SoftworksESRB
Rating : MatureThere are so many things that make Fallout 3 an amazing game .
Fallout 3 is a shooter RPG that takes place in a post - apocalyptic wasteland .
There are very few things in this game that one could be disappointed with .
Players can either take the very linear route and beat the game quite quickly , or they can take their time and hammer through what seems like endless side missions that make the game have a ridiculous lasting appeal .
If you want a great adventure this Christmas , pick yourself up a copy of Fallout 3 .
Release Date : Nov 17 , 2008 Genre : ActionDeveloper : Turtle RockESRB
Rating : MatureFirst of all , why do more games not feature zombies ?
Left 4
Dead is really pushing the envelop in terms of game play .
Instead of having players try to conquer missions , the idea of Left 4 Dead is strictly to survive .
You can either team up with 3 other players and take on the Zombie world , or you can play as Zombies , and run around trying to kill the survivors .
While the single player mode in this game is quite short , the multiplayer mode , both co-op and death match extend the replay value through the roof .
I will definitely be purchasing Left 4 Dead without a second thought .
Release Date : Nov 7 , 2008
Genre : ActionDeveloper : EpicESRB Rating : MaturePossibly the most highly anticipated game of the year ; Gears of War 2 is hands down the # 1 must have video game of the holiday season 2008 .
Starting where the first Gears of War left off , Gears of War 2 takes all the elements of the first and does nothing but improve upon them .
Everything from the storyline to the graphics to the multiplayer game is absolutely unreal and will not only drive insane sales for this game , but the fact that it is exclusive to the Xbox 360 will drive the console 's sales through the roof this Holiday season .
This is the ninth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lectures thirteen and fourteen .
They are on theoretical topics of Amortized Analysis , Competitive Analysis and Self - Organizing Lists .
Amortized analysis is a tool for analyzing algorithms that perform a sequence of similar operations .
It can be used to show that the average cost of an operation is small , if one averages over a sequence of operations , even though a single operation within the sequence might be expensive .
Amortized analysis differs from average - case analysis in that probability is not involved ; an amortized analysis guarantees the average performance of each operation in the worst case .
Lecture thirteen looks at three most common techniques used in amortized analysis - Aggregate Analysis , Accounting Method ( also known as Taxation Method ) and Potential Method .
Competitive analysis is a method that is used to show how an Online Algorithm compares to an Offline Algorithm .
An algorithm is said to be online if it does not know the data it will be executing on beforehand .
An offline algorithm may see all of the data in advance .
A self - organizing list is a list that reorders its elements based on some self - organizing heuristic to improve average access time .
Lecture fourteen gives a precise definition of what it means for an algorithm to be competitive and shows a heuristic for a self - organizing list that makes it 4 - competitive .
Lecture 13 : Amortized Algorithms
Lecture thirteen starts with a question - " How large should a hash table be ? "
Well , we could make it as large as possible to minimize the search time , but then it might take too much space .
We could then try to make it as small as possible , but what if we do n't know the number of elements that will be hashed into it ?
The solution is to use a dynamic hash table that grows whenever it is about to overflow .
This creates a problem that at the moment of overflow the table must be grown and growing it might take a lot of time .
Thus , we need a way to analyze the running time in a long run .
Lecture continues with three methods for this analysis , called amortized arguments - aggregate method , accounting method , and potential method .
In aggregate analysis , we determine an upper bound T( n ) on the total cost of a sequence of n operations .
The average cost per operation is then T( n ) / n .
We take the average cost as the amortized cost of each operation , so that all operations have the same amortized cost .
In accounting method we determine an amortized cost of each operation .
When there is more than one type of operation , each type of operation may have a different amortized cost .
The accounting method overcharges some operations early in the sequence , storing the overcharge as " prepaid credit " on specific objects in the data structure .
The credit is used later in the sequence to pay for operations that are charged less than they actually cost .
Potential method is like the accounting method in that we determine the amortized cost of each operation and may overcharge operations early on to compensate for undercharges later .
The potential method maintains the credit as the " potential energy " of the data structure as a whole instead of associating the credit with individual objects within the data structure .
Each method is applied to dynamic tables to show that average cost per insert is O ( 1 ) .

Lecture 14 : Competitive Analysis and Self - Organizing Lists
Lecture fourteen starts with the notion of self - organizing lists .
A self - organizing list is a list that reorders itself to improve the average access time .
The goal is to find a reordering that minimizes the total access time .
At this point the lecture steps away from this problem for a moment and defines online algorithms and offline algorithms :
Given a sequence S of operations that algorithm must execute , an online algorithm must execute each operation immediately but an offline algorithm may see all of S in advance .
Now the lecture returns to the self - organizing list problem and looks at two heuristics how the list might reorganize itself to minimize the access time .
The first way is to keep a count of the number of times each element in the list is accessed and reorder list in the order of decreasing count .
The other is move - to - front heuristic ( MTF ) - after accessing the element , move it to the front of the list .
Next the lecture defines what it means for an algorithm to be competitive .
It is said that an online algorithm is ?- competitive if there is a constant k such that for any sequence of operations the ( running time cost of online algorithm ) <= ?·( running time cost of an optimal offline algorithm ( also called " God 's algorithm " ) ) + k .
Lecture continues with a theorem that move - to - front is 4 - competitive for self - organizing lists .
The proof of this theorem takes almost an hour !

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : For general questions and privacy issues , please contact : Hugo Teufel III ( 703-235-0780 ) , Chief Privacy Officer , Privacy Office , U.S. Department of Homeland Security , Washington , DC 20528 .
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background : Pursuant to the savings clause in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 , Public Law 107-296 , Section 1512 , 116 Stat. 2310 ( November 25 , 2002 ) , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and its components and offices have relied on preexisting Privacy
Act systems of records notices for the collection and maintenance of records that concern internal affairs records .
As part of its efforts to streamline and consolidate its Privacy Act record systems , DHS is establishing a new agency - wide system of records under the Privacy Act ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) for DHS internal affairs records .
This will ensure that all components of DHS follow the same privacy rules for collecting and handling internal affairs records .
DHS will use this system to collect and maintain internal affairs records submitted by DHS personnel and others .
In this notice of proposed rulemaking , DHS now is proposing to exempt Internal Affairs , in part , from certain provisions of the Privacy Act .
The Privacy Act embodies fair information principles in a statutory framework governing the means by which the United States Government collects , maintains , uses , and disseminates personally identifiable information .
The Privacy Act applies to information that is maintained in a ``system of records . ''
A ``system of records '' is a group of any records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number , symbol , or other identifying particular assigned to the individual .
Individuals may request their own records that are maintained in a system of records in the possession or under the control of DHS by complying with DHS Privacy
Act regulations , 6 CFR part 5 . The Privacy Act requires each agency to publish in the Federal Register a description of the type and character of each system of records that the agency maintains , and the routine uses that are contained in each system in order to make agency recordkeeping practices transparent , to notify individuals regarding the uses to which personally identifiable information is put , and to assist individuals in finding such files within the agency .
The Privacy Act allows Government agencies to exempt certain records from the access and amendment provisions .
If an agency claims an exemption , however , it must issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to make clear to the public the reasons why a particular exemption is claimed .
DHS is claiming exemptions from certain requirements of the Privacy Act for Internal Affairs .
Some information in Internal Affairs relates to official DHS national security , law enforcement , immigration , intelligence activities , and protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to Section 3056 and 3056A of Title 18 .
These exemptions are needed to protect information relating to DHS activities from disclosure to subjects or others related to these activities .
Specifically , the exemptions are required to preclude subjects of these activities from frustrating these processes ; to avoid disclosure of activity techniques ; to protect the identities and physical safety of confidential informants and law enforcement personnel ; to ensure DHS ' ability to obtain information from third parties and other sources ; to protect the privacy of third parties ; to safeguard classified information ; and to safeguard records in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to Section 3056 and 3056A of Title 18 .
Disclosure of information to the subject of the inquiry could also permit the subject to avoid detection or apprehension .
The exemptions proposed here are standard law enforcement and national security exemptions exercised by a large number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies .
In appropriate circumstances , where compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the law enforcement purposes of this system and the overall law enforcement process , the applicable exemptions may be waived on a case by case basis .
A notice of system of records for Internal Affairs is also published in this issue of the Federal Register .
List of Subjects in 6 CFR Part 5 Freedom of information ; Privacy . [ [ Page 67423 ] ]
For the reasons stated in the preamble , DHS proposes to amend Chapter I of Title 6 , Code of Federal Regulations , as follows : PART 5-- DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS AND INFORMATION 1 .
The authority citation for part 5 continues to read as follows : Authority : 6 U.S.C. 101 et seq. ; Pub. L. 107-296 , 116 Stat. 2135 ; 5 U.S.C. 301 . Subpart A also issued under 5 U.S.C. 552 . Subpart B also issued under 5 U.S.C. 552a .
2 . Add at the end of Appendix C to Part 5 , the following new paragraph ``12 ' ' : Appendix C to Part 5-- DHS Systems of Records Exempt From the Privacy Act * * * * * 12 . The Department of Homeland Security Internal Affairs system of records consists of electronic and paper records and will be used by DHS and its components .
Internal Affairs is a repository of information held by DHS in connection with its several and varied missions and functions , including , but not limited to : the enforcement of civil and criminal laws ; investigations , inquiries , and proceedings there under ; national security and intelligence activities ; and protection of the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to Section 3056 and 3056A of Title 18 .
Internal Affairs contains information that is collected by , on behalf of , in support of , or in cooperation with DHS and its components and may contain personally identifiable information collected by other Federal , State , local , tribal , foreign , or international government agencies .
Pursuant to exemption 5 U.S.C. 552a( j ) ( 2 ) of the Privacy Act , portions of this system are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a( c ) ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ; ( d ) ; ( e ) ( 1 ) , ( e ) ( 2 ) , ( e ) ( 3 ) , ( e ) ( 4 ) ( G ) , ( e ) ( 4 ) ( H ) , ( e ) ( 4 ) ( I ) , ( e ) ( 5 ) and ( e ) ( 8 ) ; ( f ) , and ( g ) . Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a( k ) ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 5 ) , this system is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act , subject to the limitations set forth in those subsections : 5 U.S.C. 552a( c ) ( 3 ) , ( d ) , ( e ) ( 1 ) , ( e ) ( 4 ) ( G ) , ( e ) ( 4 ) ( H ) , ( e ) ( 4 ) ( I ) , and ( f ) .
Exemptions from these particular subsections are justified , on a case - by - case basis to be determined at the time a request is made , for the following reasons : ( a) From subsection ( c ) ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ( Accounting for Disclosures ) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal , civil , or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation , and reveal investigative interest on the part of DHS as well as the recipient agency .
Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts and / or efforts to preserve national security .
Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation , to tamper with witnesses or evidence , and to avoid detection or apprehension , which would undermine the entire investigative process .
( b ) From subsection ( d) ( Access to Records ) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal , civil , or regulatory violation , to the existence of the investigation , and reveal investigative interest on the part of DHS or another agency .
Access to the records could permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation , to tamper with witnesses or evidence , and to avoid detection or apprehension .
Amendment of the records could interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and would impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated .
In addition , permitting access and amendment to such information could disclose security - sensitive information that could be detrimental to homeland security .
( c ) From subsection ( e ) ( 1 ) ( Relevancy and Necessity of Information ) because in the course of investigations into potential violations of Federal law , the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation .
In the interests of effective law enforcement , it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity .
( d) From subsection ( e ) ( 2 ) ( Collection of Information from Individuals ) because requiring that information be collected from the subject of an investigation would alert the subject to the nature or existence of an investigation , thereby interfering with the related investigation and law enforcement activities .
( e ) From subsection ( e ) ( 3 ) ( Notice to Subjects ) because providing such detailed information would impede law enforcement in that it could compromise investigations by : revealing the existence of an otherwise confidential investigation and thereby provide an opportunity for the subject of an investigation to conceal evidence , alter patterns of behavior , or take other actions that could thwart investigative efforts ; reveal the identity of witnesses in investigations , thereby providing an opportunity for the subjects of the investigations or others to harass , intimidate , or otherwise interfere with the collection of evidence or other information from such witnesses ; or reveal the identity of confidential informants , which would negatively affect the informant 's usefulness in any ongoing or future investigations and discourage members of the public from cooperating as confidential informants in any future investigations .
( f ) From subsections ( e ) ( 4 ) ( G ) , ( H ) , and ( I ) ( Agency Requirements ) , and ( f ) ( Agency Rules ) because portions of this system are exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection ( d ) for the reasons noted above , and therefore DHS is not required to establish requirements , rules , or procedures with respect to such access .
Providing notice to individuals with respect to existence of records pertaining to them in the system of records or otherwise setting up procedures pursuant to which individuals may access and view records pertaining to themselves in the system would undermine investigative efforts and reveal the identities of witnesses , and potential witnesses , and confidential informants .
( g ) From subsection ( e ) ( 5 ) ( Collection of Information ) because in the collection of information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate , relevant , timely , and complete .
Compliance with ( e ) ( 5 ) would preclude DHS agents from using their investigative training , and exercise of good judgment to both conduct and report on investigations .
( h) From subsection ( e ) ( 8 ) ( Notice on Individuals ) because compliance would interfere with DHS ' ability to obtain , serve , and issue subpoenas , warrants , and other law enforcement mechanisms that may be filed under seal , and could result in disclosure of investigative techniques , procedures , and evidence .
( i ) From subsection ( g ) to the extent that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act relating to individuals ' rights to access and amend their records contained in the system .
Therefore DHS is not required to establish rules or procedures pursuant to which individuals may seek a civil remedy for the agency 's : refusal to amend a record ; refusal to comply with a request for access to records ; failure to maintain accurate , relevant timely and complete records ; or failure to otherwise comply with an individual 's right to access or amend records .

BILLING CODE 4410 -10 - P
A Malaysian couple have been beaten to death by four close family members in a ritual apparently intended to help one of them stop smoking .
They reportedly smashed the husband and wife ’s heads on a table , and beat them with broomsticks and motorbike helmets at a house in Kuala Lumpur .
The couple ’s 14 - year - old daughter was also injured and taken to hospital …
Mohamed Ibrahim was seeking help to stop his smoking habit , while his wife was suffering from asthma and a liver ailment .
Following this , a 23 - year - old male relative suggested that the couple undergo a ritual which involved all family members joining forces to beat up the couple to rid them of their ailments .
Well , it certainly was effective .
Worked as well as any other superstitious crap medication .
They ai n’t smoking anymore .
Or breathing .
People should be able to say if they wish to die , Baroness Warnock says People with dementia should be able to end their lives if they feel they are a burden to others or to the NHS , according to a respected ethicist .
Baroness Mary Warnock , who has made similar calls in recent years , first made her remarks in a Church of Scotland magazine .
She told the BBC she believed there were many who " sank into dementia when they would very much prefer to die " .
But Alzheimer 's charities called her remarks " insensitive and ignorant " .
Around 700,000 people in the UK have dementia and the number is expected to double within 30 years .
' Dread ' Lady Warnock says there should be more research to establish when people with dementia and Alzheimer 's disease can still be regarded as mentally competent , so that they can make a decision that they wish to be helped to die if they reach a certain point in their illness .
The solution to our dementia crisis is not euthanasia
Rebecca Wood , Alzheimer 's Research Trust " We need more research to find out at what point one can say people diagnosed with Alzheimer 's or dementia are still mentally competent to make the decision that they would prefer to die , rather than be a burden on their families or the NHS . "
She praised the recently introduced Mental Capacity
Act which gives people the right to appoint someone to act for them if cannot make decisions themselves .
But she added : " I still think that there is a very huge number of people who sink into dementia and mental incapacity who would really very much prefer to die rather than continue in the state they are in .
" I think that 's something most of us dread more then we dread any other form of dying . "
Baroness Warnock said many people with dementia became unable to swallow - " that 's one of the most horrible conditions to be in " .
" If one wants to avoid that , one should have the entitlement to make it clear what one wants to do , before that situation is reached . "
But Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , strongly criticised the peer 's comments .
" Lady Warnock demonstrates a shocking ignorance when espousing her highly insensitive view that people with dementia are ' wasting people 's lives ' and may have a ' duty to die .
" People with dementia can live quite comfortably when cared for properly .
" The solution to our dementia crisis is not euthanasia ; the answer is more research so we can find new treatments , preventions and a cure . 

What are these ?
Not wanting to miss out on the nationwide marriage shouting match , the Georgia Supreme Court ’s Commission on Children , Marriage , and Family Law ( pdf ) has recently sponsored a series of billboards with the message “ Get Married , Stay Married . ”
The sentiment might seem outdated , but the commission argues that science is on its side , pointing to research showing that children who grow up in two - parent households do better in school and are less likely to commit crimes later in life .
However , the good intentions behind these efforts are muddled by a potential conflict of interest .
According to the Fulton County Daily Report , Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears has spearheaded the campaign and last week helped cosponsor a pro-marriage symposium that gathered participants from the fields of psychology , law , and religion .
The other sponsor of the event was the Institute for American Values ( IAV ) , a “ private , nonprofit , nonpartisan organization that contributes intellectually to strengthening families and civil society in the U.S. and the world . ”
( Sears told the Fulton County Daily Report that " very little state money " was used for the event , with private foundations picking up the tab and the IAV covering speakers ' honoraria and transportation costs . )
But just like the benign - sounding “ family values ” behind the right 's social agenda , the “ American Values ” touted by the IAV do n’t include equal rights for the GLBT community .
During a conference debate with the Brookings Institution 's Jonathan Rauch , author of Gay Marriage : Why It Is Good for Gays , Good for Straights , and Good for America , IAV president David Blankenhorn argued vehemently against gay marriage , claiming it would weaken the general institution of marriage .
Sears , who was targeted as a gay - marriage proponent in her 1998 and 2004 re-election bids , took pains to give both men equal time , but would n't take a stance on the issue , citing her position on the Supreme Court .
The same care to maintain neutrality should have prevented the commission from teaming up with an organization that is so vocally against gay rights in the first place .

A Brazilian has broken the record for surfing on the longest board after staying on a 30 ft ( 9.16 m ) long surfboard for over 10 seconds .
Rico de Souza , who broke his own record from 2006 , said that it was a challenging but thrilling experience .
Now , this is a very simple recipe since this was the first time I made this !
We fed 6 adults and two kids with this and still had leftovers .
It is not spicy , so everyone should be able to eat it ( I have a 4 year old and a 1 year old so spicy is out of the question here ) .

LOS ANGELES –
The economy has tanked , no one 's buying cars anymore and the entire auto industry is in a tail - spin .
But such things do n't matter when you build cars that cost more than your neighbor 's house , and Bentley 's pulled the silk sheet off a convertible that brings new meaning to " over the top . "
The limited - edition Azure T unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show is faster , more decadently appointed and , of course , more exclusive than the more , ahem , pedestrian model on which it is based .
For $ 350,000 it damn well better be .
From its gleaming chrome hood ornament to the diamond - tufted leather interior and bejeweled fuel filler — please , do n't call it a gas cap — everything about the Azure T screams , " Recession ?
What recession ? "
With 42 colors and 25 different leather interiors to choose from , you wo n't have to worry about your neighbor 's Azure T looking just like yours .
“ The new Azure T reflects our passion for creating the world ’s most exhilarating and prestigious convertibles that , true to the Bentley T
tradition , blend sophistication with a powerful presence , " says sales and marketing exec Stuart McCullough .
The Azure T offers you and three of your newest friends the chance to cruise in the most opulent luxury , and with a big honkin ' hand - built twin - turbo V8 that propels the T — all 18 feet and 5,700 pounds of it — from 0 to 60 in a very impressive 5.2 seconds .
Stomp it hard enough and you 'll hit 100 mph in 12.1 seconds on your way up to 179 mph .
If you find the roar of the wind overbearing at such a speed , just turn up the Azure 's 1,100 - watt stereo .
It 's worth noting that the standard Azure is no slouch , either :
It 'll hit 60 mph in 5.6 seconds and top out at 171 mph .
The Azure is n’t the first Bentley to bear the high performance " T " designation — the 1996 Continental coupe was the first modern Bentley ‘ T’ , followed in 2002 by the Arnage T . Like those models , Azure T not only acts , but looks , the performance part .
Unique styling cues , including 20 - inch wheels , twin exhaust pipes and the " Le Mans " front wing vents , whatever those are , reinforce the sporting character and let people know you 're not driving a mere Azure .
The interior opulence is almost beyond comprehension .
You 've never sat in anything so nice .
There 's about 8 acres of butter - soft , hand - stitched leather , wood that was probably taken from old - growth virgin forests and a jeweled gear selector that looks like it was stolen from the window at Tiffany's .
The beautiful canvas top opens in 25 seconds flat , but why would you ever put it up ?
You 're only ever going to drive this thing in beautiful weather .

Voters have questioned the US presidential hopefuls in a town hall - style debate dominated by the financial crisis and foreign policy .
Two polls taken right after the debate - by CBS News and CNN - judged Barack Obama the winner over John McCain .
Senator Obama said more must be done to help the middle classes and that his rival 's tax cuts would aid the rich .
Mr McCain presented a plan for the US Treasury to help mortgage - holders and said Mr Obama wanted to raise taxes .
CNN 's poll of debate - watchers found 54 % said Mr Obama had done the best job , compared with 30 % for Mr McCain .
CBS 's poll of undecided voters suggested 29 % thought Mr Obama the winner , with 27 % for Mr McCain and 35 % calling it a draw .
The debate took place as Mr Obama appeared to be developing a substantial lead in the opinion polls with just one month to go before the election takes place .
The latest Gallup daily tracking poll puts Mr Obama at 50 % and Mr McCain at 42 % , while a new CNN poll put Mr Obama ahead by 53 % to 45 % .
And polls in the key swing states such as Ohio , Florida and Colorado which are needed to win the election have also swung against Mr McCain .
Tensions
Although both candidates sought to appear at ease on the stage in Nashville , Tennessee , greeting each other with a smile and handshake , some signs of the tensions between them emerged .
Giving a hint of the rancour between them , Mr McCain at one point referred to Mr Obama as " that one " , rather than by name , while discussing a vote on an energy bill .
No disasters for either candidate but Obama edges it - I cannot see how the McCain performance enthuses the middle ground
McCain v Obama :
As it happened In quotes : McCain v Obama US Voters ' Views
However , despite days of increasingly personal attacks leading up to the debate , the second of three , there were no real fireworks .
Senator McCain 's proposal that the government buy up $ 300 bn ( £ 171bn ) of bad debt to help people stay in their homes goes some way beyond what has been offered by the recent $ 700 bn bail - out plan agreed by Congress - although it is similar to a housing rescue package agreed by Congress in July .
The Republican candidate said : " Is it expensive ?
Yes .
But we all know , my friends , until we stabilise home values in America , we 're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy . "
He accused the Democratic candidate of being a liberal on spending , adding : " Nailing down Senator Obama 's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell - O to the wall . "
Mr Obama countered that the current crisis was the " final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years " , pursued by President George W Bush and backed by Mr McCain .
Washington would have to change to prioritise the interests of ordinary Americans and ensure they were able to remain in their homes , he said .
' Wrong on Iraq '
The town hall - style debate , taking place less than a month before the 4 November election , generated intense interest among the public .
The moderator , NBC news presenter Tom Brokaw , picked from questions e-mailed in by more than 6 million members of the public and put forward by a studio audience of about 80 uncommitted voters .
This is a guy who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb Iran ' , who called for the annihilation of North Korea
Barack Obama
Fact - checking the debate Send us your comments
Asked whether the economic crisis would affect the ability of the US to act as a " peacemaker " in the world , Mr Obama said no country could maintain the same military influence while its economy was in decline .
He said the foreign policy approach of the Bush administration , supported by Mr McCain , had made it harder for the US to address overseas conflicts like Darfur because it had lost the support of allies .
The Illinois senator also said the US had made a bad decision going into Iraq when al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden remained at large .
Mr McCain said Mr Obama had been wrong to oppose the " surge " policy of sending extra troops to Iraq and accused him of lacking the knowledge and judgement to be commander - in - chief .
On Russia , Mr McCain argued that Mr Obama had been " wrong about Russia when it committed aggression against Georgia " .
He also accused Mr Obama of having foolishly said he would carry out a cross - border raid from Afghanistan into Pakistan in pursuit of the Taleban .

Quoting former US President Theodore Roosevelt , Mr McCain said the commander - in - chief should " talk softly , but carry a big stick " .
However , Mr Obama challenged Mr McCain 's claim to exercise sound judgement on foreign policy issues .
" This is a guy who sang ' bomb , bomb , bomb Iran ' , who called for the annihilation of North Korea - that I do n't think is an example of speaking softly , " Mr Obama said .
He said the US would never take the military option off the table in dealing with Iran and its nuclear programme , but that Washington must use all the tools at its disposal , including economic sanctions .
It was important for the US to hold direct talks with Iran to deliver a " tough message " that it must change its ways or " face the consequences " , he added .
Asked about environmental issues , Mr McCain spoke of having disagreed strongly with the Bush administration over the need to act on global warming and gave his backing to nuclear power .
Mr Obama said investment in developing alternative sources of energy was a matter of national security as well as an environmental priority .
Character assaults
In recent days both camps have launched fresh assaults on the character of their opponent .
The McCain team has focused on Mr Obama 's relationship with Bill Ayers , who belonged to a US militant group that opposed the Vietnam War .
The Obama team has highlighted Mr McCain 's connections to Arizona tycoon Charles Keating , who was convicted of securities fraud 20 years ago .

As VP candidate Sarah Palin discussed Barack Obama ’s alleged ties to William Ayers at a rally in Clearwater , Florida ( surprise ) today , one of her fervent supporters shouted “ Kill Him ! ” Palin failed to rebuke them and moved on with her allegations .
It ’s now abundantly clear the McCain campaign is happy to foment it ’s base into an angry frenzy to get them to get out and vote against Obama and his “ terrorist pals “ .
And earlier today at another rally , McCain allowed one of his supporters to call Barack Obama a terrorist without so much as a blink .
I ’m not asking the candidates to control their supporters , I know that ’s pretty much impossible .
But at least call them out when they make such outrageous and incendiary statements .
But they ca n’t even bother to do that .
Just imagine the outrage on the right if something like this had happened at an Obama rally .
This is what the race has boiled down to .
And we all may suffer for it .

Plastic Electrical Grid Will Generate Power at Bottom of PA River
August 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Vandergrift , PA is ditching its longtime reputation as a steel town to become a model of sustainability .
First up in the transition : installing a grid of electricity - generating smart materials on the bottom of the Kiskiminetas River .
The town hopes that the grid — along with a healthy dose of energy conservation efforts — will generate between 20 and 40 percent of the town ’s electricity .
The underwater grid will consist of flexible strips of polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) , a material that generates electricity upon movement .
In this case , currents in the river will provide the grid with the necessary undulations .
The resulting electrical currents will pass to substations along the edge of the river , where they will charge a group of batteries .
Details of when the grid will be installed are currently unknown , but scientists involved in the project claim that it will leave the appearance and health of the river unharmed .
But I still have to wonder — what happens to a fish that gets caught in an electrical grid ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Federal authorities have received a " plausible but unsubstantiated " report that al Qaeda may have discussed targeting transit systems in or around New York , the Department of Homeland Security said .
Al Qaeda suicide bombers could target New York City subways , federal security officials say .
" These discussions reportedly involved the use of suicide bombers or explosives " on subway or passenger rail trains , according to a joint Homeland Security and FBI statement issued Tuesday .
" We have no specific details to confirm that this plot has developed beyond aspirational planning , but we are issuing this warning out of concern that such an attack could possibly be conducted during the forthcoming holiday season , " the statement said .
The uncorroborated information indicates that al Qaeda may have discussed in late September targeting New York transit systems , Homeland Security spokeswoman Laura Keener said .
She said the memo was issued as a precaution so local officials could make decisions appropriate for their areas .
Although no adjustment is being made to the national threat level , she said , transit passengers in large metropolitan areas such as New York may see increased security in the days to come .
That presence might include uniformed or plainclothes security officers , federal air marshals , canine teams and security inspectors , Keener said .
New York police also are deploying additional resources on the city 's mass transit systems as a precaution , said a statement by Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne .
" It is not uncommon for the department to receive threat information and to adjust our resources accordingly , " Browne said .
The FBI received the information through a channel that has provided reliable information in the past , so the agency is taking the threat seriously , counterterrorism sources said .
The FBI and Department of Homeland Security said they had no further information on the threat .
" We are working closely with the U.S. intelligence community , state and local law enforcement and homeland security officials to vet and corroborate this reporting , and will continue to investigate every possible lead .
We 'll provide updates as we obtain further information , " the statement said .
The public should remain vigilant and report suspicious activity to authorities , it said .
Al Qaeda has the means to launch such an attack , said CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson , who has covered al Qaeda extensively since before the September 11 attacks .
" The al Qaeda - affiliated groups are still willing to make these attacks , " Robertson said .
" What we 've seen in the past is , they 've become capable of making these homemade bomb devices with detonators and exploding them by cell phones or by suicide bombings . "
However , he said , it also would be possible for al Qaeda to plant false information .
" They would love to sort of create fear when they 're not actually capable of creating a strike .
... I 've seen it myself , in Afghanistan .
You get the Taliban out there on the ground , and they 're very capable of knowing that the troops are listening to them , and feeding and sowing false information trails saying , ' We 're over on this part of the hill ' when they 're nowhere near it .
They 're very capable and knowledgeable about feeding false information . "

Some of his online friends seem to be just as oblivious to the severity of the charges facing him .
One friend wrote that he was " never gettin aride " from Genovese again , while another said he needed to know how Genovese got his mugshot because he 's been trying to get his hands on his own mugshot photo for a while .

Continuing with Kessler 's fluff on the Secret Service ... who wants to wager that the trip below involved some of his heroin dealing friends in Syria / Lebanon ?
... AS PART OF an advance , the Secret Service reviews reports from the intelligence community about possible threats .
In 1996 , former president George H. W. Bush was planning to fly to Beirut , Lebanon .
The itinerary called for him to land on Cyprus , then helicopter over to Lebanon .
" The CIA informed us there was a threat on the former president 's life , " says Lou Morales , an agent who was with Bush 41 , as he is called , on the trip .
" The informant knew the itinerary of the helicopter flight and the time it was to take off .
In fact , he was part of the plot , which had been hatched by Hezbollah .
They were going to shoot missiles to take the helicopter down . "
The Secret Service informed Bush , who insisted he wanted to go to Beirut regardless of the risk .
The Secret Service scrubbed the helicopter flight and instead drove him in a motorcade at ninety miles per hour from Damascus to Beirut .
As with most thwarted plots against protectees , this one never appeared in the press .

Dear Friends of Antiwar.com :
A donor left this message in my Facebook Account ,
Here ’s an idea .
We ask all our friends to switch their Facebook and Myspace profile images to the Anti-War.com logo on some upcoming anti-war day .
Let ’s say Thanksgiving day , so we can be thankful there are n’t even more wars .
At the same time , on the same day , we ask everyone to switch their profile status to just “ Stop the wars . ”
And , of course , if anyone asks , “ which wars ” the answer is “ all of them . ”
Instead of your head shot , please consider changing your avatar on Facebook , MySpace and Twitter on Thanksgiving Day to an Antiwar.com logo .
I know I ’m thankful for all you champions of peace .
Please email me at akeaton@antiwar.com for images and logos .
Peace ,

In the months ahead , the members of the formerly middle class will suffer career reversals .
Paco Underhill , the retailing expert , tells me that 20 percent of the mall storefronts could soon be empty .
That fact alone means that thousands of service - economy workers will experience the self - doubt that goes with unemployment .
They will suffer lifestyle reversals .
Over the past decade , millions of Americans have had unprecedented access to affordable luxuries , thanks to brands like Coach , Whole Foods , Tiffany and Starbucks .
These indulgences were signs of upward mobility .
But these affordable luxuries will no longer be so affordable .
Suddenly , the door to the land of the upscale will slam shut for millions of Americans .
The members of the formerly middle class will suffer housing reversals .
The current mortgage crisis is having its most concentrated effect on people on the lowest rungs of middle - class life  people who live in fast - growing exurbs in Florida and Nevada that are now rife with foreclosures ; people who just moved out of their urban neighborhoods and made it to modest , older suburbs in California and Michigan .
Suddenly , the home of one ’s own is gone , and it ’s back to the apartment complex .
Finally , they will suffer a drop in social capital .
In times of recession , people spend more time at home .
But this will be the first steep recession since the revolution in household formation .
Nesting amongst an extended family rich in social capital is very different from nesting in a one - person household that is isolated from family and community bonds .
People in the lower middle class have much higher divorce rates and many fewer community ties .
For them , cocooning is more likely to be a perilous psychological spiral .
In this recession , maybe even more than other ones , the last ones to join the middle class will be the first ones out .
And it wo n’t only be material deprivations that bites .
It will be the loss of a social identity , the loss of social networks , the loss of the little status symbols that suggest an elevated place in the social order .
These reversals are bound to produce alienation and a political response .
If you want to know where the next big social movements will come from , I ’d say the formerly middle class .

CLEARWATER , Florida ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama on Wednesday disagreed with opponent John McCain and said he wanted to carry on with Friday ’s presidential debate .
Obama made the statement shortly after McCain , a Republican senator from Arizona , said the debate should be postponed .
McCain said he would suspend his campaign to help work out agreement among lawmakers on a proposed $ 700 billion financial bailout plan to resolve the worst U.S. financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Obama arrived in Florida on Tuesday for three days of preparation ahead of Friday ’s debate on foreign policy .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Jobless claims moved higher last week , pointing the way to an increase in the nation 's unemployment rate , economists said Thursday .
New applications for state unemployment benefits increased by 15,000 in the week ended Oct. 18 to a seasonally adjusted 478,000 , boosted by about 12,000 new claims stemming from Hurricane Ike , the Labor Department reported .
The four - week average of seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims -- which smoothes out one - time events such as holidays or weather -- fell by 4,500 from the seven - year high of 484,750 set the previous week .
Read the full government report .
The " underlying outlook for the deteriorating labor market " has worsened , wrote Mike Englund , chief economist for Action Economics .
" The ongoing deterioration in the underlying claims trajectory worsens the outlook for the November report , as does the global broading in the ongoing financial crisis that is inevitably boosting fear among employers . "
Meanwhile , the number of people collecting regular state unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 3.72 million in the week ended Oct. 11 , while the four - week average of continuing claims rose by 44,250 to 3.68 million , the highest in more than five years .
" The rise in continuing claims suggests that the unemployment rate moved higher in October , " wrote John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics .
September 's jobless rate was 6.1 % .
The government 's October employment survey was conducted last week , with the results to be released on Nov. 7 .
Compared with September 's survey week , initial claims are up about 8 % , while continuing claims are up about 6 % .
The Labor Department also reported that during the week ended Oct. 4 , 1.1 million people were collecting extended federal benefits available to those who've exhausted their state benefits .
That was down by 290,000 from the previous week .
Typically , unemployment benefits run out after 26 weeks for those who are eligible .
The new law extends unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks under the separate federal program .
Initial claims represent job destruction , while the level of continuing claims indicates how hard or easy it is for displaced workers to find new jobs .
In the past year , initial jobless claims have risen 47 % , while continuing claims are up 44 % .
The U.S. economy has lost jobs for nine consecutive months , and more losses are expected in October .
So far in 2008 , nonfarm payrolls have fallen by 760,000 to stand at 137.3 million .
Benefits are generally available for those who lose their full - time job through no fault of their own .
Those who exhaust their benefits are still counted as unemployed if they are actively looking for work .
IBM is testing a voice - based web to make information accessible to users who may not be able to read or write , or who do not have access to the Internet .
A " Spoken Web " project , currently being piloted by IBM's India Research Laboratory ( IRL ) , aims to take advantage of the rapid proliferation of mobile phones in emerging countries like India .
" The penetration of the PC and the Internet is not as high as that of the mobile phone , so we want to ensure that everything that is done on a web browser on a PC can be done with a mobile phone , " said Guruduth Banavar , director of IRL , in a telephone interview on Thursday .
The Spoken Web technology will enable local communities to create and disseminate locally relevant content , and interact with e-commerce sites using the spoken word over the telephone instead of the written word , Banavar said .
Using technologies such as VoiceXML ( Voice eXtensible Markup Language ) and HSTP ( hyper speech transfer protocol ) , Spoken Web mirrors the World Wide Web in a telecom network where people can create and browse " VoiceSites " that have their own URLs ( uniform resource locator ) , traverse " VoiceLinks " , and conduct business transactions , according to IBM .
The technology is about a world - wide telecom web of VoiceSites , which can be thought of as websites accessible over voice , and which are situated on a telephony network rather than the Internet , Banavar said .
Users can access the voice - based web using a toll - free number , through a variety of ways including a voice recognition system or a tone phone .
VoiceSites can be also created over the phone , using a set of templates on the server side , he added .
The web of VoiceSites can potentially link to the World Wide Web , but the sites on the Web would have to be converted to support spoken interfaces , both via VoiceXML , and in how the content is designed and laid out , Banavar said .
The research lab expects its technology to be relevant to a variety of users looking for information and wanting to engage in transactions .
These would include farmers who need to look up commodity prices , fishermen in need of weather information before heading out to sea , plumbers offering their services , and retail businesses like grocery shops that can list products , offer order placement , have personalized targeted advertisements , or set up reminders , IBM said .
Getting a Spoken Web up and running will however require the participation of a number of businesses and agencies including those offering financial services , Banavar said .
The researchers at IRL decided to focus on a voice - based web to address the information requirements of local communities because of the rapid proliferation of mobile communications in developing countries like India .
Using PCs was also not practical because PCs cost more , and Internet penetration to most local communities is low , Banavar said .
Most users are also not at ease with PCs and very often cannot read or write , Banavar said .
IBM is already doing pilots of the Spoken Web with some undisclosed mobile service providers in India , including one with associations working with visually impaired users .
The strategy for the commercialization of the technology in India and other markets will be worked out by IBM 's business groups , Banavar said .
Deaths in Afghanistan Air Force Report Confirms Rising Civilian Toll
It 's all too often that the US military accepts civilian casualties as a necessary evil .
An internal Air Force report describes its excessively violent methods as well as how officials have been trying to placate surviving family members with money .
Will Wright attended the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Awards ceremony at the Hearst Tower in New York City last night where he saw Spore pick up an award for Setting Benchmarks in Design , Creativity and Engineering .
I caught up with him afterward for a bit to find out his take on the whole DRM situation .
EA 's John Riccitiello said a few days prior that he is n't a fan of DRM , but something had to be done to stop those pirates .
I asked Wright how involved he was in the decision process to include DRM for Spore or if it was mostly EA 's doing .
" It was something I probably should have tuned into more .
It was a corporate decision to go with DRM on Spore .
They had a plan and the parameters , but now we 're allowing more authentications and working with players to de-authenticate which makes it more in line like an iTunes .
I think one of the most valid concerns about it was you could only install it so many times .
For most players it 's not an issue , it 's a pretty small percentage , but some people do like wiping their hard disk and installing it 20 times or they want to play it 10 years later . "
Advertisement
I 'm not sure if I totally agree it's a non-issue only involving a smaller percentage , why else would EA care so much to go back and alleviate some of the complaints ?
Clearly , DRM is not the best way to go to help prevent piracy , so I asked Wright if he thinks the DRM model is here to stay or if it 's only temporary .
" I think it 's an interim solution to an interim problem .
You have games like Battlefield Heroes coming out where the idea is you give away the game and sell upgrades , which works more in the Asian markets where you need to monetize it over the Internet .
I think we 're in this uncomfortable spot in going from what 's primarily a brick and mortar shrink - wrapped product to what eventually will become more of an online monetization model . "

Raw video : Two men shot in legs before being arrested by Israeli defense force .
JACKSONVILLE , Fla . – Barack Obama has a message for America ’s youth : Pull up your pants !
In an interview with MTV’s Sway Calloway , Obama fielded a question from Eric , a Huntington Beach , Calif. , man who referenced a town ordinance that tried to outlaw a street fashion trend in which young men wear their baggy pants down well below their underwear .
Obama said such laws were “ a waste of time , ” but did n’t hold back on his own view on the fad .
“ Having said that , brothers should pull up their pants , ” he declared .
“ You are walking by your mother , your grandmother , your underwear is showing .
What ’s wrong with that ?
Come on . ”
“ Some people might not want to see your underwear – I ’m one of them , ” he added .
“ Here is my attitude .
I think people passing a law against people wearing sagging pants is a waste of time .
We should be focused on creating jobs , improving our schools , health care , dealing with the war in Iraq . ”
“ Any public official that is worrying about sagging pants probably needs to spend some time focusing on real problems out there , ” he said .
Although Obama does n’t usually cast himself as the parenting police , he has gotten some of his biggest applause at rallies by telling parents to make their children turn off the TV .
Stressing responsibility is a page from the playbook of Bill Clinton , who came out for school uniforms .
( Clinton also had a famous MTV underwear moment in the 1992 campaign , when he was asked whether he wore boxers or briefs . )
A Florida judge threw out a saggy - pants law in Riviera Beach , Fla. , in September after a teen was arrested for showing four to five inches of his boxers .
After Obama ’s underwear comments , Calloway asked about people who get fired for tattoos or dreadlocks .
Calloway wears long dreadlocks , which Obama said “ looked tight . ”
“ It ’s one thing if an employer discriminates on the basis of gender or sexual orientation or obviously , race or ethnicity , ” Obama said , adding it was OK for employers to set standards .
He noted that his daughter Malia wears twists in her hair .
“ To me , it looks great .
Obviously , I would be upset if she were discriminated against on that basis , ” Obama said .

I almost ran into a moose on the way to Sarah Palin ’s hometown .
There I was , headed up the highway out of Anchorage , when suddenly drivers were slamming on their brakes as Bullwinkle humped across the road .
At the airport I ’d asked for a mid-size car , and they gave me an SUV .
Now it was becoming clear why : A Camry would n’t have a fighting chance against a moose .
Maybe it was a sign that I was n’t welcome in Palin country and should go back home to California .
But just six years after she was mayor of Wasilla , a town of fewer than 10,000 residents , Palin could become vice president of the United States .
I wanted to get a better sense of her by seeing the place that launched her onto the world stage .
Advertisement
The scenery on the drive to Wasilla is stunning , with jagged snow - capped peaks and dense birch forests .
But if you travel this way , do not make the mistake of thinking you ’re about to enter a quaint mountain village .
Some towns have character .
Some have a sense of place .
And then there is Wasilla , which greets visitors with Wal- mart , Target , Lowe ’s , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Carl ’s Jr. , McDonald ’s and Taco Bell .
They paved paradise , and all they ’ve got to show for it is chalupas and discount tube socks .
Advertisement
I thought I ’d found the town center when I came upon a row of frontier - style buildings , but it was just a Knott ’s Berry Farm - style facade housing a Senor Taco , among other establishments .
Up at the next intersection of strip malls , I found a Chimo Guns shop across from a store offering 15 % off of home - schooling supplies .
Sure , every town in the United States has its big - box stores , strip malls , fast - food joints and sprawling churches .
But Wasilla seems to have little else .
I pulled into a strip mall parking lot with a giant “ Congratulations Sarah ” sign on a storefront and asked a woman for help .
“ Ma’am , can you direct me to Main Street ? ”
Advertisement
“ This is Main Street , ” she said .
“ Well , where is the center of town ? ”
“ This is downtown Wasilla , ” she said .
I expected better , Sarah .
I really did .
Advertisement
Verne Rupright ’s law office is also on Main Street .
He used to be a planning commissioner -- a position I ’m not sure I ’d admit to , having seen this place .
Now he is one of five people running for mayor , a job with more cachet since it ’s become a steppingstone to bigger and better things .
Rupright admits the “ downtown ” area is no model city , with too much traffic and no real center .
He ’d like to fix that , he said , and the city sewer system is a mess too .
But do n’t blame Palin , he said , calling her a good mayor and a smart cookie .
The town just grew too fast .
Nobody in Wasilla could possibly be a bigger fan of Palin , though , than Glenna Edwards , who has known the Palin family for many years .
Edwards runs the Valley Medical Supply shop , where she sells $ 3.95 bumper stickers that say “ McCain - Palin , Country First . ”
Advertisement
I never understood “ Country First , ” I told Edwards .
Is that the name of a bank that ’s sponsoring their campaign ?
“ It means take care of the country first , the people of the country .
And do you know what I like about Sarah Palin ? ”
Pray tell .
“ What I love about her is that she ’s not a blueblood .
She ’s not a regular politician , a Washington politician , ” said Edwards , who was just getting warmed up .
Advertisement
“ What I really enjoy is that she ’s one of us -- a regular person , pretty , sweet , kind and all those things . . . and she will represent our country in a very good way .
And I think we need to get back to nuts and bolts and I think that ’s what ’s going to happen . ”
Edwards said she believes , as does Palin , that creationism ought to be taught in schools along with evolution , and that Barack Obama must be stopped .
And Edwards assured me that humans have nothing to do with climate change , a position her pal Sarah used to share but has backed away from in recent weeks , saying that “ some of man ’s activities ” are “ potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now . ”
She ’s doing her part for the McCain - Palin ticket by selling a $ 4.95 bumper sticker she and her husband designed , complete with a depiction of a blond who looks like a hooker to me .
The sticker reads :
“ I Thinc Im Gunna Vote Four Oboma Cuz Thems Hollywood Peoples Like Him . ”
Advertisement
There you go .
I knew I should have turned back when that moose crossed my path .
But not everyone up here is ga - ga over Sarah .
Phil Munger , a music teacher and composer who lives on the outskirts of town , told me she ’s not the sweet person Glenna Edwards described .
As for her image as an anti-corruption crusader , Munger said she ’s much more apt to get rid of anyone who crosses her .
Munger , who writes the Progressive Alaska blog , told me Palin is not just a creationist , but a “ young Earth ” creationist who believes that man and dinosaurs once shared the planet , and that the world will end in her lifetime .
Palin - tology , you might call it .
Advertisement
Munger claims she tried to stock the local school board with creationists several years ago , which caused him to quiz her on her beliefs .
“ She does n’t believe in science , and her father was a science teacher , ” Munger said .
“ She told me she felt she would see Jesus in her lifetime . ”
If true , that ’s a little scary .
But no more so than her view that a woman who ’s pregnant because of a rape should n’t be allowed to have an abortion , or that the Iraq war is “ a task that is from God . ”
And you have to wonder if Jesus would have sued the federal government to have polar bears removed from the endangered species list .
But as I slogged through heavy traffic on my way out of Wasilla , assaulted by one eyesore development after another , I had an even more critical question for voters :

Can anyone feel good about supporting a vice presidential candidate who ruled a town with worse municipal planning than we have in Los Angeles ?

GUI testing is much more time - consuming and difficult than unit testing and thus often neglected , even in generally test - driven development teams .
We take a look at two possible solutions to create GUI tests for SWT and Swing applications that promise to make this task easier .
Why are GUI tests harder to write ?
GUIs generally need more setup than simply instancing a class , and because the interaction is often asynchronous and often involves a mouse , it is harder to simulate a user 's behavior .
One approach to GUI testing is to provide an interaction recorder that monitors the tester and creates a script that can then be later replied .
There are several problems with this approach : Depending on the recording format , it can be quite hard to change the test after changes in the UI occured ; and naturally , test - first development is n't feasible .
The other option is to create the tests programmatically .
Here it mostly depends on the framework how comfortable writing tests is .
A simple and efficient way to identify UI - elements and facilities to wait for asynchronous operations to finish are crucial .
SWTBot and Marathon are both applications to write GUI tests for Java applications .
SWTBot uses Java and is thus potentially usable with JRuby .
Marathon even uses JRuby ( or alternatively Jython ) directly to script the tests .
SWTBot
SWTBot is a testing tool for SWT and Eclipse based applications , and provides an API that simplifies the access to SWT and Eclipse components .
The tests can also be run via an Ant task , so you can integrate them with your continuous integration builds .
SWTBot is licensed under the Apache 2 license .
InfoQ spoke to Ketan Padegaonkar , SWTBot 's developer .
Ketan works for ThoughtWorks , so we wondered if there 's anything happening with regards to JRuby and DSLs :
This is definitely on the list of things to do for SWTBot .
There 's just a lot of API that SWTBot is still lacking , and we 're working on moving ahead with what we have .
Most of SWTBot is built based on the requirements and feedback from the team developing Twist and the SWTBot community .
There 's been no real demand for JRuby integration so far .
I believe this is because there 's not too many people programming SWT / Eclipse using JRuby .
So JRuby integration has taken a back seat , for now .
SWTBot 2.0 ( in beta as of now ) is providing a combination of FluentInterface and a really tiny DSL to search widgets .
I think this is a good way to move ahead and provides for just about enough syntactic sugar without going the complete JRuby way .
SWTBot also provides a recorder , what 's its current state ?
The recorder was developed as a proof of concept , and has not been touched much .
It lacks support for a lot of controls , and does not record all operations , although it is quite trivial to add support for these .
The recorder records code in an intermediate format , similar to an Abstract Syntax Tree .
This representation can then be output in a language of your choice , currently it supports Java , but even Ruby is possible .
On another note : Record and playback is not the recommended way to write tests ( see TestingGUIApplications and Recording vs. Coding ) .
Primarily because the complete script for a workflow ( or all the scripts ) need to be recorded again for tiny changes .
SWTBot recommends using the PageObject / ScreenObject pattern ( or see reusing functional tests ) .
So what are the plans for the future ?
SWTBot has been a learning experience in a lot of ways for everyone involved .
SWTBot in its current state is the third rewrite .
We made quite a few mistakes in 1.x that have been fixed in 2.0 .
We 've also moved the Java 1.4 codebase to use the new features that are available with Java 1.5 , especially generics .
We 've also decoupled a few subsystems within SWTBot .
This would make SWTBot a lot more extensible in order to support multi page editors , Eclipse rich form editors , and GEF .
There 's also a proposal to move SWTBot to eclipse.org .
This would enable SWTBot to be accessible to more users , and would benefit everyone .
Some good tips and tricks on testing with SWTBot can also be found in David Green 's blog on " Eclipse GUI Testing Is Viable With SWTBot " .
Marathon
Contrary to SWTBot , Marathon can be used to test Swing applications .
Marathon comes with its own editor and test runner , it also supports debugging and provides
Ant tasks .
Marathon is developed by Jalian Systems in Bangalore and licensed under GNU LGPL .
We talked to Dakshinamurthy Karra , Marathon 's maintainer and main developer .
There exist much more tools to test Swing applications than SWT , so we asked whether there are plans to add support for SWT :
We have plans for releasing a commercial version based on Eclipse .
It is delayed due to various reasons .
We expect the release to happen in next few months .
Our immediate concentration as a team will be on adding Web testing support to Marathon .
Depending on the demand , we are open to add support for SWT .
Till now we received more requests for Web application support than SWT .
Marathon supports JRuby and Jython , what were the reasons to choose these two languages ?
Jython was the language of choice of original developers .
We ( I ) personally like Ruby and hence JRuby support is added .
Marathon architecture supports pluggable scripting models .
Any language that is supported by JVM ( Groovy , Bean shell , Clojure ) can be added to it .
Another reason for preferring Ruby is the ability to create DSLs .
There were some plans ( still nascent ) for adding keyword based testing to Marathon .
That said , we will be happy to accept contributions from the community for other language support .
Looking at the screenshots of Marathon , the interface looks similar to Eclipse , is there a relation ?
We will be releasing a commercial version ( tentatively named MarathonITE - Marathon Integrated Test Environment ) based on eclipse platform .
Eclipse is our development platform of choice and that is one reason the UI looks similar to eclipse .
When we need to find the right way to implement a feature - we usually check how eclipse implements the same .
There are no plans for integrating Marathon ( OSS version ) into an IDE .
Using JRuby ( of Jython ) for testing can also be a good opportunity to sneak a dynamic language into a more conservative development environment .
How do you create UI tests ?
At first , the PS3 Eye and the silly little PlayStation Network apps seemed cool , but they were n't cool enough for the $ 39.99 price tag .
And then Eye of Judgement came along .
And then SingStar PS3 .
Still tempted , but you 're still cheap , right ?
Did LittleBigPlanet put you over the edge ?
You can feel better about the purchase of the PS3 Eye now that Amazon has it on sale for $ 22.98 .
The price drop now has it ranked # 3 on the hourly sales charts , rigth up there with Wii Fit and the Wii console itself .
Not bad !
[ Update : You can still order , but they 've sold out of current stock already !
More are scheduled to arrive in less than a week , though . ]

What scary kid's book is this ?
Growing up in the seventies , there was a kid's book in the library I remember -- a collection of pretty scary stories , with illustrations .
I remember two in particular .
The first was about a boy who lies in bed as the moon casts a shadow of some tree branches on his mattress .
The shadows look like skeletal arms , and as the moon moves lower in the sky the shadow moves closer and closer to the terrified boy 's throat , until eventually the " arms " strangle him .
The second I remember the end of ... a girl captures a glowing bug and kills it , only to discover that it was her brother ( who was somehow transformed earlier in the story .
Like I say , I only remember the end ) , after what 's left of the bug turns into -- if I remember correctly -- a severed hand .
I 'd love to track down this book .
Anyone know it ?
I remember really liking the illustrations .
Many vegans often miss out on cakes because they are made with eggs .
Even if you 're not a vegan , eggless cakes can be a healthy - yet incredibly tasty - alternative .
Here is a wonderfully simple recipe for an eggless chocolate cake with three different icing choices .
The vinegar is used as a replacement for eggs so no need to add both , but if you want to make the batter very smooth then you can add a little vinegar with eggs .
This will make the texture of the cake spongy .
This recipe is not intended for that , but if you would like one that is , check out wikiHow to Make Cake in the Microwave
About 30 minutes , just until the cake turns a golden brown .
If you are still not sure , stick a fork into the center of the cake and pull it out .
If it comes clean , it 's done .
If not , bake it for another 10 - 15 minutes .
I prepared a mixture of an eggless chocolate cake which also does not contain salt , cocoa , baking soda or baking powder .
It is a mixture of some chocolate powder , little milk , sugar , butter flour and water .
Can I make a cake from it ?
If so , how ?
Vanilla essence is another term for vanilla extract .
You could use pure vanilla bean .
But if you do n't like vanilla , although vanilla would add to the taste and make it taste better , it is not needed .
Usually , the oven will beep , signaling that the oven is preheated .
If your oven does n't beep , turn on the oven before you begin making the cake .
It should be fully preheated by the time you 're ready to put the cake in the oven .
Frost the cake .
After you have made one of the frosting recipes , spread the frosting over the cake .
Make sure the cake has fully cooled before icing .
If you try to ice the cake before it is cooled , you could end up breaking the cake apart .
When the cake is complete , remove the pan from the oven .
Let the cake cool for about 5 minutes .
After the cake has cooled , remove the cake from the pan and place on a wire cooling rack .
Place baking soda , sugar , and salt in the mixing bowl .
Use a whisk , spatula , or fork to mix well .
Make sure no clumps remain in the mixture .
If there are clumps , run all the ingredients through a sifter again .
Preheat the oven .
The oven should be preheated to 350 º F / 180ºC .
Find a 9 " x9 " baking pan , and spray the pan with non -stick spray .
Set the pan aside for now .

A weekly series from the Ruby Masters
This week , we ’re happy to have Stuart Halloway from USA .
Satish Talim >>
Welcome , Stuart and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts .
For the benefit of the readers , could you tell us something about your self ?
Stuart >>
I am Stuart Halloway .
Along with Justin Gehtland I founded Relevance , Inc .
We specialize in development , consulting and training using agile methodologies and low - ceremony tools such as Ruby .
I wrote Component Development for the Java Platform , Rails for Java Developers ( with Justin ) , and am currently working on a book about Clojure .
Willian Molinari , Brazil >>
How should one go about learning the Ruby language ?
What material ( books , eBooks , online tutorials etc. ) would you recommend ?
Stuart >>
The best way to learn the Ruby language is to explore it .
irb is a great interactive shell for trying things out .
I would also recommend * learning tests *.
Mike Clark and I independently learned Ruby this way , and he blogged about it – Ruby Learning Test # 1 : Are You There , World ?.
Of course the libraries have changed – now you probably would want to do “ learning RSpecs ” !
Jerry Anning , USA >>
Can you recommend things to study after learning Core Ruby , including different frameworks , gems and external libraries ?
Stuart >>
Definitely look at the different testing / BDD frameworks : RSpec , dust , Shoulda , etc .
Looking at how different Ruby people approach the same problem domain is a great way to learn .
Make sure to learn other languages too .
I have been spending a lot of time with Clojure and it is terrific .
Satish Talim >>
Most beginners in Ruby , would like to contribute their time , skills and expertise to a project but invariably are unaware of where and how to do so .
Could you suggest some ?
Stuart >>
If you are doing Rails , take a look at Tarantula .
Tarantula spiders your app , looking for all kinds of possible issues .
The basic framework is in place , but there are tons of possible plugins to write .
The various Ruby VMs ( IronRuby / JRuby / Rubinius ) are great :
They are technically interesting and there is always plenty to do .
You do n’t have to be a guru – there are tons of basic documentation and testing work to be done , and they can help you learn more about the internals of the language .
Keith Brady , Australia >>
What types of applications are currently being developed in Ruby and what changes do you foresee over the next year or two ?
Stuart >>
Obviously there are many Rails applications out there , and not just for public web applications .
A lot of intranet IT work is being done in Rails as well .
Over the next few years expect to see a lot more penetration of Ruby itself , including some significant desktop applications .
Victor Goff , USA >>
How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place , and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work ?
Do you see trends in administration or other work ?
Whatâ€™s the future for Ruby ?
Stuart >>
The most visible work is certainly web , but there are other things out there as well , especially with the viability of JRuby in the Java world .
There is a great need for sysadmins with Ruby skills .
Best practices for Rails deployment seem to change several times a year , so it is exciting to keep pace .
Satish Talim >>
What can / should job candidates ( for Ruby ) do to distinguish themselves from their competition ?
Note :
The candidate has done his / her homework on the company that they are interviewing with .
The candidate understands what they ’re looking for , and the candidate is prepared to show them that he / she fits the bill , based on the candidate ’s skills and experience .
What else can the candidate do , to set themselves apart from other equally well - qualified and well - prepared candidates ?
Stuart >>
Make your name in open source .
If I can find your code on the web , that ’s big .
If I can find a * community * that you have built around an open source project , even bigger .
Satish Talim >>
Do you have any other suggestions for these participants ( would - be Ruby developers ) ?
Stuart >>
Get involved in the community .
Join your local Ruby group .
Attend conferences .
Software development is social * and becoming more so* .
The best way to learn new things and maintain a high energy level is to share your passion for Ruby with others .
Satish Talim >>
Thanks Stuart for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants .
On 21st Oct. we talk to Jay Fields from USA .
Update :
This blog post is also being discussed on dzone .

Chrysler Employee Group Follows Imperato's Advice and Bids on Chrysler
Detroit –
In a formal letter to DaimlerChrysler AG Chairman and CEO Dieter Zetsche , 25 employees from the local Chrysler Jeep manufacturing plan in Toledo , Ohio submitted a bid for the United Auto Workers to acquire the Chrysler Corporation .
The committee named the " Chrysler Employee Buyout Committee " , led by Michele Mauder , has proposed an employee stock ownership plan or ( ESOP ) in exchange for healthcare concessions .
The proposal comes after the March 1 declaration by Florida Businessman Daniel Imperato of his own ESOP plan for Chrysler .
Now after Imperato 's plan has gained attention from national and online media outlets , including the Detroit Free Press , everyone from Kirk Kerkorian to now the Chrysler Employee Buyout Committee has become warm on the idea .
In 1974 , Congress created the Employee Stock Ownership Program to encourage companies to allow employees to take a stake in their companies .
ESOPs use a trust to hold company stock ; the principal benefit is tax breaks for the company .
Today , more than 1,400 ESOP companies together employ more than 1 million .
When asked about starting an ESOP for Chrysler , Daniel Imperato stated that , " it would be the first time the history of US Auto manufacturing that the workers have owned their own destiny .
Chrysler has always been a trendsetting company and now it must blaze the trail into the next frontier of the industry , the employee owned company .
" Last February Zetsche announced that all options were open for Chrysler after it has posted a $ 1.5 billion loss in 2006 .
Currently , Chrysler is in negotiations with Cerberus Captial Management LP , Blackstone Group , which is in conjunction with Centerbridge Capital Partners , and Canadian auto parts supplier Magna International Inc. , which has partnered with Onex Corp. , a Canadian buyout firm .
All of the above named firms have offered the UAW some equity stake in a potential buyout but none have equated to a substantial interest in the Chrysler Corporation .
The Chrysler Employee Buyout Committee has currently consulted with representatives from Kent State University and is actively seeking an advisory group and an investment banker to help facilitate the proposed buyout .
Regarding to questions about a potential partnership between the Chrysler Employee Buyout Committee , Imperato stated , " As many have said all options are on the table .
I proposed the Chrysler ESOP Plan almost two months ago for the employees of the Chrysler Corporation .
What people need to understand is that I am doing this for the benefit of the US auto worker .
I am doing this so that middle class families can have a secure future and an ownership stake in the company that they have supported for decades .
" Imperato said that for him it was about keeping jobs here in America and seeing an American institution return to its former glory .
" They can't have that future if they are bought out by a private equity firm and then sold off to the highest bidders .
The American auto worker has worked too hard and too long to see his or her job lost because no one in America cared .
My name is Daniel Imperato and I am standing up to tell the United Auto Workers and the entire United States of America that I care about American jobs , American families , and most importantly American pride .
Let 's keep Chrysler the American institution that we all know it is . "***

Microsoft are facing a lawsuit , brought under California 's consumer protection statutes , was filed in the Sacramento County Superior Court .
The lawsuit alleges that an excessive number of Xbox 360 consoles have failed , resulting in what is commonly known in the gaming community as the " red ring of death " .
The lawsuit further alleges that Microsoft concealed the excessive failure rate of its Xbox 360 consoles in order to compete with the pending launch of Sony 's Playstation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii gaming systems .
The lawsuit cites to a number of recent articles published in gaming trade journals and on popular websites including dailygamesnews.com , VentureBeat , Digital Media and Yahoo !
Those articles contend that Microsoft knew as far back as November 2005 that over 50 % of the Xbox 360 consoles involved in the initial sales launch were defective .
The class action lawsuit seeks an order that Microsoft disgorge all profits attributable to its sale of the Xbox 360 , as well as that Microsoft publicly announce and implement a refund program in California .

November 18 , 2008 : Vampire Killing Kit
But Vampires are a much more difficult problem , because you need all sorts of stuff to deal with the wily devils .
You better have your kit together when the time comes , too .
You do n't have time to run around getting it all together ?
Look for a kit that 's ready to go
Quote : A complete and authentic vampire killing kit — made around 1800 and complete with stakes , mirrors , a gun with silver bullets , crosses , a Bible , holy water , candles and even garlic , all housed in a American walnut case with a carved cross on top — attained $ 14,850 in the Jimmy Pippen estate sale by Stevens October 3 – 4 in the new Natchez Convention Center .
Well you missed the boat on this one , but keep checking the estate sales , auctions and ebay .
Oh , and save your pennies .
Link Zombies are easy ... all you need is a 12 gage shotgun and a good supply of ammo .

The descent of man ~ Nixon , Friedman , Reagan , Trump .
There ’s always been a minor niggle at the back of my mind when I played the Nintendo DS .
“ They ’ve got it backwards , ” I thought , “ The A button should be on the left and B on the right .
That ’s how it ’s always been … I think . ”
A speedy investigation showed that my memory was a little foggy , and that the answer was significantly more interesting than that .
Therefore , I present to you a brief history of gamepad button mapping .
Nintendo : BA for Life
The NES was the first console to move away from the joysticks of the Atari generation , opting instead for what would become an iconic design in gamepads .
Despite my previous complaint , note that A is indeed mapped to the right of B. D’oh !
Following their ancestor ’s example , nearly every Nintendo console is mapped this way .
This includes the SNES , Virtual Boy , Gamecube , every iteration of the Game Boy , DS and Wii Classic Controller .
The only dissenters are the Nintendo 64 ( bottom right picture ) , which maps B in a location traditionally reserved for Y , and the Wiimote , which maps A and B on different surfaces entirely .
Sega & Microsoft Love AB
In the early days , Sega was hot on Nintendo ’s heels .
The NES had A and B buttons , so the Genesis added a C *.
When the SNES added the X and Y buttons , Sega one - upped them by adding a Z to the Saturn .
The Dreamcast controller was more minimal , perhaps inspired by Sony ’s popular newcomer , the Playstation .
The one element that all Sega controllers share is the AB orientation ( the Game Gear labelled them 1 and 2 , but arranged them in the same way . )
* It ’s worth noting that the short - lived Atari Jaguar had A , B and C buttons oriented the opposite way .
It also featured a full numeric pad , for a grand total of 17 individual buttons !
The first iteration of the Xbox controller , nicknamed “ Duke ” , was bulky and unpleasant to hold .
The four main buttons were on a strange slant , putting the B almost directly above A. Fortunately , Microsoft quickly responded to public criticism and began packaging the Japan - exclusive “ S ” controller with their system .
The new gamepad was smaller and straightened out the button layout , a mapping they largely reused for the Xbox 360 .
Sony Goes Both Ways
The main buttons on the Playstation gamepad do n’t use letters , but are instead labelled , , and .
The original Playstation saw three types of controllers over its lifetime , adding dual analog sticks in 1997 and rumble in 1999 .
In recent years the DualShock line has seen slow incremental improvements , but they have n’t strayed far from the original design ( mercifully they abandoned the boomerang concept . )
In North America and Europe , games commonly use to confirm ( the role of A ) and to cancel ( the role of B. )
In Japan , however , the symbol is commonly associated with maru ( right ) while is identified with batsu ( wrong . )
Therefore the roles are reversed , confirms and cancels .
While the controls of most games are localized with this in mind , games such as Final Fantasy VII and Metal Gear Solid were left with their original mapping ( to the general confusion of Western players . )
I hope this has been an enlightening trip down memory lane .
With all the variety in gamepad mapping , it should come as no surprise that even veteran gamers can be betrayed by their muscle memory sometimes .
DUBAI , United Arab Emirates 
On the surface , this glittering Arabian boomtown seems immune to the financial crisis plaguing the global economy .
The skyline still bristles with cranes  an estimated 20 percent of the world ’s total  and the papers are full of ads promoting spectacular new building projects .
On Sept. 24 , tourists from around the world flocked to the opening of Atlantis , a gargantuan , pink , $ 1.5 billion resort hotel built on an artificial , palm - shaped island .
There was no shortage of people willing to pay as much as $ 25,000 a night for a room , to gaze at the sharks and rays in a vast glass - lined aquarium in the lobby and to dine at marquee restaurants like Nobu and Brasserie Rostang .
But as recession looms in the West , cracks are appearing in the oil - fueled boom that has made Dubai , with its futuristic skyscrapers on the turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf , a global byword for unfettered growth .
Banks are reining in lending , casting a pall over corporate finance and building plans .
Oil prices have been dropping .
Stock markets across the region have been falling since June .
After insisting for days that the oil - rich Persian Gulf region was fully “ insulated ” from financial troubles abroad , the Emirates ’ Central Bank made about $ 13.6 billion available on Sept. 22 to ease credit problems , in an echo of bailout measures in the United States .
Already , some bankers are saying it is not enough .

Biden : Can I respond to that ?
Look , let ’s talk about the maverick John McCain is .
And again I love him , he ’s been a maverick on some issues but he ’s been no maverick on things that matter to people ’s lives .
He voted four out of five times for George Bush ’s budget which put us half a trillion in debt this year and over three trillion in debt since he got there .
He has not been a maverick in providing healthcare for people .
He voted against including another 3.6 million children in coverage of the existing health care plan in the United States Senate .
He ’s not been a maverick when it comes to education .
He has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college .
He ’s not been a maverick on the war , not been a maverick on virtually anything that generally affects the things that people really talk about around the kitchen table .
Can we get mom’s MRI ?
Can we send Mary back to school next semester .
We ca n’t make it .
How we gonna heat the house this winter ?
He even voted against what they call LIHEAP , for assistance for people with oil prices going through the roof in the winter .
So a maverick he is not , on the important critical issues that affect people at the kitchen table .
Nice op ed piece in today ’s Washington Post about the fallout from Prop 8 .
The writer talks about hearing a local bus driver in Santa Monica refer to gay demonstrators as “ sodomites . ’
I realized that in a post - Proposition 8 world , it is not okay for me to enable anyone ’s bigotry with my silence .
If he had said the “ n ” word or the “ k ” word or something else offensive regarding someone ’s race , gender or religion , there would have been no question about whether to report him .
But gay men and lesbians are no longer willing to be doormats .
It is no longer acceptable for people to say bigoted and hateful things about gays or anyone else in front of me .
This behavior has to stop now .
If the bigots thought they would slap down gay men and lesbians by passing Proposition 8 , or if they thought it would end the gay civil rights movement , they were mistaken .
I have n’t seen the gay community this galvanized in a long time .
The passage of Proposition 8 might be this generation ’s “ Stonewall , ” the 1969 riot that began after an unprovoked police raid on a gay bar in Greenwich Village and that marked the start of the gay rights movement .
If we can somehow harness the energy unleashed by California ’s Proposition 8 vote , we can achieve tremendous gains for us and for future generations of gay men and lesbians .
One of the most gratifying aspects of attending “ No on 8 ” rallies was the number of straight demonstrators who showed up — people who see this not just as an issue for gay men and lesbians but as a matter of everyone ’s civil rights .
He ’s right , we need to somehow harness the energy unleashed by Prop 8 , but it ’s not happening , or at least is n’t happening well .
The protests around the country are great , tremendous , brilliant even , and amazing in their number .
But .
What comes after the protests ?
Postcard campaigns wo n’t cut it .
Nor will having a day without gays .
We need a real campaign , a real war , real strategies – mean , nasty , vicious and , above all else , effective strategies targeted at achieving a concrete goal that moves our movement , moves our rights , forward .
This is why I ’ve talked endlessly about the role the Mormons had in making Prop 8 a reality .
They are willing to be hate ’s banker , and we need to make sure that their moral bankruptcy becomes a fiscal one as well .
Whether that means targeting key Mormon donors , targeting the entire state of Utah , or finding another means to make the price far too high for anyone willing to finance hate .
I ’m not sure what the answer is .
But we need one .
We are a people without leadership at the moment .
The California groups who got us into this mess seem downright terrified that gay people are finally rising up and demanding their rights , and the national groups , rightfully , to a degree , are butting out of what is California ’s own business ( for all the criticism of HRC , are they really supposed to parachute into the middle of California and , Al Haig style , declare “ we ’re in charge ” ? )
Gay people want change .
But politics , like war , best achieves its goals when someone with experience and vision is at the helm .
And for whatever reason , no one is stepping up .
In fact , consumers ’ income may actually fall more than their spending , so that their attempt to save more backfires  a possibility known as the paradox of thrift .
At this point , however , the instructor hastens to explain that virtue is n’t really vice : in practice , if consumers were to cut back , the Fed would respond by slashing interest rates , which would help the economy avoid recession and lead to a rise in investment .
So virtue is virtue after all , unless for some reason the Fed ca n’t offset the fall in consumer spending .
I ’ll bet you can guess what ’s coming next .
For the fact is that we are in a liquidity trap right now :
Fed policy has lost most of its traction .
It ’s true that Ben Bernanke has n’t yet reduced interest rates all the way to zero , as the Japanese did in the 1990s .
But it ’s hard to believe that cutting the federal funds rate from 1 percent to nothing would have much positive effect on the economy .
In particular , the financial crisis has made Fed policy largely irrelevant for much of the private sector :
The Fed has been steadily cutting away , yet mortgage rates and the interest rates many businesses pay are higher than they were early this year .
The capitulation of the American consumer , then , is coming at a particularly bad time .
But it ’s no use whining .
What we need is a policy response .
The ongoing efforts to bail out the financial system , even if they work , wo n’t do more than slightly mitigate the problem .
Maybe some consumers will be able to keep their credit cards , but as we ’ve seen , Americans were overextended even before banks started cutting them off .
No , what the economy needs now is something to take the place of retrenching consumers .
That means a major fiscal stimulus .
And this time the stimulus should take the form of actual government spending rather than rebate checks that consumers probably would n’t spend .
Let ’s hope , then , that Congress gets to work on a package to rescue the economy as soon as the election is behind us .
And let ’s also hope that the lame - duck Bush administration does n’t get in the way .

In most fields which require the ability to use words and ideas , many of those who make it to " the very top " have intellectual content and ability : this is true in law , in philosophy , in economics , and so on .
But it is rather painfully not true in journalism , where , in general , " quality rises to the bottom . "
There are honorable exceptions , but they are few and far between .
Given that banal observation - - a commonplace outside newsrooms -- one might think it slightly perverse that media outlets should elevate former journalists to the role of pundits , analysts , and news commentators .
The worst offender -- if only because the most visible -- has been The New York Times , which until fairly recently ( Paul Krugman , an actual economist is the exception I can think of ) , has boasted op - ed columnists who were all former journalists .
Why not former scientists ?
sociologists ?
psychologists ?
philosophers ?
even political scientists ?
Who -- other than journalists , that is -- would think years of being a journalist qualifies you to have substantial opinions about the affairs of the world ?
Herewith Karl Kraus ( I may be mangling the aphorism slightly ) : " No ideas and the ability to express them : that 's a journalist . "
And Karl Kraus had n't even read Thomas Friedman .
" Oh , I think they ’re just not used to someone coming in from the outside , " she replied , " saying , ' You know what ?
It 's time that . . .
Hewitt first asked the 44 - year - old mother of five if she could explain the derision , even hate , directed toward her in recent days .
Hewitt and Palin talked about why so many critics seem to despise her , about her family 's sometimes strained expenses , her faith and her professed puzzlement over why critics would mock her faith or beliefs if she is n't mocking theirs .
Not if he ever wants another national radio scoop like this .
But he'd be delighted to get Palin on air for his generally conservative audience and , as John McCain 's campaign well knows , would not try what they call any gotcha questions .
Hewitt was an ardent supporter of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney during the primary season .
But Palin took a little time off Tuesday to practice some of her speaking points in a surprise phone - radio interview with th e popular Hugh Hewitt that gives us an advance glimpse into Palin 's parlance .
Alaska Gov. and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is going through three days of debate prep in rural Arizona .
On Thursday she 'll face the Democratic VP nominee , Sen . Joe Biden , who 's no doubt doing his own prep for prime time .
. . . normal Joe Six - Pack American is finally represented in the position of vice presidency .
And I think that 's kind of taken some people off guard , and they 're out of sorts , and they 're ticked off about it .
" But it 's motivation for John McCain and I to work that much harder to make sure that our ticket is victorious and we put government back on the side of the people -- of Joe Six - Packs like me -- and we start doing those things that are expected of our government . "
OK , put that down for Thursday night .
You 'll hear about Josephine Six - Pack .
Hewitt asked if the governor was surprised by Katie Couric 's kind of pop quizzes .
" Well , I have a degree in journalism also , " Palin said .
" So it surprises me that so much has changed since I received my education in journalistic ethics all those years ago .
But I 'm not going to pick a fight with those who buy ink by the barrelful .
I 'm going to take those shots and those pop quizzes and just say , ' That 's okay .
Those are good testing grounds . '
And they can continue on in that mode .
That 's good .
" That makes somebody work even harder .
It makes somebody be even clearer and more articulate in their positions .
So , really , I do n’t fight it .
I invite it . "
So put that down too .
We 'll see more of spunky Sarah who enraptured the GOP convention audience that night of her acceptance speech .
Does she keep track of all the attacks on her ?
" No , I sure do n't , " she said .
" And , thank God , I do n’t have time to follow those .
You know , I think that those shots too , though , no matter what we 're taking and receiving , it 's nothing compared to what real shots are against Americans in this world .
" Americans today who are worried about losing their home and figuring out how in the world they 're going to pay their fuel bill next month , and send their kid to college , and may be worried about losing a loved one that they 're sending off to a war zone to protect our rights .
" Those are the shots that Americans are taking .
So all this political nonsense and the lies , the rhetoric that is spun out there about someone just trying to offer themselves up in the name of service to this great country , I 'll take it . "
And a little Sarah Barracuda .
Americans wanna see their presidential competitors fight for it .
Many people are struggling ?
Have you and Todd ever ?
" Oh , my goodness , yes , Hugh .
I know what Americans are going through .
Todd and I , heck , we 're going through that right now , even as we speak , which may put me again kind of on the outs of those Washington elite who do n't like the idea of just an everyday working - class American running for such an office .
" But yeah , there 's been a lot of times that Todd and I have had to figure out how we were going to pay for health insurance .
We 've gone through periods of our life here with paying out of pocket for health coverage until Todd and I both landed a couple of good union jobs .
" Early on in our marriage , we did n't have health insurance , and we had to either make the choice of paying out of pocket for catastrophic coverage or just crossing our fingers , hoping that nobody would get hurt , nobody would get sick .
So I know what Americans are going through there . "
Just normal folks who happen to be running for vice president .
She also talked about her family 's modest investments and 401 ( k ) taking hits in recent days and worries about three more college educations to finance .
Do you think the media and left understand your faith ?
" I think that there 's a lot of mocking of my personal faith , and my personal faith is very , very simple .
I do n't belong to any church .
I do have a strong belief in God , and I believe that I 'm a heck of a lot better off putting my life in God 's hands and saying , ' Hey , you know , guide me . '
What els e do we have but guidance that we would seek from a creator ?
" That 's about as simple as it gets with my faith , and I think that there is a lot of mocking of that .
And , you know , so be it -- though I do have respect for those who have differing views than I do on faith , on religion .
" I 'm not going to mock them , and I would hope that they would kind of , I guess , give me the same courtesy through this of not mocking a person 's faith but maybe , perhaps even trying to understand a little bit of it . "
Have you heard from your Army son in the Mideast ?
" That little stinker , I guess he 's called his girlfriend a couple of times , but can you believe he has n't called his momma yet ?
" He 's over there .
They were just leaving Kuwait heading into Iraq , and I am just so extremely proud of Track , my son , and all of the men and women , of course , serving in the military .
I 'm proud that my son made this independent and very wise decision as such a young man at 18 , deciding , you know , he realized there ’s something he can do to help , to contribute , to help protect our nation .
" I could n't be more proud of him and all those who choose to serve in our military .
They 're serving for the right reasons .
God bless them .
God love them . "
( Audio of the 10 - minute interview is available here . )
You can bet Biden 's aides are poring over the Hewitt interview too , looking for rehearsed response lines for Biden to drop in with apparent spontaneity .
" Governor , " Biden might say , " I 'm from Scranton , Pa. I know Joe Six - Pack .
And , governor , you 're no Joe Six - Pack . "
Then Palin could pause for the derisive laughter to subside and calmly observe : " Senator , I know a lot of Joe Six - Packs .
And not one of them has been living off the United States Senate like you for 36 years . "
Should be an interesting evening .

Several bloggers today have pointed to this obviously disturbing article from Army Times , which announces that " beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , the [ 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division ] will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North " — " the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities . "
The article details :
They ’ll learn new skills , use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it .
They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack .
. . .
The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use " the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , " 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
" It ’s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they ’re fielding .
They ’ve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we ’re undertaking we were the first to get it . "
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
" I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered , " said Cloutier , describing the experience as " your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body " .
. . .
The brigade will not change its name , but the force will be known for the next year as a CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF ( pronounced " sea- smurf " ) .
For more than 100 years — since the end of the Civil War — deployment of the U.S. military inside the U.S. has been prohibited under The Posse Comitatus Act ( the only exceptions being that the National Guard and Coast Guard are exempted , and use of the military on an emergency ad hoc basis is permitted , such as what happened after Hurricane Katrina ) .
Though there have been some erosions of this prohibition over the last several decades ( most perniciously to allow the use of the military to work with law enforcement agencies in the " War on Drugs " ) , the bright line ban on using the U.S. military as a standing law enforcement force inside the U.S. has been more or less honored — until now .
And as the Army Times notes , once this particular brigade completes its one - year assignment , " expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one . "
After Hurricane Katrina , the Bush administration began openly agitating for what would be , in essence , a complete elimination of the key prohibitions of the Posse Comitatus Act in order to allow the President to deploy U.S. military forces inside the U.S. basically at will — and , as usual , they were successful as a result of rapid bipartisan compliance with the Leader ’s demand ( the same kind of compliance that is about to foist a bailout package on the nation ) .
This April , 2007 article by James Bovard in The American Conservative detailed the now - familiar mechanics that led to the destruction of this particular long - standing democratic safeguard :
The Defense Authorization Act of 2006 , passed on Sept. 30 , empowers President George W. Bush to impose martial law in the event of a terrorist " incident , " if he or other federal officials perceive a shortfall of " public order , " or even in response to antiwar protests that get unruly as a result of government provocations .
. . .
It only took a few paragraphs in a $ 500 billion , 591 - page bill to raze one of the most important limits on federal power .
Congress passed the Insurrection Act in 1807 to severely restrict the president ’s ability to deploy the military within the United States .
The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 tightened these restrictions , imposing a two - year prison sentence on anyone who used the military within the U.S. without the express permission of Congress .
But there is a loophole : Posse Comitatus is waived if the president invokes the Insurrection Act. Section 1076 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2007 changed the name of the key provision in the statute book from " Insurrection Act " to " Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order Act . "
The Insurrection Act of 1807 stated that the president could deploy troops within the United States only " to suppress , in a State , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy . "
The new law expands the list to include “ natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition " — and such " condition " is not defined or limited .
. . .
The story of how Section 1076 became law vivifies how expanding government power is almost always the correct answer in Washington .
Some people have claimed the provision was slipped into the bill in the middle of the night .
In reality , the administration clearly signaled its intent and almost no one in the media or Congress tried to stop it . . . .
Section 1076 was supported by both conservatives and liberals .
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , the ranking Democratic member on the Senate Armed Services Committee , co-wrote the provision along with committee chairman Sen. John Warner ( R - Va . ) .
Sen .
Ted Kennedy openly endorsed it , and Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - Calif. ) , then - chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , was an avid proponent .
. . .
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , warned on Sept. 19 that " we certainly do not need to make it easier for Presidents to declare martial law , " but his alarm got no response .
Ten days later , he commented in the Congressional Record : " Using the military for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy . "
Leahy further condemned the process , declaring that it " was just slipped in the defense bill as a rider with little study .
Other congressional committees with jurisdiction over these matters had no chance to comment , let alone hold hearings on , these proposals . "
As is typical , very few members of the media even mentioned any of this , let alone discussed it ( and I failed to give this the attention it deserved at the time ) , but Congressional Quarterly ‘s Jeff Stein wrote an excellent article at the time detailing the process and noted that " despite such a radical turn , the new law garnered little dissent , or even attention , on the Hill . "
Stein also noted that while " the blogosphere , of course , was all over it . . . a search of The Washington Post and New York Times archives , using the terms ‘ Insurrection Act , ’ ‘ martial law ’ and ‘ Congress , ’ came up empty . "
Bovard and Stein both noted that every Governor — including Republicans — joined in Leahy ’s objections , as they perceived it as a threat from the Federal Government to what has long been the role of the National Guard .
But those concerns were easily brushed aside by the bipartisan majorities in Congress , eager — as always — to grant the President this radical new power .
The decision this month to permanently deploy a U.S. Army brigade inside the U.S. for purely domestic law enforcement purposes is the fruit of the Congressional elimination of the long - standing prohibitions in Posse Comitatus ( although there are credible signs that even before Congress acted , the Bush administration secretly decided it possessed the inherent power to violate the Act ) .
It should n’t take any efforts to explain why the permanent deployment of the U.S. military inside American cities , acting as the President ’s police force , is so disturbing .
Bovard :
" Martial law " is a euphemism for military dictatorship .
When foreign democracies are overthrown and a junta establishes martial law , Americans usually recognize that a fundamental change has occurred .
. . .
Section 1076 is Enabling
Act - type legislation — something that purports to preserve law - and - order while formally empowering the president to rule by decree .
The historic importance of the Posse Comitatus prohibition was also well - analyzed here .
As the recent militarization of St. Paul during the GOP Convention made abundantly clear , our actual police forces are already quite militarized .
Still , what possible rationale is there for permanently deploying the U.S. Army inside the United States — under the command of the President — for any purpose , let alone things such as " crowd control , " other traditional law enforcement functions , and a seemingly unlimited array of other uses at the President ’s sole discretion ?
And where are all of the stalwart right - wing " small government conservatives " who spent the 1990s so vocally opposing every aspect of the growing federal police force ?
And would it be possible to get some explanation from the Government about what the rationale is for this unprecedented domestic military deployment ( at least unprecedented since the Civil War ) , and why it is being undertaken now ?
UPDATE : As this commenter notes , the 2008 National Defense Authorization
Act somewhat limited the scope of the powers granted by the 2007 Act detailed above ( mostly to address constitutional concerns by limiting the President ’s powers to deploy the military to suppress disorder that threatens constitutional rights ) , but President Bush , when signing that 2008 Act into law , issued a signing statement which , though vague , seems to declare that he does not recognize those new limitations .
UPDATE II : There ’s no need to start manufacturing all sorts of scare scenarios about Bush canceling elections or the imminent declaration of martial law or anything of that sort .
None of that is going to happen with a single brigade and it ’s unlikely in the extreme that they ’d be announcing these deployments if they had activated any such plans .
The point is that the deployment is a very dangerous precedent , quite possibly illegal , and a radical abandonment of an important democratic safeguard .
As always with first steps of this sort , the danger lies in how the power can be abused in the future .

Seven sports will be vying for two remaining places at the 2016 Olympics Golf and rugby sevens were among seven sports presenting their cases on Friday for inclusion in the Olympic Games .
The sports for London 2012 have already been decided and these seven have to wait until next October to find out if they have a place in the 2016 Games .
Baseball and softball made bids for a return as both were dropped from the 2012 programme , baseball because many of the top players did not compete .
Squash , roller sports and karate also made presentations .
The IOC has set a limit of 28 sports in 2016 , meaning the sports will fight over the last two available slots .
The program commission is chaired by Italian Franco Carraro , one of eight IOC members on the panel questioning the delegations before presenting a report to the executive board .
Each sport had a one - hour slot , with baseball making the first pitch in the closed - door presentations in Lausanne , Switzerland .
To win reinstatement for 2016 , baseball must show the IOC it can deliver major league players to an Olympic tournament .
The baseball delegation was asked about its ability to deliver major league players to a 16 - team Olympic tournament in August 2016 - right in the middle of the US major league season .
" We 're committed to bringing the best players ever to the Olympic baseball tournament , " said International Baseball Federation president Harvey Schiller .
" We talked about our advances in drug testing .
We have an agreement with the professional leagues in terms of out - of - competition testing for the events we sanction . "
Softball - a women 's sport in the Olympics - is battling to return to the Games after missing out by just a single vote in 2005 .
606 : DEBATE Golf , which was last played at the Olympics in 1904 , proposes to return with men's and women 's tournaments .
The golf delegation , including USPGA executive Ty Votaw and Peter Dawson of the Royal and Ancient - golf 's governing body outside the US - brought the trophy presented in St Louis 104 years ago .
Votaw said golf 's strong points were " speaking with one voice , bringing top players , and worldwide participation , " with the sport televised in 216 countries each week .
" We would be able to promote golf in the Olympics and the Olympic movement across that platform every single week , " Votaw said .
The World Karate Federation , comprising 180 national governing bodies , proposes to award 10 gold medals in five classes for each of the men's and women 's competitions .
Meanwhile the International Federation for Roller Sports hopes to stage races on city streets for men and women , but not rink hockey or skateboarding .
Rugby fell from the Olympic program in 1924 and wants to come back with the seven - a- side , shorter version of the game for men and women , rather than the more established 15 - a - side competition .
Finally , the World Squash Federation hopes that television - friendly , glass - enclosed courts can counter the sport 's reputation as one that struggles to translate the speed of play to viewers .

Exclusive : NY Rail Plot Details Based on ' Reliable ' FBI Source New information in the last 48 hours led to the public warning .
Nov. 26 , 2008  --
Uniformed police officers have flooded New York City 's Penn Station , home to the Long Island Rail Road , following a warning from the FBI of a " plausible but unsubstantiated " threat of a terrorist bomb attack against the system during the holidays .
Law enforcement officials tell ABCNews.com , the plot involved a " Madrid - like attack , " a reference to the synchronized bombing of the commuter rail system in Spain in March 2004 that killed 191 people .
Click here to read the full FBI warning .
A terror suspect arrested in Pakistan by the FBI in recent days provided authorities with details of a bomb plot against the Long Island Rail Road and other information that led to series of high level intelligence and law enforcement conference calls over the past 24 hour and the issuing of a bulletin warning of an unspecified holiday attack on the New York City region 's commuter rail system , ABC News has learned .
The suspect - according to some reports the arrest took place in Pakistan - recently met with Al Qaeda leaders and was able to provide authorities with significant detail as to how the plotters would have carried out an attack if their plans had gotten beyond the so - called " aspirational " stage .
Authorities had no evidence to substantiate the suspect 's charges and there is no evidence of any active plot , multiple officials said .
The suspect is believed to have in the past resided in Suffolk County , Long Island .
The island is a 7.5 million population peninsula that contains two boroughs of New York City - Brooklyn and Queens - as well as two suburban counties - Nassau and Suffolk , which have more than 1.4 million residents .
Federal and regional authorities are deploying additional assets throughout the North East transportation corridor today , officials said , following a 1 p.m. conference call .
Assets under consideration for including in the beefed up law enforcement presence included a new cadre of federal air marshals that will be deployed alongside Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) officers in Penn Station , Grand Central Station and other locations throughout the rail corridor .
Regional and federal authorities held the first in their series of conference calls on the threat yesterday evening .
Today 's call members included Kip Hawley , the head of TSA , Deputy Chief Jim Waters , the New York City Police Dept .
Chief in charge of the Joint NYPD - FBI Counter Terror Task force , and high level officials from the federal government .
Dept. of Homeland Security , the states of Connecticut , New Jersey , and New York , as well as representatives of New York 's suburban Westchester , Suffolk and Nassau Counties , and members of various railroad police agencies .
Authorities including the New York City Police , MTA , and New York State Dept of Homeland Security said that because traditionally heavy holiday police deployments had already been anticipated , they were able to quickly move to shift deployments , increase them in some areas , and adjust their response to the preceived threat .
Following the public release of the warning by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security , officials in Washington made efforts to dampen public concern .
" There is nothing concrete to suggest this plot ever went beyond the aspirational or talking stage , " said a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence that led to the warning .
Law enforcement officials told ABCNews.com the information was based on an FBI source who has proved " reliable and knowledgeable in the past . "
Officials told ABCNews.com unspecified new information in the last 48 hours led to the public warning " out of an abundance of caution . "
FBI Officials Say Group Began Discussions in September
Congressman Peter King ( R - NY ) , the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee , told the Associated Press " authorities have very real specifics as to who it is and where the conversation took place and who conducted it . "
The FBI 's source reportedly told agents of an al Qaeda - connected group 's desire to place bombs or suicide bombers inside the first and last Long Island Rail Road commuter cars and detonate them as the train entered Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan , also used by the Washington - New York - Boston Amtrak system and the New York City subway .
Senior FBI officials said their source said the group began its discussions " in late September . "
The officials confirmed the nature of the plot and said that FBI agents worked through the night Monday to shape the language of a memo sent to local law enforcement .
" Transit passengers in larger metropolitan areas like New York may see an increased security presence in the coming days .
This includes uniformed and plain clothed behavior detection officers , federal air marshals , canine teams , and security inspectors , " said Russ Knocke , a Department of Homeland Security Spokesman .
He said there were no plans to raise the current threat level .
More Security on Busiest Travel Day of the Year
New York City Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Information Paul Browne said in a statement : " The New York City Police Department is aware of an unsubstantiated report indicating that Al Qaeda terrorists discussed targeting mass transit in New York City and vicinity .
We have no information indicating that these discussions advanced beyond the aspirational stage , but in an abundance of caution , the NYPD has deployed additional resources in the mass transit system .
It is not uncommon for the department to receive threat information and to adjust our resources accordingly . "
FBI and New York counter - terrorism officials involved in assessing the threat said they hardly viewed the warning as a " routine matter . "
" We are coordinating and communicating with the region 's transit and security agencies to provide seamless operations during this exceptionally busy time , " said Michael Balboni , the NY State Deputy Secretary for Public Safety .
" This is a continuation of ongoing operations that have been in place for some time , with different patrolling mechanisms to ensure the safety of mass transit . "
The FBI warning was made public on the morning of the busiest travel day in the country .
Many New York commuters leave their city jobs early on Thanksgiving eve .

In an interview with this reporter , Cindy Sheehan ( for the first time to press ) reveals intentions in forming a new political party , and reflects on her chances in unseating Nancy Pelosi in her race for Congress .
Inspired in part by Mark Twain 's involvement in The American Anti Imperialist League in reaction to the annexation of the Philippines by the United States in the late 19th Century , Sheehan said that the party will have a progressive platform and that after Nov. 4 , " no matter what happens , we need to consolidate the energy against Imperialism and work on building another party movement . "
While discussing a potential third party unity movement , Sheehan indicated that her own candidacy against House Speaker Pelosi has seen a broad coalition of support from Greens , independents , disillusioned Democrats such as herself ( Sheehan left the Democratic Party in May of 2007 in response to the Democratic Party led House support for a funding bill to continue Iraq War funding ) , and Republicans , many of whom made up the traditional base of the GOP represented by Ron Paul .
Sheehan revealed that name of the new party would be The First Party .
She reasoned " We do n't want to do third - party politics which has a stigma in the United States " The First Party , with a populist - progressive agenda , will be the first party that " cares about the people , will work for the people , and will actually be a viable party . "
" I have spoken to Green Party Presidential Candidate Cynthia McKinney and the Nader Campaign " and as disillusionment with the two party system increases , " this is the time to build on that energy . "
Reflecting on her own chances in unseating incumbent Pelosi , she is pragmatic and acknowledges it has been " upward momentum , the only way we could go " but believes the success of the recent $ 700 billion bailout proposal could turn the tide in her favour .
" When we 're out on the streets , we have overwhelming support , especially since this bailout . "
Sheehan indicates that she notices that " people have a new rage and a new fire in their belly because of the corporate bailout .
People are just so angry "
More importantly , some public opinions of her ability to lead have changed , and could indicate a tipping point for the Sheehan Campaign .
She notes that responses have been favourable pointing to an email she recently received , " Two weeks ago I thought you should be shot , but now I 'm awake , I 'm not going to be a slave anymore , and I support what you do . "
Sheehan believes that Members of Congress voting in favour of the bill did so at the peril of their own House seats and they have underestimated the voters .
" I was watching the debates on the House floor and the Congress people kept saying 'my constituents are overwhelmingly against this but I have to do it because it's for the good of the country ' , what a load of crap ! "
Anti War activist and challenger for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Congressional Seat ( CD 8 , California ) , Cindy Sheehan has indicated her intention to launch a National political party after the U.S. Election of Nov. 4 Inspired in part by Mark Twain 's involvement in The American Anti Imperialist League in reaction to the annexation of the Philippines by the United States in the late 19th Century , Sheehan said that the party will have a progressive platform and that after Nov. 4 , " no matter what happens , we need to consolidate the energy against Imperialism and work on building another party movement .

In one of the most dramatic days in Wall Street ’s history , Merrill Lynch agreed to sell itself on Sunday to Bank of America for roughly $ 50 billion to avert a deepening financial crisis , while another prominent securities firm , Lehman Brothers , filed for bankruptcy protection and hurtled toward liquidation after it failed to find a buyer .
The humbling moves , which reshape the landscape of American finance , mark the latest chapter in a tumultuous year in which once - proud financial institutions have been brought to their knees as a result of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses because of bad mortgage finance and real estate investments .
But even as the fates of Lehman and Merrill hung in the balance , another crisis loomed as the insurance giant American International Group appeared to teeter .
Staggered by losses stemming from the credit crisis , A.I.G. sought a $ 40 billion lifeline from the Federal Reserve , without which the company may have only days to survive .

Dopo aver escluso AirFrance dalle trattative in primavera , e con la presentazione della famosa cordata di imprenditori italiani , la situazione era sotto controllo , il problema risolto .
Così ci avevano detto .
E ora che succede ?
Succede che i tempi del mondo reale sono molto diversi da quelli della televisione , e della politica fatta di battute volanti , dichiarazioni flash e mini-spot elettorali .
Così , mentre ( quasi ) tutti si dimenticavano della nostra compagnia di bandiera , presi dalla notizia del momento , la Cai lavorava a un difficile accordo con i sindacati e i lavoratori .
Peccato che questo accordo non è stato trovato , e a metà settembre la Cai ha ritirato l’offerta per l’acquisto di Alitalia .
Le trattative sono proseguite fino all ’ultimo giorno utile per la presentazione dell ’ offerta ufficiale : il Cda di Cai aveva deliberato per il no definitivo , ma ancora una volta è intervenuto Berlusconi .
Gli è bastata una telefonata a Colaninno e subito ci hanno ripensato , presentando l’offerta poche ore prima della scadenza .
Ma ora si pone un nuovo problema : i sindacati più grandi hanno firmato l’accordo con Cai , mentre gli autonomi ( rappresentanti soprattutto di piloti e assistenti di volo ) ancora non lo hanno fatto , e sembrano intenzionati ad andare allo scontro .
Ma Colaninno avverte che la trattativa è chiusa , e a questo punto saranno chiamati singolarmente i piloti per discutere il contratto di ognuno .
Visto che a lui nessuno sa dire di no , Berlusconi si metterà a convincere oltre 12.000 persone , a una a una ?

Doctors in Saudi Arabia have registered a truly phenomenal case .
A 1 - year - old girl had proved to be pregnant .
Doctors that have been occupied with this case affirm that they have n't heard of such cases to happen anywhere in the world .
The Arabian Mass - Media has already turned on the discussion about the possibility of drawing out the unborn twin from the little girl 's body to be a crime .
As it turned out , the girl 's mother during her pregnancy has had 2 embryos and one of them began to grow in the uterus of the second baby .
Although considered phenomenal , such cases were previously knon .
The Indian town Nagpur is famous for its 36 - years - old farmer , from whose body the doctors have drawn out the embryo of his brother - twin .
It is curious the fact that the man has come to see the doctors only when his belly had turned so big that he could n't breathe .
When he was brought to the hospital , he was urgently sent to surgery .
The surgeons were sure that the patient had a huge tumor , which was pressing on his diaphragm .
During the surgery , the doctor has pulled out from the man 's abdominal cavity a strange half - formed being .
India , 2002 - doctors took out an embryo out of the body of a 6 - months - old boy .
" We could n't believe that we had taken out a dead embryo with a weight of 1 kg from the body of a child , whose weight was 6.5 kg .
It 's a very rare case , " says Pradip Kumar Mukherdgey , the leading doctor of that group .
2 years before that , doctors from another hospital of Calcutta had drawn out a foetus of 230g from the body of a 40 - days new born .
Such abnormality is called " fetus in fetu " .
Specialists say that these cases are extremely rare in the medical practice .
An embryo appears in another embryo in one out of half - million pregnancies .
This phenomenon takes place on an early stage of the pregnancy and , as a rule , both embryos die in the mother 's uterus .
It also happens that the delivery is successfull , but the embryo " caught in the trap " continues on living as a parasite , connected to his elder brother with a sort of umbilical cord .
For a certain period of time , the second embryo continues growing up equally with the other one , still remaining inside it , and when the process stops , the undeveloped foetus turns into a parasitical body .
A foetus in a foetus is considered to be alive when the tissues of his organism are not dead or have not been removed yet .
The embryo's cells must have a normal metabolism in order to be capable of living .
From the point of view of physical development , even if the organs of the " fetus in fetu " receive a normal blood supply from the " master " , still , in all of the cases known , the parasitical embryo had a set of critical defects .
As a rule , his brain , heart , lungs , gastro - intestinal tract do not function properly .
Thus , the foetus in a foetus has no chances to survive beneath the limits of the brother 's body .
Besides , its existence is a real threat for the normal twin brother .

First Thanksgiving 1621 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris , via Library of Congress
It 's one of American history 's most familiar scenes :
A small group of Pilgrims prepare a huge November feast to give thanks for a bountiful harvest and show their appreciation to the Indians who helped them survive their first winter .
Together , the Pilgrims and the Indians solemnly sit down to a meal of turkey , pumpkin pie , and cranberries .
Just how accurate is this image of America 's first Thanksgiving ?
Not very , it turns out .
Here are some common misconceptions about the origin of one of our favorite holidays .
MYTH : The settlers at the first Thanksgiving were called Pilgrims .
THE TRUTH :
They did n't even refer to themselves as Pilgrims - they called themselves " Saints . "
Early Americans applied the term " pilgrim " to all of the early colonists ; it was n't until the 20th century that it was used exclusively to describe the folks who landed on Plymouth Rock .
MYTH : It was a solemn , religious occasion .
THE TRUTH : Hardly .
It was a three - day harvest festival that included drinking , gambling , athletic games , and even target shooting with English muskets ( which , by the way , was intended as a friendly warning to the Indians that the Pilgrims were prepared to defend themselves . )
MYTH : It took place in November .
THE TRUTH :
It was some time between late September and the middle of October - after the harvest had been brought in .
By November , said historian Richard Erhlich , " the villagers were working to prepare for winter , salting and drying meat and making their houses as wind resistant as possible . "
MYTH : The Pilgrims wore large hats with buckles on them .
THE TRUTH : None of the participants were dressed anything like the way they 've been portrayed in art : the Pilgrims did n't dress in black , did n't wear buckles on their hats or shoes , and did n't wear tall hats .
The 19th - century artists who painted them that way did so because they associated black clothing and buckles with being old - fashioned .
MYTH : They ate turkey ...
THE TRUTH : The Pilgrims ate deer , not turkey .
As Pilgrim Edward Winslow later wrote , " For three days we entertained and feasted , and [ the Indian ] went out and killd five deer , which they brought to the plantation . "
Winslow does mention that four Pilgrims went " fowling " or bird hunting , but neither he nor anyone else recorded which kinds of birds they actually hunted - so even if they did eat turkey , it was just a side dish .
" The flashy part of the meal for the colonists was the venison , because it was new to them , " says Carolyn Travers , director of research at Plimoth Plantation , a Pilgrim museum in Massachusetts .
" Back in England , deer were on estates and people would be arrested for poaching if they killed these deer ...
The colonists mentioned venison over and over again in their letters back home . "
Other foods that may have been on the menu : cod , bass , clams , oysters , Indian corn , native berries and plums , all washed down with water , beer made from corn , and another drink the Pilgrim affectionately called " strong water . "
A few things definitely were n't on the menu , including pumpkin pie - in those days , the Pilgrims boiled their pumpkin and ate it plain .
And since the Pilgrims did n't yet have flour mills or cattle , there was no bread other than corn bread , and no beef , milk , or cheese .
And the Pilgrims did n't eat any New England lobsters , either .
Reason :
They mistook them for large insects .
MYTH : The Pilgrims held a similar feast every year .
THE TRUTH : There 's no evidence that the Pilgrims celebrated again in 1622 .
They probably were n't in the mood - the harvest had been disappointing , and they were burdened with a new boatload of Pilgrims who had to be fed and housed through the winter .

As California same - sex couples lined up to get married , so did the protesters .
But more and more , the battle over homosexuality has moved from the social studies department to the biology classroom .
A study published this week showed that gay men and straight women ’s brains are symmetrical , while straight men and lesbians ’ brains are asymmetrical .
Also , gay men and straight women ’s amygdalas ( the part ruling aggression and fear ) have similar connective patterns .
So what does this mean ?
According to the lead researcher , Ivanka Savic , it ’s “ robust ” proof that there are biological differences between gays and heterosexuals .
But even Savic admits that the study can’t tell whether these differences are genetic or the result of the fetus getting too much or too little testosterone while developing in the womb .
Truth is , we still do n’t know what ( if anything ) actually causes gayness .
And even if there is a genetic “ switch ” that makes a kid gay or straight , for females , it does n’t really seem to matter .
Women , as we ’ve reported earlier , have a habit of sliding through a few sexual orientations throughout their lifetimes .
One study tracked 79 women who described themselves as “ non-heterosexual . ”
After 10 years , 30 % of the subjects were lesbian , 29 % were bisexual , 22 % would n’t label themselves and 7 % were straight .
And even those that identified as lesbian occasionally slept with men .
Some right - wingers are supporting the scientific pursuit of a gay gene in hopes that it could be fixed before birth .
Aside from the questionable ethical implications about such a pre-birth intervention , to me the search seems moot .
Even if there is a “ gay ” gene , I doubt that having it would mean that one would be definitely , 100 % gay .
Some people have the gene for Type 2 diabetes but because of environmental factors will never develop the condition .
A gay gene could work in similarly , and inevitably , some people will be gay despite lacking the gene .
And while we ’re looking for genes , what about the bisexual gene or the transgender gene ?
Science may answer some questions , but it ’s not going to tell us exactly why some people are gay .
And it ’s definitely not going to tell us whether they should be able to get married .

Advertisement Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has prompted more than 500 people to complain to the BBC about a joke he made on Sunday 's motoring show .
Clarkson , 48 , was taking part in a lorry - driving task , when he joked about lorry drivers killing sex workers .
" Change gear , change gear , check mirror , murder a prostitute , change gear , change gear , murder .
That 's a lot of effort in a day , " he said .
The BBC said the joke had made " ridiculous an unfair urban myth " .
Forklift truck driver Steve Wright was jailed in February for killing five prostitutes in Ipswich .
' Urban myth ' Clarkson 's joke , made before the watershed , has now sparked 517 complaints .
But a BBC spokesman said that by Monday morning - before the incident had been reported on by newspapers and websites - there had been 188 complaints .
Sunday 's programme , which aired on BBC Two at 2000 GMT , was watched by around seven million viewers .
In a statement , the BBC said : " The vast majority of Top Gear viewers have clear expectations of Jeremy Clarkson 's long - established and frequently provocative on - screen persona .
I think it 's a sacking offence to make light of the murder of anybody , never mind prostitute women who are vulnerable and criminalised
Cari Mitchell
English Collective of Prostitutes " This particular reference was used to comically exaggerate and make ridiculous an unfair urban myth about the world of lorry driving , and was not intended to cause offence . "
The Iceni Project , a charity which had helped some of the murdered prostitutes in Ipswich , criticised Clarkson 's remark .
Director Brian Tobin called the comment " highly distasteful and insensitive " .
Mr Tobin said the joke was made around the anniversary of the women 's deaths and it made him " cringe " .
Last week , the BBC received more than 30,000 complaints about a series of phone pranks made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross on Radio 2 .
Cari Mitchell , of English Collective of Prostitutes , meanwhile , said Clarkson 's comments were " more serious than the Ross and Brand debacle " because he was " making light of murder " .
" More than 60 women have been murdered who the police say are prostitutes in the last 10 years so it's an absolute disgrace , " she said .
Clarkson should lose his job and " the people who allowed this programme to go out have to be brought to account , " she added .
Jeremy was just being Jeremy , just being himself and that 's what people watch the show for , so why change it ?
Top Gear co-presenter Richard Hammond
Hammond defends Clarkson 's joke " I think it 's a sacking offence to make light of the murder of anybody , never mind prostitute women who are vulnerable and criminalised . "
But Clarkson 's Top Gear co-presenter Richard Hammond told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat : " Jeremy was just being Jeremy , just being himself and that 's what people watch the show for , so why change it ? "
He added : " He was just being Jeremy .
People love that .
That 's what he was delivering . "
Will Shiers , editor of Truck & Driver magazine said " a small number of drivers were offended by the murdering prostitute reference " .
" On the whole , I thought the show was really entertaining .
" If anything it succeeded in demonstrating to car drivers just how difficult it is to drive a truck . "
Media regulator watchdog Ofcom said it had also been contacted by viewers angry at the remarks .
A spokesman said : " We 're looking at complaints we 've received but we 're not currently investigating the programme . "

" Miami - Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman Tuesday declared Florida 's 50 - year - old ban on gay adoptions unconstitutional -- a ruling state lawyers immediately said they would challenge .
The ruling sets the stage for Frank Gill , a gay man from North Miami , to adopt two foster children he has raised since 2004 .
In a 53 - page ruling , Judge Lederman said , ``It is clear that sexual orientation is not a predictor of a person 's ability to parent .
Two lawyers from the Florida Attorney General 's Office said they would file an appeal Tuesday .
'' We respect the court 's decision , '' said Assistant Attorney General Valerie Martin .
``Based upon the wishes of our client , the Department of Children & Families , we will file an appeal . ''
Gill , who is raising the half - brothers , ages 4 and 8 , said he was '' elated ' ' by the ruling and ` `I cried tears of joy for the first time in my life . "
( Miami Herald )
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A member of parliament who got a court order blocking online encyclopedia Wikipedia in Germany for two days because of entries linking him to communist - era security police apologized on Tuesday for overreacting .
Lutz Heilmann , a little - known MP of the Left party , made headlines across Germany and stirred complaints about censorship for winning the court injunction temporarily blocking the popular reference data base .
Heilmann told Tageszeitung newspaper he took the step because the entry about him in Wikipedia included false information , suggesting he worked for former communist East Germany ’s Stasi .
He said he realized he had made a mistake .
“ I did n’t think it through and did n’t anticipate the consequences , ” he told the newspaper after he withdrew his court injunction on Monday .
He added that he was fed up with seeing what he called false statements about his past included in his entry .
Wikipedia is edited by anonymous contributors .
Heilmann did not return calls seeking comment .
Catrin Schoneville , spokeswoman for Wikimedia that owns Wikipedia.de , did not want to comment on the accuracy of the entries but said some had been changed since the injunction .
Wikipedia.de ’s entry on Heilmann still describes the 42 - year - old as “ the first former full - time Stasi worker to enter the Bundestag ( parliament ) . ”
Schoneville said that , ironically , heavy media coverage of the blocking of the website caused donations to soar .
“ We always seek donations from users every year in the run-up to Christmas , ” she said .
“ This incident has raised public interest .
We ’ve received over five times the usual amounts . ”

Tucker does n’t know if the back - to - back U.S. political conventions addressed the financial worries she has raising four children -- she was too busy to watch .

“ I did n’t hear much about that , to be honest , ” said Tucker , a supporter of Republican presidential nominee John McCain , as she shopped at discount retailer Target in Cincinnati .
“ The economy is depressed .
Our money is n’t stretching as far , ” said Tucker , 40 .
With four kids to home school and coupons to clip to save money , the political conventions fell by the wayside .
“ I did n’t have time to watch , ” she said .
Chicago real estate agent Kathy Ivcich did catch some of the speechmaking but the celebratory atmosphere among the delegates left her wondering if they felt any of the economic pain she ’s experiencing .
“ We ’re feeling it in a city like Chicago ; I ca n’t imagine these people are n’t hurting , too , but I guess not , ” said Ivcich , 45 , an independent voter .
The hoopla of the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions captivated political junkies over the past two weeks but gloomy employment news released on Friday showed many Americans may be feeling left out of the party .
Government data showed the unemployment rate climbed to 6.1 percent in August , the highest in nearly five years , as employers shed 84,000 jobs .
It was the eighth straight month of job cuts and brought losses over the last three months to nearly a quarter of a million jobs .
Both McCain and Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama hit the ground running after their respective conventions , meeting with voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania to promise change in Washington , and to help consumers with fresh tax and energy policies .
TOO CLOSE TO CALL
While McCain is trying to distance himself from Republican President George W. Bush , whose eight - year tenure has featured a rise in unemployment and a growing housing and credit crisis , Obama has struggled to convince working - class voters that he feels their pain .
Bernice Shiney , a nurse in Nashville , Tennessee , watched some of both the Democratic and Republican conventions but was left feeling that nothing that was stated was relevant to her .
“ They have n’t said a thing , ” Shiney said .
“ It ’s all a personal thing with them , to see if they can beat each other down and win .
That ’s what it ’s all about . ”
McCain trails Obama slightly in most national opinion polls as they head toward the November 4 election but the vote is still considered too close to call .
Opinion polls show majorities favor Obama ’s leadership on the economy , although McCain is usually favored on foreign policy issues .
Economist Christian Weller of the liberal - leaning Center for American Progress said that while both men have put forth long - term proposals to address tax or energy policies , dismal economic data will likely force them to come up with specific short - term plans to try to win over undecided voters .
“ They both will have to connect , especially in battleground states , to the plight of American families .
It ’s not just the unemployment numbers , it ’s the rising foreclosures , rising bankruptcies , rising prices , ” Weller said .
“ People want to hear not only about the plan for five years out or eight years out , but , ‘ How will you help me pay my fuel bill in the winter . ’”
But Cincinnati mom Meghan Guitron , 28 , said she was skeptical any politician would help with her family ’s budget .
“ Gas prices , grocery bills -- it would be nice to see some improvement in that , but I do n’t know how much they can guarantee , ” said Guitron , a stay - at - home mother of one .
Instead , Guitron said she would vote for Obama simply to help break the Republican hold on the White House .
“ More than anything , I just feel we need a change . ”

The Republicans are coming to town !!
No more running away .
It ’s time to stand up and fight back the only way we know how — peaceful protest .
So that ’s what we did .
The protest drew over 40,000 people to St. Paul according to organizers .
Being one of the 40,000 that ’s a very believable number — in fact it could be much higher .
I ’ve rarely seen so many people all in one place , but everybody was really peaceful in our march .
There were so many good vibes and peaceful cops that I was almost bored !
It ’s great that the cops were restrained for our march .
Many anarchist groups were not so lucky .
Here ’s a story told in photos :
Police form a line against the anarchist group trying to take an authorized route .
Fred Phelps ( of the supposed Westboro Baptist Church ) thinks god hates fags … and you and me and everyone else .
What an asshole .
He sent his family out to protest … everybody .
They managed to piss people off pretty rapidly .
In fact there may have been some sort of confrontation …
This guy may have been injured after a confrontation with Fred Phelps ’ family .
He was being helped away by his friends .
Luckily Bush , Cheney , Condi and Rumsfeld were captured before they could do any more damage .
…
Wait , are those puppets ?
Dammit , they ’ve eluded us again !
Hopefully Bush will be in jail before this kid grows up .
These guys were pretty cool .
Apparently they are called The Rude Mechanical Orchestra .
The crowd masses before the march begins .
The crowd begins marching away from the capitol .
Meanwhile the river of people flowing towards the Xcel Center appeared endless .
I think the first people reached the Xcel before the end of the march managed to leave the Capitol .
That ’s how many people there were .
Lobbyists For McCain !
These guys have a message for Obama supporters — “ No You Can’t ! ” These guys were hilarious .
Yes , they were kidding .
These guys were n’t kidding .
They were part of a small group of counter - protesters who were there to support the war while implying the troops would rather achieve victory than come home now .
Umm … maybe you should ask them why they donate so much money to Obama and Ron Paul then , dudes .
There were approximately 30 to 40 of these hardcore pro-war Republicans there to greet the 40,000 of us who respectfully disagree .
The 1,000 to 1 ratio makes me wonder if the few war supporters left are able to openly support the war only because of the Media ’s cheerleading .
If they knew they were so outnumbered they might start to question some of their assumptions .
The police mostly stayed out of the way .
Many of them were just there to block off roads and keep the marchers on track .
By staying out of the way they made sure tensions stayed low and nobody felt threatened .
Some of them looked at bit concerned at times .
The crowd could ’ve easily torn these guys limb from limb if we were so inclined .
We were n’t .
The biggest worry the cops had was keeping cool .
This guy looks like he ’d rather not be wearing his dark , hot , heavy uniform .
Ca n’t say I blame him .
Every now and then the cops would interrupt the protesters so they could march through and do …. what ?
I dunno .
Seemed like they just liked making sure they were still in charge .
They herded us into the Freedom Cage , as we called it .
It was a corridor of steel fences designed to give us the impression we were near the Xcel Center when were in fact a long distance away , especially considering how many obstacles you ’d have to scale in order to get there .
This is as close as we ever got to the Xcel Center .
Close enough to shake our fists but not much else .
Not like they give a damn what we think anyway .
The Freedom Cage steered us back towards the state capitol .
Boy did we ever feel safe and secure inside that Freedom Cage .
This guy was his own personal free speech zone .
He was the safest guy at the whole protest .
The wires protect him from excessive liberty and independent thought .
Here Bush and Cheney have tied up , Lady Liberty , ripped her shirt off while strangling her and then proceeded to drag her through the street .
I ’d say this protest was pretty sick except that it ’s a dead - on metaphor for what Bush / Cheney has done to our country and our civil liberties .
This last 8 years has been like a slow - motion snuff film .
Puppy abuse ?
Maybe , but he seemed pretty happy to be there .
This red , white and blue pup was one of many patriotic ensembles .
The protesters were not ready to cede patriotism to the Republicans ; that ’s for sure .
The Constitution of the United States of America : Rememeber this thing ?
We need to bring it back online .
There were a lot of people there !
I was never able to get the majority in one shot .
I guess we ’ll never know how many people were there , but I bet there could ’ve been more .
I ’m guessing only 1 person showed up for every 10 people who hate the Bush regime and the idea of 4 more years of this crap .
What can we do to change things ?
“ Peace Begins with a Smile ” .
Man , I hope she ’s right .
Well , that ’s it !.
Have any other good pictures ?
Post them in the comments below .
I have a couple more ; you can check them out on my photostream on Flickr .
Peace !

Do not take this stock market decline at face value !
This is very , very suspicious -- drastic falls in share prices with little uptick in volume , threats of martial law directed at Congressmen ( see California Congressman Brad Sherman 's speech opposing the bailout ) , a government and President that seemingly wants to scare us instead of trying to calm the situation .
I have no idea what is really going on , but the history of the Iraq war and election fraud should have taught us to be skeptical .

Palin releases own Troopergate report :
In an effort to head off the report , McCain campaign spokesman Taylor Griffin released the campaign 's own version of events .
That report , which Griffin said was written by campaign staffers , says the Legislature has taken a legitimate policy dispute between a governor and one of her commissioners , and portrayed it as something inappropriate .
But wait a minute :
" Whenever anyone writes their own report , they 're filtering their data .
And if you 've already drawn your conclusion , you tend to filter it in a way to support that conclusion , " [ Palin 's attorney , Thomas Van Flein , said . ]
Um , is n't there some kind of disconnect there ?

AP changed their headline when you hit that link , they must be on to you , Brad .
You 're right , it 's not an Onion headline , it 's a MAD Magazine headline !
And further proof of the " liberal media " sham , the biggest sham of all time !
Let 's watch and see if they cover a REAL abuse of power story with as much vigor as the bogus ACORN voter fraud stories !
Keep track of that , Brad !
Maybe this wo n't be on TV !!!
At all !!!
Will Fox " news " cover it at all ???

A chilling video from Wasilla by Max Blumenthal that helps explain more deeply how Palin is a product of some of the most extreme forms of Christianism that exist .
I also learned a new nugget from local pastor , Howard Bess .
He claims that Palin 's church took over the board of Mat - Su Medical Center , the hospital that Palin was absolutely determined to have her fifth child in , even though her water had already broken on a trip in Texas :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Fashion designer and and Manhattan boutique owner Apollo Braun is at it again .
But this time , I think he ’s gone too far .
As much as I dislike Obama as a potential POTUS , I think his children should be left alone .
But Apollo does n’t seem to think so .
Check out his newest t- shirt .
Malia Obama , the oldest daughter of Michelle and Barack Obama , is in the center of a new T - shirt line which was launched yesterday in New York City .
The T - shirt which bears the slogan “ Who Killed Malia Obama ? ” already created anger from upset customers who visited the “ Apollo Braun ” store on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan where the line is sold .
One man even threatened “ to burn the store to the ground ” if the T - shirt would n’t be removed immediately from the store ’s racks .
But fashion designer Doron Braunshtein aka Apollo Braun , the owner of the five and a half year old boutique – who gets angry emails and phone calls since March this year when his first anti-Obama T - shirt was unveiled - is not the kind of guy to stop his art and his right for freedom of speech for anyone .
Braun said today :
“ Obama is fully responsible for the stock market fallout this Monday .
He brought it on all of us and he is the only one to blaim for it .
We , the Americans , are confused and repulsed to see this unexperienced black man as the candidate of the Democrat Party .
He is wrong , just wrong for all of us .
Unless you are a college kid you must understand how wrong Obama is for this country .
He makes all of us uncertain of the future of our lives and our children ’s lives .
He is too extreme - like John Kerry was four years ago .
I wish the Democrats will understand that the only chance they have to win is with a person who is more toward the center , like Bill Clinton was , and not such a left wing radical like this ugly joke which is continuing too long called Barack Hussein Obama .
People need to wake up from their fantasy .
Obama is not the answer , he is the biggest question this country has confronted in a long time and the bottom line is that he is dangerous , pure dangerous for all of us .
I am very happy that the “ New York Post ” , definitely my favorite newspaper in the city , understands this better than others . ”
But is it politically - correct to involve a ten year - old innocent girl in this saga ?
Braun says :
“ I do n’t care if she is ten years - old or eighty years - old .
I ca n’t stand seeing her face , I ca n’t stand seeing Michelle Obama ’s face .
I ca n’t even stand seeing Malia ’s younger sister Sasha ’s face .
As long as their last name is Obama I ca n’t bear hearing them or seeing them .
Do n’t you think that Obama is wasting enough energy and time from all of us ?
I mean , can you really imagine the possibility that the average white Christian American would accept the fact that his new president is such a left wing radical black man ?
Give me a break !
I just heard a great joke today and I must share it with you : ‘ Obama dies and meets God .
God asks him : what did you do on earth ?
Obama answers :
You do n’t know ?
I was the president !
God asks him : when ?
Obama answers :
What when ?
Twenty minutes ago !’
I know it can sound vicious to some people to some degree and believe me , I myself ca n’t even hurt a butterfly .
I ’m too gentle , but God forbid if some redneck from the Midwest will take things in the wrong way … ”

Pentagon exploring submersible aircraft for combat insertions Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 25 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - The United States wants to develop a submersible aircraft that can fly hundreds of nautical miles , weather rough seas and then go under water to insert commandos on a hostile shore .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) acknowledged it has never been done before " because the design requirements for a submersible and an aircraft are diametrically opposed . "
But in a request for proposals earlier this month , it said it was looking for " radical new technologies that can provide a game - changing Department of Defense capability for inserting small teans clandestinely , along coastal locations . "
DARPA is renowned as the originator of many of the Pentagon 's most revolutionary innovations , from the Internet to the stealth technologies that underpinned the B - 2 bomber .
Its proposal asks for feasibility studies and experiments to prove concepts for a submersible aircraft with the speed and range of an aircraft , the loiter capabilities of a boat and the stealth of a submarine .
The proposed craft should be able to fly commandos 1,000 nautical miles ( 1,850 kilometers , 1,150 miles ) into a theater of operations , fly close to the sea surface for another 100 nautical miles , and then travel underwater for the last 12 nautical miles .
And it should be able to do all that in eight hours .
The craft should then be capable of loitering for three days in seas with up to four - meter ( 13 - foot ) waves .
That 's not all .
It should have enough fuel left over to extract the commandos and fly to a rendezvous point 100 nautical miles away .
" Given the list of diverging requirements and design considerations , the difficulties involved in developing a submersible airplane are clear , " DARPA said .
Aircraft are designed to be light and bouyant .
Submarines , on the other hand , need weight to remain submerged , as well as thick skins that can sustain the pressure of being underwater .
Differences in densities of water and air , in velocities and loading requirements all make for aircraft and submarine design requirements that work against each other .
The DARPA proposal said previous attempts failed because they focused on making a submarine fly .
" The design concept being evaluated here is for a submersible aircraft , not a flying submarine , " it said .
" While it is hard to envision a propulsion system that could ever get a craft with the weight of a submarine airborne , it may be possible to submerge an extremely buoyant platform like an aircraft if the operating depths can be minimized . "
But rights to the gene are controlled by the Melbourne - based Genetic Technologies , which has already threatened to stop public hospitals testing for breast cancer gene mutations , and the hospital will not risk a similar problem .
Specialists are sending blood samples to Scotland , and only babies whose seizure patterns closely resemble Dravet syndrome are tested .
This means children with slightly different symptoms may be treated with the wrong medicines for months , potentially retarding their development .
" It 's frustrating that we can't get the test done readily , " Dr Gill said .
" If we could include it as part of the work - up , we could identify them early . "
At present the diagnosis is often delayed until the child is 12 to 18 months old .
This is after the optimum time for treatment with strong drugs that are unsuitable for most babies with epilepsy but are used for infants with Dravets to control severe seizures that can damage the brain .
Standard childhood epilepsy medications are ineffective with Dravets and may worsen it , Dr Gill said .
The situation comes amid growing concern among doctors and medical researchers over the ethics of granting private ownership to human DNA .
A Senate inquiry announced this month will investigate the effects of gene patenting on health - care .
SCN1A is the most important epilepsy gene discovered , Dr Gill said , and is abnormal in about 70 per cent of children with Dravet syndrome , which affects about one in 30,000 babies - almost 10 per cent of infant epilepsy cases .
About one in 20 children have a seizure when they develop a fever , though only a minority had epilepsy , Dr Gill said .
The Scottish laboratory conducts SCN1A testing for all of Britain .
Dr Gill said the price of the test - about $ 1800 - was similar to that offered by Genetic Technologies , but he had more confidence in the expertise of the Scottish laboratory , run by a pediatric neurologist .
Dr Gill said patenting the gene " may have helped initially to define and produce the test , but in 2008 it's not helping kids right now to access the test " .
John Christodoulou , director of the Western Sydney Genetics Program , based at the same hospital , said his laboratory could not risk SCN1A testing in case Genetic Technologies - which licenses the gene patent from an Adelaide biotechnology firm , Bionomics - later barred him from testing or imposed a prohibitive royalty .
Genetic Technologies caused an uproar last month when it threatened to sue hospitals that test for breast cancer genes .
It is reviewing that position .
Mervyn Jacobson , a founding director of the company , said , " The question is , are public hospitals allowed to break the law and breach patents granted by the Australian Government ? "
While in principle the company would insist on its rights , in practice it would be prepared to negotiate , he said .
" We do n't need to necessarily enforce them against publicly funded institutions . "
He was unaware of an earlier approach by Dr Christodoulou to ask how the company would view the establishment of public SCN1A testing , made to a previous management team .
Luigi Palombi , an intellectual law expert from the Australian National University , said legislation needed to be revised to prevent patenting of human genes .
" Why should these people have a patent over DNA , and over treatment ? "
Obama the Messiah - Dictator is more dangerous than Bush
Paul Joseph Watson & Alex Jones
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , November 4 , 2008
The messianic fervor which has preceded Barack Obama ’s expected ascension to the White House has alarming implications for freedom and is a painful reminder that most Americans have once again been suckered into believing that the two - party monopoly offers any kind of solution to the crisis that we face .
For eight years during the term of Bill Clinton , Alex Jones was labeled a right - wing fascist for opposing him and for the past near - eight years Jones has been derided as a communist and even an Al - Qaeda member for railing against the Bush administration .
Now even regular readers of our own websites are calling Alex a right - wing racist once again merely for questioning the ascension of the new great leader – Barack Obama .
The messianic complex that has been attached to Obama is truly frightening .
Bishops like Cornal Garnett Henning are calling Obama the new “ Moses ” while his supporters refer to him as “ the black Jesus ” .
In one You Tube clip , a woman hails Obama ’s Godly powers by proclaiming that as soon as he is elected , all her problems will simply disappear , saying that Obama will help her personally almost like Jesus healed the sick and wounded .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The election of a new president should not be a mindless act of idolatry and fanfare , it should be a solemn commitment to find a leader who will follow the Constitution .
But Barack Obama will ride into office with a gigantic approval rating to rival that of Bush after 9/11 , along with a complete power monopoly over the executive , the legislative , the judicial as well as widespread media support .
This makes Obama more dangerous than Bush and certainly a damn site more dangerous than a McCain administration , because his policies for at least a year or two will enjoy universal acclaim and voices of dissent will be drowned out by a wave of droning acquiescence .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Obama has all the political capital he needs to implement the terrifying policies that he has already announced and beef the architecture of the police state crafted by Bush .
– The creation of a “ civilian national security force ” that is “ just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded ” as the U.S. military to enforce Obama ’s carbon tax scheme and the total regulation and control of the American middle class .
– Obama has talked openly about his intention to bomb Pakistan under the guise of pursuing terrorists , continuing a Bush administration policy of violating the sovereignty of foreign nations .
– The guarantee to “ bankrupt ” coal power plants , costing millions of American jobs and skyrocketing energy prices .
– Unbridled implementation and expansion of the banker bailout that is hated by the majority of American citizens yet was vigorously promoted by both Obama and McCain .
Doling out taxpayer ’s money to Wall Street , causing rampant inflation , a lowering in living standards and the destruction of the dollar .
– Obama has rhetorically supported the second amendment and an individual ’s right to bear arms , but his actions tell a different story .
Obama supports local gun ban laws , including his endorsement of a state ban on the sale and possession of handguns in Illinois .
– Obama grandstands on the notion that he supports environmentalism with his climate change rhetoric , but his intention to extend biofuel subsidies will only accelerate price food costs that have already risen 75 per cent since 2002 , causing economic distress and rioting in such countries as Haiti , Egypt , and Somalia , as well as deforestation on a massive scale .
Mark our words – the causes that the liberal left has been fighting for over the last eight years will simply be forgotten just like conservatives were put to sleep when Bush came to power .
Obama is the pacifier that the establishment needs to quiet the simmering anger amongst Americans that has been threatening to boil over .
It will no longer be “ fashionable ” to fight the police state amongst the political left .
Mark our words – there will be no repeal of the Patriot Act , there will be no repeal of the John Warner Defense Authorization
Act , there will be no repeal of warrantless secret surveillance of American citizens .
Democratic control of Congress and the Senate since the 2006 elections has achieved nothing in the way of reversing the Bush administration ’s assaults on the Constitution , so why should we expect Obama to do anything different ?
Obama may eventually withdraw a portion of troops from Iraq but mark our words , they wo n’t be home long before they are sent off to bomb another broken - backed third world country , this time in the name of a United Nations - backed “ humanitarian ” war , just as Bill Clinton presided over in Somalia and Serbia with the full support of the establishment political left .
Indeed , Obama ’s running mate Joe Biden has already “ promised ” and “ guaranteed ” that Obama will be faced with an international crisis that will mandate him to take “ unpopular ” and “ tough ” decisions in the context of foreign policy .
Do n’t think for a second that our warnings about Obama are an endorsement for John McCain .
We have tirelessly attempted to educate Americans about the two party monopoly and the fact that Democrats and Republicans serve the interests of the elite , not the people , and have for at least five decades since Kennedy was killed .
Obama is Coca - Cola and McCain is Pepsi – at the end of the day you ’re still drinking the same beverage .
The two - party monopoly offers no solutions for the problems we face , in fact the two - party monopoly that you will be helping to maintain should you vote for either Obama or McCain – is the problem .
Stop falling for the same bait and switch trick again and again every eight years .
When George W. Bush was elected , conservatives were in adulation and awe , confident that after eight years of federal government expansion under Clinton , Bush – complete with slick conservative rhetoric and promises of change – would shrink the size of government and restore dignity to the office of President .
Nearly eight years later and what have we witnessed , a record expansion in the size of government and an almost universal contempt for America around the world .
When Tony Blair swept into power with a landslide in the British general election in 1997 , the country breathed a collective sigh of relief that this new young dynamo would put right years of Tory malfeasance and provide the “ change ” that everyone was crying out for .
When Blair left office in 2007 he had created a Socialist surveillance police state and eliminated a huge popular approval lead the Labour Party had enjoyed over the Tories , leaving most of the public once again to demand Conservative rule .
When are we going to wake up to the fact that voting in the lesser of two evils is not a solution ?
When are we going to realize that participating in a rigged system , where our vote means virtually nothing anyway because it is counted by a completely compromised and hackable voting machine , not only fails to address any of our problems , but actually compounds them because of our passive obedience in participating in the phony virtual reality presented to us as “ democracy ” ?
When are we going to realize that by continually electing Democrats and Republicans , we are voting away our own freedom as the march towards a new world order and an American police state proceeds no matter who takes office ?

Comment on this article
As I was searching for a specific part of every M.A.S.K. cartoon that reminded me of Obama ’s Economic Team Formation , I came across this video …
I had to post it , because it is so completely , unbelievably off .
I ’ve never even heard of half of these shows , and I was a cartoon junkie for that entire decade !
However , it completely makes up for its failures with its choice of the # 1 song - a show that is mostly forgotten , but was such an amazingly fantastic show … ( though it ’s theme song is pretty fail . )
I know for many of us 80s Babies out there , this is the most important issue of our time , so let me know how horridly wrong I am …
Without further adieu …
My Top Ten 80s Cartoon
Theme Songs after the jump :
10 . Transformers
This would rank higher if it was the electric - guitar - god Transformers : The Movie version .
And it would easily be # 1 ( possibly of any song , ever ) if it was Stan Bush ’s The Touch .
Either way , if aliens came to earth in the 80s , this would be the first cultural artifact I would hand them .
And the tape would obviously be played in a working version of Soundwave .
9. Thundercats
Hoooooo !
I was junked on this song as a kid .
If Lik ’M ’Aid was my cocaine , this was my opium .
8. GI Joe
The fact that I watched this show every day for most of my childhood probably renders my taste moot - I have no idea if this is a good or bad song , I just heard it so damn much , mere exposure phenomenon took over .
It would rank higher if it was the GI Joe : The Movie theme song .
Cobralalalalalalala !
7. TMNT
‘ Nuff said .
6. Jem
Sure , none of us admitted we watched Jem - none of us males that is .
But dammit was this show all kinds of awesome , and wow did it set the bar for what we wanted women to be like when we grew up … a combination of Jem and She - Ra .
How healthy for society …
5. Muppet Babies
The most postmodern show ever made is also my all - time favorite ( well , tied with Alvin ) .
I loved how they got to pretend they were in the Star Wars universe and Oz in the same episode .
And I find it weird that most people were positive they ’d seen Nanny ’s face , and had a similar vision of exactly what it looked like .
Proof for God ?
4. Heathcliff
I ’m not exaggerating in the least when I say that I STILL sing this song to myself a few times a day .
This is not an exaggeration .
Damn you Heathcliff , for burrowing into my head with your pitch - perfect pop masterpiece !
It is easily the most addictive song I ’ve ever heard .
And it changed my life forever .
3. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show
Rarely has a creative team been so visionary in providing an entire experience for a theme song .
It is a travesty that Macarena and Soldja Boy were popular dances in da clubs , and we ’ve never ridden a euphoric wave of Do the Mario .
My brother and I would always jump up after a rousing episode of TSMBSS and join Cap’n Lou Albano in his incendiary dance .
A serious contender for my wedding song .
2. Alvin and the Chipmunks
Every song these rodents touched turned to gold .
Not only was this my favorite show as a kid , it was one of the best theme songs we ’ve ever had .
1. Disney Afternoon Lineup
I had to group the Disney Afternoon Lineup together - otherwise they would have monopolized the entire list .
If there were an infinite amount of money in the world ( or in my pocket ) I would hire a documentary team to create a doc about the making of the Disney Afternoon theme songs .
Clearly they are four of the most important songs written in the twentieth century .
( Darkwing is an afterthought . )
My brother and I got a cassette tape of the Disney Afternoon theme songs as a gift back in the day , and wore it down until it was dust .
A. Duck Tales
B. Rescue Rangers
C. Gummi Bears

Rapture for the Geeks : When AI Outsmarts IQ
Author : Richard Dooling
Publisher : Harmony
Price : $ 22.00 ( Amazon.com )
Literary Jack - of - all - trades Richard Dooling once told me that he begins " every novel with the vow that I will not write about technology , Catholicism , or hell , " but it never sticks .
" I end up writing about all three . "
It 's true for his book - length essays as well ; Dooling 's first work of nonfiction , Blue Streak , ended with a memorable passage articulating what one can only describe as a theology of swearing .
The last chapter of Dooling 's new work , Rapture for the Geeks :
When AI Outsmarts IQ , considers what will happen to religious belief in the coming age of Higher Tech .
It includes the opening chapters of the book of Genesis as if they had been rewritten by Microsoft contract lawyers ( " The Source Code of Good and Evil you shall NOT view , for the day you view it you will surely die " ) , then tweaked by our coming open - source friendly robot overlords ( " The one true God runs the universe in UNIX " ) .
Dooling also takes issue with noted scientists who are trying to popularize atheism as a necessary part of technological progress .??
The author calls Richard Dawkins 's bestselling book The God Delusion " a collection of arguments that most liberal - arts students encounter before their junior year " and are bored of by graduation .
He confesses that he read the polemic " out of curiosity , same way I 'd read a book by Mother Teresa if she had suddenly decided to write one called The Math Delusion " — a subject she would have been utterly unqualified to weigh in on .
Dooling quips , " Many scientists smarter than Dawkins , like Einstein , for instance , " believe in a God .
He insists that Dawkins is a disingenuous wuss for allowing that " Einsteinian religion " is okay while calling for the abolition of those old time religions , because it amounts to special pleading by a new religious minority .
" Dawkins ca n't declare Einstein 's God somehow not God , " he writes , " and thereby free himself from calling the greatest physicist of the twentieth century deluded for believing in him . "
And that 's just a single chapter .
I mock , therefore I am
The pointed challenge to Dawkins is not an outlier .
Dooling does n't just use the book to criticize the people , trends , or businesses he dislikes — he also ridicules them for fun and profit .
Microsoft comes in for repeated ( mostly deserved ; often hilarious ) mockery .
Not even permanent disability can shield someone from Dooling 's rapier wit .
David Gelernter , the Yale computer scientist who lost an eye and most of a hand to the Unabomber , takes a drubbing for his theorizing about machine consciousness .
( " Anyone who asks you to explain [ consciousness ] is changing the subject or cheating . " )
And Dooling has a run at Cambridge 's current wheelchair - bound Lucasian professor of mathematics , Stephen Hawking , for good measure .
" It 's fashionable these days to laugh at creationists and intelligent design kooks , " he writes , " but come on : is the notion of a big bang really any more plausible ?
Hawking and other cosmo-megalomaniac astrophysicists ' know ' that the big bang happened at least fifteen billion years ago . "
How do they know that ?
Through their measurements of something called " cosmic microwave background radiation . "
Dooling calls Hawking " a smart fellow with a lot of equations [ who's ] used them to make a nice story about how the universe began . "
In Dooling 's telling , the mathematician 's theorizing only raises the same concern that the " great physicist and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla complained of . "
Tesla complained that " today 's scientists ... wander off through equation after equation and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality . "
For good measure , Dooling likens Hawking et al to those " medieval astronomers " who had " elaborate equations , postulates , and theorems " that " made their numbers work to prove that the sun revolved around the earth . "
Unfair ?
Probably .
But it 's at least a brazen and entertaining debater 's trick .
Disagree with Dooling ?
Hey , go right ahead , but his friends Einstein and Tesla might ask you to step outside .
Big bang ?
That 's a good one , buddy .
Bet you bought into heliocentrism , too .
But cut out all the jagged pirouettes and Dooling really is onto something here .
Science fictioneers used to imagine a future in which technological progress had moved us beyond the need for religion and spirituality , but they 've learned a thing or two .
Now , sci - fi storytellers are starting to incorporate into their yarns the notion , backed up by some scientific observation , that the religious impulse cannot be stripped out of humanity .
In fact , it might affect us more deeply as Tech marches on , and not necessarily in a good way .
Which brings us to the Cylons .
In a nutshell : Four months after gay marriage was declared legal in California , an initiative has been introduced to the November ballot , called Proposition 8 , to make such a union illegal again .
I am of mixed feelings about this , because while I whole - heartedly support gay marriage , I have a number of presents waiting to go to the post office for friends who have recently tied the knot , and if their marriage suddenly becomes illegal , I can return the gifts for cash .
I kid , of course .
I 'd barter them on the street for drugs .
I kid again .
I do n't have any friends .
So , what do you do ?
If you live in California , vote NO on Proposition 8 .
If you live either in or out of California , donate to the cause .
Polly at Lesbian Dad has a handy little donation page that I 've linked to here .
Click on it .
Donate .
If you all donated $ 5 the minute you read this , we'd have almost $ 10,000 additional dollars by the end of today .
Donate $ 10 and we 'd double that .
Do it .
If you are not sure , read Polly 's site here , here and here .
Then do it .
So you 've pledged to vote , donated to the cause , read the propaganda , and even promised to raise all your babies gay just to marry them legally in California and you still want to do more ?
Steal this post .
Below are seven different post - ready ads that you can copy and post on your blog or myspace page or whatever you kids have these days and wo n't tell me about because I 'm almost forty .
Each is followed by a code that you can copy and paste directly .
Take them and spread them everywhere .
You can also send me your own awkward wedding photos and I 'll make more posters to spread around .
If I receive enough , I splice them into a youtube video and we 'll all be famous !
( Nothing like being mocked for a good cause .
And yes , I 'm in these somewhere .
I wo n't say which one I am , just that I 'm really cute , short , and blonde . )

Recently , I have written quite a few posts highlighting the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s ballooning balance sheet .
It has increased purchases of assets at an unprecedented clip .
In fact , that balance sheet had $ 900 billion in assets just this past year .
By year ’s end , we should expect it to have risen more than three - fold to $ 3 trillion .
This is a wild experiment without parallel in modern history .
But , there is a cost to all of this .
One cost , hidden behind much of the chatter about bailouts , loans to lending institutions , and debt guarantees , is the damage to the Fed ’s balance sheet .
If the Federal Reserve were a commercial bank , any regulator would declare the institution insolvent due to inadequate capital and shut it down .
The Federal Reserve now has leverage of over fifty times capital and this figure is expected to rise .
The Fed needs $ 48 billion in capital just to get back to the capital ratios it had last year .
How this experiment ends is anybody ’s guess .
However , below is an article in this week ’s Barron ’s pointing out how extreme things at the Federal Reserve have become .
Notice the sharp reduction in U.S. treasurys and the huge increase in securities lent to dealers and overall assets .
Very worrying .
If the Federal Reserve were a commercial lender , it would be a candidate for receivership , based on its capital ratios .
Bank examiners generally view any lender with a ratio below 2 % to be dangerously undercapitalized .
The Fed ’s current capital ratio , or capital as a percentage of assets , is 1.9 % .
The Fed has provided so many loans and emergency credits — to banks , brokers , money funds and foreign countries — that its balance sheet , viewed one way , is as leveraged as any hedge fund ’s : Its consolidated assets amount to 53 times capital .
Only 11 months ago , its leverage on this basis was a more modest 25 times , and its capital ratio 4 % .
A caveat : Many of the loans are self - liquidating facilities that will disappear in a few months if the financial crisis eases .
Although the Fed ’s role as a central bank is much different from the role of a private - sector operation , the drastic changes in the size and shape of its balance sheet worry even some long - time Fed officials .
Its consolidated assets have swelled to $ 2.2 trillion from $ 915 billion in about 11 months , and contain at least a half - dozen items that were n’t there before .
Some , like a loan to backstop the purchase of a brokerage , Bear Stearns , are unprecedented .
( See table for highlights . )
Critics say this action could hinder the Fed in achieving its No. 1 priority : keeping inflation in check .
To try to get in front of the crisis , many decisions have had to be made on the fly .
“ If the Fed had been [ a savings - and - loan ] ballooning its balance sheet so fast , the supervisors would have been all over it , ” says Ed Kane , a Boston College finance professor .
Adds Walker Todd , a former Fed lawyer : “ The Fed has stretched its authority farther and wider than it ever has in its entire history .
The risk is that they wo n’t be able or willing to mop up all this excess liquidity when it comes time to head off inflation a few years down the road . ”
How did the U.S. central bank , under Ben Bernanke , get to this place ?
The boldest move hit the headlines on St. Patrick ’s Day , when the Fed made its unique 10 - year loan to bail out Bear Stearns by backstopping JPMorgan Chase ’s ( JPM ) purchase .
That was done , some say , to prevent the domino effect that Bear Stearns ’ collapse might have had on certain big counterparties , including banks .
In September , the Fed provided $ 85 billion to American International Group ( AIG ) , effectively taking control of the world ’s biggest insurer in a deal that ’s since been restructured .
And the central bank has poured so many billions into the commercial - paper and money - market mutual - fund markets that one in every seven dollars , about 15 % of the $ 1.6 trillion commercial - paper market , is Fed - supported .
The Fed also created special lines for London offices of primary U.S. government dealers after the Bank of England cut off its short - term lending to them because Lehman Brothers repatriated $ 8 billion to New York from London just before its bankruptcy filing .
Then came the $ 571 billion in foreign - currency swap lines funded and operated by the Fed .
The last time swap lines were used in a major crisis , the so - called Exchange Stabilization Fund — to bail out Mexico in 1995 — was operated by the Treasury and Fed .
The Fed has its supporters .
“ Given the alternative — doing nothing in the face of a crisis — the Fed has done a remarkable job of holding the system together by inventive use of short - term liquidity , ” says Charles Blood , senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman .
Yet others see a willy - nilly series of moves that did n’t weed out insolvent banks .
Boston College ’s Kane blames Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for frightening Congress into parting with $ 700 billion .
Kane ’s view is that the Fed ’s independence has been compromised by working too closely with Treasury .
For all that , banks remain reluctant lenders , because no one ’s sure who ’s solvent .
Reserve balances held with Federal banks now rest at $ 592 billion , up from the normal $ 15 billion in the months prior to September .
“ The Fed has violated two principal tenets of central banking , ” says Lee Hoskins , former president of the Cleveland Fed : “ First , do n’t lend to insolvent institutions , and second , do n’t lend on anything but the most pristine collateral ” — and at a penalty rate .
In lending and selling off most of its hoard of U.S. Treasuries , the central bank may not have the resources to sop up all the liquidity .
Its current accounts show that the Fed ’s holdings of Treasuries not already lent to dealers have dropped to about $ 250 billion , the lowest level since the late 1980s .
The Fed needs at least $ 48 billion more in capital to return to 2007 levels , just to meet the standard it demands of banks , says Gerald P. O’Driscoll , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .
And some of that capital might go into reserves to shield against unanticipated loan losses .
“ [ The Fed has ] spooked the market with [ its ] scare tactics and ever - changing plans , ” he says “ The Fed ’s actions coupled with the Treasury ’s bailout of the banks have taken us one big step closer to corporatism — big business in cahoots with big government . ”
It ’s possible some of the better - capitalized regional Fed banks may balk at some point .
“ Of course , there are plenty of regional Reserve bank presidents and directors deeply concerned about what the Fed has done , ” says Hoskins .
“ But how do we register that concern ? ”

This shows that the Cupertino tech giant has caught on to how important security is to smartphone users nowadays , especially with all the companies that came forward on the topic of data collection and farming .
Naturally , with the launch of the most recent installment in Apple ’s in - house operating system line , namely the iOS 10 , many new promises of improved security features were made .
But did Apple really hold true to them ?
Our answer will have to be a firm ‘ yes ’ on this one .
Keep reading to find out why .
iOS 10 Security Features
Perhaps the most robust security features that iOS 10 has to offer is its reliable data encryption system .
In this way , Apple ’s got your back as far as protecting your data from malicious third - parties , be them hackers or actual physical thieves that stole your phone .
Your iPhone protects itself and the data it carries by a series of security steps such as a password , a pin code and thumbprint .
On top of that , while the myth that Apple devices are n’t safe from malware might not hold true , it ’s true that they are a bit safer from outside threats than Android devices or any other operating system - powered ones .
For one , any Apple device comes with sever anti-malware programs already built in , and the constant security patches and update rolled out by the company also reduce the risk of malware infestation .
All in all , we ’d have to say that iOS 10 is pretty safe as far as operating systems go .
What about your experience ?
Do you own an iOS 10 - powered device ?
If so , how would you rate its security level ?
Let us know .
Officials did not disclose the extent of the damage and would not elaborate on the reasons for believing the assault originated in Russia .

WASHINGTON —
The political weapon cabinet might need restocking .
“ Liberal , ” it appears , is n’t the lethal label it used to be .
It was a reliable bludgeon for more than three decades , and Republicans pulled it out again on the 2008 campaign trail .
But in Colorado , Democrat Mark Udall won the race for U.S. Senate despite persistent GOP efforts to brand him “ Boulder Liberal Mark Udall . ”
And Barack Obama is president - elect , even with a National Journal listing that ranked him the Senate ’s most liberal member .
In the face of those defeats , GOP strategists are questioning whether they ’ve lost their favored tactic for the short term or forever .
Democrats are watching young voters ’ opinions .
And those who track political language are listening for the next catchword .
“ I suspect that the heyday of using ‘ liberal ’ as an attack word is over , ” said George P. Lakoff , a University of California - Berkeley cognitive linguistics professor .
“ It has pretty much gone out of use , except by conservatives that are attacking people . ”
The meaning of “ liberal ” today veers far from its original definition .
More than a century ago , it described proponents of individual liberty , free trade and free markets .
In the years following President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s terms , Lakoff said , it signified support of government intervention .
People proudly called themselves liberals .
“ Liberal ” became political poison in the early 1970s , during the presidential campaign of Republican Richard Nixon against Democrat George McGovern .
Republicans in that race used “ liberal ” to describe people they considered radical , opponents of the Vietnam War , and supporters of social change , including legalized abortion .
It worked .
Nixon won re-election over McGovern by a 23 - point margin .
Republicans have used it in elections ever since .
Some argue it ’s still relevant and that voters in 2008 picked personality over ideology .
“ This whole election turned on the unpopularity of George Bush and the collapse of the economy and finally the charisma of Barack Obama , ” said Dick Wadhams , campaign manager for Republican Bob Schaffer , who lost the Senate race to Udall .
“ There would be no other circumstance where a Boulder liberal could be elected to the U.S. Senate or a liberal like Barack Obama could be elected president of the United States . ”
“ Might never work again ”
Udall “ ran ” from the “ liberal ” label , Wadhams said , proof that he knew Colorado voters reject liberal philosophies .
Udall aides said he was n’t available for comment , but during the campaign , he said labels did n’t apply .
“ It ’s pretty hard to characterize me , ” he said in an early 2008 interview .
“ I see myself as an independent Western Democrat . ”
Former U.S. Sen .
Ben Nighthorse Campbell , a Colorado Republican , called it a mistake to rely on the “ liberal ” label as a weapon in the Senate race .
“ I do n’t think it works anymore .
It might never work again , ” Campbell said .
“ People are trying to look beyond the labels .
They want action .
They want change .
They want something to happen . ”
And while “ liberal ” is seen as equal to “ I take poison , ” in some Western Slope communities , Campbell said , moderates and Republicans in Denver and the suburbs do n’t recoil when someone says the word .
Despite failing to wound those at whom it was thrown this year , “ liberal ” still is n’t a positive word , said Robert Borosage , co-director of Campaign for America ’s Future , which calls itself “ the strategy center for the progressive movement . ”
“ It still polls more negative than positive when you ask people what you think of the word , ” Borosage said .
Most voters do n’t see themselves as liberal .
When Pew Research Center for People and the Press asked people to describe their ideology this year , 38 percent called themselves conservative , 35 percent said moderate and 21 percent said liberal .
But Rep. Diana DeGette , a Denver Democrat , argues that “ liberal ” has lost some of its negative meaning .
“ A generational shift ”
“ What you see in this election was really a generational shift , ” DeGette said .
Younger voters , she said , “ do n’t know about the negative connotations of ‘ liberal ’ because . . . the pejorative use of ‘ liberal ’ to mean big spending , morally lax , is just not true anymore . ”
Younger voters are more friendly toward the “ liberal ” label .
In NBC News exit polls after a Feb .
5 Democratic primary vote , 58 percent of voters ages 17 to 29 described themselves as liberal .
In the 30 - to - 44 age category , 51 percent said they were liberal .
But the word really did n’t work as epithet this year because the economy dominated as the issue voters cared about , Borosage said , and voters “ turned against the conservative policies that had failed . ”
“ It just did n’t have the force it might have once had , ” Borosage said .

An investigation has been launched into two police officers and a special constable who were caught on camera attacking a soldier .
CCTV footage shows Lance Corporal Mark Aspinall being punched on the floor by one officer while under restraint from two others .
Mr Aspinall , who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan , was set upon after a night out in his home town of Wigan , Lancashire , in July .
He was then charged and convicted on two counts of attacking police officers - until last week when he won an appeal at Liverpool Crown Court .
The turnaround has sparked an investigation with one officer 's duties already restricted .
Video source : YouTube / Sunday Mirror
Terry Sweeney , Assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police , said tonight : " Greater Manchester Police 's professional standards branch is investigating the conduct of the officers on the Wigan division .
" One officer has had his duties restricted and other two are being investigated .
" The matter has been voluntarily referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission , but an independent complaint has also been made . "
An IPCC spokesman said the investigation would be conducted under the watchdog 's " management , direction and control " .
The CCTV begins with Mr Aspinall - who admits he was drunk - standing unsteadily in the street and calling to the officers .
The trio run 10ft across the road at him and he falls over but jumps up .
An officer is seen rugby tackling the 24 - year - old who is pinned down by two officers while the third punches him several times .
Mr Aspinall , who returned from Afghanistan in February and was working his notice in the Army at the time of the attack , told the Sunday Mirror : " I went into the Army thinking this country was worth fighting for .
" I put my life on the line every day in Afghanistan , so to come back and be treated like this for no reason was just so depressing . "

Cable channel USA alienated at least one viewer with their queerly edited showing of cheerleading movie Bring It On .
From an “ enraged ” reader :
Imagine my delight , as a gym - procrastination measure , when I discovered that USA Networks was screening Bring It On ( in my opinion unjustly dissed by Entertainment Weekly with a lowly # 30 ranking in their list of 50 Best High School Movies ) last Saturday , Oct. 25 .
But my pleasure turned to self - righteous - letter - to - the - editor - writing rage when I realized that USA censors had degayed the sympathetic homo character , Les ( Above , left ) .
Not only did they remove the coming - out scene where he says he speaks fag “ fluently , ” but also the bit at the end where he meets another cute guy backstage at the nationals .
However , USA saw fit to leave the homophobic slurs ( Eliza Dushku being called a dyke , one straight jock calling another a fag ) intact .
I would be curious if Queerty could get a response from USA Networks as to why they made these editorial decisions .
Poor Christian Slater , just when we were applauding his gainful employment on My Own Worst Enemy NBC has pulled the plug on his split personality show .
No more shall we watch the character switcheroo from Henry to Edward , but more importantly now we 'll never know who killed his parents .
Sources have told the trades that the lackluster ratings were the cause of the cancellation .

Mr. Heebner ’s funds have not avoided the carnage this year .
The CGM Focus fund is down about 42 percent so far in 2008 .
But his long - term track record is impressive .
In the decade that ended Dec. 31 , 2007 , CGM Focus rose 26 percent a year , including reinvested dividends , making it among the best - performing mutual funds .
Mr. Heebner is not alone in his optimism .
“ I think in years to come  I would n’t say months to come  we will perceive this as being a great value - buying opportunity , ” said David P. Stowell , a finance professor at Northwestern and a former managing director at JPMorgan Chase .
“ Two and three years from now , it will seem very smart . ”

Even before their jaw - dropping plunge of the last month , stocks were not expensive by historical standards , based on fundamentals like earnings and cash flow .
Now , after falling 30 percent or more since early September , stocks in stalwart , profitable corporations like Nokia , Exxon Mobil and Boeing are trading at nine times their annual profits per share or less .
Many smaller companies are even cheaper .
Some of those stocks are trading at five times earnings or less .
Those ratios are historically low .
Over all , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index is trading at about 13 times its expected profits for 2009 , its lowest level in decades .
In contrast , at the height of the technology bubble in early 2000 , the stocks in the S.& P. traded at about 30 times earnings , the highest level ever .
At the same time , the 10 - year Treasury bond paid about 6 percent interest , compared with less than 4 percent today .
Investors have fled stocks in favor of government bonds , insured bank deposits and other low - risk investments because they are deeply afraid of the worldwide economic crisis , said Stephen Haber , an economic historian and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution .
But he said he believed that fear might have gone too far .
“ If there is good and wise policy , and government moves effectively , this need not play itself out in ways like the Great Depression , which is the image that is playing itself out in people ’s mind , ” Mr. Haber said .
Government action typically does not work immediately , and banking crises around the world often require multiple interventions , he said .
This is your world and only you have the power to change it .
ABSTRACT
Learning the structure of Bayesian networks ( BNs ) is known to be NP - complete and most of the recent work in the field is based on heuristics .
Many recent approaches to the problem trade correctness and exactness for faster computation and are still computationally infeasible , except for networks with few variables .
In this paper we present a software / hardware co-design approach to learning Bayesian networks from experimental data that is scalable to very large networks .
Our implementation improves the performance of algorithms that are traditionally developed based on the Von Neumann computing paradigm by more than four orders of magnitude .
Through parallel implementation and exploitation of the reconfigurability of Field Programmable Gate Array ( FPGA ) systems our design enables scientists to apply BN learning techniques to large problems such as studies in molecular biology where the number of variables in the system overwhelms any state of the art software implementations .
We describe how we combine Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) sampling with Bayesian network learning techniques as well as supervised learning methods in a parallel and scalable design .
We also present how our design is mapped and customized to run on the Berkeley Emulation Engine 2 ( BEE2 ) multi-FPGA system .
Experimental results are presented on synthetic data sets generated from standard Bayesian networks as well as a real life problem in the context of systems biology
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street ’s manic dealmaking reached a new pitch on Wednesday as U.S. share prices plummeted to three - year lows and forced increasingly desperate major banks to scramble for merger partners .
With the financial landscape undergoing its most dramatic transformation since the Great Depression , reports emerged of takeovers involving No. 2 U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley , weakened top U.S. savings bank Washington Mutual and major UK mortgage lender HBOS .
“ This is indicative of the changes that are shaking the foundation of the financial system in today ’s world , ” said Frank Husic , Managing Partner of Husic Capital Management in San Francisco .
The flurry of potential deals followed the surprise $ 85 billion rescue of insurer American International Group by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday that did little to calm investors ’ nerves .
“ Stop The Insanity , ” pleaded a research note from Swiss bank UBS as U.S. financial shares appeared to be in free - fall .
The U.S. stock market plunged 4.7 percent to a three - year low , the dollar slumped , while safe - haven U.S. Treasury bonds and gold soared .
The AIG rescue capped a week of bailouts , a bankruptcy on Wall Street and moves by central banks around the world to flood the financial system with funds to prevent it from seizing up .
The result : a seismic shift in the financial industry , with some of Wall Street ’s biggest names disappearing .
“ The fear is who is next , ” said John O’Brien , senior vice president at MKM Partners in Cleveland .
“ It almost feels like people scour the books and say who is the next likely target that we can put a short on .
And that spreads continuous fear . ”
DANCING PARTNERS
Shares of Morgan Stanley and larger rival Goldman fell as much as 43 percent and 27 percent respectively , even after both reported better - than - expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday .
That stoked talk Wall Street ’s two surviving investment banks may have to join up with a commercial bank to survive .
“ I ’m assuming that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are lining up dancing partners .
They do n’t want to be ... this week ’s victim , ” said William Larkin , fixed income manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem , Massachusetts .
The dance music picked up pace after the close of trading .
Morgan Stanley was discussing a merger with regional banking powerhouse Wachovia , the New York Times reported .
CEO John
Mack got a phone call from Wachovia on Wednesday but is also pursuing other options , the paper said .
“ In this market , anything ’s possible .
It seems like the market wants the investment banking model to disappear , ” said Danielle Schembri , a bond analyst covering brokers at BNP Paribas in New York .
Washington Mutual , beleaguered by mortgage losses , put itself up for sale , sources said .
Potential suitors include Citigroup , JPMorgan , Wells Fargo and HSBC , they added .
“ Everything is for sale in the banking world these days , ” said Ralph Cole , a portfolio manager at Ferguson , Wellman Capital Management in Portland , Oregon .
“ Washington Mutual should be shopping itself . ”

In Britain , top mortgage lender HBOS Plc struck an all - stock deal with Lloyds TSB to create a 28 billion pound ( $ 50 billion ) mortgage giant .
EMPTY SEATS
The White House said it was “ concerned about other companies ” while the U.S. presidential candidates struck populist tones , with John McCain blasting Wall Street ’s “ casino culture ” and Barack Obama stressing protection for mom-and - pop investors .
The objects of their ire were glued to their trading screens .
In the capital of the hedge fund industry , Greenwich , Connecticut , an industry conference for 500 people had 200 empty seats .

“ A lot of people who are seeing massive red ink and are suffering the most are not here , ” said Jean de Bolle , the chief investment officer at Byron Advisors .
The cost of protecting Morgan Stanley ’s and Goldman ’s debt spiked , reflecting investor fears their debt issues are no safer than junk bonds .
“ The credit crunch and credit contraction is intensifying , ” said Peter Boockvar , equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York .
“ The action in Morgan Stanley in light of what was better - than - expected numbers last night is disconcerting . ”
Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said the drop in his company ’s share price was “ the result of completely irrational fear and is not based on any fundamentals . ”
Morgan Stanley ’s Mack blamed short sellers , or investors who bet on falling stock prices , saying in an internal memo :
“ We ’re in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumors , and short sellers are driving our stock down . ”
PROPPING UP THE SYSTEM
In the latest example of regulatory action with little apparent effect , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission curbed short - selling .
“ Seems like the SEC is a day late on the rule ... Morgan Stanley is clearly in the short - sellers ’ sights , ” said Andrew Brenner , senior vice president at MF Global in New York .
New distress signals had popped up earlier .
The cost of borrowing overnight dollars spiked above 10 percent , indicating a deep lack of trust in the interbank lending market .
The HBOS merger talks underscored how quickly authorities around the world are ditching long - held beliefs about free markets as they struggle to counter the credit crunch .
Lloyds was previously blocked from buying a smaller mortgage bank , and the British government shocked investors by taking over troubled bank Northern Rock in February -- the country ’s first major nationalization since the 1970s .
U.S. authorities already have spent $ 900 billion to prop up the financial system and housing market .
Authorities may get much of that money back -- if asset prices do not slide further .
The AIG rescue came just over a week after the bailout of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and six months after the Fed brokered the sale of failed investment bank Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase .
Two legendary firms bit the dust over the weekend .
Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch & Co CEO John
Thain struck a deal to sell out to Bank of America Corp .
“ Thain at Merrill Lynch did a very smart thing ... in keeping shareholders from being swallowed up by this vortex , ” said Jeffrey Gundlach , chief investment officer at bond manager Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles .

One bailout was not enough for Citigroup .
And it may not be enough for other big banks .
While Citigroup ’s second multibillion - dollar rescue from Washington hit Wall Street like a shot of adrenaline on Monday , many analysts worried that the jolt would soon wear off .
Citigroup has been stabilized , but the outlook for the financial industry as a whole is bleak .
With the red ink deepening , other banks may eventually turn to the government to soak up some of their losses .
Taxpayers could end up guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of banks ’ toxic assets .
Indeed , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is expected to announce a new plan on Tuesday to bolster the consumer - finance market .
“ When all else fails , government does come in , ” said David A. Moss , a public policy professor at Harvard Business School .
On Monday , Wall Street put aside its worries , at least for a day .
Citigroup ’s share price , which had plunged to a mere $ 3.77 on Friday , shot up to $ 5.95 .
Shares of its biggest rivals  banks which , with the government ’s help , are emerging to dominate the industry  also soared .
Bank of America jumped 27 percent , JPMorgan Chase leapt 21 percent and Wells Fargo gained nearly 20 percent .

Puncturing the Acupuncture Myth
by Harriet Hall , M.D.
By definition , “ alternative ” medicine consists of treatments that have not been scientifically proven and that have not been accepted into mainstream medicine .
The question I keep hearing is , “ But what about acupuncture ?
It ’s been proven to work , it ’s supported by lots of good research , more and more doctors are using it , and insurance companies even pay for it . ”
It ’s time the acupuncture myth was punctured — preferably with an acupuncture needle .
Almost everything you ’ve heard about acupuncture is wrong .
To start with , this ancient Chinese treatment is not so ancient and may not even be Chinese !
From studying the earliest documents , Chinese scholar Paul Unschuld suspects the idea may have originated with the Greek Hippocrates of Cos and later spread to China .
It ’s definitely not 3000 years old .
The earliest Chinese medical texts , from the 3rd century BCE , do not mention it .
The earliest reference to “ needling ” is from 90 BCE , but it refers to bloodletting and lancing abscesses with large needles or lancets .
There is nothing in those documents to suggest anything like today ’s acupuncture .
We have the archaeological evidence of needles from that era — they are large ; the technology for manufacturing thin steel needles appropriate for acupuncture did n’t exist until about 400 years ago .
The earliest accounts of Chinese medicine reached the West in the 13th century : they did n’t mention acupuncture at all .
The first Westerner to write about acupuncture , Wilhelm ten Rhijn , in 1680 , did n’t describe acupuncture as we know it today : he did n’t mention specific points or “ qi ; ” he spoke of large gold needles that were implanted deep into the skull or “ womb ” and left in place for 30 respirations .
Acupuncture was tried off and on in Europe after that .
It was first tried in America in 1826 as a possible means of resuscitating drowning victims .
They could n’t get it to work and “ gave up in disgust . ”
I imagine sticking needles in soggy dead bodies was pretty disgusting .
Through the early 20th century , no Western account of acupuncture referred to acupuncture points : needles were simply inserted near the point of pain .
Qi was originally vapor arising from food , and meridians were channels or vessels .
A Frenchman , Georges Soulie de Morant , was the first to use the term “ meridian ” and to equate qi with energy — in 1939 .
Auricular ( ear ) acupuncture was invented by a Frenchman in 1957 .
The Chinese government tried to ban acupuncture several times , between 1822 and World War II during the time of the Chinese Nationalist government .
Mao revived it in the “ barefoot doctor ” campaign in the 1960s as a cheap way of providing care to the masses ; he did not use it himself because he did not believe it worked .
It was Mao ’s government that coined the term “ traditional Chinese medicine ” or TCM .
In 1972 James Reston accompanied Nixon to China and returned to tell about his appendectomy .
It was widely believed that his appendix was removed under acupuncture anesthesia .
In reality , acupuncture was used only as an adjunct for pain relief the day after surgery , and the relief was probably coincident with the expected return of normal bowel motility .
A widely circulated picture of a patient allegedly undergoing open heart surgery with acupuncture anesthesia was shown to be bogus .
If acupuncture is used in surgery today , it is used along with conventional anesthesia and / or pre-operative medication , and it is selected only for patients who believe in it and are likely to have a placebo response .
As acupuncture increased in popularity in the West , it declined in the East .
In 1995 , visiting American physicians were told only 15 – 20 % of Chinese chose TCM , and it was usually used along with Western treatments after diagnosis by a Western - trained physician .
Apparently some patients choose TCM because it is all they can afford : despite being a Communist country , China does not have universal health coverage .
There were originally 360 acupuncture points ( loosely based on the number of days in a year rather than on anatomy ) .
Currently more than 2000 acupuncture points have been “ discovered ” , leading one wag to comment that there was no skin left that was not an acupuncture point .
There were either 9 , 10 , or 11 meridians — take your pick .
Any number is as good as another , because no research has ever been able to document the existence of acupuncture points or meridians or qi .
Does acupuncture work ?
Which type of acupuncture ?
And what do you mean by “ work ” ?
There are various different Chinese systems , plus Japanese , Thai , Korean and Indian modalities , most of which have been invented over the last few decades : whole body or limited to the scalp , hand , ear , foot , or cheek and chin ; deep or superficial ; with electrified needles ; with dermal pad electrodes and no skin penetration .
Acupuncture works in the same manner that placebos work .
It has been shown to “ work ” to relieve pain , nausea , and other subjective symptoms , but it has never been shown to alter the natural history or course of any disease .
Today it ’s mostly used for pain , but early Chinese acupuncturists maintained that it was not for the treatment of manifest disease , that it was so subtle that it should only be employed at the very beginning of a disease process , and that it was only likely to work if the patient believed it would work .
Now there ’s a bit of ancient wisdom !
Studies have shown that acupuncture releases natural opioid pain relievers in the brain : endorphins .
Veterinarians have pointed out that loading a horse into a trailer or throwing a stick for a dog also releases endorphins .
Probably hitting yourself on the thumb with a hammer would release endorphins too , and it would take your mind off your headache .
Psychologists can list plenty of other things that could explain the apparent response to acupuncture .
Diverting attention from original symptoms to the sensation of needling , expectation , suggestion , mutual consensus and compliance demand , causality error , classic conditioning , reciprocal conditioning , operant conditioning , operator conditioning , reinforcement , group consensus , economic and emotional investment , social and political disaffection , social rewards for believing , variable course of disease , regression to the mean — there are many ways human psychology can fool us into thinking ineffective treatments are effective .
Then there ’s the fact that all placebos are not equal — an elaborate system involving lying down , relaxing , and spending time with a caring authority can be expected to produce a much greater placebo effect than simply taking a sugar pill .
There are plenty of studies showing that acupuncture works for subjective symptoms like pain and nausea .
But there are several things that throw serious doubt on their findings .
The results are inconsistent , with some studies finding an effect and others not .
The higher quality studies are less likely to find an effect .
Most of the studies are done by believers in acupuncture .
Many subjects would not volunteer for an acupuncture trial unless they had a bias towards believing it might work .
The acupuncture studies coming from China and other oriental countries are all positive — but then nearly everything coming out of China is positive .
It ’s not culturally acceptable to publish negative results because researchers would lose face and their jobs .
The biggest problem with acupuncture studies is finding an adequate placebo control .
You ’re sticking needles in people .
People notice that .
Double blinding is impossible : you might be able to fool patients into thinking you ’ve used a needle when you have n’t , but there ’s no way to blind the person doing the needling .
Two kinds of controls have been used : comparing acupuncture points to non-points , and using an ingenious needle in a sheath that appears to have penetrated the skin when it has n’t .
In George Ulett ’s research , he found that applying an electrical current to the skin of the wrist — a kind of TENS ( transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ) treatment — worked just as well as inserting needles , and one point on the wrist worked for symptoms anywhere in the body .
Guess what ?
It does n’t matter where you put the needle .
It does n’t matter whether you use a needle at all .
In the best controlled studies , only one thing mattered : whether the patients believed they were getting acupuncture .
If they believed they got the real thing , they got better pain relief — whether they actually got acupuncture or not !
If they got acupuncture but believed they did n’t , it did n’t work .
If they did n’t get it but believed they did , it did work .
Acupuncturists have used ingenious rationalizations to try to salvage failed studies .
In a recent study using sham acupuncture as a control , both the sham placebo acupuncture and the true acupuncture worked equally well ; both were better than no treatment .
The obvious conclusion was that acupuncture was no better than a placebo .
Instead , the researchers insisted that real acupuncture worked and that placebo acupuncture worked too !
Another acupuncture researcher recently decided not to use a placebo control in his research because any stimulation of the skin might be effective — which seems to me to pretty much destroy the whole rationale for acupuncture , but he did n’t seem to notice that .
If that were true , we could just caress or massage our patients instead of inserting needles and postulating imaginary qi and meridians .
Considering the inconsistent research results , the implausibility of qi and meridians , and the many questions that remain , it ’s reasonable to conclude that acupuncture is nothing more than a recipe for an elaborate placebo seasoned with a soupçon of counter - irritant .
You can play human pincushion if you want , and you might get a good placebo response , but there ’s no evidence you ’ll get anything more .

It ’s well worth a visit ; it includes great pictures of camelpuncture , goatpuncture , and chickenpuncture .
In some neighborhoods in the southeast , prices have dropped by 10 to 40 percent .
In other parts of the country , transactions have fallen , but prices have only started to follow .
For instance , the number of home sales has plunged by two - thirds in Harbin in the northeast , though prices are down as little as 4 percent from the same period last year .
“ People are thinking more carefully and taking much longer before they decide to buy or not to buy property , ” said Hwang Sha , a real estate broker in Xiamen in east - central China .
Cities deep in China ’s interior are least affected .
Dan Yian , a real estate agent in Chongqing , the largest city in southwestern China , said that the volume of housing transactions there had slowed by 20 to 30 percent so far this year .
But prices have not yet fallen from a stable level of $ 730 a square meter , or 10.76 square feet , which works out to nearly $ 66,000 for a typical apartment of about 970 square feet .
Export - dependent coastal cities in mainland China have had the steepest downturns in their real estate markets .
Some of those problems are starting to make ripples elsewhere in Asia .
Freddy
Wu , the chief executive of Hong Kong Property Services , said his real estate agency had seen mainland investors default in recent months on a tenth of their purchases of Hong Kong apartments , forfeiting the down payments that they made .
“ A lot of investors from China have their cash tied up in the mainland stock market and in mainland real estate , so they would rather take a loss now , ” instead of being forced to sell mainland investments at a loss to come up with the cash to complete purchases in Hong Kong , Mr. Wu said .
Eugene Hibbs , a semiretired computer programmer in Santa Barbara , Calif. , has thrown in the towel on the markets .
" I just do n't have the stomach for it anymore , " says Mr. Hibbs , 66 years old .
At the beginning of the year , he was entirely invested in stocks .
As stocks sank , he moved into commodities .
Then commodities investments began deteriorating , ...
Naomi Klein : Bailout is ' multi-trillion - dollar crime scene ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The Bush administration has already handed out almost half of the $ 700 billion in bank bailout money authorized by Congress but has not even filled the mandated oversight positions to review how it is being used .
Naomi Klein , author of The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , has described the handling of the bailout as " borderline criminal " because of this and other problems .
Klein spoke to Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! on Monday to explain her accusations .
" We were all reassured that there was going to be transparency , accountability , legality , " Klein stated .
" But now we re finding out that , in fact , Henry Paulson has achieved his original goal by stealth , because there is no accountability , and lawmakers are very hesitant to challenge this .
...
Essentially , what the Bush administration has done is said , ' We dare you to challenge us and be responsible for the Great Depression . ' "
Klein sees three areas of borderline illegality .
The first is that rather than being used to get banks lending again , the bailout money " is instead going to bonuses , is instead going to dividends , going to salaries , going to mergers . "
The second is that , without Congressional authorization , " the Treasury Department pushed through a tax windfall for the banks , a piece of legislation that allows the banks to save a huge amount of money when they merge with each other .
And the estimate is that this represents a loss of $ 140 billion worth of tax revenue for the US government . "
The third problem , which dwarfs the $ 700 billion bailout itself , is that " theres another $ 2 trillion that s been handed out by the Federal Reserve in emergency loans to financial institutions , to banks , that actually we dont really know who they re handing the money out to , because , apparently , its a secret . "
" If the Fed has accepted distressed assets as collateral in exchange for these loans , " stated Klein , " theres a very good chance the taxpayers arent going to be getting this money back .
...
So thats why were calling this the ' trillion - dollar crime scene ' or the ' multi- trillion - dollar crime scene . ' "
Klein argued that Congress should be challenging violations of the bailout legislation , but instead " what they re saying is , we cant afford to enforce the law ... that somehow , because theres an economic crisis , legality is a luxury that Congress cant afford . "
" Im quite concerned , " Klein stated , " that what were seeing from Obamas team is an accepting of this logic that they need to give the market what it wants , which is continuity , smooth transition , which is really just code for more of the same .
... I think we should question all of it .
Across the board , I think the assumptions are faulty . "
Klein is also concerned that rather than using the crisis as a mandate to fix the underlying problems , the world leaders at the recent G20 summit were talking about propping up the old system .
" Think about what these leaders could do if they really wanted to , " Klein suggested .
" When you have a crisis like this , which so clearly shows the need for those types of regulations , when you have an election like there just was in the United States , where people have said clearly that this is a priority , the leaders have an opportunity to act .
...
But they blew that opportunity , and they actually called for less regulation . "
" This crisis is nt over , " Klein warned , " and the same people who justified this bailout , who clamored for this bailout , are the very people who are going to turn around and say to Barack Obama , ' We cant afford for you to make good on your election promises .
We cant afford universal healthcare . ' "
" The money has been given to the people who needed it least , and its going to be used to justify austerity measures imposed against those who need it most , " Klein concluded .
" It s going to be used to justify cuts to food stamps .
It s going to be used to justify cuts to Social Security , to health care , let alone being used to justify why more ambitious plans for a national health care program , for green energy are not affordable .
So people have to be ready for this .
You know , the next shock is yet to come . "

Tim Streeter came home from work on Thursday and did what he usually does -- check the voice mails on his phone at his Edina home .
A woman 's voice on the line told him Democratic nominee Barack Obama associated with " domestic terrorist " William Ayers , who " killed Americans . "
She warned about Obama 's " extreme leftist agenda " and hung up after leaving the Washington number for the Republican National Committee .
" It 's very disturbing that the campaign has gotten to the point where the Republicans have sunk this low to suggest Obama consorts with murderers , " said Streeter , who identified himself as an Obama supporter .
Like thousands of others on Thursday , Streeter had been robo- called , Minnesota - style .
Ordinarily , a robo - call is one in which a potential voter is called at home by an automatic dialer and is spoken to by a recorded voice .
Phone calls of that kind , 32 seconds long , spread throughout the country following Republican nominee John McCain 's comments during a debate Wednesday about Ayers , a former Weather Underground member , and his relationship with Obama .
In Minnesota , however , according to McCain campaign officials , calls like the one Streeter received were made with actual people on the other line .
It is against a 1987 Minnesota law to use robo - calling unless it is preceded by a live operator .
Without revealing how many calls were made or how long they will last , McCain campaign officials said they complied with state law , even with actual costs of a live call ranging from 20 to 30 cents apiece , about 10 times the cost of a recorded call .
" We made the calls , and they were all live , " said McCain regional political director Ben Golnik .
' It 's that time of year '
Under the headline , " Wave Of McCain Robocalls Reported , Some May Violate State Law , " the left - leaning online website the Huffington Post said several readers from Minnesota reported receiving the calls and questioned whether they were illegal .
( Adds comment from Apple ; quotes from Papermaster ’s court filing )
SAN FRANCISCO , Nov 5 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. District Court judge in New York ordered a newly hired Apple Inc AAPL.
O executive to stop work immediately because he might be violating an agreement with his former employer , IBM IBM.N .
Federal District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains ordered that Mark Papermaster “ immediately cease his employment with Apple Inc until further order of this court . ”
Apple announced on Tuesday that Papermaster would lead the engineering teams making Apple ’s highly successful iPods and iPhones and that he would report directly to Chief Executive Steve Jobs .
On Friday it said he would cease work for now .
“ We will comply with the court ’s order but are confident that Mark Papermaster will be able to ultimately join Apple when the dust settles , ” a spokesman said .
Karas said Papermaster could submit any objections to his order by Tuesday and he set another hearing for Nov. 18 .
Papermaster had worked for IBM for 25 years .
IBM said in a court filing that , before Papermaster left , he agreed to avoid working for any competitor for a year .
Papermaster ’s lawyers argued that forcing him “ to ‘ sit out ’ of the electronics industry for a year would be incredibly damaging to his career . ”
They said that Apple was a “ once - in - a - lifetime ‘ dream job ’ ” and that Papermaster would be unable to return to IBM , given the litigation .
Papermaster also argued that there were signficant differences between between the two companies because IBM makes big machines for big business and Apple makes little devices for consumers .
IBM disagreed .
“ Electronic devices large and small are powered by the same type of intelligence , the microprocessor , ” IBM argued .

The head of his transition team said the President - elect wanted to make genuine efforts to reach out across the parties .
John Podesta , a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton , said Republicans and independents would be in Mr Obama ’s cabinet and lower - level jobs at “ not just a token level ” .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The news came as Mr Obama revealed he had asked two leading Democrat and a Republican figures to meet delegates on his behalf at the G20 financial summit in Washington at the weekend .
Madeleine Albright , Secretary of State under Mr Clinton , and Jim Leach , a former Republican congressman , will represent him during the talks .
Denis McDonough , a senior foreign policy adviser to Mr Obama , said : “ There is one President at a time in the United States , so the President - elect has asked Secretary Albright and Congressman Leach , an experienced and bipartisan team , to be available meet with and listen to our friends and allies on his behalf . ”
Among the Republicans under consideration for senior posts in the cabinet are Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana , a possible Secretary of State , Colin Powell , being looked at for Pentagon chief or Education Secretary , and Robert Gates , who could be kept on at the Pentagon .
Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , a Vietnam veteran who has lambasted President George W. Bush for his conduct of the Iraq war , is also a possible Republican in the 14 - member cabinet .

Airline travel is down , grocery stores are giving away free turkeys to get customers in the door , and everybody is looking for ways to economize this Thanksgiving .
But before you decide to save money by buying a jug of Riunite instead of an expensive wine , consider serving your guests American craft beers with dinner this year .
Most discerning food lovers are much happier drinking good beer than cheap wine anyway .
And there are more great American beers to choose from the ever before .
Julia Herz , Craft Beer Program Director for the Brewers Association , recommends Oktoberfest amber lagers with Thanksgiving dinner .
The " gentle malt notes of this style harmonize well with gravy and toasted turkey skin , " she says .
Shiner 's Bohemian Black Lager is n't a bad choice either .
" Personally I like Saint Arnold 's Brown Ale or Christmas Ale with the main course at Thanksgiving , " says Saint Arnold Brewery founder Brock Wagner .
" I find that the malty notes do well with the turkey , stuffing and gravy .
But if there is any cranberry sauce involved , then it 's definitely the Christmas Ale . "
When eating turkey breast all by itself the day after Thanksgiving , Wagner recommends the crisp clean flavor of Saint Arnold 's " Fancy Lawnmower , " a German Kolsch Beer .
Serving small glasses of lots of different beers is the best way to complement a extensive feast like Thanksgiving dinner , some brewers say .
Dessert beer suggestions include Shiner Holiday Cheer , a seasonal brew with peach and pecan flavors , Sam Adams Chocolate Bock , and Stone Brewing Company Chocolate Oatmeal Stout .
Everyone agrees that on an all - American holiday like Thanksgiving , the beers should be American , not imports .
You 'll find more suggestions at Beertown , the website of the Brewer 's Association , as well as an extensive list of seasonal beers and suggested food pairings at www.seasonalbeerandfood.org.

A PREGNANT woman who knows her unborn child has Down ’s syndrome might one day be able to prevent some symptoms before giving birth .
That at least is the hope raised by experiments in mice .
When fetal mouse pups that had a syndrome similar to Down ’s were treated with nerve - protecting chemicals , some of the developmental delays that are part of the condition were removed .
Children with Down ’s have an extra copy of chromosome 21 , while mice engineered to have a similar condition are given an extra copy of a segment of chromosome 16 .
In both species , the development of certain motor and sensory abilities is delayed .

This A Monroe , Louisiana man is facing a felony terrorizing charge after a racially charged , profane exchange with his Registrar of Voters and police officers who would later arrest him .
75 - year - old Wade Williams , arrested Wednesday morning , was angry that he had n't yet received his voter registration card .
According to the Ouachita Parish Sheriff 's Office , Williams threatened a state official over the phone that he would " empty his shotgun , " stating an urgent need to vote to " keep the nigger out of office . "
On the way to be booked at the Ouachita Correctional Center , Williams reportedly " continued his ' tirade ' about niggers and also stated that he had a shotgun , but had hidden it at his residence . "
The affidavit also states that Williams was informed over the phone that he would be able to vote simply by showing a form of identification at the polling place .
No specific political candidate was named in the affidavit , available to view at The Smoking Gun .
Standing in a sandbox on the lawn of the cemetery at Resurrection Catholic Community in Aptos are thousands of figurines representing Americans and Iraqis killed during the war that began in March 2003 .
The 4,190 small white clay figures , each holding a U.S. flag , represent dead American soldiers .
The 92,000 dark clay figures , behind the Americans like a shadow , represent Iraqis .
The installation ’s creator , artist Kathleen Crocetti , started the project 4 ﻿ 1 / 2 years ago , and thought it would be an appropriate memorial on Veterans Day .
“ I ’m doing this to help people visualize the number of people killed in the Iraq war .
We need a physical connection to that number , ” said Crocetti , a Watsonville resident .
“ I thought we went into the war under false pretenses , and I ca n’t sanction pre-emptive war . ”
Each figure is handmade and fired in a kiln that Crocetti , an art teacher at Mission Hill Middle School in Santa Cruz , has at home .
In the beginning , she crafted each figure herself .
However , once the numbers started climbing significantly , she called on the community to help .
Now , she hosts workshops so the public can help make the clay bodies and keep up with the growing number of deaths .
As long as the war continues , she ’ll continue adding to the body count .
“ I feel such shame and sadness in my name as an American , ” she said .
“ I feel responsible for the pain and grief because of this war . ”
Crocetti said she drew the number of dead civilians from www.iraqbody count.org , an organization that tracks civilian war deaths .
The war memorial will stay up at Resurrection until Dec. 7 .

Two clones produced in the study survived to adulthood Japanese scientists have managed to create clones from the bodies of mice which have been frozen for 16 years .
Cloning has largely been done using just live donor cells , transferring their DNA to recipient eggs .
Using previously frozen cells runs the risk of ice damage to the DNA unless carefully handled .
The scientists in Kobe , Japan , said their technique raised the possibility of recreating extinct creatures , such as mammoth , from their frozen remains .
Many of the successful clones since Dolly the sheep was born in 1996 have been created by a method where the nucleus of a cell has been removed , placed in an empty egg and kick - started into replicating by chemicals or electricity .
It is not the only cloning technique , and Australian researchers reported cloning a pig in 2001 from cells that had been frozen for two years .
The Adelaide - based team said its cloning method differed from the Dolly approach in important respects .
Frozen bodies
The Japanese research was undertaken at Kobe 's Centre for Developmental Biology and is reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The work extends the time frozen material can be held before it is used to clone an animal .
Pigs have been cloned using frozen material before now The scientists said they created their mice from the brain cells of rodents that had been kept in laboratory conditions at - 20C .
Obviously , these are ideal conditions - far removed from the uncontrolled conditions of the Siberian steppe where mammoth remains dating back 40,000 years have emerged from the permafrost .
DNA previously removed from such animals has been found to be highly degraded .
Even if good material were available major obstacles would have to be overcome before such a technique could be used on extinct or even endangered animals - such as finding a suitable species to provide recipient eggs and surrogate mothers .
The donor genetic material came from animals stored at - 20C for 16 years
Professor John Armitage is director of tissue banking at the Bristol Eye Hospital , UK .
He commented : " Mitochondrial and some nuclear DNA fragments have previously been isolated from mammoths frozen in permafrost , but the key question is whether sufficiently intact nuclei could be extracted from mammoth cells , which will have been frozen for at least 10,000 years at relatively high sub -zero temperatures .
Professor Armitage added : " - 20 C , the temperature at which the mice used in these experiments were stored , is insufficient to stop physical and chemical reactions of biological significance - even food in a domestic freezer has a limited storage time based on changing texture and taste .
" To achieve long - term storage of viable cells , including embryos , requires far lower temperatures of at least - 140C in the presence of cryoprotectants . "
It is conceivable the techniques being developed might have some application in future stem cell therapies in humans where a cloning process was used to generate particular tissues for transplantation .
Viable eggs , sperm and embryos are already retrieved from the frozen state for use in in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .

The video game world received a shock when Microsoft Game Studios announced that it would be closing down Ensemble Studios after the completion of Halo Wars .
Apparently , we were n't the only ones who were surprised , as Ensemble 's Bruce Shelley has explained that the studio had no idea that the move was coming .
" Everyone at our studio was shocked , and I think remains very disappointed that this is going to happen , " Shelley wrote on his blog .
" I believe we thought we were immune to shut - down talk because our published games have done so well and have been so profitable .
Plus we felt we had built a really stable ( low - turnover ) , talented , hard - working , and creative team , which is not easy to do .
We thought we were among the best studios in the world , and that may be true , but we do n’t fit in the future plans of MGS as an internal studio , so we ’re out . "
He then went on to reiterate what MGS has said previously , that Ensemble was closed for purely financial reasons .
Apparently , Ensemble is the most expensive first - party studio to run per-person , and this was one of the major deciding factors .
Shelley did say , however , that a new studio will be formed soon after the impending closing .
" Studio head Tony Goodman has a plan to start a new independent studio following the end of ES and a number of the existing ES employees have been offered a position in this company , " he explained .
" He felt he had to get a plan for that in place ... so that all employees can know where they stand and begin making plans for their futures .
I believe the spirit and mission of ES will be carried forward in this new company if enough of the key leaders agree to take part , which I expect to happen . "
While it 's sad to see a great studio close its doors , it looks as though the core of Ensemble will be staying together with the formation of this new studio .
Unfortunately , it looks as though Shelley — who was one the key creators behind the Age of Empires franchise — will not be joining them .
" I do not expect to be part of the new company formed after ES is shut down . "

Mid-Year Trend Review 2020
Halfway through one of the most unpredictable years in history , we review the biggest trends to dominate 2020 so far ...
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Former media baron Conrad Black is seeking a pardon from U.S. President George W. Bush in a last - ditch effort to get out of jail early , the Globe and Mail reported on Thursday , citing sources familiar with the matter .
Black , a Canadian - born member of Britain ’s House of Lords , has been in prison since March , when he began serving a 6 - 1/ 2 year sentence for defrauding shareholders of one - time newspaper publishing giant Hollinger International Inc .
Black ’s lawyers recently submitted legal bills to his former publishing company , some of which referred to work done in pursuit of a clemency plea , the Globe and Mail said .
Under the U.S. Constitution , the president can grant pardons and shorten sentences .
The push for clemency comes after a federal appeals court unanimously upheld Black ’s conviction this summer .
Black and three ex-colleagues were accused of swindling the company -- once the world ’s third largest publisher of English - language newspapers -- out of $ 6.1 million by giving themselves illegal bonuses .

Be very afraid of the “ D ” word now making the rounds in economic circles .
Today the Federal Reserve hinted that we are now tipping into the prospect of deflation .
This is very bad from their perspective .
In fact , it is a horrifying prospect for the Federal Reserve since every action they have taken in this decade has had the desired outcome of inflation .
Why would the Fed want inflation ?
Inflation would make our structured debts cheaper as time goes by since the price level of most items in the economy would rise and the debt would remain static .
First , let us get our definitions clear .
Inflation in the mainstream media is normally associated with a general price rise of items and goods in the economy .
Conversely , deflation would be a general price drop in items in the overall economy .
Many people from the classical school of economics or Austrian school refer to inflation or deflation when the money supply and credit move up and down .
For our purposes , we will refer to the mainstream reference since most people are familiar with this and generally speaking in most normal times they usually go hand and hand .
Deflation is a troubling prospect especially for a society with so much debt .
Why ?
What happens during a deflation is debts brought onto the books during high priced times are now more expensive as the general cost of other items in the economy goes lower .
This is exactly what is occurring .
Take a look at the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) which just showed the largest one month drop on record :
The CPI measures a basket of consumer goods bought in our economy .
This one month drop was enormous as you can see from the chart above but was largely due to the drop in fuel costs .
Energy dropped a stunning 9 % while transportation dropped 6 % :
The fact that the Fed is only acknowledging this publicly now is a complete misnomer to the public .
The true reality is that they were wishing deep down that inflation would make its way into the economy by the historical rate cuts and also , the injection of off balance sheet purchases .
Take a look at the growth in the Fed ’s balance sheet :
Keep in mind this is only based on depository institutions which are supposedly the safest of the safe .
That puts us well over $ 600 billion in that quick jump you see above .
If we throw in non-depository institutions the number jumps to over $ 2 trillion .
Now take a look at the Fed funds rate .
We are now back to 1 % .
All these actions at their heart are to get credit flowing into the system and get people to spend .
The idea of course is to get people to spend but how are they going to spend money they do not have or have allocated to servicing current debts ?
The only bullet left in the chamber is for the U.S. government to start literally printing money .
With the amount of debt we have , this is not a good idea .
So why have n’t these actions helped recently ?
Well , people are essentially maxed out .
Let us take a look at total debt outstanding :
Americans are at the end of the rope with debt .
With over $ 14 trillion in household debt outstanding , we now have as much household debt as our annual GDP !
And keep in mind GDP is contracting so it may be the case by the end of the year that there is more debt than actual GDP .
Deflation will do this because of the destruction of money .
Let us now look at 5 areas that have been seeing deflation for a long time .
Area # 1 – Housing
Nothing highlights the deflationary menace like declining home prices .
In fact , it can be argued that every foreclosure that occurs is deflation in action .
The lender no longer has the prospect of collecting the face value of the loan .
Therefore , they have to writedown the loss .
Which leads to even more cheaper homes on the market .
It becomes a vicious feedback loop .
As you can see from the Case - Shiller 10 composite , housing prices are clearly declining .
There is heavy deflation occurring in this sector .
Home prices are now down 22 % from their peak .
That is a significant drop in prices .
The issue that makes deflation more ominous is this .
It creates hoarding behavior .
After all , why would you buy a home today when chances are that in one year , it will be cheaper .
It gives an incentive for people to save and not consume .
That can be a problem when 71 % of our economy depends on consumption .
Area # 2 – Automobile Costs
This is probably the most significant story in the mainstream media at the moment .
The prospect that the big 3 automakers are on the verge of bankruptcy .
For the most part , much of their problems are self - initiated .
They were riding high when gas was low and the demand for gigantic trucks and SUVs seemed to be insatiable .
Well that bubble of course has also burst .
Many times , you can find these cars now selling on Craigslist for insane prices .
Take a look at this 2004 Escalade selling for $ 18,000 :
This thing sold for nearly $ 40,000 brand new .
That is deflation .
There are many other cases like this on eBay as well .
You can also look above at the CPI report and see that transportation costs for the last 3 months are running at a jaw dropping - 28.9 % compounded per year .
That is simply incredible .
This of course wo n’t continue forever but the big 3 automakers have saddled themselves with manufacturing equipment for vehicles that are dropping in price on a daily basis .
Area # 3 – Fuel
Gas prices have fallen off a cliff .
From a peak of $ 147 a barrel we are now hovering in the $ 50s only a few months later .
This has sent a shock in many world markets like Russia that are heavily dependent on oil revenues .
Some have tried to say this is a good thing and it is but not for the right reasons .
It would be one thing if prices fell in good economic times .
Prices have fallen because of demand destruction .
Demand destruction from where ?
Americans are traveling less and buying more fuel efficient cars .
Gas is now half off in a few short months .
This is another sign of deflationary forces .
You can expect this to be passed on to prices at the grocery store .
You will also see this in products at retail outlets .
Retailers are already in a fury to cut prices to attract consumers .
This will only feed that cycle again .
Look at what occurred with Circuit City and Mervyns .
Fuel dropping like this is simply another deflationary sign .
Area # 4 – Wages
Wages have remained stagnant throughout this decade .
The median income for an American household is $ 46,000 .
After taxes that is not much .
Given the cost of homes in many metro areas that would eat up a major part of take home pay for any household .
Add in the absurd prices of automobiles and you essentially have a small chunk left for food and utilities .
And one thing that is insanely deflationary for wages is unemployment .
Unemployment is flying off the charts :
The rate now stands at a 14 year high and only shows more signs of increasing .
The intense market volatility , which is not a sign of health , is only assuring us of more layoffs for at least for 1 or 2 years possibly more .
There is nothing more deflationary than unemployment .
In addition , many state governments have already frozen yearly pay increases and have already implemented hiring freezes and are laying workers off .
Citi announced layoffs of 52,000 people this week .
This is more signs of deflationary forces .
Area # 5 – Commodities
Finally , commodities are dropping like a rock .
Once thought to be a saving grace these areas are now collapsing .
Take a look at oil .
Gold has fallen from the peak above $ 1,000 to the current $ 740 an ounce price .
Let us take a look at a few markets :
Taking a look at these markets , you wonder why in the world was anyone even worrying about inflation .
It is true that many of these actions may in the far future lead to inflation but at the moment , there is one clear winner and that is deflation .
We are clearly in a deflationary spiral much like the one that occurred during the Great Depression .
That is why the stock markets now reached new lows and are all off nearly 50 % in one year .
That is a crash .
No doubt about that .
Yet the stock markets are only following in lockstep with housing , autos , fuel , commodities , and wages .
We are really in uncharted waters .

Obama campaign expects ' nastiest attacks ' from McCain at debate RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday October 7 , 2008
Print This Email This When Barack Obama meets John McCain in Nashville for Tuesday night 's debate , his campaign expects the GOP candidate to unveil some of the " nastiest attacks " that have been seen so far , according to an expectations - setting memo an Obama adviser released Tuesday morning .
" In order to change the dynamics of this race , we anticipate that McCain will launch his nastiest attacks and continue to lie about Barack Obamas record and his vision to fundamentally change our country , " Bill Burton , Obama - Biden press secretary , wrote in a memo to reporters .
" We dont know if McCain will continue his refusal to even look at Obama on stage -- like in their first debate -- but we fully expect that his ' turn the page ' strategy to ignore the economy will be seen in full view for 90 minutes of character attacks against Barack Obama . "
Burton 's memo notes that Tuesday night 's town hall format plays to McCain 's strengths and argues the Republican is " running out of time " to change the dynamics of the race .
He accused McCain of resorting to smears because he is unable to offer solutions on the economy .
Burton also noted a McCain aide 's observation Monday that , " If we keep talking about the economic crisis , we 're going to lose . "
Obama 's campaign this week released a 13 - minute " documentary " attacking McCain 's involvement in the Keating 5 , a group of senators who pressured federal regulators to back off during the savings & loan crisis of the late 1980s .
Burton 's memo seemed to indicate that that line of attack would n't come up during Tuesday 's debate , though .
" In the face of those attacks , Barack Obama will continue to offer steady leadership , and talk about his plan to give real relief to the middle class and create good jobs here in America , " Burton wrote .

RE : The Town Hall Presidential Debate
DA : October 7 , 2008
When are you going to take the gloves off ?  a John McCain supporter wanted to know this afternoon .
 How about Tuesday night ? 
McCain replied , grinning and looking ahead to his crucial second debate with Democrat Barack Obama . 
[ Washington Post , 10/2/08 ]
John McCain is running out of time for a game - changing event .
In the latest sign of desperation , his campaign admitted just yesterday that if they keep talking about the economic crisis , they re going to lose . 
It s our view that the American people are already worried about losing  their homes , their jobs and their health care  and its up to the candidates at this debate to demonstrate who is best equipped to make sure that they can get ahead again .
In order to change the dynamics of this race , we anticipate that McCain will launch his nastiest attacks and continue to lie about Barack Obamas record and his vision to fundamentally change our country .
We dont know if McCain will continue his refusal to even look at Obama on stage -- like in their first debate -- but we fully expect that his turn the page strategy to ignore the economy will be seen in full view for 90 minutes of character attacks against Barack Obama .
The fact is , McCain has erratically been all over the map in recent weeks , telling Americans that the fundamentals of the economy are strong only days before claiming to suspend his campaign and warning of another depression .
John McCain just doesnt get it .
The American people arent interested in nasty , false attacks , and they re not interested in four more years of Bush policies .
But that s all hes offering .
If all he does is attack Barack Obama , as hes said hell do , it will be yet another colossal missed opportunity .
In the face of those attacks , Barack Obama will continue to offer steady leadership , and talk about his plan to give real relief to the middle class and create good jobs here in America .
When it comes to sheer format , we enter todays debate the decided underdog .
John McCain does extremely well in town hall settings .
It s been his favorite format throughout his career and we think that he will of course do very well .
See below for more reviews of John McCains town hall performances .
The Town Hall Format Of The Debate Favors McCain .
 McCain finally gets his long - demanded joint town - hall meeting with Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday night in Nashville , Tenn .
The Republican 's performance in the second of three presidential debates -- the only one held in the format he tends to favor -- could help determine his ability to stay competitive in a race that seems to have moved against the Arizona senator over the past week . 
[ Wall Street Journal , 10/6/08 ]
McCain Is Engaged In  Especially Serious Preparations  For The Town Hall Debate , Which His Former Campaign Manager Said Is  Probably Going To Be The Best Kind Of Forum He Is Going To Be In. 
 McCain appears to be engaged in especially serious preparations for Tuesday 's debate , one of his last opportunities to change the trajectory of a race that may be slipping out of his control .
He is certainly doing more formal preparation than he did before last month 's debate in Mississippi .
 McCain has done so many of these over the years that it 's probably going to be the best kind of forum he is going to be in ,  said his former campaign manager Terry Nelson .
 It 's a great opportunity for him and the campaign . 
An open question is how aggressively McCain will take the fight to Obama on Tuesday night .
One senior McCain adviser said Sunday that he expects both candidates to draw contrasts with each other on the economy , but he seemed to suggest McCain would stay away from personal attacks .
This official said McCain is looking forward to the debate because he likes the freewheeling town hall format , and he expects it to focus on the candidates ' economic plans . 

Fordham Professor Paul Levinson :  The Town Hall Debate Is McCains Best Debate Format . 
 The town hall debate is McCains best debate format ,  said Paul Levinson , a professor at Fordham University in New York .
 Obama ... clearly is a much better speaker to a huge crowd or an interviewer ( than he is at a debate ) . 
[ Reuters , 10/6/08 ]
Communications Expert Ruth Sherman Said That McCain Has The Advantage In Town Hall Formats And Is Far More Comfortable And Experienced In What Can Be A Challenging Setting .
 Communications expert and author Ruth Sherman said that , in normal times , McCain would have an advantage in Tuesday 's town hall format - he 's done more than 100 such meetings , and is far more comfortable and experienced in what can be a challenging setting .

Password managers are a huge help in dealing with our exponentially growing numbers of accounts .
But stand - alone apps introduce a new problem :
If you are n't sitting at the PC with the software installed , you can't get to your credentials .
Luckily , you have alternatives .
These five password tools are all accessible either from a portable device ( such as a thumb drive ) or over the Web .
RoboForm
RoboForm is one of the better - known password - management applications , but the $ 30 software ( with a free version limited to saving ten passwords ) is normally tied to one PC .
Its built - in access to GoodSync.com lets it synchronize its account files across multiple systems , but doing so requires Windows network , FTP , or WebDAV access .
In other words , setting it up between PCs across the Internet -- such as your home and work PCs - - could be a pain .
Instead , use Microsoft 's free FolderShare utility to sync the directory where RoboForm keeps its account files : My Documents \My RoboForm Data \Default Profile .
Newly created files will automatically transfer between PCs , though you may have to restart RoboForm to see a new account created on another PC .
Passpack
The latest online storage features let Web sites tackle what has long been a security no - no : storing all your user names and passwords online .
In addition to a site log - in , Passpack employs a " Packing Key " passphrase to encrypt your stored cache of account data .
Once downloaded and decrypted , that cache stays only on the computer you 're using until you save it , at which point it 's encrypted again and re-sent to Passpack for storage .
Passpack does n't ever have access to the packing key , and you can't decrypt your passwords without it -- so be careful not to lose the key .
You can use PassPack to log you in automatically to sites , though you might need to train it on a specific site .
The free service allows you to store only up to 100 log-ins , but the company may add premium levels of service .
While Passpack includes some good antiphishing measures , password - stealing attacks could prove to be an Achilles ' heel if they target the service 's log - in and packing key , so you might want to use it solely for less - important ( namely , nonfinancial ) sites until it has been around a while to prove itself .
Password Hash
Another free browser - based option takes an entirely different approach to password security .
If you have the Pwdhash ( Password Hash ) add - on for Firefox and Internet Explorer installed , pressing F2 prior to typing in a password runs that password through some mathematical " hashing " calculations .
The end result is a unique and strong password that transmits to the site and does n't have to be saved anywhere ; meanwhile , you have to remember only one password .
The tool will always generate the same password for the same site ( provided you give it the same starter password ) , even if you use a different browser .
If you 're at a PC where you can't install the add - on , you can instead visit the PwdHash site to run the calculations manually , after which you can simply cut and paste the resultant password .
OpenID
Would n't it be nice to use one account to log in to many different sites ?
Try OpenID .
First sign up for free with your choice of OpenID provider ; the pool includes big names such as Flickr , Verisign , and Yahoo .
Then , when you visit a site that supports the technology , give it your OpenID .
You 'll be sent to your provider for verification .
Once you 're vetted -- which might entail your providing a password or correctly identifying preselected elements of an image map , as in myVidoop.com 's interesting setup -- the provider tells the original site that you 're okay , and voilà , you 're logged in .
Not many sites use OpenID yet , largely because some security risks , such as phishing , still threaten the relatively new system .
But you can save yourself a fair amount of hassle by using it for those nonsensitive sites that do support it .
ID Vault
Guard ID 's thumb drive can securely store all your online account data , and it can help guard against phishing by launching a stripped - down custom browser for use with financial accounts .
While it 's easy to use , it 's not cheap :
It costs $ 50 plus a $ 40 yearly subscription renewal .
Before you can use the device with a given PC , you 'll need to install downloadable software ( available for Windows XP or Vista ) .
Then you can add accounts from a list of known financial or shopping sites , or input data for other accounts you specify .
From then on , you connect the thumb drive , right - click the ID Vault system - tray icon , and select an account .
After you provide a numeric code ( which you choose during the device setup ) , ID Vault logs you in .

Beautiful coordinated and accessorized outfits were a feature of 1920 's ladies fashions .
Hats , shoes , stockings , handbags , dresses and jewelry all came together in perfect harmony to create a unique and elegant style that can only be appreciated when seen in real - life or in color illustrations .
The vibrancy is lost in black and white photographs that typically showcase the era .
1920 's Womens Fashions and Changing Lifestyles
Womens fashions in the early 1920's experienced dramatic changes following the end of the first world war , in a period often referred to as the " roaring 20's " , the era of the " flapper " .
The passing of bustles and corsets gave clothing designers much greater freedom of expression resulting in innovative styling .
Women dressing in the new and colorful fabrics echoed the joy felt by a war weary population following the end of hostilities .
The rate of change in clothing styles for women and children accelerated during the 1920's along with a decline in purchase costs .
This increased the demand for dresses in particular , with silk and rayon hosiery not far behind .
1920 's Dresses were lighter ( due to less material and new synthetic fabrics ) and brighter and shorter than ever before .
Fashion designers played with fabric colors , textures and patterns to create totally new styles of dress .
Evening dresses , coats and jackets were often trimmed with fur .
Fur coats dropped in popularity while fur trimmed coats , especially for women , followed an upward trend .
Hemlines rose for most of the decade but dropped slightly toward the end .
The popular trend toward silk and rayon reflected a taste for luxury in the 1920's and as a result cotton became less fashionable .
Women 's underwear which had been primarily cotton before 1920 was predominantly fashioned from silk and rayon by the end of the decade .
Young women in particular discarded cotton underwear for the new materials while older women were slower to change .
Likewise city people made the change to the new materials and styles far sooner than country people .
Shoes and stockings assumed a greater prominence now that they were more visible .
Silk stockings in all the colors of the rainbow , often with patterns , were designed to match the coordinated outfits of stylish women .
1920s Makeup and more
" Ensembling " was part of the new fashion trends and so purses and handbags became fashion items in a co-ordinated fashion statement .
At the same time there was a marked decrease in the use of hooks and eyes , and feathers and plumes .
The use of perfumes , cosmetics and toilet preparations skyrocketed due to a massive advertising effort in periodicals , newspapers , and radio .
Correspondence schools flourished in the inter - war period as people sought to educate themselves and create a better future for themselves and their families .
Dressmaking and millinery courses in particular were embraced by women who wanted the new fashions but could n't afford retail prices .
Others were looking to create full or part - time jobs for themselves .
Many women turned to fashion as a vocation in order to support their fatherless families in the case of war widows , or to earn extra income to spend on the new luxuries .
Working women also embraced the relatively inexpensive ready - made clothes as mass production of contemporary clothing became common .
It did n't matter if there was n't a department store in your town or city where you could shop for clothes or accessories as all the big department stores had mail - order catalogs where you could order clothes for men , women , and children for delivery by post .
This meant country people had easy access to city fashions for the first time .
Pantsuits , hats and canes that gave women a sleek look without frills and avoiding the fickleness of fashion were popular for a while .
The style was named after the novel La garçonne by Victor Margueritte .
In Europe , this look featured women with short hair ( Bubikopf ) for the first time ; in the U.S. , " the bob " was reintroduced by actress Louise Brooks in the late 1920s .
The hairstyles of Hollywood stars were copied by women all over the world and womens magazines carried articles on how to achieve the current look .
Hairstyles were much shorter than the previous decade and styles like finger waving , the Marcel wave and permanent waving were in vogue .
Women 's underwear changed as a result of this move towards practical clothing , with corsets becoming smaller and more flexible , and modern style bras being introduced .
The new bras provided shape and support whereas the older style tended to flatten breasts and constrict the chest .
Flappers , as the trendy young women were called in the U.S. , wore short dresses with a straight loose silhouette .
By 1927 seams had risen to just below the knee , so that part of the knee could be seen when dancing the Charleston .
Thus , the Roaring Twenties redefined womanhood — a new woman evolved ; it became more acceptable to smoke and drink in public , closer body contact in dancing , shorter hair , make - up , different styles of dress , and greater participation in the workforce - all contributed to the new woman .

Polio is still a major problem in Nigeria Polio could be wiped out in Nigeria - one of the world 's last blackspots of the disease - thanks to an improved vaccine , research suggests .
An Imperial College London team found a recently introduced polio vaccine is four times more effective at protecting children than previous vaccines .
They say it could eradicate type 1 polio - the most common form - in Nigeria if it reaches enough children .
The study appears in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Last pockets of unvaccinated children now need to be reached to achieve elimination in Nigeria
Helen Jenkins
Imperial College London Nigeria is one of only four countries in the world where polio has yet to be eliminated , and 82 % of global cases reported so far this year have been in the country .
Polio is highly infectious and it primarily affects children under five years of age .
A small minority of infected people develop permanent paralysis , which can be fatal .
The monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine , known as mOPV1 , has been used in Nigeria since February 2006 and the number of reported cases of polio in the country fell by 75 % between 2006 and 2007 .
The latest study shows that just one dose of mOPV1 gives a child in Nigeria a 67 % chance of being protected , compared with a 16 % chance after receiving the standard trivalent vaccine .
However , the researchers warn that although the monovalent vaccine is proving very effective , many more children need to be immunised if the polio virus is to be eliminated in Nigeria .
In the north west zone of the country , where the majority of new cases are found , 21 % of children report never having received a single dose of the vaccine and a further 55 % have received fewer than the recommended four doses .
Concern raised Earlier this year the World Health Assembly expressed alarm over a dramatic increase in type 1 cases in Nigeria because of poor immunisation in the north of the country .
The Nigerian government subsequently established a presidential taskforce to identify barriers to immunisation , and potential solutions .
Researcher Helen Jenkins , based at Imperial 's MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling , said : " Nigeria and India are responsible for the vast majority of new global polio cases .
" In Nigeria , we now have an effective vaccine to use and we 've seen the start of improvements in vaccine uptake .
" These last pockets of unvaccinated children now need to be reached to achieve elimination in Nigeria and this in turn will have a dramatic impact on the prospects of worldwide eradication . "
In a statement the World Health Organization said the study proved the new vaccine was a " highly effective tool " - but operational problems stood in the way of successfully eradicating polio .
" To overcome the remaining operational challenges , full political oversight and engagement at all levels is necessary , as demonstrated by states such as Kebbi , where case numbers have declined following such engagement . "
The researchers reached their conclusions after analysing the vaccination histories of 21,815 children with acute flaccid paralysis , 14 % of whom had polio , collected between January 2001 and December 2007 .

Woo on the Wing
I fly often , and unlike so - called yogic flyers , I prefer to use commercial aircraft .
Ok , I do n't really prefer it but it seems to be the only option available .
During that uncomfortable time when I 'm forcibly separated from my electronics , I take a look in the SkyMall magazine , and have a few chuckles .
SkyMall has a literally captive audience .
In the bygone days of phones in the seats of aircraft , they offered a discount if you ordered while in the air .
I suspect this was to prevent you from having time to actually think about what you were purchasing .
Bashing SkyMall is a popular Internet pastime , and now it 's my turn .
Here 's a sampling from the November issue as found on Delta Airlines :
A " Featured " item , the Moletech Fuel Saver promises to " Increase miles per gallon , increase horsepower , install quickly , reduce harmful pollutants ( no mention of the non-harmful ones ) , reduce greenhouse gases , and it will last for 10 years . "
It is a " Patented ' Carbon Friendly ' Solution , " whatever that means .
There are different versions for motorcycles and diesel engines as well , with prices from $ 129.99 to $ 389.99 .
So far so good , but there 's something missing .. any description at all of what it is or how it works .
It does say that it " incorporates ' Molecule Reaction Technology , ' " which must be a good thing .
There is a very tiny picture of something that looks like a stainless - steel kiwi fruit .
I wonder if this plane is using them ?
The guy in front of me could use this .
It 's the X5 Hair Laser .
I guess we missed out on models A through W , 1 to 4 .
It says " The X5 generates 15 distinct points of coherent laser light . "
Points are by definitions distinct , and laser light is always coherent , but words are nice .
" The cool laser light makes direct contact with your scalp , and conforms to its shape for ideal treatment . "
Translation : the light shines on your on your head .
" Shine " is the term we use when light makes direct contact , and as we know , light always conforms to the shape it shines on .
As for the efficacy of lasers for hair growth , maybe that 's why Dr. Evil wanted sharks with laser beams on their heads .
Seems like he's not quite done with the " as little as two months " period of time in which this device is claimed to work .
Ironically , just below that ad , and from the same company , is Toppik , which makes " thin hair look thick and natural in 30 seconds . "
The irony is .. this one actually looks like it would work !
It consists of " keratin protein fibers , " which is another way of saying ground - up hair .
That 's right , just sprinkle some hair on your hair and it will look thick and natural .
It comes in 8 colors , at $ 21.99 a piece .
I think the guy in front of me is too far gone though , unless he applied spray adhesive first .
They serve wine on the plane , but it 's a recent vintage .
I cannot bear to allow such a young fermentation to taint my discriminating palate .
SkyMall to the rescue with Clef Du Vin !
That 's fancy french for " wine key . "
It has been " tested over 10 years by scientists and sommeliers , " although the results are not shared with us .
At $ 99.95 this little chunk of metal might help oxidize the wine , but waiting about 5 minutes after pouring could do the same thing .
Or , it may do nothing at all , but boy , wo n't you be tempted to find the wine better tasting after enhancing it with $ 100 .
This plane ride has been a bit bumpy , and motion sickness looms as the words on the screen jump around .
( The guy in front just put his seat back , so I 'm typing extra hard . )
I wish I had this Motion Sickness Relief Band .
At $ 139.95 , it claims to zap the median nerve in the wrist with electronic pulses , which " harmlessly interferes with the nerve stimulation between the brain and the stomach that causes nausea . "
It also claims to be " similar to acupuncture , without the needles . "
Perhaps they mean it 's mostly placebo , and as long as I do n't realize that , it will work !
Ooops , damn .
Glad there 's an airsickness bag in the seat pocket .
If I took better care of myself , I might not have this motion sickness problem .
Why do n't I " Help strengthen ( my ) health with the latest ancient technology " ?
Read that again .
I 'll quote them for you : " It might sound bizarre . "
Well , yes it does .
Apparently , a " 5000 year old mummy " was found with tattoos that resembled the meridian maps that acupuncturists use .
Did they fail to notice that despite the tattoos , the mummy was dead ?
It 's a little unclear what the $ 199.95 Aculife Therapist Deluxe actually includes .
Apparently there 's a map , and a small electrode that you use to " stimulate qi pathways . "
Which , conveniently , are all found on the left hand .
Oh , and do n't expect immediate results .
It takes at least 60 days .
I do n't think I 'm willing to wait 60 days if something 's bothering me .
Airplane food may cost $ 10 now , but the Thai chicken salad with peanut M&Ms are pretty good .
This is an awfully big bag of candy , though .
I should work out a bit when we land .
But what to wear ?
Why not a Credo Mundi hoody ?
After all , they 're covered with " 200 positive words in 15 different languages . "
$ 79 seems like a lot of a hoody ... what are the words for ?
Well , it says " Fact : Research shows that written words on containers of water can influence the water 's structure for better or worse depending on the nature or INTENT of the word . "
Bolding theirs .
And they continue " Fact :
The human body is over 70 % water .
What if positive words were printed on the inside of your clothing ? "
Well , what if I bought a $ 1.99 marker and wrote them on a $ 5 t- shirt myself ?
I have a feeling the results would be the same , and according to their " research , " they should be .
Of course , this refers to Dr. Emoto's " research " as featured in the movie What the BLEEP Do We Know ?
My in flight movie was Journey to the Center of the Earth , which is much more scientifically accurate than Emoto 's film .
What 's on the next page ...
Ahh .
For $ 495 , I can have " Real Hope for Hair Regrowth . "
The HairMax LaserComb .
And look , we have a cited study !
I quote " The HairMax LaserComb is indicated to promote hair growth in males with androgenic alopecia who have Norwood Hamiton Classification of IIa to V and Fitzpatrick Skin Types I to IV . "
Alas , my name is not Fitzpatrck , so I fear I have the wrong skin type .
This study was conducted by .. umm.. surely I 'm missing it .. hmm , no .
They do not say who did the study , but I have no doubt it was someone clinical .
On this plane , I 'm being bombarded by all sorts of radiation from CD players , Gameboys , and noise - cancelling headsets .
Perhaps I should try to protect my health from the " harmful waves emitted by all electronic products . "
The BiCox " is a systematic health oriented bracelet composed of a bio-ceramic chip made of 20 different oxidation minerals that maximize the protection from harmful electromagnetic waves . "
Oh no !
I 'm using a computer to type this right now .
And I do n't have any pottery covered with rust anywhere nearby !
It has " medical " magnets as well , which are suppose to " improve blood circulation and relieve body tension . "
Do n't magnets produce electromagnetic waves ?
At any rate , they 're probably handy for hanging it up on the refrigerator when you get home .
And what 's this ?
" Far Infrared Ray .
Improves metabolism and vital energy . "
It 's a ray gun too ?
Cool .
I think .
I 'm not sure what that means .
Ahh , and here 's what I 've been needing : " Negative Ions .
Improves immunity and concentration . "
I could use some immunity to deal with that speeding ticket in New York , which was significantly more than the $ 89.95 this piece of costume jewelry cost .
I get my choice of black , brown , white , or red .
Since those are all colors of light in the electromagnetic spectrum , I wonder why there 'd be a choice at all .
Hey , this infrared ray stuff is cool .
What else can we do with it ?
Well , the Baby Quasar Photo Rejuvenation Light Therapy Device will show me .
If I hold this $ 449.00 flashlight up to my face , I can reverse the signs of aging by " reducing the appearance of fine lines , wrinkles and enlarged pores ... "
Oh , and thank goodness ..
" Clinically proven research has shown that red and infrared pulsating light can be effective ( in hiding the signs of aging . ) "
Again , I have to wonder why the sun 's blasting of infrared light does n't do the same thing , but hey , this was studied in a clinic somewhere so it must be real .
I could really use a bathroom visit , but the two people between me and the aisle are sleeping .
I 'm feeling a bit stressed .
Maybe the emWave Personal Stress Reliever is in order .
It can " Revitalize ( my ) emotions , mind , spirit , and body . "
Sounds great !
How does it work ?
Well , this silver box the size of a business card case does .. well , they do n't actually say .
It looks like it has a button and some lights .
It was developed from the " Institute of HeartMath 's 17 years of innovative research on the relationship between the heart , stress , and emotions . "
Heart math ?
Sounds stressful .
Maybe I should just politely wake these people up .
Walking back from the bathroom and the pretty blue water , I wonder how many toxins my body has accumulated with all this flying .
Maybe these " Detox Foot Patches " will help me " collect toxins from reflexology points . "
It seems there are herbs in there !
So .. wait , it 's a mesh bag filled with herbs ...
I 've seen that before ... oh yeah , it 's a tea bag !
It says that the statements contained in this ad have not been evaluated by the FDA , so I guess I wo n't find out .
I prefer coffee anyway .
Toxins be damned , I like the pick - me - up .
But you know , I 'm feeling a pinch in my wallet from buying all these things .
As I have a trip planned to Vegas in July , I wonder if I could win some money at the slots ?
The Science of Winning At Slots is just what I need !
At $ 39.95 , it says it 's the only published slots system supported by real evidence , which in this case , is IRS tax returns .
I wonder why they need the $ 39.98 ?
Anyway , it says it will show me how to tell if a machine is ready to pay .
I hope the casinos do n't read this .
Imagine what would happen if people started winning !
Umm , yeah , I can't imagine it either .
Just an aside here .. the bigfoot lawn ornament , oh , I 'm sorry " Garden Yeti " is a steal at just $ 98.95 .
Have to get one of those , as it's " hand painted for startling realism . "
At 28 " high , how big could the feet be ?
Oh hey , Brookstone has a Pain Relief Wand that uses infrared emitting LEDs .
Er , that 's " infrared emitting light emitting diodes . "
And it 's only $ 249.95 !
We got ripped off on the anti-acne one .
But this one is for joint pain , and it has a quote and a picture from a real doctor !
Oh wait , it 's Dr. Louis Trifos , D.C. That would be " Doctor of Chiropractic . "
The air on this plane is stuffy , and I 'm sure it 's filled with mold spores , pollen , and bacteria .
I think I need this $ 249.95 " Pure - Ion Advanced Ionic Cleaner . "
It removes these things , you see .
Hmm , no mention of what else it does .. which is to fill the air with 03 .
That 's ozone , which is great in the upper atmosphere , but is poisonous at ground level .
The small print says it 's not a medical device , but it does n't say that on the anti-snoring pillow on the next page .
I guess that means the pillow is a medical device ?
The plane lands soon , and I 'm thinking of home .
You know , I wonder if I should rearrange my furniture .
Maybe this " Electronic Feng Shui Compass " can help me " align my physical surroundings to match my intentions . "
I put the couch in front of the TV , because my " intention " is to lay there while I watch Mythbusters .
I do n't think I need a device to help with that .
Oh , it works with electronmagnetic energy !
Guess I can't use it with the BiCox bracelet .
It claims to be " Operating with the same technology used in aerospace guidance systems ... "
Is n't that just detecting magnetic north ?
I think I have a compass that came in a Cracker Jack Box that does that .
Oh no , that was Slim Pickens .
Nevermind .
Hmm , some more wine would be nice to relax with .
Oh , what 's this ?
A Wine and Liquor Accelerator !
And only $ 39.95 !
Damn , the wine key was a rip off .
The accelerator uses a " triangular - shaped magnetic field " and in just 10 seconds , you 'll have aged the wine just like " years of traditional aging . "
It keeps " working " as long as you keep the wine there .
Hmm , let 's say 10 seconds equals 10 years .
A minute would be 60 years .
An hour , 3600 years .
What does 3600 year old wine taste like ?
I 'm not sure I want to know .
It 's guaranteed to work for 100 years .
I wonder what happens after that .
Oh , it also says " It sounds impossible , but it 's true . "
They 're not allowed to lie , are they ?
Oh wait , they 're referring to this specific sentence : " Experience a premium drink in seconds . "
I guess that 's how long it takes to open that 1996 Dom Perignon you 've been saving ... no triangle of plastic needed .
On second thought , I do n't think I 'm going to buy any of this stuff .
I think I 'll stick with the animated Elvis Bust , the Mickey Mouse shaped USB stick , and the red cylindrical fire starters that come in a wooden box labeled " DYNAMITE . "
Something tells me those things might actually perform as advertised .
Synthetic organic chemistry has come a long way in the course of the last century .
At the beginning it was not much more than pure guesswork , mixing different things , heating and taking a guess what heteroaromatic might have formed .
Nowadays , we have arrived at a point where it is possible to make almost any conceivable chemical structure by a rational approach , using the large toolbox of synthetic methods available today .
Have we thus reached our goal ?
Is there nothing left to do in synthesis except improving the existing methodology ?
Of course not .
What we still need is a more profound understanding what is happening on the molecular level .
Quite often we find ourselves faced with a synthetic problem where only one specific set of reaction conditions will work .
Why this one ?
Nobody knows , and nobody can predict , so we have to try all possible conditions .
I would argue that the huge improvement in our understanding of reaction mechanisms and the complexity of chemical structures of today is largely related to the availability of more powerful analytical methods .
A hundred years ago , melting points and elementary analysis were about the only ones , later on IR spectroscopy became available .
But we all know that modern organic synthesis would be unthinkable without the help of NMR spectroscopy .
Maybe a new method is just around the corner , waiting to be introduced .
To gain more knowledge about mechanisms , we would need the ability to “ look at ” individual molecules , rather than ensembles of molecules as is the case today .
A new method that could do this would definitely have a huge impact on organic synthesis .
While we observe billions of molecules at the same time with our analytics , in our mind we are still stuck with the single molecule that we draw on paper .
In this way , we neglect all the interactions between molecules that can be very important for the outcome of a reaction .
Take organolithium compounds as a simple example .
We usually write “ n - BuLi ” as if it were an isolated species , although it is well - known that these compounds form clusters up to hexamers in solution , depending on the solvent and the concentration .
From a theoretical point of view , it will be very important to devise models that take the interactions between molecules , molecule clusters and the solvent ( more ) into account .
When The Times and CBS News first asked the question , more voters said they believed Mr. Obama was not ready , 49 percent , than believed he was , 44 percent .
Mr. McCain still holds an advantage on that front , with 64 percent saying they believe he is prepared for the presidency .
There was also fresh evidence that Mr. McCain ’s attacks on Mr. Obama ’s character and qualifications in commercials , mailings , speeches and automated telephone calls were , if anything , harming Mr. McCain .
The percentage of people who view Mr. McCain unfavorably was at its highest level since The Times and CBS began asking the question in 1999 .
Forty - six percent said they held unfavorable views of him , with 39 percent saying they viewed him favorably .
Mr. Obama was viewed favorably by 52 percent of those surveyed , and unfavorably by 31 percent .
Voters were almost evenly split over Mr. Obama ’s ability to handle a crisis wisely : 49 percent said they were confident he could and 47 percent said they would be uneasy .
Respondents showed less ease with Mr. McCain : 51 percent said they would be uneasy with his approach and 46 percent expressed confidence .
Mr. Obama fared better than Mr. McCain on economic matters : 65 percent said they were somewhat confident or very confident in Mr. Obama ’s ability to handle the economy ; 47 percent said the same thing about Mr. McCain .
In spite of Mr. McCain ’s sustained attack on Mr. Obama ’s proposal to raise income taxes on households and businesses that earn more than $ 250,000 a year , Mr. Obama ’s plan received significant support in the new poll .
When voters were asked whether they supported the tax increase to help provide health insurance for those who are not covered , 62 percent said it was a “ good idea ” and 33 percent said it was a “ bad idea . ”
Voters were evenly divided over Mr. McCain ’s plan to make permanent Mr. Bush ’s 2001 tax cuts .
In another area where Mr. McCain could take heart , the last two polls offered fresh evidence that his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate had helped to excite two traditional bases of support for Republican presidential candidates .
White voters who say they attend church every week preferred Mr. McCain over Mr. Obama by 61 percent to 29 percent , and voters who live in the South preferred him over Mr. Obama by 51 percent to 40 percent .
But , over all , the percentage of those who view Ms. Palin unfavorably , 40 percent , was higher than those who view her favorably , 31 percent .
Korean Designers Invent Wind Powered Battery Charger
November 13th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
A team of young Korean designers have invented a battery charger that runs on 100 % renewable energy .
The Febot might look a bit like a torpedo that ’s gone wrong , but the in - built propellors mean that each one can generate enough energy to top up a rechargable AA battery .
Now here ’s the fun bit .
The Febot comes with a suction cup that allows you to attach it to pretty much any flat surface or structure .
In theory , you could attach it to the outside of your window , or even the top of your car .
Just imagine — a tiny little wind farm all of your own .
At this point , the Febot is still at the prototype stage .
But , as soon as a few teething problems , like making sure the suction cup is strong enough to stand up to higher winds , are ironed out , I reckon there could be a market for a nifty little gadget like this .
You have to admit , it certainly looks like a fun way of doing a very mundane task — and it ’s 100 % free green energy .

Hugo Chavez declares war on Alaska
November 28 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
by again offering donations of oil to rural parts of the state :
With heating oil prices approaching $ 10 a gallon in rural Alaska and reports of neighbors stealing fuel from neighbors to warm their homes , a Venezuela - owned oil company plans to supply free fuel to villages again this winter . [ … ]
Citgo has provided roughly 15,000 Alaska village households 100 gallons of heating oil each for the past two winters .
If the company donates the same amount this year , some families will save as much as $ 1,000 on their fuel bills .
It ’s part of a program providing assistance to low - income communities in 23 states .
which means war !
The fact that the heating assistance is coming from Chavez led some eligible Alaska communities — such as St. Paul — to reject Citgo ’s gift in the past .
It would have been unpatriotic to participate , said Steve Senisch , a local councilman who voted against the gift in 2007 .
He predicted the council will vote the same way this time .
well , maybe less war this year …
But Osborne said that villages that once opted out of the program , such as St. George , plan to participate this year as Citgo ’s program grows internationally and prices remain high in rural Alaska .
Melanie Edwards lives in Nome , where she ’s the vice president of the regional nonprofit that manages the heating - oil program for more than a dozen nearby villages .
“ Last time I checked , ( Citgo is ) paying corporate taxes to the U.S. Treasury , ” she said .
“ And we figure until such time that the U.S. government is so offended by Venezuela and Citgo that they ’re not accepting any more funding , then we ’re not being unpatriotic by accepting the same . ”
and there was somebody who I vaguely remember being awful antagonistic not too long ago , I wonder what she has to say about this invasion by socialists :
Palin ’s office did not respond to questions Wednesday about the governor ’s stance on the Citgo program
good golly , could she really be considering a continued experiment with socialism ?
Anchorage Rep. Bob Lynn , a Republican , said he doubts the state would cut checks again because oil prices are dropping and the payment was meant to be a one - time measure .
Lynn said it ’s not right for Alaska to receive oil from Chavez .
“ We need to be able to take care of our own .
The United States needs to do something about this , ” he said .
Still , Lynn added later , “ It ’s one thing for me to speak philosophical thoughts here in the warmth of my home in Anchorage .
It ’s another thing to have a wife and kids in danger of freezing to death out there . ”
oh dear , capitalism is n’t doing a great job of saving the day …
Fast Substructure Search Using Open Source Tools Part 3 - A CRUD API for Fingerprints in Ruby 2008-10-06T00:00:00.000Z
The previous article in this series showed how to perform fingerprint screens for substructure searches using nothing more than SQL .
Although this is significant progress , working at the level of SQL queries to perform create , read , update , and delete operations ( CRUD ) on our fingerprint table is more work than it needs to be .
We 'd really prefer to use an API written in a high - level programming language .
This article describes a simple Ruby API for managing and querying a database of molecular fingerprints .
All Articles in this Series :
Some Changes to the Database Schema
Before we move forward , we must deal with one minor detail .
By default MySQL uses signed 64 - bit integers .
This gives a range for integers of -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 .
Ruby , on the other hand , can work with integers of any size through the Bignum class - and we 'll be taking full advantage of this feature .
If we want to avoid the headache of constantly accounting for the difference , we need to tell our database to use unsigned integers in the fingerprints table .
This can be done by first dropping the old table :
mysql > drop table fingerprints ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec )
Now let 's create a new table in which the fp< sub > n < / sub > columns store unsigned integers only .
While we 're at it , let 's change the naming of these columns from fp < sub > n < / sub > to the more descriptive byte < sub > n< / sub > and set a default value of zero .
The new table can be created with with :
mysql > create table fingerprints ( id int not null auto_increment , primary key ( id ) , byte0 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte1 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte2 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte3 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte4 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte5 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte6 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte7 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte8 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte9 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte10 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte11 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte12 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte13 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte14 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 , byte15 bigint ( 64 ) unsigned default 0 ) ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > describe fingerprints ; +--------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ |
Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ | id | int ( 11 ) | NO | PRI | NULL | auto_increment | | byte0 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte1 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte2 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte3 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte4 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte5 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte6 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte7 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte8 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte9 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte10 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte11 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte12 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte13 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte14 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | | byte15 | bigint ( 64 ) unsigned | YES | | 0 | | +--------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ 17 rows in set ( 0.01 sec )
We 're now ready to create the Ruby API .
The API
The code below is all we need to begin querying and managing our fingerprint database in Ruby :
require ' rubygems ' require ' active_record '
ActiveRecord ::Base.establish_connection ( :adapter => ' mysql ' , :host => ' localhost ' , :username => ' root ' , : password => '' , : database => ' compounds ' ) class Fingerprint & lt ; ActiveRecord :: Base @@bytes_prefix = " byte " def each_byte 0 .upto( byte_count - 1 ) { |i| yield send ( " #{@@bytes_prefix} #{i} " ) } end def each_byte_with_index 0 .upto( byte_count - 1 ) { |i| yield send ( " #{@@bytes_prefix} #{i} " ) , i } end def fill_bytes 0 .upto ( byte_count - 1 ) { |i| send ( " #{@@bytes_prefix} # {i} = " , yield ( i ) ) } self end def to_byte_array Array.new ( 16 ) .fill { |i| send ( " #{@@bytes_prefix} #{i} " ) } end def byte_count result = 0 while respond_to ? " #{@@bytes_prefix} #{result} " result += 1 end result end def bitstring result = " " each_byte { | byte| result += sprintf ( " %064b " , byte ) } result end def cardinality bitstring .
count ( " 1 " ) end def eql ?
( other ) to_byte_array.eql?( other.to_byte_array ) end def save return false unless Fingerprint.find_by_fingerprint ( self ) .empty ?
super end def self . find_by_fingerprint fingerprint Fingerprint.find_by_sql sql_for_find_by_fingerprint( fingerprint ) end def self . find_children_by_fingerprint fingerprint Fingerprint.find_by_sql sql_for_find_children_by_fingerprint( fingerprint ) end def self .
sql_for_find_by_fingerprint fingerprint result = " select fingerprints . * from fingerprints where " last = fingerprint .
byte_count - 1 fingerprint.each_byte_with_index do |byte , i| result += " #{@@bytes_prefix} # {i} = # {byte} " + ( ( i ==last ) ? " " : " and " ) end result end def self .
sql_for_find_children_by_fingerprint fingerprint result = " select fingerprints .* from fingerprints where " last = fingerprint .
byte_count - 1 fingerprint.each_byte_with_index do |byte , i| result += " #{@@bytes_prefix} # {i} & # {byte} = # {byte} " + ( ( i ==last ) ? " " : " and " ) end result end end
Testing the API
We can test this library from interactive ruby ( irb ) .
Let 's add two fingerprints - the first consisting of all bits set to " 1 " and the second consisting of alternating " 1 " and " 0 " bits :
irb irb( main ) : 001:0 > require ' fingerprint ' => true irb( main ) : 002:0 > f1=Fingerprint.new.fill_bytes{ " ffffffffffffffff " .hex} => irb( main ) : 003:0 > f1.save => true irb( main ) : 004:0 > f2=Fingerprint.new.fill_bytes{ " aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa " .hex} => irb( main ) : 005:0 > f2.save => true
Let 's find the fingerprint in which all bits are turned on :
irb irb( main ) : 001:0 > require ' fingerprint ' => true irb( main ) : 002:0 > query=Fingerprint.new.fill_bytes{ " ffffffffffffffff " .hex} => irb( main ) : 003:0 > Fingerprint.find_by_fingerprint query => [
Our query has found an exact match for the query fingerprint in the database at row 111 .
( This id is not 1 because previous automated tests that I wrote and executed have added and removed rows , advancing the id counter ) .
We can also search the database for the children of an arbitrary fingerprint query .
A test fingerprint A is a " child " of query Q if all of the set bits in Q are also set in A .
Notice that this leaves open the possibility that A has more bits set than Q .
For example :
irb irb( main ) : 001:0 > require ' fingerprint ' => true irb( main ) : 002:0 > query=Fingerprint.new.fill_bytes{ " aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa " .hex} => irb( main ) :003:0 > results = Fingerprint.find_children_by_fingerprint query => [
It worked - both fingerprints stored in the database were found .
We can delete a Fingerprint like this :
irb irb( main ) : 001:0 > require ' fingerprint ' => true irb( main ) : 002:0 > f=Fingerprint.find 112 => irb( main ) :003:0 > f.destroy => irb( main ) :004:0 > Fingerprint.count => 1
Active Record and the Fingerprint API
The Fingerprint class is so concise because it takes advantage of the Ruby library called ActiveRecord .
ActiveRecord is the object - relational mapping system used in Ruby on Rails .
ActiveRecord can be used outside of Rails , as was done for this library , by including the code at the top of the file beginning with " ActiveRecord : : Base.establish_connection … " , where you 'd use the parameters specific to your database .
We gain three key advantages with this approach : ( 1 ) we have very little SQL to code ; ( 2 ) we have access to all of ActiveRecord 's built - in CRUD operations such as counting records through Fingerprint .
count and deleting Fingerprints with destroy without writing anything ourselves ; and ( 3 ) we can easily integrate the Fingerprint class into any Ruby on Rails application .
Variations
At least two other Object - Ralational Mapping systems could be used from Ruby , DataMapper , and Sequel .
The approach described here could be adapted to these other ORMS with minimal effort .
Conclusions
We now have a working fingerprint screening system built solely from open source components .
MySQL houses the data and provides for highly - optimized queries .
A concise Ruby API created with ActiveRecord now allows us to deal with our fingerprint database as a collection of objects in a high - level language .
We can perform all CRUD operations without writing a line of SQL .
We 've come a long way , but we 're still not dealing with molecules .
We previously saw how Open Babel can generate fingerprints with which we could , in principle , populate and query our database .
The next article in this series will use this capability in creating a more chemically - aware system .

Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - NY ) takes on the Detroit CEO ’s asking for a handout :
There ’s a delicious irony of seeing private luxury jets flying into DC , and people coming off of them with tin cups in their hands , saying that they ’re going to be trimming down and streamlining their businesses .
It ’s almost like seeing a guy show up at the soup kitchen in high hat and tuxedo .
Kind makes you a little bit suspicious as to whether or not …we ’ve seen the future .
There ’s a message there .
Could n’t you all have downgraded to first class or jet - pooled to get here ?
It would have at least sent the message that you do get it .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Today it ’s worth remembering how Obama ’s career was launched – and to realize how remarkably consistent his message has been since at least 2004 .
It is almost as if every speech he has given since then has been an exploration of the themes laid out here – getting past partisan blinders and wedge issues to the core challenges of our time ; restoring the place of American values in the War on Terrorism ; unity ; hope ; that better place around the bend ; biblical references to liberal values ; patriotism .
It ’s also worth noting how often Obama cites and quotes both the Bible and the Constitution – both in this speech and in his later speeches – and how he constantly invokes “ the American story . ”
After this long campaign , it seems “ that skinny kid with a funny name ” was right to believe that America had a place for him , too .

Trying to Map Love and Hate in the Brain A study trying to map hate in the brain found similarities to " love circuits . "
Oct. 29 , 2008  --
When we look at an enemy , hate takes a similar path in our minds to the path taken by love , at least according to a small study published today in the Public Library of Science .
Researchers in Britain used brain imaging to map what happens when people look at photos of individuals they hate , or individuals they neither cared for or hated .
Seventeen people in the study brought in photos of their ex-girlfriends , co-workers , acquaintances and despised public figures .
When a photo of their enemy appeared , researchers using functional MRI found a distinctive pattern in the brain .
The researchers , professors Semir Zeki and John Romaya of the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology at the University College of London , called the pattern a " hate circuit . "
Researchers also found that some activation of the " hate circuit " in the insular part of the brain was remarkably similar to a previous " love circuit " they found .
" They were almost identical to the ones activated in the love study , " said Zeki .
" I was mildly surprised , although love can transmute into hate . "
Yet , despite the interesting findings , other scientists question how well brain imaging can explain complex emotions .
Working Backward From Brain Scans
" There are a number of very good studies now that look at things that seem kind of ineffable , " said Scott Huettel , an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University in Durham , N.C .
Huettel , who was not involved in the research , said scientists are making surprising gains into understanding subtle emotions , such as attachment , altruism and disgust by doing brain imaging with functional MRI .
But Huettel said the multifaceted working of the brain makes studying these emotions an enormous amount of work .
" It 's hard for us to make it precise , " he said .
According to Huettel , looking at a functional MRI scan is like looking at areas of little computations in the brain .
Each area that lights up should be doing something , but what is n't always clear .
Parsing Words , Thoughts and Brain Scans
" Some regions may do computations related to a topic , like faces or words , " Huettel said .
" Others may do computations related to functions , " such as starting , stopping , relating , etc .
When more than one area lights up , as happened with the " hate circuit , " trying to parse what each area is doing is like trying to solve an equation with multiple unknowns , he said .
" Each person hated only one other person , so there are probably a lot of other things that are wrapped into the expressions of hatred here , " Huettel said .
These could be thoughts of other people related to their enemy , or a reaction to an image .
" We have to look at other studies to separate what they 're doing , " he said .
However , Huettel said he thinks the initial study of the " hate circuit " could be a great start for more research .
" Does this go broader than just looking at the photo of someone you hate ? " he asked .
Dr. Cameron Carter , professor of psychiatry and director of the imaging resource center University of California at Davis , agrees .
" I think that it 's interesting and it's a very preliminary study , " Carter said .
" They saw different activities in different areas and then they speculate as to what that activity may have meant . "
In those speculations , Zeki noted that an image of an enemy lit up areas of the cerebral cortex part of the brain , which is associated with judgment and reasoning , while an image of a loved one did n't activate those areas .
" I was surprised by the level of deactivation in the case of love , than in the case of hate , " said Zeki .
" But if you see a person and if you love them , and you trust them , you do n't have to watch every step . "
By Zeki's estimation , his experiment implies that hate is much more calculating , while love is much more trusting .
" It 's interesting , " Carter said .
" But the study seems to be more of an exploratory kind . "
The U.K. study may be one of a kind , too .
Zeki could not find many studies on pure love and hate .
" This is the first study to look at brain activity that underlies the emotional response of hatred to the picture of a face , " said Kevin S. LaBar , associate professor at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University .
" It would be really interesting to know if the brain activity reported here in response to an individual face generalizes to hatred of groups , which can motivate prejudice , " he said .
Getting to the Bottom of Hatred
" People have done lots of studies that have involved using lots of different facial emotions : faces from in - groups , faces from out - groups , faces of smiling people , faces of different races , " Carter said .
" But people were inferring a certain emotion from those faces . "
With this study , Carter noted , the scientists flat out asked the people how they felt about these faces and then ran the scans .
In this case , the assumption was n't an emotion , but what was happening in the functional MRI scan .
Zeki wants to use this new approach to do more studies .
" We 've got many other follow - up studies to do , and even this is a follow - up study to the love study , " Zeki said .
" For example , romantic love is usually directed at one person at any given time , but with hate it can be directed at a group or an individual member of the group . "
To Zeki , that makes hatred more complicated than love .
Barack Obama ’s recent surge in the presidential race has been credited to a rise in voters ’ concerns about their money .
It helps that Obama himself has a lot of money .
Spurning federal funds -- and the spending restrictions that go with them -- the Democratic nominee has racked up an enormous cash advantage that he is using to dominate the television airwaves .
The week before last , Obama outspent Republican nominee John McCain in all of the most competitive states , save for Iowa and Minnesota , where he has a comfortable lead in recent polls .
More significantly , Obama has used his financial edge to turn once - reliable GOP states into hard - fought battlegrounds .
In that same week , according to an independent study , Obama outspent McCain by more than 8 to 1 in North Carolina and 3 to 1 in Indiana .
No Democrat has won either state in more than three decades .
Advertisement
Obama has “ stretched the playing field , ” said Edward Carmines , who teaches political science at Indiana University .
“ Now , in the last month of the campaign , Sen. McCain is having to make very tough decisions where to spend his money . ”
Obama ’s financial edge results from his decision to become the first candidate to forgo public funding since the federal system was adopted in 1976 after the Watergate scandal .
McCain accepted $ 84.1 million from Washington , and that is all he can spend .
But the Illinois senator rejected the taxpayer money , betting he could raise a lot more .
And he has .
Obama had more than $ 77 million in the bank on Aug. 31 , the close of the last reporting period , and is on a pace to raise at least $ 100 million more by election day .
That would mean a cash advantage over McCain of better than 2 to 1 .
In a sign of his flush finances , Obama plans a half - hour prime - time broadcast on CBS and NBC on Oct. 29 , the first time in years that a presidential candidate has made such a substantial investment in national TV .
Ross Perot , a billionaire who bankrolled much of his own campaign , drew an audience of 26 million to his 1992 simulcast on ABC and CBS .

Obama ’s money advantage adds to the already tough climb McCain faces in the final three weeks of the race .
Polls have shown momentum shifting strongly in the Democrat ’s direction as the economic crisis has come to dominate the campaign .
McCain has another chance -- perhaps his last , best one -- to reverse the direction of the race when the two men meet in their third and final debate Wednesday in New York .
At the start of the presidential campaign , common wisdom was that a candidate would need to raise $ 100 million to compete seriously in the early primaries .
Obama , with his Internet - fueled fundraising machine , easily shattered that mark on the way to upsetting Democratic rival New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
In all , Obama has raised $ 454 million through August ; he will easily top $ 500 million by election day .
McCain collected $ 210 million in coming from behind to win the GOP nomination .
Early last year , Obama indicated a willingness to accept federal funding and abide by spending restrictions for the fall campaign .
As late as spring , an Obama spokesman said the Democrat would “ aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election . ”
Advertisement
But there was no such effort and Obama announced in June that he would opt out of public funding .
Obama took a risk that his image as a reformer would suffer .
McCain criticized the move and his aides have periodically raised the issue .
But it has never gained much political traction .
Garry South , who managed the 2002 reelection bid of former California Gov. Gray Davis , is not surprised .
Davis collected a then - record $ 78 million and was attacked throughout the campaign for his prodigious fundraising .
“ Voters do n’t care , ” South said .
“ They ’re cynical and jaded about political money in any respect and every respect .
And for one politician to say , ‘ I ’m holier than thou , ’ to another politician never works . ”
Most of the money Obama raised is being spent on TV ads , the most expensive part of a campaign and one of the most crucial .
Advertisement
From Sept. 28 through Oct. 4 , Obama outspent McCain by more than 3 to 1 on TV ads in Florida and Virginia , 2 to 1 in New Hampshire and Missouri and 3 to 2 in Nevada , according to data compiled by the Wisconsin Advertising Project , which independently monitors spending on campaign commercials .
The study found that Obama spent just less than $ 17.5 million on TV ads that week , compared with just less than $ 11 million by McCain and the Republican National Committee .
The RNC , which can raise and spend unlimited sums , has been supplementing McCain ’s TV ad budget in several states .
The committee raised a record $ 66 million in September .
But the advertising disparity is even larger than those figures indicate .
If the Republican Party pays for half the cost of a McCain ad , then half the content is required to be general in nature , promoting , say , the GOP or its members of Congress .
So , even in those states where McCain has equivalent dollars , “ we do n’t have equivalent time , ” said one Republican ad maker who did not want to be identified discussing the challenges facing the party ’s nominee .
Obama has also benefited more than McCain has from spending by supporters who are advertising on the candidates ’ behalf .

Since Labor Day , the traditional start of the fall campaign , independent groups have spent nearly $ 15.8 million to support Obama , or oppose McCain , more than double the $ 5.4 million spent on behalf of McCain , according to Federal Election Commission records .
The largest amount of pro-Obama spending has come from organized labor , led by the Service Employees International Union , which has spent $ 7.7 million since Labor Day .
Other unions have pushed organized labor ’s pro-Obama expenditures to more than $ 10 million , all of it in battleground states including Ohio , Wisconsin and Missouri .
Other than the Republican Party -- which has spent almost $ 10 million since Sept. 1 -- the biggest group promoting McCain has been the National Rifle Assn. , which has spent $ 3.2 million to help elect the Arizona senator .

Thoughts of travel by James Budden .
Paul Mawhinney was born and raised in Pittsburgh , PA .
Over the years he has amassed what has become the world ’s largest record collection .
Due to advancing age , financial issues , health issues and a struggling record industry Paul has been forced to sell his collection , AGAIN .
3 Million Records
300,000 Compact Discs
More Than 6 Million Song Titles
Back in February , Paul put the entire collection up on eBay .
The bidding got up to a whopping $ 3,002,150 ( albeit much less than the collection is actually worth . )
The news of the auction and the collection were widely reported at this time , however as it turns out the winner of the auction was a deadbeat non-paying bidder .
The user ’s ( now suspended ) account name was “ jopsoup ” and he later claimed that someone had stolen his identity .
Ya , right .
After dealing with this headache , Paul is now putting the collection up for sale once again .
Every genre of American music is represented : rock , jazz , country , R&B , blues , new age , Broadway and Hollywood , bluegrass , folk , children ’s , comedy , Christmas music (! ) and more .
No other collection in the world even comes close .
More than half of the recordings are actually NEW , and many of the records are worth hundreds or thousands themselves .
Every recording in this amazing collection was purchased by its owner , over a period of 50 years , and stored in a 16,000 square foot climate – controlled warehouse .
The estimated value of the entire collection is now greater than fifty million dollars .
Of course the price tag is the greatest obstacle in selling the collection , but I think it could be argued that the value of the collection is much greater than the sum of its parts .
It is absolutely the greatest collection of music from the 20th century and has a tremendous historical value .
Other than selling the whole lot to to a private collector I have no idea what attempts have been made to preserve the collection .
Has anyone approached any archival instututions , maybe the library of Congress ?
Would they even want it ?
The collection must be preserved in it ’s entirety .
To break up a collection as comprehensive and rare as this would be absolutely unthinkable .
Perhaps some crazy music - loving billionaire out there wants to acquire it .
If you ’re listening – this is your call to action !
Buy it , preserve it , and maintain this historical and cultural treasure .
In any case , an individual named Sean Dunne has created a documentary about it called “ The Archive ” .
It is a must watch .
Short video describing the documentary .
And here is video in it ’s entirety ( you can click on the arrows it to see it full screen ) .
Paul is also the publisher of Music Master , the definitive guide to buying and selling music , used by record collectors the world over .
More information on the collection can be found here and you can browse the complete database of music if you fill out a form here .
Oh , the first record he ever bought ?
It was a 45 rpm Frankie Lane song .
BBtv is launching a series of episodes featuring author , PC , and minor television personality John Hodgman , as the world waits breathlessly for the launch of his new book , MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU REQUIRE .
We have read it , dear viewer , and it is splendid .
Today , the debut installment of Boing Boing tv's SPAMASTERPIECE THEATER , which Hodgman himself describes as the dramatization of " true tale [s ] of romance , adventure , infamy , and low - cost prescription drugs , all culled from the reams of actual , unsolicited emails , received here by us and people like you — what we call SPAM . "
We 'll be releasing more of these in the coming weeks .
Each one is composed exclusively of actual , unadulterated , unsolicited email .
Like virtual raw foodists , we would not think of cooking perfect fruit that falls so gracefully from the internet 's tree of life .
We hope you enjoy .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama called Nancy Reagan on Friday to apologize for a remark about seances he made during his first news conference earlier in the day .
President - elect Barack Obama 's spokeswoman syas he apologized to Nancy Reagan for " offhanded remark . "
When a reporter asked Obama if he had spoken with any ex-presidents since his election on Tuesday , he responded that he had spoken to all former presidents " that are living . "
" I did n't want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about , you know , doing any seances , " he said .
Nancy Reagan , wife of 40th President Ronald Reagan , was derided in 1988 when his former chief of staff Donald Regan revealed in a book that the first lady had consulted an astrologer to determine the president 's schedule .
Obama apologized to Reagan " for the careless and offhanded remark , " Obama transition team spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said .
Watch Obama make the seance remark »
" The president - elect expressed his admiration and affection for Mrs. Reagan that so many Americans share and they had a warm conversation , " Cutter said .
President Reagan died in 2004 at 93 .
Other first ladies have reportedly used spiritual advisers .
In his 1996 book , " The Choice , " Washington Post editor and writer Bob Woodward said that as first lady , Sen. Hillary Clinton had seance - like sessions at the White House during which she conversed with late first lady Eleanor Roosevelt .
At the time , the White House said the sessions were not seances .
Abraham Lincoln 's wife , Mary Todd Lincoln , was rumored to have held seances at the White House in order to contact her two dead sons , Eddie and Willie .
She also reportedly went to seances under an assumed name after the president 's death to attempt to contact him .
Immediately after the seance remark , Obama said he had " re-read some of Lincoln 's writings , who 's always an extraordinary inspiration " and mentioned that former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush and current President George W. Bush " have all been very gracious and offered to provide any help that they can in this transition process . "

Dimdim Delivers Version 4.0 if its Conferencing App
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 06 , 2008
Related Blog Posts 25 Free , Game Changing Open Source Resources
Dimdim , the open source web conferencing application that we 've liked and written about is out in a new version 4.0 .
Dimdim is widely regarded for its ability to host online meetings including up to 20 people - - for free .
The new version adds many new features including letting you record your meetings and share playback URLs .
If you have an existing Dimdim account , you 'll be automatically upgraded .
Here 's more on what you get in the new version .
Dimdim now allows for multiple presenters .
A single click lets you allow any other meeting attendee to share his or her presentation , whiteboard , webcam stream , or other attendees can share their desktops .
Mac desktop sharing was a highly requested new feature , and it is in place now .
Mac users can share their desktops via a browser and show presentations .
Free teleconferencing accounts have been around in non-open source conferencing applications for a while .
Dimdim now allows for free teleconferencing or you can use the free VoIP microphone sharing features .
You can now set private meetings , where only people who have a key can participate .
In recording meetings , you can send someone else a link to your recording and they can click to play it .
Alternatively , you can embed the recordings in your site or blog , as is frequently done with YouTube videos .
Dimdim is still available in free , pro and enterprise versions , with the pro version costing $ 99 a year and the enterprise version costing $ 1,998 .
However , users of the free version will be happy to hear that the new features are available to them .
While there are a few tinier features not available in the free version that are in the paid versions , the main difference between them is that the paid versions allow for more meeting participants ( 100 and 1,000 respectively ) .
Most of us still watch movies the old fashioned way : on DVD .
Okay , maybe watching movies on DVD is n't that old , but for every $ 10 U.S. consumers spend on movie and TV entertainment , $ 8 of it goes to purchasing or renting DVDs ...
Which certainly makes us wish we bought Netflix stock when it first starting trading publicly in 2002 .
But DVDs wo n't remain the number one movie and TV source forever .
And no , Blu-ray is unlikely to be DVD 's ultimate successor either .
The future -- and it's not a very distant future -- of movie and TV consumption is via online streaming .
Netflix knows this and it is why the company has been building its film and TV streaming library for the last year and a half .
The problem is , the Netflix Watch Instantly selections have been rather disappointing , unless you are fan of documentaries or independent films .
The enticement that the Netflix content streaming offered was not that great .
That , however , is starting to change for the better as a result of a few strategic moves that Netflix has made recently .
First , Netflix partnered with CBS Television Network and Disney - ABC Television Group two weeks ago to add a number of current and classic TV shows to Netflix 's live streaming library , such as Heroes , Hannah Montana , and Star Trek .
( Some of the shows are available now , and others will be available later this fall . )
Adding TV shows to its streaming library certainly beefs up the content options , but is not necessarily a unique feature , as many of these same titles can be viewed for free elsewhere , such as on Hulu or on the networks ' own sites .
( Albeit , the Netflix TV shows are sans commercials , and the image quality on Netflix is noticeably better than on Hulu . )
The second , and perhaps more significant partnership that Netflix announced today is with Starz Entertainment .
Not only does this deal add another 2,500 or so movies to Netflix 's existing streaming library of roughly 12,000 films and TV shows , but it also adds some sorely - need , recent A - list titles , such as No Country for Old Men , Superbad , and Spiderman 3 .
Most of the movies are older titles and classics , but they represent a noticeable step up from the rather non-Hollywood - based titles that have been the main fodder on Netflix 's Watch Instantly feature until now .
About 1,000 of the Starz - supplied the titles are available now , with the rest coming online " in the coming weeks .
"
Netflix 's Watch Instantly feature is available at no extra cost to members of any of Netflix 's unlimited plans ( which range in price from $ 8.99 to $ 47.99 per month ) .
Netlfix now also offers a " Starz Play Only ( no DVDs ) " plan for $ 7.99 per month , which offers " unlimited streaming " of Starz Play and the Live Starz TV Channel .
If you have the right equipment , the live streaming is n't even just limited to your Windows PC .
Both the Netflix Player by Roku and the LG BD300 Network Blu-ray Disc Player also support instant streaming from Netflix .
Xbox 360 owners with an Xbox LIVE Gold membership will also be able to view the Netflix live streaming starting in " late fall 2008 . "
And Mac owners should rejoice that on the official Netflix blog this morning , " Brent " reported the following : " And , for all of you Mac users ( of which I am one ) we ’ve been busy working getting a solution that will allow you to watch instantly on your Mac .
So hang in there - we ’ll have something for you by the end of the year .
" Depending on your particular movie and TV tastes , these partnerships might give you significantly more viewing options .
As for the author of this news post , his Netflix queue currently has 256 movies [ obviously , I have some time - management issues ! -- DAB ] ; but only 12 of them are available to watch instantly and hardly any of them are new releases .
Hopefully more titles will become available as Netflix adds more movies from the Starz library .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
For the first time the transmission of data secured by quantum cryptography is demonstrated within a commercial telecommunications network .
41 partners from 12 European countries , including academics from the University of Bristol , have worked on realising this quantum cryptographic network since April 2004 .
Today [ Wednesday 8 October ] the first commercial communication network using unbreakable encryption based on quantum cryptography is demonstrated in Vienna , Austria .
In particular the encryption utilises keys that are generated and distributed by means of quantum cryptographic technologies .
Potential users of this network , such as government agencies , financial institutions or companies with distributed subsidiaries , can encrypt their confidential communication with the highest level of security using the quantum cryptographically generated keys .
The network consists of six nodes and eight intermediary links with distances between 6 km and 82 km ( seven links utilising commercial standard telecommunication optical fibres and one “ free - space ” - link along a line of sight between two telescopes ) .
The links employ altogether six different quantum cryptographic technologies for key generation which are integrated into the network over standardised interfaces .
The network is installed in a standard optical fibre communication ring provided by SECOQC partners , Siemens AG Österreich in Vienna .
Five subsidiaries of Siemens are connected to the network .
The operation of the quantum cryptographic network will be visualised on a screen at the Siemens Forum in Vienna and streamed live over the Internet .
The network - wide key generation and distribution will be demonstrated , the different functionalities of the network itself will be presented as well as utilisation of the keys for standard communication applications .
A voice - over - iptelephone - application will be secured by the information - theoretically secure " one- time - pad- encryption “ while videoconferencing will be protected by symmetrical AES - encryption with frequent key changes .
A low - cost key distributor , with the potential of extending the quantum cryptographic network to the consumer , will also be shown .
Academics at Bristol University led by John Rarity , Professor of Optical Communication Systems in the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering , working on the project have developed a low cost free - space quantum cryptography system , complete with purpose - built software that can operate in daylight conditions .
The system is designed to eventually work in applications where a consumer can regularly ‘ top up ’ a store of secrets for use in a variety of one - time - pad ( OTP ) and authentication protocols .
This system could allow online consumer transactions to be PIN protected for instance .
The user would use secret bits shared with the bank to encode his PIN .
In the framework of the project intensive development of existing and novel quantum cryptographic technologies has allowed the production of high performance , stable and mobile quantum cryptographic devices packed into standard 19 - inch boxes .
Theses devices interoperate seamlessly over standardized interfaces .
The technical descriptions of the different quantum cryptographic technologies used in the network can be found on the projects website at : www.secoqc.net/html/technology … blingtechnology.html
Advantages of Quantum Cryptography
Confidential communication needs encryption in order to ensure that no unauthorised party could misuse the content .
Quantum cryptography provides long - term security and thus conforms to the requirements of a number of recent legal regulations for protecting information .
Quantum cryptographic technologies provide information - theoretically secure keys for encryption .
The basic approach includes sending streams of specially prepared particles of light ( photons ) , their measurement by the legitimate parties and the subsequent post - processing of the measurement data .
The output is the cryptographic key consisting of identical random bit strings .
A potential eavesdropper cannot gain any information on this key irrespectively of his resources .
This property which has no classical counterpart is due to the fundamental laws of quantum physics which ensure that any measurement leaves indelible traces behind .
These traces manifest themselves in an error - rate that can be identified by the legitimate users .
There exists a quantitative relationship between the error - rate and rate of key generation :
In case the error is below a certain upper bound , and therefore the eavesdroppers invention was sufficiently weak , the process of generating the cryptographic key is still possible with the same security standard but at a accordingly reduced rate .
The latter gets equal to zero if the error - rate exceeds the bound .
Advantages of the quantum cryptographic network
Previous developments in quantum cryptography focused on point - to - point connections between only one sender and one receiver and commercial solutions are already available from several companies ( including the SECOQC - Partner id Quantique SA ) .
Although these solutions are suitable for some applications such as connecting two data - centres in a metropolitan area , they cannot address all scenarios requiring secure communication .
These limitations are related to a number of disadvantages of the point - to - point solutions : the maximum distance between sender and receiver is limited due to loss of photons in the optical fibre ; the maximal speed of key generation is relatively low – it is comparable to that of a modem from the 1980 ’s – and the communication can be interrupted by simply cutting the fibre or interfering with the line of sight ( in case of a free - space application ) .
In a network , longer distances can be bridged and alternative paths between sender and receiver can automatically be chosen in order to increase key generation throughput or prevent denial - of - service - attacks even if a communication line is interrupted .
Furthermore , in a network , more than two partners can simultaneously obtain keys for encrypting confidential communication .
This development will open up the possibility for telecom operators to develop novel services and products based on quantum cryptography .

No ... not that kind of floppy ... a disk - type one .
Why is this useful ?
Apparently some BIOS updates still need you to jam in a floppy disk , despite the fact that many a PC nowadays ships without a drive for you to jam the disk into .
So HP 's floppy - emulating USB flash drive gizmo is more a sysadmin 's friend , rather than your average user 's fare , but you can at least switch it over to behaving like a normal flash drive .

what is the best moment of the day ?
midnight , that when I heal my tired body , relax , and yes … I drink maybe alcohol ( I like wine ) .
what kind of music do you listen to at the moment ?
I listen more to the sounds than the music – in its complexity ( rythmn , words , meaning … ) .
I prefer taking it in an abstract way .

no .
what books do you have on your bed side table ?
mostly architecture books .
poor me , because I would prefer to read some poetry .
but recently I am working a lot and time is short .
so I have had to concentrate on some architecture readings .
… honestly I like movies best .

do you notice how women are dressing ?
do you have any preferences ?
it does n’t matter what kind of fashion they wear as long as its suitable for the person .
are there any clothes you would avoid wearing ?

when you were a child did you always want to be an architect ?
no , I never thought of that .
I was born in a very rural area , a small island , I had no ideas of architecture , orto become an architect .
but I always wanted to be creative with my hands .
where do you work on your architectural designs ?
60 - 70 % on the train , moving to the site where I am currently developinga building .
I dont bring my computer , I sketch by hand .
I usually dont do final drawrings from the begining , its more work in progress .
verifying ideas alongside construction .

yes , there is .
I think that the japanese architecture system is very veiled , this means that the outside of a building does not neccessarily reveal how the inside is organised .
after my first projectsI have tried to change this approach .
I came up with the idea of building at a ‘ low cost ’ .
I started collaborating with a lot of good structural engineers reduce costs by changing the construction system .
do you have any advice for the young ?
I think everything is border - less , so do n’t be limited , try to have a wide view and the most important thing is to contribute to society and not to justsatisfy yourself .
what are you afraid of regarding the future ?
I fear natural disasters the most .
in japan , 60 % of the nature is damaged by architecture .
this is a very scary thing , and I ’m a part of it .
therefore I have to be very careful in the future , and to take responsibility in my work .
Attack hoaxing GOP volunteer sprung from jail RAW STORY
Published : Thursday October 30 , 2008
Print This Email This The Republican volunteer who carved a backwards " B " into her face and falsely claimed that a Barack Obama - supporting black man attacker her will not be facing jail time .
The Associated Press reports : Ashley Todd , 20 , of College Station , Texas , claimed the attack happened when the robber saw her McCain bumper sticker .
Todd appeared before a city judge and waived her right to a hearing and was to be released from jail later Thursday .
Under the agreement , her criminal record will be expunged after if she stays out of trouble and gets mental treatment on probation .
Most people spend a year on probation in the program , which is for first - time , nonviolent offenders .
" Our focus was really , ' This is somebody who appeared to have some mental issues , ' " said prosecutor Chris Avetta .
" And we wanted to make sure she does n't hurt herself or anybody else . "
Todd 's public defender , Emily McNally , declined to comment .

While we have n't yet gotten our hands on a Windows 7 build with the new taskbar , we did talk to Microsoft 's Steven Sinofsky about the various UI changes and what we can expect at release time .
It 's not a surprise that the most disruptive Windows UI change in 15 years comes under the watch of the man largely responsible for the Office ribbon .
The ribbon was a jarring change for many users , yet there was no option to turn it off , which made sense to most of us here at Ars .
Many people vehemently disagreed with this decision , and we expect to be hearing from them again on the new taskbar .
Sinofsky told us that there will be no ability to enable the old taskbar since , in Microsoft 's opinion , the new taskbar 's leap in usability negates the need for a " less - able " option .
While there 's not quite as much ingrained taskbar knowledge as there may have been for the various Office toolbars and menus , we expect that this change will be the source of lots of contention .
The Office change seems to have given Microsoft some insight into how its customers will react to disruptive changes , and made the company a little bolder with Windows itself .
Ribbon users generally took between 48 hours and 25 days to see productivity gains , and Microsoft is quick to point out how much time many Office users actually spend in front of Excel .
The implication is that an aggressive taskbar change wo n't be quite as hard to adapt to as the Office ribbon may have been for many users .
Sinofsky 's comments about historical Windows UI changes were informative .
" I think that Windows has had this history of being , sort of , risk averse on change .
And frankly , I feel like we just kind of move stuff around a little and never really fundamentally alter it , " Sinofsky told Ars .
" So people talk about how XP had compatibility mode ... it kind of just turned it gray .
I mean , it really did n't do all that much to make it that much different " .
Over the course of this discussion , we also heard something interesting about the taskbar 's jump list feature .
" The reason [ the jump list feature ] is really cool is because it gives a chance to developers to stop annoying customers , " Sinofsky said .
Current and previous versions of Windows do n't really have a good mechanism for the sort of unobtrusive interaction that jump lists could provide .
To highlight the problems this causes , Sinofsky pointed out that even Windows Live messenger has a window for listing buddies , a notification icon with a basic context menu , and it 's still a window that can be minimized " with bizarre balloon messages if you close it , reminding you that it 's still running . "
With jump lists , developers can just make the window , minimize it , and do everything in one place , leaving the notification area for ... notifications only .
Other Windows 7 UI tidbits
Many of our readers have asked us about multimonitor support for the new Window docking abilities .
We asked about that , and it sounds like window docking will behave in a relatively predictable way with multiple - monitor setups .
If you watch the video of a single - monitor configuration , you 'll notice that dragging a window to one of the side edges of the screen " docks " it , while dragging it to the top edge maximizes it .
In a multimonitor configuration , the screen will be treated as one giant space , with one specific exception .
The outer side edges will result in a " docked " Window that fills the screen it's on , while the top edge will maximize a window to the current screen .
We would have liked to have seen two regions per screen for docking purposes , but they do n't seem to have included that .
There are quite a few big UI changes in Windows 7 that are dependent on developers taking advantage of them .
Microsoft is going to have to lead the way here , since it's the largest Windows software developer ( in addition to , you know , building Windows ) .
Vista had a number of neat features that Microsoft software never took much advantage of ; there were no first - party Office sidebar gadgets , for instance .
We asked Sinofsky if this would be different for Windows 7 , and he basically said that the entire company follows Office , for better or worse , so it will depend on what the Office people do .
They have apparently been included in the design process for some of these changes , which may mean that there 's some hope in this area .
We 're pretty excited to get our hands on the Beta build of Windows 7 that 's supposed to be out in January .
Microsoft confirmed that the UI changes they demonstrated will be available in that build , so it will give us a good chance to put them through their paces and show them in action .
Stackelberg Follower notes that housing prices in Canada continue to not crash .
Should we expect them to ?
Nick Rowe revisits some recent evidence and passes this along :
[ I thank Tsur Somerville for emailed comments on a previous draft of this Note ]
An August 2008 paper by Tsur Somerville and Kitson Swann of the Sauder School of Business UBC presents estimates of the extent to which houses are overpriced in major Canadian cities .
The paper can be found on the website of the Centre for Urban Economics and Real Estate here .
It ’s certainly a very timely paper , on an important topic , and based on a lot of data and careful research .
But the conclusions nevertheless struck me as strange .
They concluded for example that : Toronto houses were not overpriced ; Vancouver houses were 11 % overpriced ; and Ottawa houses were 25 % overpriced ( see their Table 7 ) .
They reach these conclusions despite Vancouver having the lowest ratio of rents to prices ( 3.6 % ) , Toronto having a higher ratio ( 5.2 % ) , and Ottawa having the highest ratio of all nine cities ( 6.5 % ) .
Reading through their paper , I found one assumption in particular that I did n’t like , and which seems to be important in driving their results .
It ’s a nice clear paper , which makes it easy to see how changing the assumptions will affect the conclusions .
What I do here is revise their assumptions to get revised estimates of the extent to which houses are over - priced in nine Canadian cities .
Ignoring property taxes , insurance , structural depreciation and maintenance for the moment , an annual rent / price ratio of 3.6 % means that the rate of return on owning a house ( as opposed to renting a similar house ) is 3.6 % , provided rents and house prices stay constant .
We can compare this own rate of return on housing to the market interest rate to decide if houses are over - priced .
If market interest rates are 7.2 % , for example , then house prices seem to be double what buyers should rationally pay .
But if there is inflation , so that rents and house prices cannot be expected to stay constant , we need to make some sort of adjustment to the rate of return on houses .
Somerville and Swann adjust by adding the expected rate of nominal house price appreciation to the rent / price ratio ( actually , they subtract it from the market rate of interest to get a revised cost of capital , but that amounts to the same thing ) .
They base this estimate of expected house price appreciation on an average of past appreciation in each city , peak - to - peak , and trough - to - trough .
That ’s the assumption of the paper which really worries me .
Based on past appreciation , they assume future appreciation of 5.4 % for Vancouver , which gives a rate of return of 3.6% +5.4%=9 % before costs ( taxes , insurance , structural depreciation and maintenance ) .
The same 5.4 % assumed future appreciation for Toronto pushes the total return before costs on Toronto houses to 5.2%+5.4%=10.6 % , which is what makes Toronto houses seem to be so reasonably priced .
I do n’t buy this assumption about future house price appreciation .
If we could assume there were no bubbles in house prices , so that house prices had always reflected fundamental values , it might be reasonable to extrapolate from past to future appreciation .
But the question of bubbles is exactly what is at issue .
Their use of peak - to - peak and trough - to - trough averages ( rather than a simple trend ) is an attempt to avoid this problem , but I ’m not sure it works .
Also , since overall inflation is likely to be lower in the future than it has been on average over the last 30 years , their approach might overstate future house price appreciation even if there were no bubble .
I replace their assumption with an alternative .
The fundamental value of a house is defined as the present value of the future stream of rents net of costs ( taxes , insurance , structural depreciation and maintenance ) .
If we ignore costs , and assume that rents grow at a constant rate g , the fundamental value can be calculated as F=Rent / ( r - g ) where r is the rate of interest ( we can either use a nominal r and g or a real ( inflation - adjusted ) r and g , it makes no difference ) .
To compare the current price to the fundamental value F , we can then compare ( Rent / Price ) + g to r.
So I am going to revise Somerville and Swann ’s estimates by replacing their future price appreciation estimates with my own rent growth estimates .
I will add the expected growth rate of rents to the rent / price ratio to get my own estimate of the gross rate of return on housing .
Fortunately for me , the UBC Sauder School ’s Centre also has an excellent accessible collection of data , including data on rents in those nine cities .
Eyeballing that data , it is hard to reject the conclusion that real rents have very little long term trend over the last 20 years , though Halifax , Montreal , and Winnipeg real rents have been declining at about 1 % per year .
Even Vancouver real rents show a slight downward trend , and not the upward trend which would warrant a low rent / price ratio based on fundamentals .
But since I can not be sure whether those slight downward trends will continue , for simplicity I will first assume nominal rents will grow at 2 % per year ( the Bank of Canada ’s inflation target ) in all cities .
Despite the absence of any big long - term trend in real rents , my scientific eyeball suggests that Calgary and Edmonton real rents are currently about 10 % above trend .
This makes sense given the recent oil boom , and the fact that house construction cannot immediately increase the supply of housing in response .
But I expect these high rents to be short - lived , and accordingly will consider adjusting the rent / price ratios in those two cities downwards by 10 % to adjust for this .
I have only one minor quibble about Somerville and Swann ’s estimates of the costs of home ownership ( property taxes , insurance , structural depreciation and maintenance ) : they present these costs as an annual percentage of the price of the house .
But if house prices ( say ) halved , many of these costs would stay the same , and so would double as a percentage of the price of the house .
If so , this would mean they underestimate the extent to which house prices might be over - valued compared to fundamentals , but it would not affect whether houses are over - valued .
Accordingly , I will ignore my minor quibble , and take their cost estimates as they are , and subtract those costs from the rent / price ratio to get the net rate of return on housing .
Starting with the rent / price ratio , adding 2 % nominal growth in rents , and subtracting costs , I get the following revised estimates of the net nominal rate of return to buying a house ( remember that a low rate of return means house prices are too high ) :
( Rent / price ) + growth of rents – costs = net rate of return ( nominal )
Calgary 5.0 % +2 % - 3.1 % = 3.9 %
Edmonton 6.4 % +2 % - 3.3 % = 5.1 %
Halifax 6.0 % +2 % - 4.6 % = 3.4 %
Montreal 5.8 % +2 % - 4.3 % = 3.5 %
Ottawa 6.5 % +2 % - 3.9 % = 4.6 %
Regina 5.2 % +2 % - 4.5 % = 2.7 %
Toronto 5.2 % +2 % - 3.2 % = 4.0 %
Vancouver 3.6 % +2 % - 2.1 % = 3.5 %
Winnipeg 6.0 % +2 % - 4.9 % = 3.1 %
If we adjust Edmonton and Calgary rents down by 10 % ( to reflect the reversal of the recent increase ) , we get a revised rate of return of 3.4 % for Calgary , and 4.5 % for Edmonton .
If we assume 1 % rather than 2 % growth rate of rents for Halifax , Montreal and Winnipeg , their rates of return become 2.4 % , 2.5 % , and 2.1 % .
( Since my own house is near Ottawa , I am pleased to see that Ottawa house prices now become the most reasonable , but then everyone thinks that it ’s only everyone else ’s houses that are over - priced . )
Next step is to compare these rates of return to the market rate of interest .
Which market rate of interest ?
For a buyer financing 100 % by borrowing , the relevant interest rate would be a mortgage rate , of ( say ) 6 % .
By this metric , all Canadian cities have house prices which are far too high .
For a buyer with a 100 % down - payment , the after - tax interest rate would be the relevant opportunity cost of capital .
With long term bonds paying ( say ) 4 % , and a buyer in a ( say ) 50 % marginal tax bracket , the after - tax rate of 2 % makes house prices look low .
( This assumes an owner - occupier , who pays no tax on the implicit rental income of the house .
A buy - to - let landlord , who will pay income tax on the rents , and can deduct interest payments , should compare the return on housing to the before - tax rate of interest . )
For equilibrium house prices , what matters is the source of financing for the marginal buyer , who will typically have a large mortgage , and small down - payment , and whose interest rate is a weighted average of the mortgage rate and the after - tax alternative return .
For the marginal buyer , using mostly mortgage financing , Canadian houses look a bit over - priced .
I ’m still not sure I believe those estimates .
They do n’t seem to correspond well across cities to recent price increases .
Differences in costs drive much of the differences in return , and tax differences across cities drive much of the differences in costs .
[ Tsur Somerville notes in correspondence that when you buy a house you also get the option value of redeveloping the site , to earn higher ( implicit or explicit ) rents .
An interesting point , which may lead house prices to appreciate faster than rents .
This effect may be stronger in some cities than others . ]

PLEASE SEE REVISED RODEO PRISON POLICIES
By George Friedman German Chancellor Angela Merkel went to St. Petersburg last week for meetings with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev .
The central question on the table was Germany 's position on NATO expansion , particularly with regard to Ukraine and Georgia .
Merkel made it clear at a joint press conference that Germany would oppose NATO membership for both of these countries , and that it would even oppose placing the countries on the path to membership .
Since NATO operates on the basis of consensus , any member nation can effectively block any candidate from NATO membership .
The fact that Merkel and Germany have chosen this path is of great significance .
Merkel acted in full knowledge of the U.S. view on the matter and is prepared to resist any American pressure that might follow .
It should be remembered that Merkel might be the most pro-American politician in Germany , and perhaps its most pro-American chancellor in years .
Moreover , as an East German , she has a deep unease about the Russians .
Reality , however , overrode her personal inclinations .
More than other countries , Germany does not want to alienate the United States .
But it is in a position to face American pressure should any come .
Energy Dependence and Defense Spending
In one sense , Merkel 's reasons for her stance are simple .
Germany is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas .
If the supply were cut off , Germany 's situation would be desperate — or at least close enough that the distinction would be academic .
Russia might decide it could not afford to cut off natural gas exports , but Merkel is dealing with a fundamental German interest , and risking that for Ukrainian or Georgian membership in NATO is not something she is prepared to do .
She can't bank on Russian caution in a matter such as this , particularly when the Russians seem to be in an incautious mood .
Germany is , of course , looking to alternative sources of energy for the future , and in five years its dependence on Russia might not be nearly as significant .
But five years is a long time to hold your breath , and Germany can't do it .
The German move is not just about natural gas , however .
Germany views the U.S. obsession with NATO expansion as simply not in Germany 's interests .
First , expanding NATO guarantees to Ukraine and Georgia is meaningless .
NATO and the United States do n't have the military means to protect Ukraine or Georgia , and incorporating them into the alliance would not increase European security .
From a military standpoint , NATO membership for the two former Soviet republics is an empty gesture , while from a political standpoint , Berlin sees it as designed to irritate the Russians for no clear purpose .
Next , were NATO prepared to protect Ukraine and Georgia , all NATO countries including Germany would be forced to increase defense expenditures substantially .
This is not something that Germany and the rest of NATO want to do .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , Germany spent 1945 - 1992 being the potential prime battleground of the Cold War .
It spent 1992 - 2008 not being the potential prime battleground .
Germany prefers the latter , and it does not intend to be drawn into a new Cold War under any circumstances .
This has profound implications for the future of both NATO and U.S. - German relations .
Germany is thus in the midst of a strategic crisis in which it must make some fundamental decisions .
To understand the decisions Germany has to make , we need to understand the country 's geopolitical problem and the decisions it has made in the past .
The German Geopolitical Problem Until 1871 , Germany was fragmented into dozens of small states — kingdoms , duchies , principalities , etc. — comprising the remnants of the Holy Roman Empire .
The German - speaking world was torn apart by internal tensions and the constant manipulation of foreign powers .
The southeastern part of the German - speaking world , Austria , was the center of the multinational Hapsburg Empire .
It was Roman Catholic and was continually intruding into the predominantly Catholic regions of the rest of Germany , particularly Bavaria .
The French were constantly poaching in the Rhineland and manipulating the balance of power among the German states .
Russia was always looming to the east , where it bordered the major Protestant German power , Prussia .
( Poland at the time was divided among Prussia , Russia and Austria - Hungary . )
Germany was perpetually the victim of great powers , a condition which Prussia spent the roughly half - century between Waterloo and German unification trying to correct .
To unify Germany , Prussia had to do more than dominate the Germans .
It had to fight two wars .
The first was in 1866 with the Hapsburg Empire , which Prussia defeated in seven weeks , ending Hapsburg influence in Germany and ultimately reducing Austria - Hungary to Germany 's junior partner .
The second war was in 1870 - 1871 , when Prussia led a German coalition that defeated France .
That defeat ended French influence in the Rhineland and gave Prussia the space in which to create a modern , unified Germany .
Russia , which was pleased to see both Austria - Hungary and France defeated and viewed a united Germany as a buffer against another French invasion , did not try to block unification .
German unification changed the dynamic of Europe .
First , it created a large nation in the heart of Europe between France and Russia .
United , Germany was economically dynamic , and its growth outstripped that of France and the United Kingdom .
Moreover , it became a naval power , developing a substantial force that at some point could challenge British naval hegemony .
It became a major exporting power , taking markets from Britain and France .
And in looking around for room to maneuver , Germany began looking east toward Russia .
In short , Germany was more than a nation — it was a geopolitical problem .
Germany 's strategic problem was that if the French and Russians attacked Germany simultaneously , with Britain blockading its ports , Germany would lose and revert to its pre-1871 chaos .
Given French , Russian and British interest in shattering Germany , Germany had to assume that such an attack would come .
Therefore , since the Germans could not fight on two fronts simultaneously , they needed to fight a war pre-emptively , attacking France or Russia first , defeating it and then turning their full strength on the other — all before Britain 's naval blockade could begin to hurt .
Germany 's only defense was a two - stage offense that was as complex as a ballet , and would be catastrophic if it failed .
In World War I , executing the Schlieffen Plan , the Germans attacked France first while trying to simply block the Russians .
The plan was to first occupy the channel coast and Paris before the United Kingdom could get into the game and before Russia could fully mobilize , and then to knock out Russia .
The plan failed in 1914 at the First Battle of the Marne , and rather than lightning victory , Germany got bogged down in a multifront war costing millions of lives and lasting years .
Even so , Germany almost won the war of attrition , causing the United States to intervene and deprive Berlin of victory .
In World War II , the Germans had learned their lesson , so instead of trying to pin down Russia , they entered into a treaty with the Soviets .
This secured Germany 's rear by dividing Poland with the Soviet Union .
The Soviets agreed to the treaty , expecting Adolf Hitler 's forces to attack France and bog down as Germany had in World War I .
The Soviets would then roll West after the bloodletting had drained the rest of Europe .
The Germans stunned the Russians by defeating France in six weeks and then turning on the Russians .
The Russian front turned into an endless bloodletting , and once again the Americans helped deliver the final blow .
The consequence of the war was the division of Germany into three parts — an independent Austria , a Western - occupied West Germany and a Soviet - occupied East Germany .
West Germany again faced the Russian problem .
Its eastern part was occupied , and West Germany could not possibly defend itself on its own .
It found itself integrated into an American - dominated alliance system , NATO , which was designed to block the Soviets .
West and East Germany would serve as the primary battleground of any Soviet attack , with Soviet armor facing U.S. armor , airpower and tactical nuclear weapons .
For the Germans , the Cold War was probably more dangerous than either of the previous wars .
Whatever the war 's outcome , Germany stood a pretty good chance of being annihilated if it took place .
On the upside , the Cold War did settle Franco - German tensions , which were half of Germany 's strategic problem .
Indeed , one of the by - products of the Cold War was the emergence of the European Community , which ultimately became the European Union .
This saw German economic union and integration with France , which along with NATO 's military integration guaranteed economic growth and the end of any military threat to Germany from the west .
For the first time in centuries , the Rhine was not at risk .
Germany 's south was secure , and once the Soviet Union collapsed , there was no threat from the east , either .
United and Secure at Last ?
For the first time in centuries , Germany was both united and militarily secure .
But underneath it all , the Germans retained their primordial fear of being caught between France and Russia .
Berlin understood that this was far from a mature reality ; it was no more than a theoretical problem at the moment .
But the Germans also understand how quickly things can change .
On one level , the problem was nothing more than the economic emphasis of the European Union compared to the geopolitical focus of Russia .
But on a deeper level , Germany was , as always , caught between the potentially competing demands of Russia and the West .
Even if the problem were small now , there were no guarantees that it would n't grow .
This was the context in which Germany viewed the Russo - Georgian war in August .
Berlin saw not only the United States moving toward a hostile relationship with Russia , but also the United Kingdom and France going down the same path .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who happened to hold the rotating EU presidency at the time , went to Moscow to negotiate a cease - fire on behalf of the European Union .
When the Russians seemed unwilling to comply with the terms negotiated , France became highly critical of Russia and inclined to back some sort of sanctions at the EU summit on Georgia .
With the United Kingdom being even more adamant , Germany saw a worst - case scenario looming on the distant horizon :
It understood that the pleasant security of the post - Cold War world was at an end , and that it had to craft a new national strategy .
From Germany 's point of view , the re-emergence of Russian influence in the former Soviet Union might be something that could have been blocked in the 1990s , but by 2008 , it had become inevitable .
The Germans saw that economic relations in the former Soviet Union — and not only energy issues — created a complementary relationship between Russia and its former empire .
Between natural affinities and Russian power , a Russian sphere of influence , if not a formal structure , was inevitable .
It was an emerging reality that could not be reversed .
France has Poland and Germany between itself and Russia .
Britain has that plus the English Channel , and the United States has all that plus the Atlantic Ocean .
The farther away from Russia one is , the more comfortable one can be challenging Moscow .
But Germany has only Poland as a buffer .
For any nation serious about resisting Russian power , the first question is how to assure the security of the Baltic countries , a long - vulnerable salient running north from Poland .
The answer would be to station NATO forces in the Baltics and in Poland , and Berlin understood that Germany would be both the logistical base for these forces as well as the likely source of troops .
But Germany 's appetite for sending troops to Poland and the Baltics has been satiated .
This was not a course Germany wanted to take .
Pondering German History
We suspect that Merkel knew something else ; namely , that all the comfortable assumptions about what was possible and impossible — that the Russians would n't dare attack the Baltics — are dubious in the extreme .
Nothing in German history would convince any reasonable German that military action to achieve national ends is unthinkable .
Nor are the Germans prepared to dismiss the re-emergence of Russian military power .
The Germans had been economically and militarily shattered in 1932 .
By 1938 , they were the major power in Europe .
As long as their officer corps and technological knowledge base were intact , regeneration could move swiftly .
The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and its military power crumbled .
But as was the case in Weimar Germany , the Russian officer corps remained relatively intact and the KGB , the heart of the Soviet state , remained intact if renamed .
So did the technological base that made the Soviets a global power .
As with Germany after both world wars , Russia was in chaos , but its fragments remained , awaiting reconstruction .
The Germans were not about to dismiss Russia 's ability to regenerate — they know their own history too well to do that .
If Germany were to join those who call for NATO expansion , the first step toward a confrontation with Russia would have been taken .
The second step would be guaranteeing the security of the Baltics and Poland .
America would make the speeches , and Germans would man the line .
After spending most of the last century fighting or preparing to fight the Russians , the Germans looked around at the condition of their allies and opted out .
The Germans see their economic commitment as being to the European Union .
That binds them to the French , and this is not a bond they can or want to break .
But the European Union carries no political or military force in relation to the Russians .
Beyond economics , it is a debating society .
NATO , as an institution built to resist the Russians , is in an advanced state of decay .
To resurrect it , the Germans would have to pay a steep economic price .
And if they paid that price , they would be carrying much of the strategic risk .
So while Germany remains committed to its economic relationship with the West , it does not intend to enter into a military commitment against the Russians at this time .
If the Americans want to send troops to protect the Baltics and Poland , they are welcome to do so .
Germany has no objection — nor do they object to a French or British presence there .
Indeed , once such forces were committed , Germany might reconsider its position .
But since military deployments in significant numbers are unlikely anytime soon , the Germans view grand U.S. statements about expanded NATO membership as mere bravado by a Washington that is prepared to risk little .
NATO After the German Shift Therefore , Merkel went to St. Petersburg and told the Russians that Germany does not favor NATO expansion .
More than that , the Germans at least implicitly told the Russians that they have a free hand in the former Soviet Union as far as Germany is concerned — an assertion that cost Berlin nothing , since the Russians do enjoy a free hand there .
But even more critically , Merkel signaled to the Russians and the West that Germany does not intend to be trapped between Western ambitions and Russian power this time .
It does not want to recreate the situation of the two world wars or the Cold War , so Berlin will stay close to France economically and also will accommodate the Russians .
The Germans will thus block NATO 's ambitions , something that represents a dramatic shift in the Western alliance .
This shift in fact has been unfolding for quite a while , but it took the Russo - Georgian war to reveal the change .
NATO has no real military power to project to the east , and none can be created without a major German effort , which is not forthcoming .
The German shift leaves the Baltic countries exposed and extremely worried , as they should be .
It also leaves the Poles in their traditional position of counting on countries far away to guarantee their national security .
In 1939 , Warsaw counted on the British and French ; today , Warsaw depends on the United States .
As in 1939 , these guarantees are tenuous , but they are all the Poles have .
The United States has the option of placing a nuclear umbrella over the Baltics and Eastern Europe , which would guarantee a nuclear strike on Russia in the event of an attack in either place .
While this was the guarantee made to Western Europe in the Cold War , it is unlikely that the United States is prepared for global thermonuclear war over Estonia 's fate .
Such a U.S. guarantee to the Baltics and Eastern Europe simply would not represent a credible threat .
The other U.S. option is a major insertion of American forces either by sea through Danish waters or via French and German ports and railways , assuming France or Germany would permit their facilities to be used for such a deployment .
But this option is academic at the moment .
The United States could not deploy more than symbolic forces even if it wanted to .
For the moment , NATO is therefore an entity that issues proclamations , not a functioning military alliance , in spite of ( or perhaps because of ) deployments in Afghanistan .
Everything in German history has led to this moment .
The country is united and wants to be secure .
It will not play the role it was forced into during the Cold War , nor will it play geopolitical poker as it did in the first and second world wars .
And that means NATO is permanently and profoundly broken .
The German question now turns into the Russian question : If Germany is out of the game , what is to be done about Russia ?

Tacked on last minute to the $ 700 billion bailout , bicycle commuters across the nation will be eligible for for a tax benefit that is already available to both train & bus commuters .
[ social_buttons ]
After $ 700 billion of our American tax dollars just went to bail out private banks , it ’s a small relief that some laws were squeezed into that deal , with the sole purpose of benefiting people and the planet .
Starting January 1st , those who commute via bicycle to work are eligible to receive $ 20.00 per month in tax - free reimbursements from their employer .
The reimbursement is meant to defray the costs of owning and operating a bike .
Employers can deduct this expense from their federal taxes .
“ What this does is to legitimize commuting by bicycle , ” said Robert Rayburn , director of the East Bay Bicycle Coalition .
“ We ’ve already seen a swelling of bicycling commuters on account of the rising gas prices .
Until this change in the tax code , bike commuters have been denied a benefit that public transit riders get . ”
The bicycle tax break was championed by Oregonians .
Advocates of the provision had been trying for seven years to get something similar passed in Washington .
At the last minute of negotiating the $ 700 billion bailout , lawmakers were able to add in their “ pet projects , ” and thus the bicycle commuter tax break is now a reality .
According to the League of American Bicyclists , it ’s estimated that $ 1 million a year might be eliminated from the federal tax roll due to this new employer write off .

Apple has just sent out invites to a special media event on Apple 's campus for October 14 .
The invite reads , " The spotlight turns to notebooks , " and has a ray of light shining over the back of an unidentified Apple notebook .
The invite - only event will be taking place at Apple 's Town Hall in Cupertino on October 14 , 10 am Pacific Time .
As you are likely aware , October 14 has been widely rumored for several weeks now as the official date for Apple 's update to the MacBook and MacBook pro line .
Some of us had our doubts ( myself included ) that such an update would end up being announced during an Apple event , but Apple has come through once again .
What can we expect from this event ?
No one knows for sure , but supposedly leaked photos have been spreading across the web as of late .

" Allowed " ?..
I believe that the DPC site would benefit if there were more interesting / artistic images and less boring / tacky ones .
You yourself wrote that you did n't like this image .
I concluded that we owe it purely to the WPL that this mediocre image was posted to the site .

There is nothing personal , I am only discussing this image , which you have posted for public discussion .

Kris , do n't get me wrong , I also did n't think this showed photographic skills and photographic creativity ( which you obviously have ) and therefore did n't deserve to win on a photography site .

i do n't mean to sound ungrateful ... i'm just surprised it won .
it scored higher than images which were clearly superior ( of course , this is my opinion )
thanks everyone for you kind words
uhhh ..
I guess I 'm a crappy judge of an interesting & compelling image , but I like this FOR THE CHALLENGE it was entered into .
It bums me out to hear you , as the photographer did n't really like it because I think based on the majority of the comments & the fact that it won a ribbon , you and agenkin are in the minority .
It may be cheesy , but it was creative , it was well lit , the focus is perfect & overall based on the merit of the photo , it was well done .
It seems that if you are voting based on comparison 's to other photo's , one might feel it was n't as dramatic or challenging to capture , but that 's not how I vote ..
Besides , we all know what opinions are like ..... ( you can fill in the rest )

You missed the point completely .
I do n't at all wish to discuss your images ( which are quite good , but that 's not the point ) .
You 're statement was that dpchallenge is somehow weaker because I 've submitted an image that is not as good as someone else 's .
You 're reasoning implies that every person new to photography should not participate here because only images which YOU think will benefit the site are allowed .
My image should n't have won ... but it has n't weakened the site , which is the same as saying the site would have benefited without it .
Hilarious that you 're pointing out my bad manners .

It is bad manners to turn a discussion onto the commenter 's own images ; if you feel like discussing them , feel free to post a comment under any of them .
We are talking about * your * entry and your own admission that you submitted something that you yourself considered a bad image into a challenge just for the benefit of your WPL participation .

This is not what I was implying .
My point was that ( if I was reading you correctly ) you would not have submitted this tacky , mediocre image if not for the WPL , which would have been a benefit for the site ( well , at least from where I am standing ) .

By the way , about a third of my keys are still out of order to this day , as this turned out as the solution that FINALLY taught me to type without looking at the keys all the time !

" It 's high time we made it legitimate , " he says of his relationship with partner Brad Altman
George Takei and his soon - to - be - husband Brad Altman are gearing up for their Sunday evening wedding in downtown Los Angeles .
“ We ’ve been living in sin for the past 21 years , ” Takei , 71 , tells PEOPLE .
“ It ’s high time we made it legitimate . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
The wedding party includes two of Takei ’s former Star Trek castmates – best man Walter Koenig , who played Chekov on the series , and Nichelle Nichols , who played Uhura .
( Takei played Mr. Sulu . )
With T - minus a day until the nuptials , Takei summed up his mood as : “ Nervous - ville . ”
His partner , Altman , 54 , is spending what ’s left of the weekend polishing up his vows , which he ’ll recite during the couple ’s Buddhist wedding ceremony .
“ This is going to be the most exciting day of my life , ” he says .
“ I ’m going to be married .
I m the luckiest guy in the world . ”
In May , Takei announced his plans to wed after California ’s Supreme Court allowed gay marriage under the state ’s constitution .
If ACTN3 suggests a child may be a great athlete , he said , parents should take a step back and nurture that potential Olympian or N.F.L. star with careful nutrition , coaching and planning .
He also said they should hold off on placing a child in a competitive environment until about the age of 8 to avoid burnout .
“ Based on the test of a 5 - year - old or a newborn , you are not going to see if you have the next Michael Johnson ; that ’s just not going to happen , ” Mr. Reilly said .
“ But if you wait until high school or college to find out if you have a good athlete on your hands , by then it will be too late .
We need to identify these kids from 1 and up , so we can give the parents some guidelines on where to go from there . ”
Boyd Epley , a former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Nebraska , said the next step would be a physical test he devised .
Atlas plans to direct children to Epic Athletic Performance , a talent identification company that uses Mr. Epley ’s index .
He founded the company ; Mr. Reilly is its president .
China and Russia , Mr. Epley said , identify talent in the very young and whittle the pool of athletes until only the best remain for the national teams .
“ This is how we could stay competitive with the rest of the world , ” Mr. Epley said of genetic and physical testing .
“ It could , at the very least , provide you with realistic goals for you and your children . ”
The ACTN3 test has been available through the Australian company Genetic Technologies since 2004 .
The company has marketed the test in Australia , Europe and Japan , but is now entering the United States through Atlas .
The testing kit was scheduled to be available starting Monday through the Web site atlasgene.com .
The analysis takes two to three weeks , and the results arrive in the form of a certificate announcing Your Genetic Advantage , whether it is in sprint , power and strength sports ; endurance sports ; or activity sports ( for those with one copy of each variant , and perhaps a combination of strengths ) .
A packet of educational information suggests sports that are most appropriate and what paths to follow so the child reaches his or her potential .
The protesters say they will not leave until the PM resigns Flights from Thailand 's international airport have been suspended after hundreds of anti-government protesters stormed the building outside Bangkok .
The demonstrators are in full control of Suvarnabhumi airport , leaving at least 3,000 passengers stranded .
A BBC correspondent says it is the most dramatic move so far in the protesters ' campaign to oust the government .
The government is to hold an emergency cabinet meeting , and the head of the army is due to make a statement .
There is speculation that the army chief may impose emergency rule .
A leader of the protesters has rejected a government offer of talks to end the stand - off .
The head of the anti-government People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , Sondhi Limthongul , said his group would only agree to talks if Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat resigned .
A series of small explosions among the PAD protestors on Wednesday morning injured several people , underlining the risk of more violent clashes with pro-government groups , says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok .
Evacuation Yellow - shirted protestors from the PAD took over strategic areas of the airport , such as the control tower , on Tuesday .
The protesters , who have been occupying a government compound in the capital , claim that the government is corrupt and hostile to the monarchy .
They also accused it of being a proxy for former premier Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a 2006 coup , but who critics say is still very influential .
Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat is Mr Thaksin 's brother - in - law .
AIRPORT SYMBOL
Building the new airport was former PM Thaksin Shinawatra 's pet project Plagued by delays , it opened in 2006 , days after Mr Thaksin was overthrown in a military coup Shoddy construction work was used by the military as one of the justifications for the coup Designed by German architect Helmut Jahn , thought to have the world 's tallest control tower at 132.2 m ( 433.7ft )
One of the busiest airports in Asia
Chaos at seized airport Q&A : Bangkok protests
The PAD is a loose grouping of royalists , businessmen and the urban middle - class opposed to Mr Thaksin .
The protesters had hoped to intercept Mr Somchai as he returned from an Asia - Pacific summit in Peru , but his flight has been diverted elsewhere .
Now the PAD says it will keep the airport closed until Mr Somchai resigns .
" We will stay until the government steps down .
This government is not legitimate , " retired university lecturer Sunthorn Kaewlai told the Reuters news agency .
The PAD also handed out leaflets to stranded passengers , apologising to tourists for the disruption , adding that " the alliance believes the measure is crucial to bring an end to the traitorous killer government " .
Reports say the authorities have begun evacuating stranded passengers .
However , the evacuation appeared chaotic , with the authorities making no announcement , the Agence France Presse news agency reported .
Christopher Persson , from Sweden , spent the night underneath a check - in desk .
" I understand the people but the airlines are terrible .
They 've given us no information , " he told the Reuters news agency .
Thousands of other passengers spent the night sprawled across suitcases , luggage carts and even security conveyor belts .
Provocation ?
Airport director Serirat Prasutanon said operations had been " totally shut down " since early on Wednesday , and that 78 outbound and incoming flights had been affected .
" We are trying to negotiate with them to allow outgoing passengers stranded by the protest to fly , " he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " The incident has damaged Thailand 's reputation and its economy beyond repair . "
Organisers say the protest is a " final battle " to bring down the government .
Our correspondent says that the government appears to have followed a strategy of allowing the PAD to attack government buildings while avoiding clashes , in the hope that it will wear the protesters down .
The government has so far resisted calling in the army .
Analysts says it is a thinly disguised aim of the PAD to provoke such a move .

In August I complained about vague LHC forecasts .
My oped based on that post just appeared in Symmetry , " A joint Fermilab / SLAC publication . "
Its blurb : " Today ’s LHC forecasts are no easier to score than the typical horoscope . "
It ends :
But geez – the LHC costs more than $ 10 billion of public money .
Should n’t we expect big - shot physicists who hope to crow to the public about LHC vindication to express their predictions in a more scoreable form ?
We do n’t accept less from weather , business , or sport forecasters ; why accept less from physicists ?
My implicit answer : we hold physicists to lower standards .
As I posted two years ago :
Consider how differently the public treats physics and economics .
Physicists can say that this week they think the universe has eleven dimensions , three of which are purple , and two of which are twisted clockwise , and reporters will quote them unskeptically , saying " Is n’t that cool ! "
But if economists say , as they have for centuries , that a minimum wage raises unemployment , reporters treat them skeptically and feel they need to find a contrary quote to " balance " their story .
That same Symmetry issue says :
Leon Lederman , a 1988 Nobel laureate and Fermilab physicist , plopped a folding table and two chairs on a busy New York City street corner and sat under colorful hand - scrawled signs offering to answer physics questions .
Even in a city of people too busy for impromptu sidewalk conversations , the sight was too tempting to resist .
…
Soon about 20 people formed a line down the block .
They asked Lederman about the strong force , time and space , fusion , and even time travel .
Some asked follow - up questions to get a clearer understanding , while others just seemed thrilled at the chance to meet a Nobel Prize winner .
I ’ll bet none told Lederman he was wrong .
Imagine how a Nobel - winning economist would be received .

Big business was granted wide access to Sarah Palin ’s office during her first 20 months as Alaska governor , but she rarely met with labor , environmental or other groups pressing alternative views , her official calendar shows .
On at least three dozen occasions , Palin , now the Republican vice presidential nominee , spoke with executives and lobbyists working for an array of energy , mining and tourism firms with major investments in Alaska .
Among those who visited Palin ’s Juneau office multiple times were the chief executives of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips , as well as several dozen other top oil and gas company officials .
“ We have not had problems with access to Gov. Palin or her key department people , ” said Ashley Reed , a lobbyist who was on a team of natural - gas officials who met with Palin in April 2007 .
Reed was working with Enstar , a gas firm seeking approval for a natural - gas “ bullet ” pipeline .
Advertisement
Despite that access , however , Palin has cut an independent course on oil and gas issues -- which has won wide acclaim from Alaskans .
She forced the companies to share windfall profits with the state , moved to pull the lucrative leases of those that were not actively exploring for oil and chose a Canadian firm to manage a major gas pipeline project .
Still , Palin has held few meetings with groups holding alternative views .
Her calendar shows that Palin met four times in those 20 months with officials from the Teamsters , who endorsed her 2006 gubernatorial bid , and the AFL - CIO .
She also held two sessions with members of a conservation group seeking state support in addressing climate change -- an issue on which Palin does not see eye to eye with environmentalists .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t think we ’ve had the time we need to press the importance of our issues , ” said Kate Troll , executive director of the Alaska Conservation Alliance .
The activists have not been granted a follow - up to a February 2007 meeting with the governor “ despite multiple requests , ” said Peter Van Tuyn , an Alaska environmental lawyer .
In an August interview with National Public Radio before being named John McCain ’s running mate , Palin declared : “ I ’ve had about two lobbyists , two , maybe three lobbyists who have snuck in [ to her statehouse office ] with a group of people .
So I ca n’t say they ’ve never been in , but we do n’t invite lobbyists in . ”
According to her calendar , however , Palin has met with more than a dozen registered lobbyists since taking office in December 2006 .
Taylor Griffin , a McCain campaign spokesman in Anchorage , insisted that Palin “ has a policy that she does not meet with lobbyists .
As governor , she has hundreds of meetings and , as she concedes , occasionally a lobbyist slips through . ”
Advertisement
But the policy “ was never clearly articulated , ” a former senior aide said .
“ It did n’t get applied consistently . ”
Though some veteran lobbyists have complained about being effectively barred from Palin ’s office , Reed and several others said Palin ’s aides were aware before the meetings that lobbyists would be coming .
“ My personal experience is they ’ve always welcomed discussions , ” Reed said .
In several cases , registered lobbyists met with Palin and returned for second sessions .
Advertisement
Robert A. Evans , a veteran lobbyist in Anchorage , and several Safeway supermarket executives met with Palin on April 17 , 2007 .
Eight days later , Evans returned to her office with a team of executives from Agrium , an ammonia and fertilizer operation .
Lisa Parker , an Agrium executive who also is a registered lobbyist , was among them .
Evans confirmed the meetings but otherwise declined to comment .
The Times obtained Palin ’s calendar under a Freedom of Information Act request .
The governor ’s office turned down a similar request for calendars and schedules pertaining to her husband , Todd Palin , who reportedly has played a prominent role in her decision - making .
Gov.
Palin ’s office said her husband does not keep a calendar .
Advertisement
In addition to meetings with big business and lobbyists , Palin ’s calendar indicates that she filled her daily schedules with dozens of media interviews .
That access seems a far cry from her recent complaints that the national media has “ filtered ” her message as a vice presidential candidate .
According to aides , Palin wooed reporters in Juneau with plates of brownies and telephone calls on their birthdays .
Courting the Alaska press proved to be a key component of her soaring popularity in the state -- long before she struggled during interviews with national television anchors Katie Couric and Charles Gibson .
Advertisement
“ She craved publicity and the poll ratings that came with it , ” said Larry Persily , a former Alaska journalist who worked for Palin in Alaska ’s state office in Washington until earlier this year .
The calendar also details Palin ’s frequent stays at her home in Wasilla , Alaska -- which became a source of controversy when it was learned that she collected per diem allowances while away from the governor ’s mansion in Juneau .
Palin received a $ 60 stipend for each of the hundreds of days she worked out of Anchorage and stayed at home , about an hour away .
Alaska officials said she is entitled to the per diem when she works outside the state capital , and Griffin added that Palin has spent much less on travel and security arrangements than her Republican predecessor , Frank Murkowski .
Advertisement
Palin collected the per diem for six days around Christmas 2007 when she had no events listed on her official calendar .
She was paid for Christmas Eve and New Year ’s Eve but did not seek stipends for Christmas or New Year ’s Day .
Her official work away from Juneau for which she received stipends included visits to libraries in Wasilla and nearby Palmer , a stop at the annual Bear Paw Festival in Eagle River and attendance at the Moose Dropping Festival in Talkeetna .

Seattle - based Cray has been wowing us with massive , ridiculously fast supercomputers since the ' 70s , establishing a position for its machines high on every geek 's most wanted list -- despite never publishing a Doom benchmark .
In recent years the title of " world 's fastest " supercomputer had been lost by the company , ping - ponging from Wako , Japan to Armonk , NY , but is now back in Cray 's hands with the implementation of the XT Jaguar .
It 's comprised of over 45,000 quad - core Opteron processors , 362TB of memory , and has a 10 PB ( petabyte ) storage array , able to perform calculations at a massive 1.64 petaflops .
That 's over one and a half quadrillion operations per second and more than 50 percent faster than IBM 's previous heavyweight .
Mind you , Cray is quick to point out that this is the fastest machine being used for non-classified research , a caveat that just makes us even more curious about what 's keeping the Pentagon 's server rooms warm and loud ... and apparently orange .
That should be 362 terabytes of memory , not mere gigabytes .

The Secret To Happiness
September 29 , 2008 at 3:14 am
The American Dream tells us we are free to pursue happiness , but does n’t give us instructions .
Even life - changing events such as winning the lottery have been shown ( Brickman 1978 ) to only increase happiness in the short - term .
The secret to long term happiness is a concept that seems too sacred to be studied and dissected .
However , many researchers devote themselves to this topic , and this paper by Sheldon and Lyubomirsky presents a nice theory about sustainable happiness .
This elusive goal is difficult , and may be impossible .
Many past studies have shown that each person has a base level of happiness which they can only deviate from temporarily .
Even more unfortunate , is that this base level of happiness is 50 - 80 % inherited .
The researchers in this paper divided events that increase your well - being into : activity changes ( intentional acts such as exercising ) and circumstantial changes ( such as being assigned a great roommate ) .
They performed 3 studies on psychology students who had recently experienced an increase in well - being .
These studies showed that sustainable happiness was only possible through activity changes .
Intentional changes resulted in a bigger boost in happiness and more varied experiences .
After a period of time , those who experienced the increase in well - being because of an activity change retained their increase more than those who experienced the increase because of a circumstantial change .
The ones who became happier by chance became accustomed to the change and were no longer affected by it .
There is no shortcut — effort and hard work are the best route to happiness .
Sheldon , K & Lyubomirsky , S. ( 2006 ) .
Achieving sustainable gains in happiness : Change your actions , not your circumstances .

From Larry King Live Nov. 25 , 2008 while discussing the potential stimulus package Obama is proposing , Bay Buchanan suddenly finds religion on government waste , cronyism and corruption .
This Republican cheerleader suddenly does n't like that these things might go on when she sat silent about them all through the Bush administration .
Bay , where were you at while they were playing football with pallets full of our money in Iraq and while Halliburton was blowing up $ 70,000 trucks at cost plus to our government ?
Where were you when they were giving no bid contracts for Gulf Coast reconstruction and they used about ten middle men in the process before finally hiring some illegal alien to do the actual work and stealing our tax dollars ?
I could go on , and I 'm sure the readers here can give a longer list of the things that Republicans have ignored while Bush was in charge of the theft of our tax dollars .
To see the feigned outrage from those who cheered Bush along the entire way now that we 're in a mess of Bush 's making so huge it's hard to imagine how we 'll come out of it is nothing short of infuriating .
Bay , you 're a day late and way more than a dollar short .
Yesterday I wrote Essence of the " Rescue " Plan .
Here once again is the pertinent snip .
To stimulate lending , the bailout plan will attempt to recapitalize banks .
The method of recapitalization is best described as robbing Taxpayer Pete to pay Wall Street Paul .
In essence , money is taken from the poor ( via taxes , printing , and weakening of the dollar ) and given to the wealthy so the wealthy supposedly will have enough money to lend back ( at interest ) to those who have just been robbed .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama on Monday called on voters to “ turn the page ” on the policies of the Bush administration as he emphasized his message of change in a closing argument for the presidential campaign .
With eight days left before Election Day , the Illinois senator laid blame for the deepening financial crisis on U.S. President George W. Bush and said Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s approach on the economy would mirror Bush’s .
“ Sen . McCain has served this country honorably .
And he can point to a few moments over the past eight years where he has broken from George Bush -- on torture , for example , ” Obama said in excerpts from a speech he is to deliver later in Canton , Ohio .
“ He deserves credit for that .
But when it comes to the economy -- when it comes to the central issue of this election -- the plain truth is that John McCain has stood with this president every step of the way , ” Obama said .
The Ohio speech has been billed by the Obama campaign as a “ closing argument ” for the candidate and one he will emphasize in a 30 - minute prime - time television advertisement on Wednesday .

Obama , seeking to become the first black U.S. president , is leading McCain in both national opinion polls and in surveys of many of the crucial battleground states that will decide the election .
Obama held steady with a 5 - point lead over McCain among likely U.S. voters nationally in a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby national tracking poll released on Monday .
McCain , an Arizona senator , has described himself and running mate Sarah Palin as mavericks and said he has shown a willingness throughout his career to break with his Republican Party , including with Bush .
McCain has said Obama does not have a track record of bucking his own party .
But Obama took at aim at McCain ’s proposal for cuts in corporate tax rates and his opposition to rolling back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans , saying they represented a “ tired , old ” approach on the economy .
“ In one week , you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of Wall Street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on Main Street , ” Obama told voters .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A company that harnesses bacteria - killing viruses said on Saturday it has devised a test that can detect dangerous staph infections within hours .
This could allow doctors to begin treating patients right away with the correct drugs , instead of waiting the usual two to three days for a test that grows the germs in test tubes , the researchers said .
The test detects Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in blood within five hours , Longmont , Colorado - based MicroPhage Inc told a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America .
Older tests require a blood culture , in which labs try to grow bacteria in a dish .
At least two other companies -- Cepheid and Becton , Dickinson and Co -- had fast tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year .
More than 94,000 life - threatening infections and nearly 19,000 deaths in the United States were caused by drug - resistant staph infections in 2005 , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Bacteria undamaged by the antibiotic methicillin , called methicillin - resistant Staph aureus infections , or MRSA for short , accounted for 63 percent of new hospital - acquired infections in 2004 .
“ MRSA infections are best treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics , but infections by methicillin - susceptible strains are best treated with narrow - spectrum antibiotics , ” MicroPhage said in a statement .
The MicroPhage test requires two test tubes .
“ One tube determines whether or not the sample contains S. aureus bacteria ; the other determines whether the bacteria are antibiotic - resistant or susceptible , ” the statement said .
Reverse engineering is one of the skills necessary on many Linux software projects , because many file formats have no open specifications .
Even if we have a specification , we will probably have to reverse engineer certain portions to learn all the details .
Reverse engineering is a rewarding experience .
Not only do we learn something in detail , but it is satisfying to offer Linux users access to previously unsupported devices .
This article discusses the specific example of reverse engineering the iTunesDB file format used by the Apple iPod portable MP3 player .
Although this example covers a file format , we can use similar techniques for device drivers and network streams .
The key strategies for reverse engineering are hypothesis , pattern recognition and validation .
We use hypotheses to guess what will be in the file .
All files contain repeated patterns , and recognizing those patterns is the key to reverse engineering .
Validation consists of developing software to check whether a file conforms to a format .
If we can tell that a file is valid , we understand the format .
We need a hypothesis for the types of information an unknown file format contains .
We know that an iPod plays digital music and the songs can be organized into playlists .
Because we can't find any other files on the iPod hard disk for storing this information , we guess that it will be in the iTunes DB file .
The goal of trying to find song and playlist information narrows our search when we look for patterns in the file .
Although every file format contains repeated patterns , the trick is recognizing these patterns and learning how to parse them .
Opening a file in a hex editor allows us to examine the raw data for patterns .
Figure 1 contains the first 256 bytes of an iTunes DB file as shown by Emacs in hexl - mode .
The first column is the file position ; then there are eight columns , each column containing two bytes .
The final column is the ever - helpful ASCII representation of the data .
Figure 1 . First 256 Bytes of the iTuneDB File
From only the first 256 bytes , a pattern emerges : three 5 - byte sequences start with “ mh ” ( 0x6d68 ) .
When we scan the rest of the file , we find it littered with 5 - byte mh sequences ( see Figure 2 ) .
Based on the number of mh byte sequences we see in the file , we hypothesize that these sequences are a marker for a data structure .
We do n't know if the data structure has a fixed or varying size .
Perhaps it is only five bytes long and the information between the mh sequences is composed of other data structures .
To help us determine this information , we will extract the first 15 mh sequences from the file ( Figure 3 ) .
Figure 2 . 5 - Byte mh Sequences
Figure 3 . First 15 mh Sequences
The numbers 0x9c and 0x18 do not translate to “ . ” using ASCII ( the ASCII code for . is 0x2e ) .
So , we follow the Emacs example and use .
for anything out of the range of standard ASCII characters .
Although we have only a few data points , we find multiple potential patterns .
Certain sequences are repeated , such as “ mhod . ” and “ mhit . ” .
In fact , both of the mhit .
sequences are followed by mhod .
sequences .
Perhaps the patterns exist throughout the file .
Before sifting through hundreds of kilobytes in a hex editor , it is a good idea to consider using the third reverse engineering strategy : validation .
A great way to test out hypotheses is to write a validation program , and the sooner the better .
The goal of the validation program is to parse the file and determine if it is valid using various tests derived from pattern recognitions and hypotheses .
The first iterations of the validation program will have few tests ( if any ) that are correct , but as we come to understand the format , the program evolves into a compliance tester .
It is then useful for checking software that modifies files of this format , because we can use it to ensure that our changes are valid .
Our first validation program will display information ( shown in Figure 4 ) about all the mh chunks in the file to help us find patterns .
The first glaring pattern we see pertains to the difference between the file positions of the mh chunks .
With the exception of the mhod chunks , the fifth byte contains the number of bytes until the next mh chunk .
We can add code to our validation program to check this pattern , and we find that this is almost the case : there are a few chunks besides the mhod chunks that fail our test .
It is unlikely that the creators of the iTunesDB file format would limit the size of a data structure to 256 bytes , thus we are probably dealing with a multibyte number .
Figure 4 . Results of Validation Program
As soon as the word “ multibyte ” crosses our mind , we must consider the endianness of the file .
If this first byte is part of a multibyte number , it is the least significant byte , thus a little endian number .
If one number in the file is little - endian , the whole file will be little - endian .
Only a sadistic designer would create a mixed - endian file format .
Bytes six , seven and eight are almost always zero , so we guess the chunk size is a 4 - byte number .
Figure 5 contains a diagram of our theory for the basic building block of the file format .
When we change our validation program to use a 4 - byte number for the chunk size , the test is successful for all non -mhod chunks .
Figure 5 . Theory of File Format
Reverse engineering requires us to oscillate between our three strategies in order to decipher the file format .
We will continue to employ these strategies to discover more details .
We wrote software that can parse the file format into data chunks of variable size and type .
We would like to know what every byte in the chunk signifies , and this requires more hypotheses , pattern recognitions and validations .
We start at the top of the file and focus on the mhbd chunk .
Given its frequency and its location at the start of the file , it probably contains header information for the whole file .
We know it is 0x68 bytes long , and we accounted for only eight of those bytes with our standard tag and chunk length fields .
Everything else thus far consists of 4 - byte numbers and we have a multiple of four bytes left , so we will break up the remaining 96 bytes into 24 4 - byte numbers , as shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 . The Remaining 96 Bytes
The size in bytes of the example iTunesDB file is 571,616 .
We can add a test to the validation program and verify that n1 is the file size for all iTunes DB files .
The n2 , n3 , n4 trio resembles a version number ( 1.1.2 ) .
Looking at multiple iTunesDB files teaches us that n2 through n4 changes to 1.2.2 for iTunesDB files from newer iPods.
n5 to n24 are always zero .
Storing the file size in the header is a curious action .
We determined a consistent pattern for the first eight bytes of an mh chunk ; perhaps bytes 9 - 12 are consistent for all mh chunks .
We modify our validation program to spit out the value of bytes 9 - 12 for all mh chunks ( see Figure 7 for results ) .
Figure 7 . Value of Bytes 9-12
When we add n1 to the file position of the mhbd chunk , we get to the end of the file .
Adding n1 to the mhod chunk position is the position of the next mh chunk .
For mhsd , adding 0x73048 to 0x68 is 0x730b0 .
Going to that file position in our hex editor shows us that at 0x730b0 is the start of another mhsd chunk .
The n1 plus file position value for mhit , mhyp and mhip chunks is consistent with the one for mhbd , mhsd and mhod .
Figure 8 contains an example of the relationship between these chunks .
For mhlt and mhlp , the position at n1 plus the mhlt / mhlp file position is in the middle of a chunk .
The n1 value for mhlt in this example is 755 , which is the number of mhit chunks in the file .
The n1 value for mhlp is 4 , which is the number of mhyp chunks .
These relationships suggest a nested data structure .
If we use the n1 size to determine parent - child relationships between mh chunks , we can create the tree diagram shown in Figure 9 .
The symmetry looks too good to be wrong , so we 'll stick with it as our theory unless we find data later on that convinces us otherwise .
Figure 8 . The Relationship between the mhit , mhyp and mhip Chunks and the mhbd , mhsd and mhod Chunks
Figure 9 . Parent - Child mh Chunks
Going down the tree one level from mhbd , we have a pair of mhsd nodes , each 104 bytes long .
Breaking the data after the initial 12 bytes into 4 - byte numbers shows us that only the first 4 - byte number contains any non-null data .
It equals one when the child node is mhlt and two when the child node is mhlp .
Figure 10 contains a description of the mhsd chunk .
Figure 10 .
The mhsd Chunk
Continuing down to the next level , we find the mhlt and mhlp nodes .
We can verify that following the number of children they end with 80 null bytes , as shown in Figure 11 .
Figure 11 .
The mhlt and mhlp Nodes
The children of the mhlt node are mhit nodes .
The number of mhit nodes corresponds to the number of songs on the iPod .
Dividing the first mhit chunk into 4 - byte unsigned integers yields the diagram in Figure 12 .
Figure 12 .
Dividing the First mhit Chunk into 4 - byte Unsigned Integers
The only number that looks at all familiar simply by its magnitude is n6 .
In UNIX , time is usually determined as the number of seconds since the Epoch ( 00:00:00 UTC , January 1 , 1970 ) .
In Apple 's HFS + filesystem , however , time is stored as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC , January 1 , 1904 .
Converting 3090924135 to a date yields December 11 , 2001 , 06:02:15 .
We can't make much sense of the rest of these numbers yet , but by looking at many mhit chunks we notice that n1 equals the number of mhod children , n3 is always one , and n4 is always zero .
Perhaps by looking at the mhod children of the mhit chunks we can learn what the unknown mhit values signify .
Indeed , a cursory look at some mhod chunks ( see Figure 13 ) indicates they contain variable - length text after them .
Figure 13 . mhod Children of mhit Chunks
We know that n1 of the mhod chunk ( see Figure 14 ) tells us how long the mhod chunk is including the text data .
We need a hypothesis for what the remaining 12 bytes contain .
Figure 14 . n1 of mhod Chunks
By reading the text , we see the artist , album and title strings are included , among others .
The software needs to know what type of string it is for the string to be useful .
This information could be provided by always having the strings in the same order : album , title , artist , genre and so on , but what if a song did n't have an album ?
It is more likely , then , that the type of string is encoded in the chunk somewhere .
n2 looks like a good candidate .
Looking at the strings and the n2 value , we determine the relationship shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 . The n2 Value and Description
The text data is not pure ASCII because the letters ( in this example ) are separated by a null byte .
As there are two bytes for every letter , we assume we are dealing with a multibyte representation of text , most likely a Unicode encoding .
There are 16 bytes before the text starts , however , that we have n't accounted for them .
Figure 15 contains the 16 unknown bytes for the four mhod blocks shown in Figure 13 .
Figure 15 .
The 16 Unknown Bytes for the Four mhod Blocks Shown in Figure 13
We find a 4 - byte number that is always one , a varying 4 - byte number and 64 bits of zero .
On closer inspection , the second number seems to vary with the length of the subsequent string and is , in fact , its length in bytes .
We will add a test to our validation program to check if this is true for all mhod strings .
Our validation program finds text data chunks where the first number is zero instead of one .
These follow mhod chunks where the type is 100 , probably an empty string type .
Figure 16 contains a complete description of the mhod chunks .
Figure 16 .
The Complete mhod Chunk
We can use the mhod children of the mhit chunks to figure out which songs relate to which mhit chunks .
This helps us figure out the rest of the mhit chunk : n5 changes based on the file type ; n7 is the size of the song 's file .
n8 is the duration of the song in milliseconds .
n9 is the track number .
n 12 is the bit rate .
See Figure 17 for a diagram of the mhit data chunk .
Figure 17 .
The mhit Data Chunk
Our analysis of the left side of the tree is complete , and using it we can find the information for all the songs on the iPod .
Earlier we hypothesized that the other main use of the iTunesDB file is for playlists , so we will look for playlist information in the right side of the tree .
Hoping for symmetry , we want to find one mhyp chunk for each playlist , as there was one mhit chunk for each song .
Looking around , we know this iPod has three playlists yet there are four mhyp chunks .
When we run our validation program on a variety of iTunesDB files , we learn there is always one more mhyp chunk than the number of playlists .
We will use our validation program to display information about the children of the mhyp chunks .
It shows us that every mhyp chunk has a first child that is an empty string mhod chunk ( type 100 ) with a mysterious extra 604 null bytes .
Then it has an mhod chunk with a string in it .
For the first mhyp chunk , this is the name of the iPod ; for every other mhyp chunk it is the name of a playlist .
After the name mhod chunk comes a series of mhip and mhod pairs , until the next mhyp chunk .
The mhod portion of the pair is an empty string .
The number of these pairs is equal to the number of songs in the playlist .
As far as the first playlist is concerned , it has the same number of mhip / mhod pairs as there are songs on the iPod .
Thus , we can theorize that this first playlist is a master playlist containing one entry for every song on the iPod .
We know that a playlist is a named list of songs with a title .
We found the name already , but we need to figure out how the list of songs is stored .
We start by looking at the mhip chunk in Figure 18 .
n5 is the same order of magnitude as the date we found earlier .
We saw n4 ( 2626 ) in the mhit data at n2 .
Thus , we can guess that n4 is a song identification number and that the mhip chunks use song identification numbers to specify which songs are in the playlist .
We can add a test to the validation program to match n4 in the mhip chunks , with n2 in the mhit chunks to confirm our theory .
Figure 18 .
The mhip Chunk
The remaining mhip mystery is that the n3 number is similar in magnitude to the song key , n4 .
If we change our test program to look for songs whose key is the number following the key we already found , we wo n't find any songs with these identification numbers in any iTunes DB file .
We can deduce , then , that it is a unique identification number for these chunks .
Adding a test to our validation program confirms they are indeed unique .
Figure 19 contains a diagram of the mhip data chunk .
Figure 19 .
The mhip Data Chunk
The mhyp chunk ( see Figure 20 ) is the final chunk we need to evaluate .
n 1 is always 2 . n2 is the number of songs in the playlist .
The master playlist has n3 set to 1 ; all other playlists have it set to 0 .
n4 is a date , probably the date the playlist was created .
n5 and n6 are the same for every mhyp chunk , and 72 null bytes always follow them .
Figure 20 .
The mhyp Chunk
Using the three reverse engineering strategies of hypothesis , pattern recognition and validation , we deciphered the iTunes DB file format .
Hopefully the ideas presented here will help Linux users reverse engineer more devices and file formats to make them compatible with Linux .
Responding to criticism from Democrats , campaign aides to Gov. Sarah Palin on Tuesday defended her practice of billing Alaska taxpayers for more than 300 nights she spent at home in her first year - and - a - half in office .
Ms. Palin received a “ per diem ” expense allowance for 312 nights she spent at her home in Wasilla , The Washington Post reported on Tuesday .
The $ 60 - a- day allowance is available for state employees when traveling on official state business to cover meals and other sundry expenses .
Ms. Palin ’s per diems , which included some charges for partial days , totaled $ 17,059 , from Dec. 4 , 2006 , when she took office , through June 30 , 2008 , the most recent data available , according to Sharon Leighow , a spokeswoman for the governor ’s office .
Ms. Palin ’s salary is $ 125,000 a year .
Ms. Palin was able to receive the allotment while she was at home because her official “ duty station ” is listed as Juneau , the state capital , aides said .
That allowed Ms. Palin to file for per diems while she was working out of her Anchorage office and commuting from her home about 45 miles away in Wasilla .
Juneau is nearly 600 miles away .
AN ESSAY ON MURDER , MEDIA MAYHEM AND
THE CONDITION OF THE CULTURE
by
Michael Tracey
FOR PATSY RAMSEY , SHERRY KEENE - OSBORNE , and BARB SMITH
Courageous and Good Ladies All
Oft in the stilly night ,
Ere Slumbers ’ chain has bound me ,
Fond memory brings the light
Of other days around me ;
The smiles , the tears ,
Of boyhood ’s years ,
The words of love then spoken ;
The eyes that shone ,
Now dimmed and gone ,
The cheerful hearts now broken !
– ( Thomas Moore : 1779 – 1852 )
* * *
This long essay was originally intended to be a short memoir .
It did not work out that way .
It has evolved , for good or ill , into a work of parts , and can be read as such .
* * *
In late 2006 Professor Michael Murray , of the University of Illinois , asked me to contribute a chapter for a book he is editing on crime and the media .
It would be an account of a curious , singular event I happened to get caught up in , an event that in a sense began in 1997 , but took an unfortunate turn in 2006 .
Writing it , he suggested , might even be therapeutic .
He was correct .
But as I started to write it almost inevitably grew , moving in various directions , as the narrative which I initially wrote raised questions that begged explanation .
The account of the “ event ” is told in narrative form .
The essay then shifts direction , to engage what is to this mind ’s eye , more substantive issues that not only do I want to raise but which I take be of considerably greater importance than the dark dance that occupied my life for a miserable , harmful year , indeed ten years .
Inevitably , then , the style changes , or evolves , from a narrative of unfolding events to an examination of larger social and cultural issues , reflecting my long held belief that the only reason to examine , pick apart , the particular is better to understand the general .
Blake put it best in his admonition : “.. to see the world in a grain of sand , to hold infinity in the palm of your hand . ”
In this case the particular was the murder , on Christmas night 1996 , of JonBenet Ramsey and the August 2006 arrest of a person claiming to have killed her “ accidentally . ”
The general is the meaning of the national , indeed global , reaction to these two events .
This was not , however , an act of scholarly whimsy , of knowingly using an account of dreadful tragedy as a tool to go where I “ really ” wanted to go .
It was , in truth , a deeply personal experience out of which , by happenstance , I was able to think through other questions which I have long pondered and never quite resolved , issues of the nature of our culture , a condition defined not just by the stuff of its content , or of how it comes to be what it is , but also by what one might call its mood , its psychology and morality , its texture if you will .
Perhaps , within all of this , what I really wanted to get to grips with was something I have long detected , and been massively disappointed by , the sense that there is within the public mind and heart , within the societal corpus , an anger that seeks the balm of calm through occasional explosive , emotional fury , a fury which is , by the way , ever so open to manipulation – as we have seen of late .
The need to engage with these questions of the condition of American culture and the role of the media in defining that condition comes naturally .
I am at one level simply intellectually curious about the world around me , always have been , and for that I make no apology .
There was , however , I understand and will admit , another purpose , another need to know the forces forming and , to my way of thinking , distorting , this society , drawn from the well of my childhood .
295 Shaw Road
A few miles from where I was born , in the English working class community of Oldham , an old cotton spinning town that went into steep decline in the early 1950s and which has been trying to climb out of the pit of industrial failure ever since , is Moston Cemetery .
My father is buried there .
I was 4 years old , he was thirty one when he died .
He was in the Royal Air Force and burnt to death when his plane smashed into the side of a Welsh mountain .
I have a feeling that he did n’t want to be in the RAF but it was 1952 , he was working class , the prospects outside were n’t great .
He chose to stay in the service , he died and I never knew him .
I have no memory , no picture gallery of the mind to occasionally roam through .
He was too young to die and I was too young to have been deprived of his presence .
Never a day has passed , nary a moment when I don ’ t think of him .
I miss him desperately , and I ’m old enough now to understand and , more importantly , to acknowledge that his loss impacted , scarred , my whole life .
It was unfair , just as the loss of the young always seems so unfair , like acid poured into an open , never to be closed , festering wound .
Such loss is unfair , and we lash out against it because it offends against a core thesis of our world , that death is not for the young .
After his death my mother and I moved in with my grandparents .
They were kind and I loved them very much .
The physical circumstances were , however , to say the least meager .
295 Shaw Road was a 19th century terraced house , what would be called a row house here , built by cotton factory owners to house the workforce .
It had been condemned many years before I was born but still stood there , a defiant reminder of an age long gone except in the hearts and minds and moods of those who lived within its cramped , damp space .
It was what we called “ 2 up , 2 down , ’ that is , 2 bedrooms upstairs , a downstairs living room and a kitchen .
There was only running cold water , a coal fire and an outside toilet .
I lived there , sharing a room with my mother until I was 14 when the local authority re-housed us in a council “ flat , ” what here would be called public housing .
At least this had an inside toilet and , oh wonder of wonders , central heating – we had of course been moved because my mother had convinced the powers that be that it was n’t quite seemly for a teenage boy to be sharing a room with his mother ( thank God for puberty . )
One thing I came to understand at an early age is that the English working class do n’t handle death well , and in some senses they are not all that great at handling life .
I ’ve been away a long time now and maybe today it is different , maybe .
What I recall , however , is a world , a culture that was in considerable part , traumatized by its circumstance .
It was also a world , one that could never go inside and engage the pain .
The idea of therapy , of talking about feelings and hurts was unthinkable except when fueled by alcohol at which moments the emotional engagement either translated itself into a certain maudlin , self - pity or violence in a curious ritual in which one way to deal with pain was to inflict it .
To my young eye none of this was necessarily apparent since life seemed fine ( black dog , who would later emerge snarling , was still a puppy . )
On the surface life was lived with a kind of jolly chirpiness , a mood that spoke that all was well , life is basically OK , when in fact it was n’t .
I remember whenever I walked with my mother to the local store , or around the town centre ’s outdoor market , and we passed someone with whom she was familiar , they would say to each other , with a quick smile , “ hiya , ” the local version of hello and then very quickly move on , no conversation other than perhaps a piece of gossip or “ how ’s yer mum ? ”
For a long time I assumed that the greeting and the smile were real .
They were n’t , more often than not they were milquetoast artifice behind which lurked something far less cheery , a dark misery .
There was humour , buckets of it , but it was I think similar to what someone once said of Graham Greene ’s novel , Travels With My Aunt , “ laughter in the shadow of the gallows . ”
The fact is that the English working class , no less than the English middle class , if for different reasons , knew when they listened to their inner voice , that they were sad , disappointed , incomplete , frustrated .
And then there was death .
They bury it in the darker recesses of the mind where demons lurk , they do n’t talk about it , pretend that there is no need to grieve , that somehow grief is actually a sign of weakness , unless it is the orchestrated , sad , even bizarre spectacle of public grief , as happened with Diana in 1997 .
It is a sad , but perhaps necessary consequence of the felt need to just “ get by , ” to survive in a hostile world that is designed for and by their “ betters . ”
There were no photos of my father in the house , not one .
I once found some letters of his but they quickly and inevitably disappeared .
No one ever spoke of him , mentioned his name , reminisced about him , told the stories that I was so desperate to hear , as is any child who has lost the other most important person in their life .
There was one exception , when a family friend said “ you have his eyes , ” at which point I blushed and changed the subject .
It was as if he never existed , except of course in my heart .
The silence was so intense that it was impossible for me to even ask those simple , but vital questions : what was he like ; was he funny ; did he like soccer or cricket ; did he love me ?
I remember my first day at Cardinal Langley Grammar School , an all boys school run by a religious teaching order .
In one class , taught by Brother Leonard , he asked us what our fathers did – not , note , our mothers ( mine was a shop assistant . )
I heard the boys say “ he ’s a teacher , ” “ a solicitor ( lawyer ) , ” “ he owns a shop , ” “ he works in a factory . ”
The brutal question slowly snaked towards me , from the front of the class to the back where I was sitting .
I was terrified , what would I say , what could I say – I knew what I could n’t say , the truth .
I lied .
I said he was a “ dustman , ” a trash collector .
Looking back it was an interesting choice in that if I was going to give him a job it was n’t going to be glamorous .
I simply did n’t have the emotional strength to say that he was dead , that he had died serving his country , that I was proud of him , loved him very much and missed him dreadfully , even if I had n’t a clue as to who he was .
What a wretched moment , one that I ’ve regretted ever since .
Of course the silence about him could not last , and one day my mother asked me what I wanted to know ?
I was 50 years old .
I think she sensed my rage at what they had done , but I simply replied , “ It ’s OK , it ’s too late . ”
I did ask her one question that had plagued me , “ did I go to his funeral … ? ”
Of course , I knew the answer to that one .
It was during these years on Shaw Road that two things happened that , along with his death and the screaming silence , came to define my whole life , and laid the ground work for the events of 2006 , indeed the past ten years .
My grandfather was a leading local politician and every Friday night his political pals would come to the house and talk politics .
I would sit on the floor and simply listen .
I was entranced , and there was born my love of language and my fascination for all things political .
Then when I was about 13 I was browsing in a book store and picked up a copy of Theodore White ’s Pulitzer Prize winning The Making of the President 1960 .
Each week my mother would give me my “ odd money , ” what here would be called an allowance .
It was tiny , but each week I would go to this small bookstore and spend two or three hours deciding which book to buy .
I stood there in the bookstore ( I have always loved the smell of books ) , opened White ’s book and read its famous first words , “ It was invisible , as always … ”
The “ it ” was the unfolding majesty of the electoral process , as the first votes are counted in the far eastern corner of America and then slowly , surely moves like the sun from east to west as the leader of the free world is chosen by the ordinary , but decent , folks of this most free of lands .
If I might engage in a cliché , I could n’t put it down .
Here was the proffering of a dream to a young boy so desperately in need of a dream .
I fell in love with the idea of America , with its politics , its institutions , its peoples and most of all its glorious possibility .
I drank in White ’s wonderfully mad , idealized narrative of the process , and in particular I fell in love with the iconic figure of JFK – the first of many iconic father figures I would come to adore and respect and learn from .
I started to read everything that I could get my hands on , books , newspapers , magazines .
I subscribed to the London Times and would clip every article about the United States , a land that I “ knew ” in my youthful heart was truly blessed , that shining city on the hill .
I became a huge fan of the Times ’ then Washington correspondent , Louis Harris .
I would do crazy things like writing to the Port Authority of New York and the Schenectady Chamber of Commerce for anything they could send me .
The packages would duly arrive , and I could n’t wait to open them and devour the latest information on a new industrial plant in Schenectady or Buffalo or …name a place , or the tonnage of shipping passing through the waters off New York City .
Ah , bliss was it in that dawn to be alive and to be young , even in Oldham .
I could recite JFK ’s inaugural , detail the stories in his Profiles in Courage , tell you about the Constitution , explain the reason for being in Vietnam even before Vietnam was a major blip on the global radar .
I “ knew ” that JFK was a good and great martyr , that LBJ while gruff was designing the Great Society of which , by the time I was 15 , I definitely wanted a piece .
In the eyes of a sad child “ America ” was quite simply heaven on earth .
And then I came to live here and that ’s where it started to go wrong .
A Troubled Place
I have no regrets about my childhood naivete , which has never quite left me , because if a child ca n’t dream , who can ?
It was not , however , as I would have wished it to be .
It disappointed as I realized that like few societies on earth America promises people Heaven , and gives them Hell , and then for good measure gives other parts of the planet a good kicking .
In his 2005 Nobel lecture , the English playwright , Harold Pinter , savaged what America had become and done , particularly in its foreign policy and its almost fetish - like desire to cuddle up to this and that authoritarian regime that had perfected the fine art of ripping peoples ’ fingernails out – if they were lucky .
He noted , however , that the United States was particularly adept at masking all of this – just as it had with the boy from Oldham .
Standing in the Stockholm Konserthus he observed that whatever the miseries inflicted , in the public eye ,
“ … It never happened .
Nothing ever happened .
It did n’t matter .
It was of no interest .
The crimes of the United States have been systematic , constant , vicious , remorseless , but very few people have actually talked about them .
You have to hand it to America .
It has exercised a quite classical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good .
It ’s a brilliant , even witty , highly successful act of hypnosis .
I put it to you that the United States is without doubt the greatest show on the road .
Brutal , indifferent , scornful and ruthless it may be but it is also very clever .
As a salesman it is out on its own and its most salable commodity is self love .
It ’s a winner .
Listen to all American presidents on television say the words ‘ the American people ’
… It ’s a scintillating stratagem .
Language is actually employed to keep thought at bay .
The words ‘ the American people ’ provide a truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance .
You do n’t need to think .
Just lie back on the cushion .
The cushion may be suffocating your intelligence and your critical faculties but it ’s very comfortable . ”
What Pinter said resonated .
His critique was twofold : of the dreadful actions of the political class in foreign affairs and of the witless compliance of “ ordinary ” Americans .
It was this latter that particularly concerned me because while I was troubled by what the United States was doing to the rest of the world I was equally troubled by what it was doing to itself .
I wanted , somehow , on however small a scale , to do something , to say something about what I saw as a miserable , wretched but fundamentally unnecessary condition .
The Fell upon which I had long walked was that of culture , particularly as expressed through , and by , the media .
For many years as I observed I became ever more troubled , arriving at a conclusion that I wished would go away , but which lurked with an ever greater and chilling presence .
I had come to see the dragging down of the idea that cultural expression could serve larger purposes , could be imbued with the spell of wisdom and profundity , could work from the premise that there was something ultimately good , indeed great , about who we are , who we can be , who we should be .
I had come to feel a growing belief that there was no longer any meaning to the old aphorism that , for example , broadcasting at its best made the good popular and the popular good .
I come to agree with Newt Minnow who , forty years on , revisited his famous claim from the early 1960s that television was a vast wasteland , declared that it was a vaster wasteland still .
OJ was happening , along with a growing trend of reality television , that bitter broth of voyeurism and public humiliation – Cowper ’s “ Detested sport / That owes its pleasures to another ’s pain . ”
I had this unshakable sense , a long time in the making , that mass culture was evolving in ways that shoved aside things of worth and merit in favor of too much vacuous , juvenile , even primitive “ pleasures , ” egged on all the while by ever larger corporations .
The larger body politic also seemed driven more by the will to power than the will to serve , a metastasizing lack of grace .
When he was dying of a brain tumor , Lee Atwater , who had been the wunderkind who had masterminded the election of the first President Bush and who all but single handedly invented modern - day , dirty politics , had a profound epiphany .
He wrote :
“ What was missing in society is what was missing in me : a little heart , a lot of brotherhood … I do n’t know who will lead us through the 90s , but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society , the tumor of the soul … ”
It was as if the culture and its institutions , its governance as much as its education system , had failed and left vast numbers of people ill - equipped for the hard work of citizenship , a population that was bored , too readily drawn to simple pleasures , ignorant of the world around , drawn ever more to absurd beliefs and world views .
In other words , I had arrived at a place I did n’t want to be , a troubled place .
Perhaps it was all inevitable .
On such a broad landscape it may seem curious to admit , but when JonBenet died and the media frenzy began , and the public clamoured for ever more information , and sought retribution against her “ ghastly parents , ” here , for me , was an opportunity to say something about what was a deeply troubled land , to say that this is not how it is supposed to be , this is not how the media should function in a democracy , this democracy , this is not how justice should be pursued , it ’s wrong .
I wanted to do this because I could not , do not want to , shake that feeling of calm and warmth and , finally , finding a future , a place to love not just live in , a place in which to belong , not just be in that I felt as I stood there in that bookstore , opened the pages of the book and read those words , “ It was invisible , as always … ”
NEXT : JonBenet
INDEX
Less able to achieve their life goals , women end up unhappier than men later in life – even though they start out happier , reveals new research by Anke Plagnol of the University of Cambridge , and University of Southern California economist Richard Easterlin .
Plagnol and Easterlin 's study , forthcoming in the Journal of Happiness Studies , is the first to use nationally representative data spanning several decades to examine the role of unfulfilled desires in a person 's sense of well - being .
As the researchers explain , expectations of success may vary among those raised in different generations ( i.e. , an economic depression ) .
Data sets from a range of time periods may also have different demographic compositions .
In their analysis , the researchers control for birth cohort and demographic characteristics such as race and education .
They find that women are , on average , happier than men in early adulthood – but the glow wears off with time .
Specifically , after the age of 48 , men 's overall happiness exceeds women 's happiness .
These gender patterns of overall happiness correlate to patterns in two significant aspects of life satisfaction : family and finances .
As Plagnol explains :
In later life it is " men [ who ] come closer to fulfilling their aspirations , are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations , and are the happier of the two . "
Women and men have fairly similar life goals when it comes to love , the study reveals .
Nine out of 10 people of both genders reach adult life wanting a happy marriage .

" Differences between men and women in aspirations for marriage and children are fairly small , " says Plagnol , who received her Ph.D. from USC in 2007 .
" Gender differences in satisfaction depend largely on attainment . "
The saddest period of the average man 's life – his 20s – is also the period when he is most likely to be single .
Young men are also more dissatisfied than young women with their financial situations , not because they are worse off , but because they want more and therefore experience a greater " shortfall , " the researchers explain .
But age alters many things , including men's money woes and lackluster love lives .
After 34 , men are more likely to be married than women , and the gap only widens with age , mirroring men's growing satisfaction with family life .

Men also become more satisfied with their financial situations over time , as reflected in their increased spending power .
The researchers found that men tend to covet big - ticket items that might not be within reach until later in life , such as a car or vacation home .
( A notable exception : women want more " nice clothes " than men , the researchers found . )
These findings are consistent with an earlier study by Easterlin showing that recent generations are less satisfied than previous generations , despite having more .
" Of course , one does n't have to be married to be happy , but if that 's something you really want – and it is for most people – then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness , " Plagnol says , adding that those in a relationship also tend to be in a stronger financial position than those who must depend solely on their own resources .
Some age milestones :
41 : Age at which men's financial satisfaction exceeds women 's financial satisfaction
48 : Age at which men's overall happiness exceeds women 's overall happiness
64 : Age at which men's satisfaction with family life exceeds women 's satisfaction

Chemicals used in the environment to kill bacteria could be making them stronger , according to a paper published in Microbiology .
Low levels of these chemicals , called biocides , can make the potentially lethal bacterium Staphylococcus aureus remove toxic chemicals from the cell even more efficiently , potentially making it resistant to being killed by some antibiotics .
Biocides are used in disinfectants and antiseptics to kill microbes .
They are commonly used in cleaning hospitals and home environments , sterilizing medical equipment and decontaminating skin before surgery .
At the correct strength , biocides kill bacteria and other microbes .
However , if lower levels are used the bacteria can survive and become resistant to treatment .
" Bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus make proteins that pump many different toxic chemicals out of the cell to interfere with their antibacterial effects , " said Dr Glenn Kaatz from the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit , USA .
" These efflux pumps can remove antibiotics from the cell and have been shown to make bacteria resistant to those drugs .
We wanted to find out if exposure to biocides could also make bacteria resistant to being killed by the action of efflux pumps . "
The researchers exposed S. aureus taken from the blood of patients to low concentrations of several biocides and dyes , which are also used frequently in hospitals .
They looked at the effect of exposure on the bacteria and found that mutants that make more efflux pumps than normal were produced .
" We found that exposure to low concentrations of a variety of biocides and dyes resulted in the appearance of resistant mutants , " said Dr Kaatz .
" The number of efflux pumps in the bacteria increased .
Because the efflux pumps can also rid the cell of some antibiotics , pathogenic bacteria with more pumps are a threat to patients as they could be more resistant to treatment . "
If bacteria that live in protected environments are exposed to biocides repeatedly , for example during cleaning , they can build up resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics .
Such bacteria have been shown to contribute to hospital - acquired infections .
" Scientists are trying to develop inhibitors of efflux pumps .
Effective inhibitors would reduce the likelihood of additional resistance
mechanisms emerging in bacteria , " said Dr Kaatz .
" Unfortunately , inhibitors evaluated to date do not work on a wide range of pathogens so they are not ideal to prevent resistance . "
" Careful use of antibiotics and the use of biocides that are not known to be recognised by efflux pumps may reduce the frequency at which resistant strains are found , " said Dr Kaatz .
" Alternatively , the combination of a pump inhibitor with an antimicrobial agent or biocide will reduce the emergence of such strains and their clinical impact . "

TREVOR " The Smiler " King was known for being beaten just once in his 64 - fight professional boxing career .
Now the 78 - year - old has added another notch to his belt .
The grandfather of five celebrated another win last week in a bout against two repo men one - third his age .
Mr King , the founder and chaplain of Westside Mission , a welfare group for battlers , was helping a family having trouble making mortgage repayments on their Auburn home .
According to the NYT today , the Palin campaign has refused to give any interviews or provide any documents with respect to Sarah Palin 's health records .
Like her refusal to hold a press conference in the campaign , this makes Palin uniquely shielded from accountability in modern times .
But there is a public record of what Larry Altman called in the NYT today " the much - discussed circumstances surrounding the birth of her fifth child last April . "
So here goes .
What follows is all from the public record - from the Anchorage Daily News and the New York Times in three articles here , here , and here .
I recommend the originals rather than this summary .
I 've added some context by talking to leading obstetricians about medical questions I am not competent to answer .
It 's a remarkable story , whatever your take on it .
Since this person could well be the president in the next four years , it may be worth your time to ponder the narrative she has laid out .
We do not know when exactly Sarah Palin discovered she was pregnant at age 43 .
We do know that she says she had an amniocentesis to determine for genetic abnormalities .
That test , routinely used to determine if an unborn child will be aborted , discovered that Trig had Down Syndrome .
Around 90 percent of such babies are indeed aborted .
But Palin , admirably to my mind , chose life .
The test , however , is also a serious if small risk to the life of the unborn child .
The risk is calculated between a 1 in 200 and 1 in 1500 chance of precipitating a miscarriage .
Very , very few pro-life activist women agree to an amniocentesis because it can endanger the life of the unborn child with no tangible benefits for the child .
Other risk - free methods of predicting the chance of Down Syndrome exist - but would occur later in pregnancy or would not be as accurate .
Palin says she decided to take the risk to the life of her unborn child to help prepare her mentally for the task of raising a child with special needs .
And , at 43 , with Down Syndrome much more common among the offspring of women in their forties , such a test would be routinely offered .
I have just completed an alpha release of a c++ backend for haxe .
This means that you can complile haxe code into a 100 % compiled executable .
You can download the demo file in hxcpp-01.zip .
Sorry , windows only at this stage .
The distribution contains a new cpp backend for haxe .
It has been based on a 2.0 version of haxe , which may be a tiny bit out of date .
Most of the changes are in the new “ gencpp.ml ” , and to the standard library files , with a few little extra bits here and there .
You can re-compile the
haxe compiler if you have ocaml by using the supplied install.ml script .
To try this version for yourself , first backup your haxe distro and copy then supplied “ compile/bin/haxe.exe ” and “ compiler / std / * ” files over the top .
Use the “ - cpp cpp_directory ” command line to generate a directory that contains src , include and nmake files .
You can then compile these using the microsoft visual studio “ nmake ” utility .
The build system requires the library , include , make and dlls from the “ hxcpp ” directory .
To access these , you should set the environment variable “ HXCPP ” to point to hxcpp directory extracted from this distribution .
This can be done from right - click - “ My Computer ” / Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables , or from the commandline before compiling .
These resulting “ exe ” file also needs the hxcpp.dll file from the hxcpp / dll directory .
The should be in your “ path ” , or simply copy it next to your exe .
You can recompile the hxcpp.dll using the nmake file in the directory .
You can change the compile flags from the $ HXCPP / nmake.setup file ( eg , turn on debug ) .
Demos
Two demos have been included – “ perf ” , a small benchmark program I found on the net
and a “ Physaxe ” demo .
The source is included ( slightly modified ) , and so are the binaries .
The cpp src and include directories have been included to give you taste of the
output if you ca n’t be bothered setting up the compiler yourself .
The binaries can be found in demos / bin , and are compiled for neko , swf and cpp .
The neko version can be run with “ neko phx . n ” or “ neko TestRunner .n ” .
You do not
need a very recent version of neko , but you do need the included “ nme.ndll ” findable
by neko ( next to it will work ) .
The cpp version of Physaxe uses the cpp verion of NME .
This was compiled from
the same code base as the neko version , except it uses the “ neko.h ” file found
in the hxcpp directoty instead of the one that comes with neko .
The nme.dll should
be next to the compiled exe .
If you want to compile the nme versions yourself , you will need the latest nme and neash
versions from code.google.com :
http://code.google.com/p/nekonme/source/checkout
http://code.google.com/p/neash/source/checkout
Performance
— — ——
The flash version of physaxe runs the fastest , with the cpp version about 70 % of the
speed ( when using the opengl version ) , and neko about 20 % of the speed .
One of the problems is that the cpp version uses the neko api , which required fields
to be looked up by name , which is quite slow in this implementation .
A faster version
could link directly to the hxcpp objects – but then it could not use the same API .
This problem is made far worse by the fact the physaxe re-renders each point in each
object every frame , rather then simply adjusting the matrix of existing objects .
I think the most significant loss of perfromance is coming from the reference counting
housekeeping .
I will look into a garbage collected system soon .
The results from the “ TestRunner ” are mixed with flash being faster for stings , but
cpp faster for maths and looping .
Neko is fastest for the sting sort in this case ,
but this is unusual because the stings are already sorted .
When they are not , neko
is very slow .
The cpp string code is very simple , so there is scope for improvement there .
TODO
—-
There is still plenty to do .
A lot of the operators ( eg , “ *= ” ) have not been looked at .
The actual formatting of the generated code needs a complete overhaul .
The ml code needs some simplifying / cleaning .
The standard libraries ( eg , xml , regex )
Need some way of locating the various dlls etc .
Splitup / refactor the HObject.h et al files .
Returning values from blocks / swithes .
Complete neko.h
Look at GC .
Plenty more , I ’m sure .
If all goes to plan , Princes William and Harry will be halfway through their 1,000 - mile charity motorbike ride across South Africa on Wednesday this week .
Here 's a suggestion for something they might do as they peel off their leathers at the end of another " gruelling " day burning up the wilderness , terrifying wildlife , and deafening the locals .
Wednesday is the day that next year 's Tour de France route is announced .
That 's bikes minus the engines , in case William and Harry need reminding .
At the same time the Tour organisers will reveal the route of the Etape – the annual event in which some 8,000 amateur cyclists are given the chance to ride a mountain stage of the greatest bike race in the world .
Unlike the Enduro Africa event in which the princes are taking part ( " Fitness is not essential , " says its website ) , the Etape requires many months of arduous training , and huge reserves of stamina and willpower on the day .
It 's a massive physical challenge that offers pain and exhilaration in equal measure .
The sense of achievement at the end of it all is profound and richly deserved .
I know this because I 've done it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
How much training have the princes done for Enduro Africa ?
" Absolutely none whatsoever , " William says , as if he 's proud of the fact .
And they really expect to derive satisfaction from the experience ?
So my message to the princes is this .
If you want some credibility , if you want some respect , and if you want to know the real meaning of a tough day in the saddle and the rewards that go with it , check out the 2009 Etape route and pledge that you 'll be there next July .
I 'll even sponsor you myself .
The various causes that the princes are raising money for on their motorbike jolly are perfectly laudable .
But in every other respect Enduro Africa is about as crass an undertaking as any royal can ever have got involved in – far worse , in its way , than various Windsors ' notorious appearance on It 's A Royal Knockout many years ago , which at least showed their willingness to make complete fools of themselves in public .
William and Harry may be overnighting in what is described as " modest accommodation " , but there remains something inherently distasteful about these symbols of privilege and their 80 or so fellow - bikers parading such gaudy , polluting totems of Western consumerism as their 230 cc Honda CRF machines across one of the most scenic but poorest parts of the world .
Such , alas , seems to be the hold over the princes ' imagination of trans - Africa petrolheads Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman .
I assume it 's them and not Easy Rider , anyway .
Meanwhile , real cycling is enjoying a boom , for reasons that even the princes must be aware of .
And after the Beijing Olympics there 's a case for arguing that it's the sport Britain is best at right now .
I 'll stop myself from saying that cycling is cool , but then really how cool is what the princes are up to in South Africa ?
Pretty naff , I 'd say , even without that ridiculous war paint on their faces .
Still , it 's not too late to redeem yourselves , lads .
Check out the Etape , swap those seriously ugly motorbikes for some gorgeous titanium wonder that you have to power yourself , and start putting in the miles .
Of course , cycling carries more than a whiff of egalitarianism .
But that 's not going to put off our 21st - century royals , is it ?
If the Government goes ahead , it will have to spend billions on new trains over several decades .
Extrapolated from the net present value of the current order for double - deck trains , the replacement of the 1600 carriages servicing the CityRail network would cost $ 9.2 billion .
If the cost of finance is included , this blows out to $ 24.3 billion .
" There is a long - term strategic direction to start investing in single - deck rolling stock , " Mr Campbell said .
The plan would " assist in moving more people across the network faster by reducing dwell time [ the time a train spends in each station ] , address capacity constraints and improve service levels on the RailCorp network . "
While NSW plans to switch to single - deck trains , in Switzerland , Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium and France suburban rail networks are being converted to double - deck trains .
In Sydney , single - deck trains are synonymous with the notorious " red rattler " , the noisy carriages that began to be phased out in the 1960s .
The plan surfaced in the same week the Government slashed $ 13 billion worth of new railways to the north - west and south - west of Sydney .
It raises questions about how vital freight , inter-urban and XPT trains would squeeze into the network .
The policy reversal has been motivated by the same advice that prompted the proposal of the seven - kilometre , $ 4.8 billion CBD Metro as an achievable first step in introducing a modern subway system to Sydney .
Using the same rationale , all western line services would be converted to single - deck trains that would terminate at Central .
Commuters would then switch to the new metro line at its terminus to reach northern parts of the city centre , including Martin Place .
The NSW Treasury is working on an estimated cost of $ 2 billion to convert just the western line from Parramatta to Central .
But the mini - budget revealed plans to take this strategy much further , in a decision at odds with the existing order for double - deck rail carriages expected to be delivered from 2010 .
The strategy also runs counter to another budget announcement , the $ 370 million purchase of at least eight outer suburban trains , which are double - deckers .
Single - deck trains are favoured because they are quicker to load passengers and would need to spend less time in stations .
While this is true of the main city centre stations , signalling systems govern the distance between trains , and hence their frequency .
The mini - budget papers described the new strategy as a " low cost " way to improve service levels " based on gradual conversion of network operations to higher - frequency single - deck rolling stock " .
Rail experts told the Herald the signalling work alone would cost $ 5 billion .
There are also questions about who would do the work .
The Rail Clearways program has been hampered by a chronic shortage of skilled staff .
The Auditor - General says RailCorp needs 16 specialist signal engineers to complete current work , but it has only three permanent signal engineers on its books .
I went back to Borobudur a second day in a row for a morning sunrise and stayed for about five hours .
I would mostly sit in the shade , listen to my music , and do some reading .
Of course , I ’d take regular breaks as the clouds changed and the light moved around .
Inside each of those little “ bell cages ” is a buddha statue facing out towards the countryside .
There , in the distance , you can see the volcano poking through the fog …

A gun disguised as a mobile phone has been discovered by police in Italy .
The .22 calibre weapon was found during an early morning raid on a property near Naples .
Officers also seized bullet proof vests , drugs , ammunition and thousands of pounds in cash .
It was all part of an operation against the Camorra , the Naples - based mafia .
Fully loaded , the gun 's capable of firing four shots in quick succession through the antenna using buttons on the keypad as the trigger .
One man was arrested by detectives but others are thought to have escaped .
Gothamist 's Amanda Spurlock attended a press conference with Penn , Josh Brolin , James Franco , Alison Pill , and Emile Hirsch .
Here 's her report :
Franco revealed that he wanted to be a part of the film so badly that he would have “ played the pool boy ” just to be in it .
But , thankfully , he plays Milk ’s lover , giving the world a steamy Sean Penn and James Franco make out scene !
$ 11 well spent !
Another tidbit : Van Sant ( pictured ) said they looked at hours of archival footage for developing the characters and maintaining historical accuracy .
( In the film , you 'll see snippets of " home movies " from The Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center 's archive in San Francisco . )
Of course , it 's impossible to overlook the fact that Milk , which opens Wednesday , is being released on the heels of the Prop 8 passage in California , the same state where Milk helped mobilize the gay community to demand their civil rights .
Speaking about Prop 8 , Penn said , " It 's only an issue because of ignorance in the first place .
We do n't have any excuse for being ignorant of the law ... or ignorant of human history ...
In fact any support of Prop 8 would be minimally manslaughter .
Because human history tells us that teenage boys are going to hang themselves out of a reach for an identity that they can't get ....
And if this movie is a part of an engine to help reveal that , that 's going to make us all happy and proud . "
A good working definition of quantum mechanics is that things are the exact opposite of what you thought they were .
Empty space is full , particles are waves , and cats can be both alive and dead at the same time .
Recently a group of physicists studied another quantum head spinner .
You might innocently think that when a particle rolls across a tabletop and reaches the edge , it will fall off .
Sorry .
In fact , a quantum particle under the right conditions stays on the table and rolls back .
This effect is the converse of the well - known ( if no less astounding ) phenomenon of quantum tunneling .
If you kick a soccer ball up a hill too slowly , it will come back down .
But if you kick a quantum particle up a hill at the same speed , it can make it up and over .
The particle will have “ tunneled ” across ( although no actual tunnel is involved ) .
This process explains how particles can escape atomic nuclei , causing radioactive alpha decay .
And it is the basis of many electronic devices .
In tunneling , the particle can do something the ball never does .
Conversely , the particle might not do something the ball always does .
If you kick a soccer ball toward the edge of a cliff , it will always fall off .
But if you kick a particle toward the edge , it can bounce back to you .
The particle is like one of those little toy robots that senses the edge of a table or staircase and reverses course , except that the particle has no internal mechanism to pull off its stunt .
It naturally does the exact opposite of what the forces acting on it would indicate .
The researchers behind the analysis — Pedro L. Garrido of the University of Granada in Spain , Jani Lukkarinen of the University of Helsinki , and Sheldon Goldstein and Roderich Tumulka , both at Rutgers University — call this phenomenon “ antitunneling . ”
In both cases , the explanation lies in the wave nature of particles , which in turn reflects the fact that a quantum particle generally has an ambiguous location .
The wave describes the range of locations where it could be found .
This wave behaves much like ordinary waves such as sound .
Whenever any wave encounters a barrier that is not absolutely rigid , some of the wave will penetrate into the barrier , albeit with diminishing intensity .
If the barrier is not too thick , the wave can reemerge on the other side .
That is analogous to tunneling .
For antitunneling , the analogy is that whenever any wave encounters any abrupt change of conditions — even ones more favorable to its propagation — some of it will reflect back .
Something similar happens when a scuba diver looks up and sees the sea surface acting as a mirror .
To be sufficiently abrupt , the distance over which conditions change must be shorter than the wavelength ( which for a particle is related to momentum ) .
If the change is too gradual , the wave will simply go along , and the particle will act like a soccer ball after all .
Garrido and his colleagues undertook a numerical analysis to rule out the possibility that the phenomenon was an artifact of idealized assumptions .
They also calculated how long a particle will tend to roll around the table before going over the edge ; it gets longer the higher the table is .
David Griffiths of Reed College , author of a widely used introductory quantum mechanics textbook ( the second edition of which gives a version of antitunneling as a student exercise ) , calls it “ a very sweet paradox . ”
Physicist Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says , “ It ’s a solid analysis , and it points out an interesting phenomenon I had n’t been consciously aware of . ”
Antitunneling might have applications for building laboratory particle traps , describing nuclear decay or exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics , but its main appeal is to remind physicists how a nearly century - old theory has lost none of its capacity to surprise .

The 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle rattle , helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys .
Now they ’re training for the same mission — with a twist — at home .
Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , the 1st BCT will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks .
It is not the first time an active - duty unit has been tapped to help at home .
In August 2005 , for example , when Hurricane Katrina unleashed hell in Mississippi and Louisiana , several active - duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas .
But this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities .
After 1st BCT finishes its dwell - time mission , expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .
“ Right now , the response force requirement will be an enduring mission .
How the [ Defense Department ] chooses to source that and whether or not they continue to assign them to NorthCom , that could change in the future , ” said Army Col.
Louis Vogler , chief of NorthCom future operations .
“ Now , the plan is to assign a force every year . ”
...
They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack .
...
The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , ” 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
“ It ’s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they ’re fielding .
They ’ve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we ’re undertaking we were the first to get it . ”
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
“ I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered , ” said Cloutier , describing the experience as “ your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body .
“ I ’m not a small guy , I weigh 230 pounds ... it put me on my knees in seconds . ”
“ I do n’t know what America ’s overall plan is — I just know that 24 hours a day , seven days a week , there are soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines that are standing by to come and help if they ’re called , ” Cloutier said .
“ It makes me feel good as an American to know that my country has dedicated a force to come in and help the people at home . ”
You 're not crazy , that is , if you 've begun to have waking nightmares about what might be coming as the economy worsens and signs of " normalcy " ( of what ? ) begin to vanish from our lives .
Many more people without jobs and homeless , tent cities springing up here and there , perhaps regular power outages and growing shortages of goods that had once been plentiful ... the list goes on and on .
And what , you might wonder , is our beneficent , all - caring government doing to prepare for this multitude of possibilities ?
After all , some of those poor , jobless , homeless , starving people might get
The government of the United States is a wondrous creation and , naturally , it only wants to " help " you " Nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them ... "
Frequently , it does n't work out that way : " Obey or Die .
" But you were being You might be , at least dangerous to those who rule us .
And honestly , the fact that you may be homeless , starving and desperate is no reason to beor
This comes at the very end of the story , offered by the division operations officer : I 'm sure there are people in the military who believe this , or at leastthey believe it .
But if and when the order comes to fire on American citizens , what happens then ?
I do n't think we want to find out .
Many of these individuals are overly familiar with killing innocent people -- as indeed , our criminal war in Iraq is nothingan operation dedicated to killing innocent people in ungraspably huge numbers -- so a new kind of target probably wo n't deter them for long , if at all .
Add in all the private mercenary forces now available to the government , and , well ... No , you 're not crazy .
The reasons for my argument will become clearer in the second and concluding part of this new essay of mine , " The State and Full Spectrum Dominance , Abroad and At Home " -- but this gives you an idea of why I chose the phrase " Full Spectrum Dominance , " a phrase that usually refers to U.S. military capabilities in particular , and why I included " At Home . "
But I am concerned with " Full Spectrum Dominance " in a still broader sense , as I will soon explain .
Pleasant dreams , dear reader .

First Gordon Brown and Mervyn King , the Bank of England 's governor , admitted that Britain was on the verge of recession .
Then food sales were reported to have seen their biggest fall for 20 years .
Last night came final and irrevocable proof that the country is entering tough economic times , unseen since the 80s : AC / DC have returned to the top of the album charts for the first time in 28 years .
Even by the standards of a band whose commercial success is a given - the venerable Australian rockers have shifted more than 80 m records since forming 35 years ago ( in the midst of the 1973 oil crisis ) - the circumstances of their 16th studio album 's British success seem striking .
At one point last week , AC / DC's Black Ice was outselling its nearest competitor , Kaiser Chiefs ' Off With Their Heads , by two to one , despite the fact that they declined to release it as a digital download , preferring vinyl and CD .
Those keen to draw wider inferences from its success might note that the last time AC / DC made No 1 in Britain , the country was on the brink of recession .
Back
In Black , the album that marked their commercial breakthrough and went on to become the second biggest - selling of all time , was released in 1980 , just as inflation had reached 20 % and unemployment inched towards 2 million .
When the economy recovered , AC / DC 's popularity receded , albeit becoming merely immense instead of phenomenal : their " flop " 1985 album , Fly On The Wall , still sold more than 1 m copies , a not unimpressive figure , but a fraction of Back In Black 's 30 m sales or the 5 m copies that Black Ice sold in the last seven days .
But right on cue the album that returned the band to its heyday was The Razors Edge , released in 1990 - just as Britain headed towards its last recession .
AC / DC 's appeal in unpredictable times is straightforward .
People crave something uncomplicated and dependable in a time of uncertainty , and rock music has never produced a band so uncomplicated and dependable as AC / DC .
For 35 years , they have done exactly the same thing - which in guitarist Angus Young 's case involves dressing like a naughty schoolboy - unaffected by changes in fashion or band personnel .
Not even the death of lead singer Bon Scott could stop AC / DC cranking out hard - edged , wilfully basic blues - rock , decorated with lyrics in which the phrase " rock ' n ' roll " figures heavily , but not as heavily as sniggering innuendo about scrotums .
Small wonder that people turn to AC / DC in their millions when the world appears on the brink of chaos .
Here is escapism into a world untroubled by sub - prime mortgages , record public finance deficits and the baleful state of the FTSE 100 , but escapism of the most comfortingly consistent kind .
Western capitalism might collapse but at least
Young can be relied on to perform a song about either rock and roll or testicles while wearing shorts , blazer and cap .
Alas , what he can't be relied on to do is support those who delve into the sociological implications of AC / DC 's appeal .
" What we do , you 're not going to look into it with depth , y' know , " he suggested recently .
" Because if you look into it with depth , you 're not going to get it . "
Highway to hell
1973 : AC / DC form in Sydney , Australia .

Economy : Inflation in UK reaches 20 % and unemployment nears 2 million
1990 : AC / DC score comeback with The Razor 's Edge
Economy : Recession in UK imminent
2008 : AC / DC top UK album charts
Economy : Biggest world recession in decades looms
I have the foreboding feeling that by early Wednesday morning , an avoidable but all - too predictable problem of voters being unable to cast their ballots , through over crowding at polling stations , will overshadows the 2008 presidential election .
The message , however , is clear .
If you ’re in line before polls close , you ’re entitled to cast your vote .
In 2000 and 2004 , electronic voting machines which were incorrectly ( or deliberately ) calibrated , so that a vote for one candidate actually tallied against his or her opponent , was subsequently proven ( not least thanks to testimony from ex-employees of the Diebold corporation who made the defective - by - design machines ) to have affected thousands of votes in tens of counties right across America .
The worry this time is not just that those same machines are still being used , but that wards which traditionally have a low voter turn out –predominantly lower income African - American homes –have fewer of the machines available than in the middle class , predominantly white neighbourhoods , more likely to vote republican–so long lines , hours in wait - times , are highly likely .

When the 111th Congress convenes in January , it is time for a change - - a change of the Speaker of the House .
Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( D - Ca ) in her two years as Speaker has enabled a pro-Bush , pro-corporate agenda almost as facilely and frequently as Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
In November , 2006 , voters put Democrats in the majority in Congress to end the Iraq occupation and hold Bush responsible for the war .
But before she became Speaker , Pelosi took impeachment off the table , giving Bush a blank check to wage the Iraq war for two more years .
Showing disdain for those opposed to the war , Pelosi snubbed peace demonstrators outside her San Francisco home , morphing into Bush , who refused to meet Cindy Sheehan and peace protesters outside his Crawford , Texas compound .
Under Pelosi's leadership , Congress gave Bush a ½ trillion dollars for the Iraq war Pelosi said she wanted to stop .
More than 1,200 U.S. soldiers and thousands of Iraqi men , women , and children have died since Pelosi became Speaker .
Pelosi has refused to sanction hearings to collect evidence about impeachable offenses , and she quashed other House members ' impeachment efforts .
By last June , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) had compiled at least 35 articles of impeachment for G.W. Bush .
The first 16 articles relate to the Iraq war : for secret propaganda ; deception about 9/11 ; weapons of mass destruction , and illegal spending in an unauthorized and undeclared war .
Pelosi also enabled legislation legalizing warrantless wiretapping and granting immunity not only for telecommunications company executives , but also for Bush , Dick Cheney , and other administration officials .
The law obliterated our Fourth Amendment protections against illegal search and seizure .
Pelosi looked the other way as Bush politicized the Justice Department , using federal Attorneys General to corrupt the voting process and wage political vendettas against Democrats .
Former Alabama Governor Donald Siegelman spent time in Federal prison after Karl Rove 's political associates trumped up charges against him .
Pelosi has let White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolton , Counsel Harriet Meirs , and Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove defy Congressional subpoenas .
In September , Pelosi joined with Bush to plunder even more of the Treasury for their corporate cronies under the guise of a $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout .
Pelosi with other Congressional Democrats stood at the microphones , salivating at the prospect of helping Bush loot the U.S. Treasury .
The scene was sickeningly reminiscent of Congressional Democratic leaders Tom Daschle and Richard Gephardt , with presidential ambitions on their sleeves , rush to the White House six years earlier embracing Bush and his illegal and immoral preemptive attack on the people of Iraq .
Instead of educating and leading and representing , Pelosi and her Democratic cohorts quiver at the thought they might be blamed for a terrorist attack or financial collapse if they deny Bush what he wants .
Are Pelosi 's repeated capitulations to Bush due to complicity -- knowing inside information about 9/11 , torture , and wiretapping ?
If she were compromised , Pelosi could have refused the speaker 's position .
If she were afraid of political retaliation like that against Siegelman , she could have stepped down .
If Bush et al had threatened another 9/11 or martial law if the Democrats voted against his corporate agenda , the smart , powerful , proactive politician would hold a press conference surrounded with other vulnerable officials and tell the American public the truth .
But instead , Pelosi appears a willing tool .
She has used her position to enrich herself and her family .
The first female Speaker of the House is part of a cabal , one which , unfortunately , includes other Congressional women dressed in Democratic cloth coats by day and power suits by night .
Through their positions in Congress , Pelosi along with , most notably , Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) and Senators Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) and Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY ) are enriching their family financial coffers and building family dynasties .
( Feinstein , Harmon , and Clinton voted for the Iraq resolution . )
Sheehan , who challenged Pelosi in November for California 's 8th Congressional District , the San Francisco seat Pelosi has held since 1987 , issued a campaign - like manifesto in May 2008 : " Blood is being poured into the bank accounts of the ruling elite while it is being drained out of our soldiers , families , and communities ... "
Pelosi has confused politics with Constitutional responsibility .
Protesters shouted , " Know your power , Nancy .
Impeach , impeach , " interrupting a San Francisco event in August for her book ironically titled " Know Your Power . "
Pelosi cavalierly told them to take their passion and ... vote for Barack Obama .
Pelosi has amassed a power base in Congress during her 20 years as a House member and two years as Speaker .
According to the San Francisco Bay Guardian , Pelosi has doled out millions from her political action committee to help elect other Congressional Democrats -- ensuring their votes on the war , economy , and Constitutional matters and their indebtedness to her reelection as Speaker .
A corporate media blackout of Sheehan 's challenge and the acquiesce of progressive talk show hosts , bloggers , and magazine editors and reporters further entrench Pelosi 's power .
Pelosi sided with President - elect Obama late in the Democratic primaries against Sen. Clinton and has built bridges to his transition team .
However , other members of Congress could serve with distinction as Speaker , while forging a legislative agenda to benefit America and the people of America .
It is time for a politically astute leader , who possesses courage , morals , and ethics , perhaps someone like Rep. John Lewis ( D - GA ) .
( Pelosi called the civil rights leader " the conscience of the U.S. Congress . " )
Under Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) , public approval of Congress sunk in July to 9 % , an all time low .
Rather than be fooled again , it is time for the Democrats to elect a Speaker who knows how to use power .

Laptops today vary greatly in size , weight and purpose , but they all have one common origin : Alan Kay 's Dynabook .
Kay , a former Xerox PARC computer scientist , drew up the idea of a portable computer in 1968 , when computers still weighed over 100 pounds and ate punch cards .
His definition of the perfect , portable computer was a very thin , highly dynamic device that weighed no more than two pounds .
Kay 's original vision , which he called the " Dynabook , " was never built .
But it largely inspired the devices we now call laptops , although it 's taken four decades to slim the tech down to the point where usable computers actually weigh as little as two pounds .
To honor his achievements , Mountain View's Computer History Museum on Wednesday will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the legendary
Dynabook .
Joining Kay in a panel discussion will be Mary Lou
Jepsen , the designer of One Laptop Per Child 's XO notebook , as well as
Chuck Thacker , a former PARC researcher who co-invented Ethernet LAN .
In an interview with Wired.com , Kay shared the story behind how he hatched the Dynabook concept , and what challenges personal computers face as they continue to evolve .
Wired.com :
So how did this all start ?
__Alan Kay : __When I first had a full - fledged version of the Dynabook idea in 1968 , I started to think about what portability really meant .
I made cardboard models that I could fill with lead pellets to simulate sizes and weights .
I defined
" portability " as " being able to carry something else too " and
" hand portability " as " being able to grab something else , too . "
I
calculated that you needed about 1 million pixels to be really universal , and all of these combined to make a form factor that was very thin in one dimension , large enough for a real page display , and weighed about 2 pounds .
There was some prejudging here because I had already made a drawing of two children learning science with these machines , so the final cardboard model wound up looking like the drawing , but with things sized and weighed out .
Later , at Xerox , one of the papers I wrote made the specs a little larger and heavier , when I was trying to convince Xerox execs to really take a shot at such a machine .
But I think the original analysis still holds up pretty well .
However , my thoughts about an intimate personal computer were mostly of a service nature — that is , how could and should it act as an amplifier for human , especially child , endeavors ?
This is what led to quite a bit of UI , language and media design , some of which made it out to the commercial worlds in the 1980s .
As a follow - up to the PARC
designs , the best thing I 've seen in the right direction was Bill
Atkinson 's Hypercard , which was not as general as our ideas but brilliantly filled in a number of very important properties that we were still vague about .
__Wired.com : __What do you think of netbooks ?
They 're lightweight and small — pretty close to two pounds .
Do they still need work before they can meet your definition of a
Dynabook ?
__
Kay : __I 'd like to think that they are finding a form factor and weight that fits human beings better , but I 'm presuming that it is because many people use only a small part of what they could do on their larger machines , and much of what they do use computers for can be done through a browser or a few simple apps .
So this would be somewhat similar to the limited uses of computing that fit into other even smaller devices such as phones and PDAs .
If so , then this is more disappointing than something to be cheered about .
I cringe every time I use a browser for many reasons .
The browser people had a chance to make a more integrated UI and functionality , but really did pretty much the opposite in almost all respects .
But , because of the attraction , and even some real value of stuff on the internet , there is more pressure to do better .
I would expect to see some real alternatives to the typical " bad defacto standard "
browsers we 've had to put up with .
For example , suppose you actually have " real objects " as they were originally thought about .
[ These data objects ] will have " ideas " about how they can display themselves and be edited , and [ their appearances ] can be moderated by various kinds of styles .
The PARC UI took this approach and displayed the views from different objects in a 2.5 - dimensional media layout space .
Boundaries could be put around these views or not [ to contain them within " windows " or not ] .
There were no applications , instead there were a highly integrated form of what today are called mashups .
This was in the original PARC GUI !
There is much to be done here , and to even get back to a number of important integration and workflow ideas that were part of the PARC UI .
__Wired.com : __Are there any particular manufacturers that you think are heading in the right direction in terms of mobile devices ?
__Kay : __All the ones I 've seen have been spotty one way or another .
The only one that has paid real attention to the screen is the OLPC XO , done by Mary Lou Jepson .
It is otherwise a little too big , thick , etc .
The service idea on it could be better , but it at least represents an attempt to rethink service , and has a few improvements on the standards .
The Amazon Kindle is kind of a subset of a Dynabook — too much of a subset .
The screen is too small , it is not very capable of dynamics , the keyboard is poor , etc .
But it does have several limited service ideas that are good .
The next version of a
Kindle could be really exciting .
The next versions of the e-Ink display are a much better size , they can be much more dynamic , the media range could be extended to what I called " Active Essays " years ago , etc .
__Wired.com : __What do you think will become of laptops in the not - too - distant future ?
__Kay : __Does anything ever go away ?
In the early thinking about this whole space , one of the dominant factors is pixels and what to do with them .
My thought back then was that we would move from a notebook device to head - mounted displays to get more effective pixels .
Another was the idea that it should be easier to make head - mounted displays than flatscreens ( this is true , but virtually all of the engineering went into making flatscreens work ) .
I still think that this will eventually happen .
What is really sad today is to see people sacrifice real functionality and real value for portability on tiny screens .
The ominous side effect is that pretty much the only thing that can work on a tiny screen are the various things that work on television , and this is not a good thing for people .
__Wired.com : __What challenges do you think notebooks face as they continue to get more powerful and faster ?
__Kay : __The biggest challenges are : A. ) to really think up service ideas that actually help people ; B. ) how to get people to learn them , if they are actually new ; and C. ) how not to be pulled along by bad de facto standards .
The basic process is just the same as it was 40 years ago : define a viewing mechanism that presents above - threshold viewing angles , capacities , pixels , and define a service concept that can A. )
range over the enormous space of good things , and B. ) that is integrated in concept so that " Simple things are simple , complex things are possible . "

I have had to listen to the presidential and vice presidential debates and comment on them , often enough in real time , as part of my job , but sometimes it feels as if it ’s a form of penance for my sins .
To keep this as understated as possible , these are not outstanding people .
They are seeking to occupy ( or be a heartbeat away from ) an office that for the past seven - plus years has been held by a not unintelligent but certainly uninquisitive man who , with that special kind of arrogance born of unapologetic ignorance and a fixation on a few dubious verities , has plunged the country into a disastrous war and now into an eminently avoidable financial crisis that almost all the politicians and talking heads have diagnosed incorrectly .
Can there be much doubt that this is an empire in steep decline ?
People of real quality not only do not gravitate toward political leadership , they scurry away from it .
At a certain level we might view this decline in the quality of candidates offered by the major parties as good news .
We ’re not looking at leaders who are likely to be able to make the hardheaded and cold - blooded calculations that would be consistent with maintaining the kind of imperial dominance they seem to envision lasting forever .
The sooner this country gives up its dreams of world - bestriding dominance  spun as benevolent concern for spreading the blessings of democracy , or at least its surface manifestations , of course  the better off those of us still blessed to live here will be .
However , there is little evidence that these leaders have given up their imperial fantasies .
And while Adam Smith tried to reassure us that there is a great deal of ruin in a country , and much of what is good about the United States will no doubt survive and perhaps reemerge with more strength during our imperial decline , it looks as if we will have to suffer a great deal more before finally giving up  or being forced to give up  our leaders ’ foolish dreams of universal rule .
One piece of evidence that we are in decline is the fact that the only candidate of the four offered by the major parties to be chief executive or executive - in - waiting with an iota of executive experience is Sarah Palin .
Her executive experience is strictly limited , of course  mayor of a small town and governor of a state with about a quarter of the population of the county in which I work .
And while she does have at least that experience , it is tainted by a partisan and old - friends - friendly approach to wielding such power .
And of course , while she demonstrated in the recent debate more facility at speaking in complete sentences and discussing facts that have been crammed into her head than many observers anticipated , her understanding of foreign affairs , the most important brief of the chief executive in the American system , is almost laughably lacking .
I do n’t doubt that she has a certain level of native intelligence , and she certainly has some shrewd political instincts and an ability to " connect " with certain classes of voters at a visceral level .
And she is able to project a certain confidence , but it is confidence born of less - than - partial knowledge that she does n’t even recognize as partial .
We ca n’t flinch ?
What about avoiding situations in which the only choice is to flinch or court disaster ?
And what does it say about the cultural level of an empire that otherwise reasonably intelligent people make the argument that what we really need in a position of high authority is a " hockey mom " ?
There are certainly reasons to doubt the wisdom of the purported elites who have led this country to the brink of bankruptcy and defeat , but this is close to denigrating even a scintilla of accomplishment and thoughtfulness , let alone the concept of relevant qualifications .
Then there ’s the ultimate timeserver , Joe Biden , who was for the war ( though perhaps with naïve qualifications and a willful blindness to the true implications of the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution , which everybody knew really meant what it said rather than being a prelude to peace ) before he was against it .
To be sure , by virtue of having been in Washington forever he knows more about policy than the less - than - divine Sara , but he sees it through an unabashedly partisan lens .
When unwarranted aggression was conducted by a Democratic president , he was all for it , thought it was wise and just , but naked aggression by a Republican president is always bad .
The distaste for Republican adventurism , however , is accompanied by a general enthusiasm for almost any kind of intervention in the wider world .
When poor Gwen Ifill clumsily tried to ask him if there was any intervention that he would not support , aside from a few boilerplate qualifications , he could n’t or would n’t name any .
As for knowing the particulars that might guide one to make a judgment as to whether a particular intervention would be practical or not ( aside from the party occupying the White House ) , there was that bizarre statement about the Americans and French kicking Hezbollah out of Lebanon leading to the 2006 Hezbollah - Israeli war .
From what planet did that emanate ?
He certainly knows more than Sarah Palin , but he still knows considerably less than he thinks he does , which can be more dangerous than the gaffes that his overconfidence in knowledge without checking leads to .
As for John McCain , little needs to be said beyond the near - certainty that he considers war not just a way to solve problems , but an ennobling endeavor , which is not surprising , given that he comes from a family of warriors , and most people have to find ways to rationalize and justify what they do .
He has tried to suggest , by speaking ( not entirely accurately ) of his skepticism about keeping Marines in Lebanon way back during the Reagan administration , that he is n’t a knee - jerk interventionist , but there is pretty good evidence that his attitudes underwent a sea-change during the 1990s ( perhaps after he was mildly instrumental in achieving the first steps toward normalization of relations with Vietnam , which may have been something of a psychological catharsis for a man who tends to see issues big and small in an intensely personal way ) in the direction of bellicosity .
Dear , sweet Sarah says John McCain knows how to win a war .
There is scant evidence of that .
He has never been in a high military command position during wartime , let alone in a position that demanded a grasp of grand strategy .
It is hardly to denigrate his genuine courage and personal determination during his POW experience to suggest that being a prisoner has little or nothing to do with knowing how to win a war .
He did urge the surge , but he tends to credit the surge solely for the reduction in violence in Iraq , when everybody knows that the Anbar Awakening , which preceded the surge , was almost certainly more significant  to say nothing of the de facto segregation of Baghdad with massive walls and the decision by the Iranians , for reasons of their own , to rein in Moqtada al - Sadr ’s forces .
I do n’t know if McCain understands the significance of those other developments , some related and some unrelated to the surge , but his consistent failure to acknowledge them does n’t indicate a brilliant strategic mind .
Not to mention that he does n’t seem to have the knowledge or imagination to consider that stateless terrorism can and should  perhaps even must  be approached by methods other than straightforward military action .
As for Barack Obama , while he did have the judgment to oppose the war in Iraq before it was undertaken  and based on his speeches at the time actually had some good reasons for it  he seems to suffer from the delusion that you ca n’t simply be against war and adventurism in this country , but that if you ’re against one war you have to demonstrate that you ’re still a macho dude by plumping for war in some other theater .
Thus he promises deeper involvement in Afghanistan , which has not only long been the graveyard of empires , but is bigger than Iraq , with more difficult terrain , much trickier ethnic / tribal complications , and no history of having been a viable nation - state in the modern sense ( even one enforced through brutal repression , as in Saddam ’s Iraq ) or of wanting to become one .
A final bit of evidence of imperial decline .
All these distinctly mediocre people are surrounded by courtiers and enablers , not only in their own entourages but in the media and the academy .
Thus a panoply of conservatives argue that the ability to string together a few complete sentences after having stumbled in one - on - one interviews is evidence of magnificent leadership qualities .
On the other side , the ability to deliver modestly inspirational speeches that upon analysis are more characterized by vaporous platitudes than anything remotely resembling concrete ideas about how to achieve " change we can believe in " is hailed as the mark of a truly great orator on the level of Martin Luther King , Jr. or Daniel Webster .
Most of our intelligentsia , even those with a certain degree of intelligence themselves , ca n’t distinguish between modest abilities and genuine excellence , or pretend not to be able to do so when assessing those believed to be on their side .
We ’re bound to suffer as imperial decline proceeds , but all will probably not be lost .
Rome , Vienna , London , and Paris are still great cities , and probably more culturally alive than when they were imperial capitals .
Beyond empire might lie real promise .
“ Blast ” not ruled out as source of blaze

A U.S. Navy warship stationed in the Persian Gulf has reportedly caught fire , with officials not ruling out that a “ blast ” was the cause of the blaze .
According to Press TV , the vessel was moved to the Iraqi port cities of Al - Bakr and al - Amaya following the fire .
“ The sources did not rule out the possibility that a blast had started the fire on the vessel that was said to be “ one of the four US warships in the region , ” the report added .
U.S. military officials are yet to comment on the report .
Fears of a Gulf of Tonkin style provocation to grease the skids for an invasion of Iran have repeatedly surfaced in the media .

Pulitzer prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh revealed in July that top Neo -Cons , including Vice President Dick Cheney , had convened to brainstorm ways of building a pretext for a military strike on Tehran .
The meeting took place in Cheney ’s office and the subject on the table was “ how to create a casus belli between Tehran and Washington , ” part of an ongoing effort to provide an excuse to attack Iran .
“ There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war , ” Hersh explains .
“ The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up . ”
In January , the Pentagon released video footage and an audio tape that allegedly depicted Iranian aggression against U.S. Navy warships in the Straight of Hormuz .
The video tape failed to show any aggressive action on behalf of the Iranian patrol boats and many dismissed the audio tape as a crude fake .

Desert island tennis - fans flock to Qatar to watch historic match
Fancy watching a tennis match on a desert island ?
Fans from around the world arrived in the bay of Doha in Qatar to mark the start of the Sony Ericsson Championships .
Top players including number - one - ranked Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and Elena Dementieva of Russia are scheduled to appear in the tournament , which begins on November 4 .
It is part of the Sony Ericsson Women 's Tennis Association ( WTA ) Tour 2008 , which is staging the event for the first time in Doha .
A historic tennis match on a desert island in Qatar will mark the start of the Sony Ericsson Championships
Other players participating in the singles include Dinara Safina , Svetlana Kuznetsova , Serena Williams , Venus Williams and Vera Zvonareva .
Chasing ranking points is usually high on the agenda for players .
But with Miss Ivanovic having already secured the year - ending world number one spot , the top players have expressed concern that new rules may be constraining the players .
A revamped playing schedule , the 2009 Roadmap calendar , was designed to create a more fan friendly and healthier system to more consistently deliver stars to top events and reduce withdrawals .
Number - one - ranked Ana Ivanovic ( right ) and Elena Dementieva will play in the tournament
Players will now need to compete in a fewer number of tournaments from next season .
But the trade - off is that top - 10 players could be suspended if they opt to miss any event designated as ' mandatory ' .
They must compete in at least 10 of the 20 Premier events -- previously known as Tier I and II tournaments -- and the four grand slams .
All top 10 players must compete at Indian Wells , Miami , Madrid and Beijing .

In my never ending hunt for cool and unblogged about pop culture in Japan , I found this mysterious item at the convenience store :
What sold me was it apparently went fast enough or was powerful enough to shatter it ’s own UPC code .
My first impression was that it had something to do with racing given what I thought was a speedometer or cyclometer .
Then there is the fake signs of scraping and damage printed on .
Maybe it was some sort of foul sports drink I initially thought .
It turned out to be a little sweet and citric but I could n’t really figure out what it tasted like .
So translation time …
The yellow line on the front lets one know it ’s a carbonated drink .
The product name translates as “ Carbonic Acid Gas Cylinder ” , so the color and presumably pressure , not speedometer meter make sense .
Then the third line on the front points out that muscat and grapefruit is the flavor .
Certainly not bad tasting , the design is surely more curious than appealing .
Not likely targeted toward women .
I ’m reminded when I see the tanks full of liquid nitrogen that are left out on Manhattan streets all the time .
I never saw another bottle of this stuff .
Just glad it did n’t explode .

Michael Reagan : Obama ' absolutely admirable ' for not taking public funding David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican strategist and prominent McCain supporter Michael Reagan stunned the hosts of Fox and Friends on Thursday morning when he stated , " Barack Obama has run a brilliant campaign " and called Obama 's decision to opt out of public financing " smart politics . "
" I would rather see us do private funding for elections , " Reagan stated .
" I think what he did was absolutely admirable .
I wish Republicans would do that . "
Obama 's purchase of airtime to run a half - hour infomercial on Wednesday was made possible only by his reliance on private fundraising , for which he has been severely criticized by the McCain campaign .
When Fox 's Gretchen Carlson insisted that Obama had " lied " when he suggested early in the campaign that he might accept public financing , Reagan quickly cut her off .
" It 's really interesting , " commented Reagan .
" Conservative Republicans have always wanted private financing , not public financing .
So I think the McCain argument that he lied and he did n't take public financing ...
I think it 's really a bogus argument . "
The Fox hosts appeared amazed by this positive reaction from Reagan , who has generally been harshly critical of Obama , recently writing , " How does he explain the proven fact that he has been wallowing in a sty surrounded by fervent socialists and sharing in their swill for most of his life ? "
However , liberal columnist Kirsten Powers quickly agreed with Reagan 's assessment .
" If he did n't do it , it would have been political malpractice , " she said of Obama 's decision .
" He could n't have walked away from all that money .
It just would have been stupid , I think . "
" Barack Obama has run a brilliant campaign , " continued Reagan .
" The Republicans have run a campaign from last century .
And the Republicans , if they want to win , have to come into this century and learn to raise money on the Internet . "
Powers noted that McCain probably made a mistake in accepting public financing , but added that " I do n't think he was going to raise anything near the amount of money that Barack Obama did , anyway .
I mean , Barack Obama has raised such an insane amount of money . "

My favourite rejected / withdrawn Python Enhancement Proposal ( PEP ) is Steven Bethard 's PEP 359 based on an idea by Michele Simionato .
That 's not to say I disagree with Guido not wanting it in Python , but I like aspects of the idea conceptually as part of a possible Python - like language .
Consider the class statement ( take from the PEP ) :
class C( object ) : x = 1 def foo( self ) : return ' bar '
This , as the PEP points out , is equivalent to :
C = type ( ' C ' , ( object , ) , {'x ': 1 , ' foo ' :< function foo at ...>} )
And more generally :
class < name > < bases > : __metaclass__ = < metaclass > < block >
is syntactic sugar for :
< name > = < metaclass >( " < name > " , < bases > , < dictionary created by executing block > )
The PEP points out that the class statement nicely avoids the need to mention the name twice and also does the task of executing a block of statements and creating a dictionary of the bindings that result .
It then proposes a make statement of the following form :
make < callable > < name > < tuple > : < block >
that would basically make the class statement syntactic sugar usable for other things .
See the PEP itself for a bunch of interesting this this would allow in Python .
I certainly think it makes metaclasses clearer .
But my interest is n't so much in Python , but just thinking about a language where something like this is core .
On a related note : think of relationship between Python function definition statements and lambda expressions .
One thing I like about Javascript is that the syntax for named and anonymous functions are so similar .
One thing I like about Java is that you can have anonymous classes .
I wonder if all this could be supported with one core syntax .
This relates to the whole concept of the " dictionary created by executing a block of statements " .
I find this notion of a " block of statements " being a first - class object appealing .
Imagine a function that , instead of having a return value , simply returns its bound local variables .
I guess Python modules are pretty much that .
But I 'm thinking of the notion within a file .
One could argue Python classes are almost that , but they carry with them two additional features — inheritance and instantiation — that would be , I think , interesting to separate out .
Inheritance could be separate and could be a general property of dictionaries .
I think it would be interesting and potentially useful to have dictionaries with bases .
Of course it 's possible to implement such a notion in Python now ( see my final remark in this post ) .
Because of these other characteristics of inheritance and creating a dictionary from executing a block of statement , Python classes can be useful without ever instantiating them .
So I think it would be interesting to have a language where instantiability is just another characteristic that can be added on to a dictionary .
Of course , Python lets you do that to some extent now with special methods such as __new__ and __call__ .
Which leads me to my final thoughts .
While I still think it would be fun to explore a language whose fundamental concepts are built along the lines I 've been talking about , I think it is worth noting that Python does pretty much let you implement things this way right now .
The biggest takeaway for me from Guy Steele 's talk was that a good language is one that can take common patterns and turn them in to things that look like primitives of the language .
You just need to look at most Python ORMs to see an excellent example of that .

Sandie Hollick - Kenyon wipes down the belly of a dead female chum salmon before slitting it open , letting thousands of beautiful , glistening pink eggs inside spill out into a plastic bucket .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
In a few hours , she will take these eggs from here , the South Alouette River near Maple Ridge , to the Mossom Creek hatchery in Port Coquitlam , where they will be fertilized , incubated and eventually released as fry and smolts -- approximately 86,000 to 110,000 chum and coho in total .
This egg - take operation is small potatoes compared to that of the major hatcheries in British Columbia .
There are 19 of these facilities in British Columbia that altogether produce hundreds of millions of young salmon each year .
Any time people nurture salmon into existence , it would seem to obviously be a good news story for B.C. 's beleaguered salmon fishery .
But the role played in our coastal environment by these hatcheries -- as well as by smaller community and First Nations hatcheries -- is controversial .
Some say the hatcheries do more harm than good .
They are a sign of our failure to protect wild salmon habitat , and are in fact hurting some wild salmon stocks , charge critics .
Others counter they are a way to get people involved in watershed conservation , and without them , some stocks would simply disappear .
One Department of Fisheries and Ocean officer likened hatcheries to " chemotherapy for the rivers , " in other words , not an ideal situation , but better than the alternative .
Case against hatcheries
Is the cure doing more harm than good ?
According to Gordon Ennis , managing director of the Pacific Fisheries Resource Conservation Council , the jury is still out .
The council published two reports and held a series of public meetings on B.C. salmon hatcheries in 2005 .
Ennis says some research supports the belief that hatchery fish impact wild stocks by competing for the same food resources , and bolstering commercial fleets that harvest abundant hatchery stocks as well as dwindling wild ones .
According to a 2004 DFO report , hatcheries have been used as a " major tool " to increase freshwater survival of wild , native stocks of coho , chinook and chum salmon .
When managed in conjunction with habitat conservation , the report finds , hatcheries should maximize stock survival in the long run .
" The other big issue is with respect to genetics , whether hatchery fish are changing the genetic makeup of fish in the rivers , and how fit those fish are in the long term , " says Ennis .
" But in our view , the information does n't exist to be definitive as to what the impacts are or are n't . "
" If you 're going to have a program where so much money is being spent , it 's incumbent to know the answers that we do n't know yet , " he adds .
Restoring a barren salmon stream
The program Ennis is referring to is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Salmonid Enhancement Program ( SEP ) .
It was created in 1979 with the goal of doubling the number of salmon on B.C. 's coast , and has a current operating budget of $ 26 million per year .
Ruth Foster and Rod McVickars started the Mossom Creek Hatchery 30 years ago with grant money from the newly launched SEP .
They were initially looking for a place to do field work with their Centennial High School students when they stumbled across the creek , Foster tells me .
Mossom Creek was puzzling , a perfectly healthy waterway with virtually no salmon .
" We concluded it had been fished out , " said Foster .
" In the '50s and '60s people were accustomed to coming to these little streams and just picking up dinner . "
We 're standing just under the tent where Hollick - Kenyon is supervising egg removal , at a site just adjacent to the river .
Foster has to speak up over the clamour from a group of Grade 5 students who are here to observe , take part in , and videotape the egg - take as part of a class project on salmon .
Hundreds of kids like these ones have been involved with the hatchery .
The current hatchery manager , Janet Rickards , first got involved when she was a student ( and still calls Ruth " Mrs. Foster " ) .
" A lot of today 's kids never ever get outside .
We 're losing touch and we always say that you only care about what you know about , " says Foster .
" What we 've seen over more than 30 years of working with kids in one place , in Mossom Creek , is that they do develop a sense of place and caring . "
Along with the school group , about a dozen community volunteers have come out to help on this rainy Friday morning in late - October .
A fish fence guides weary and battered chum heading upriver into a concrete pen adjacent to the river , where they are netted , killed with a blow to the head from a rubber club and then hung head - down on a metal rack to bleed .
The sperm , or milt , from males is simply squeezed out an opening near the base of the tail ; the females have to be opened up .
Once all the eggs and milt are collected , from 12 females and 15 males , we bring them back to the Mossom Creek hatchery .
The take , incubation and rearing process is all supervised by Hollick - Kenyon , the DFO community advisor for the Burrard Inlet and Salmon Arm region .
Hatcheries getting lower returns
Hollick - Kenyon says the ultimate goal is for small hatcheries like Mossom Creek to not have to operate anymore because healthy watersheds will one day be able to produce naturally - spawning salmon .
Of the 6,000 to 10,000 coho smolts released each year , she estimates the survival rate is less than one per cent .
This year , approximately 20 have returned .
Chum , of which 80,000 to 100,000 fry are released each year , fare a little better with returns of 400 to 600 adults .
Even those numbers have declined in recent years , says Hollick - Kenyon .
" In this case , what 's more important than production is community involvement and education , " she says .
" People can come up here and learn about their watershed and the value of a clean and healthy watershed .
The fish are a tool , an engaging tool to get people involved . "
Even large hatcheries , where production for commercial and sport fisheries is the main objective , are facing low returns this year .
Nitinat River hatchery is Canada 's largest salmon hatchery , producing chum , coho , chinook and steelhead , and it is a major contributor to the commercial chum fishery .
Nitinat used to take 40 million chum salmon eggs per year , but this year that number will be closer to ten million .
" This year we did n't have the adult returns in chum , and we had to be satisfied with what we had , " explains operations manager Hans Galesloot .
Those 10 million eggs are still only one - third of the lowered target for this year , which was 30 million .
Galesloot also blames " vagaries in the ocean , " for the poor returns -- but these vagaries are not well understood , nor is the impact of climate change on salmon and other fish stocks .
He says he remembers clearly the " battle cry " of the SEP to double the salmon in British Columbia 's waters .
" There were some years of glory , but there have been some years of diminished returns .
It 's been a tough haul . "
' It 's about people trying to feel good '
Craig Orr , executive director of the Watershed Watch Salmon Society , says that while small hatcheries do serve an educational purpose and maintain runs that would probably peter out altogether should the hatchery stop producing .
" It 's about people trying to feel good about doing something for the fish , " says Orr . " The conservation benefits are not really proven out there . "
As for large hatcheries , he says pumping out millions of fish will not be effective if mortality rates in the ocean continue to rise .
Orr says likening hatcheries to " chemotherapy " for a river is an interesting analogy .
" I 've heard people say that hatcheries are also a symbol that we failed to protect the natural productivity of the rivers , " he says .
" I think that 's accurate as well . "

Senior politicians from all parties are urging the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , to halt the extradition of the computer hacker Gary McKinnon unless she receives a guarantee from the US that he will be allowed to serve any sentence imposed in Britain .
The former home secretary David Blunkett is among those who believe that , because McKinnon has been diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome , he should be immediately repatriated if convicted .
In an early day motion , the shadow justice minister , David Burrowes , has urged Smith not to permit the extradition without assurances from the US that McKinnon would be repatriated to serve any sentence in the UK if found guilty .
Burrowes , the MP for the Enfield Southgate constituency in north London , where McKinnon lives , has alerted the home secretary to the " accepted practice " of the Dutch and Israeli governments requiring assurances from the US that any nationals with medical or mental health disabilities being deported to face trial should be repatriated to serve any sentence imposed .
Blunkett , who was in office when the 2003 Extradition
Act was passed , said yesterday that he was supporting calls for McKinnon to serve any sentence in the UK because of his " special needs " .
Burrowes 's motion has already been supported by Chris Huhne , the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman , Chris Mullin , the former Foreign Office minister , and the Tory MP John Bercow .
Burrowes has also asked Harriet Harman , the leader of the house , for a debate on the proposed extradition .
He noted that the house had debated the case of the NatWest Three , also known as the Enron Three , and asked Harman : " Can at least similar efforts be made on behalf of my constituent , who is a vulnerable young man of little means who was ... recently diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome ? "
Lord West , the Home Office minister with responsibility for security , wrote to Burrowes last week telling him that " we reconsidered ... but found no grounds for overturning the order to surrender " .
McKinnon has also had support from the leading constitutional lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC .
" Jack Straw bent over backwards to accommodate Pinochet 's medical condition , " said Robertson , in a reference to the decision not to extradite the late Chilean dictator because he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's .
" It is highly unsatisfactory that this gifted and unusual British citizen should be extradited to face a massive sentence when he could have been prosecuted here before a British jury . "
Lawyers acting for McKinnon , 42 , are seeking a judicial review of the case .
McKinnon 's mother , Janis Sharp , said : " Gary has Asperger 's syndrome ...
He believed the UK police when , almost seven years ago , they told him he would probably get six months ' community service .
Without having engaged a lawyer , he naively admitted to computer misuse but has always denied the alleged damage . "
Engineers and scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have achieved a breakthrough in the use of a one - atom thick structure called " graphene " as a new carbon - based material for storing electrical charge in ultracapacitor devices , perhaps paving the way for the massive installation of renewable energies such as wind and solar power .
The researchers believe their breakthrough shows promise that graphene ( a form of carbon ) could eventually double the capacity of existing ultracapacitors , which are manufactured using an entirely different form of carbon .
" Through such a device , electrical charge can be rapidly stored on the graphene sheets , and released from them as well for the delivery of electrical current and , thus , electrical power , " says Rod Ruoff , a mechanical engineering professor and a physical chemist .
" There are reasons to think that the ability to store electrical charge can be about double that of current commercially used materials .
We are working to see if that prediction will be borne out in the laboratory . "
Two main methods exist to store electrical energy : in rechargeable batteries and in ultracapacitors which are becoming increasingly commercialized but are not yet as popularly known .
An ultracapacitor can be used in a wide range of energy capture and storage applications and are used either by themselves as the primary power source or in combination with batteries or fuel cells .
Some advantages of ultracapacitors over more traditional energy storage devices ( such as batteries ) include : higher power capability , longer life , a wider thermal operating range , lighter , more flexible packaging and lower maintenance , Ruoff says .
Ruoff and his team prepared chemically modified graphene material and , using several types of common electrolytes , have constructed and electrically tested graphene - based ultracapacitor cells .
The amount of electrical charge stored per weight ( called " specific capacitance " ) of the graphene material has already rivaled the values available in existing ultracapacitors , and modeling suggests the possibility of doubling the capacity .
" Our interest derives from the exceptional properties of these atom - thick and electrically conductive graphene sheets , because in principle all of the surface of this new carbon material can be in contact with the electrolyte , " says Ruoff , who holds the Cockrell Family Regents Chair in Engineering # 7 .
" Graphene 's surface area of 2630 m2 / gram ( almost the area of a football field in about 1/500th of a pound of material ) means that a greater number of positive or negative ions in the electrolyte can form a layer on the graphene sheets resulting in exceptional levels of stored charge . "
The U.S. Department of Energy has said that an improved method for storage of electrical energy is one of the main challenges preventing the substantial installation of renewable energies such as wind and solar power .
Storage is vital for times when the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine .
During those times , the stored electrical energy can be delivered through the electrical grid as needed .

Ruoff 's team includes graduate student Meryl Stoller and postdoctoral fellows Sungjin Park , Yanwu Zhu and Jinho An , all from the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Texas Materials Institute at the university .
Their findings will be published in the Oct. 8 edition of Nano Letters .
The article was posted on the journal 's Web site this week .
This technology , Stoller says , has the promise of significantly improving the efficiency and performance of electric and hybrid cars , buses , trains and trams .
Even everyday devices such as office copiers and cell phones benefit from the improved power delivery and long lifetimes of ultracapacitors .
Ruoff says significant implementation of wind farms for generation of electricity is occurring throughout the world and the United States , with Texas and California first and second in the generation of wind power .
According to the American Wind Energy Association , in 2007 wind power installation grew 45 percent in this country .
Ruoff says if the energy production from wind turbine technology grew at 45 percent annually for the next 20 years , the total energy production ( from wind alone ) would almost equal the entire energy production of the world from all sources in 2007 .
" While it is unlikely that such explosive installation and use of wind can continue at this growth rate for 20 years , one can see the possibilities , and also ponder the issues of scale , " he says .
" Electrical energy storage becomes a critical component when very large quantities of renewable electrical energy are being generated . "
