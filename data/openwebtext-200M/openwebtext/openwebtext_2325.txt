The patients watched a series of 5 - to 10 - second film clips , some from popular television shows like “ Seinfeld ” and others depicting animals or landmarks like the Eiffel Tower .
The researchers recorded the firing activity of about 100 neurons per person ; the recorded neurons were concentrated in and around the hippocampus , a sliver of tissue deep in the brain known to be critical to forming memories .
In each person , the researchers identified single cells that became highly active during some videos and quiet during others .
More than half the recorded cells hummed with activity in response to at least one film clip ; many of them also responded weakly to others .
After briefly distracting the patients , the researchers then asked them to think about the clips for a minute and to report “ what comes to mind . ”
The patients remembered almost all of the clips .
And when they recalled a specific one — say , a clip of Homer Simpson — the same cells that had been active during the Homer clip reignited .
In fact , the cells became active a second or two before people were conscious of the memory , which signaled to researchers the memory to come .
“ It ’s astounding to see this in a single trial ; the phenomenon is strong , and we were listening in the right place , ” said the senior author , Dr. Itzhak Fried , a professor of neurosurgery at the University of California , Los Angeles , and Tel Aviv University .
His co-authors were Hagar Gelbard - Sagiv , Michal Harel and Rafael Malach of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel , and Roy Mukamel , of U.C.L.A .
Dr. Fried said in a phone interview that the single neurons recorded firing most furiously during the film clips were not acting on their own ; they were , like all such cells , part of a circuit responding to the videos , including thousands , perhaps millions , of other cells .
In studies of rodents , including a paper that will also appear Friday in the journal Science , neuroscientists have shown that special cells in the hippocampus are sensitive to location , activating when the animal passes a certain spot in a maze .
The firing pattern of these cells forms the animals ’ spatial memory and can predict which way the animal will turn , even if it makes a wrong move .
Three years ago today , Hurricane Katrina made landfall just east of New Orleans , Louisiana .
Poorly designed and poorly maintained levees failed to keep back the storm surge and the swollen waters , and half the city , mostly the poorest neighborhoods who had been left behind by an evacuation plan that was only half ready , went under water .
Almost 1,000 people died in the hurricane itself , and then dozens more died because the government , out of fear that ( non-existent ) gangs of armed black looters would steal the supplies and sell them on the black market , held back Red Cross disaster relief crews until the 101st Airborne could be flown back from the middle east to " pacify " a drowning American city .
The events of the subsequent three years have done nothing to reassure me that the gods have forgiven us , yet , for this unexpiated act of unmitigated national cowardice .
On this anniversary last year , I said that two years was not long enough to judge the reconstruction efforts a failure , and I stand by that .
It 's easy to underestimate how long it takes to rebuild an entire city after a disaster of this size .
I predicted at the time that it could end up being a decade or more before even the majority of the reconstruction was done , no matter who the President was or what party was in power , because it just plain takes that long to get people to agree on what to build in the ruins , raise the financing for it , and then get it built .
And here we are on the third anniversary , and the hardest - hit Lower Ninth Ward has barely finished clearing the rubble , with only a few scattered demonstration projects built , and that 's sad , but it 's still not a cause to go looking for someone to blame .
Some things just take as long as they take , and there 's nothing that can be done about that .
But it looks like , while two years was not enough , three years may , in fact , turn out to be as much time as we had to get two important parts of it done .
Or , to be precise , three years , zero months , and five days :
As of when I 'm embedding that image from the Weather Underground website , Hurricane Gustav is projected to make landfall five days after the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina .
It is currently projected to be a category 3 hurricane at the time , that is to say , on the same order of magnitude as Katrina .
And it is currently projected to be most likely to make landfall roughly the same distance from New Orleans , to the west this time .
Nobody with any reasonable sense of how long rebuilding takes expected the whole city to be rebuilt by now .
But now it appears that we 're going to find out , the hard way , whether three years was long enough to get the two most important parts of it done : the repairs and upgrades to the levees and flood walls , and the completion and updating of that long - overdue evacuation plan .
And , gods help the people of New Orleans , but it looks like only one of those two things , the evacuation plan , got finished .
At least this time , it looks like there will be buses and trains available to evacuate those who can't drive out .
But the levees ?
Not so much .
Back in May , President Bush vetoed the idea of freeing up more money for the levees until next summer , which , it looks like will turn out to have been too late .
But even that , even if the construction currently slated to end in 2011 had been done by today , that may have turned out to be too little .
The current plan , as inadequate as it is , would be to have the US Army Corps of Engineers , the government agency that supervised the construction of the original failed levees , supervise the same corrupt construction firms that built the original failed levees .
In the aftermath of the storm , President Bush said that whoever got the contract would be audited within an inch of their life , because of Louisiana 's long culture of corrupt government , but the money for the extra auditors was never allocated , either , so that part is n't getting done .
A Dutch engineering firm , Arcadis , came in with a plan for a real , solid , reliable , Dutch - style levee system , and delivered a detailed , almost 3,000 page plan to build it .
I 'm reading conflicting accounts as to why , but they were told to go home ; the resulting cheaper , sloppier design might not have even worked if they got it done .
And one thing I 'm being told by a lot of random sources is that nobody really thinks that itgoing to get done well , or maybe even ever , by the new contractors .
Why ?
Corruption .
Why finish the levee , when the longer the contract can be stretched out , the more opportunities for graft there are ?
So , all we can do now is wait , and hope that the parts that did get done will hold up , or the storm will weaken or somehow miss New Orleans , and we 'll all find out come Tuesday .
Well , no .
We can do one other thing , and it 's going to startle you hearing it out of my mouth : vote Republican .
No , not in every election .
And certainly not for President in November .
Vote Republican for mayor of New Orleans .
And Detroit .
And St. Louis .
And in every other corrupt , pestilential hell - hole of a city that 's been under single - party rule for too , too long .
What , the Republicans are running a nutbag flake in your city ?
Do n't worry ; you 're not going to get him elected .
That 's not even the goal .
The goal is to convince the Republicans that the current mayor is vulnerable , so they run a plausible , centrist candidate , someone who could conceivably get elected in your city , the next time .
And then I want you to vote for that guy .
Once .
And then get him out of there , and the sooner the better , before he gets out of control like Rudy " the Nazi " Giuliani did in New York City .
Because I 'm not asking you to vote Republican , in any of these Democratic cesspits , because I think that the Republicans have good ideas on how to govern cities .
On the contrary ; let them run any of these cities for more than a couple of years and they 'll utterly destroy them , especially the current crop of Republicans , all of whom are deeply wedded to voodoo economic theories like the Laffer Curve and who are turning out to be even more corrupt than the single - party - rule Democrats were .
No , it 's because of one and only one reason : it is awhen one party 's primary election 100 % reliably decides the final election results .
That kind of single - party rule breeds corruption .
It floats to the top those who do their best " work " in dark places , the ones with the most favors they can bestow or call in , the experts in graft and corruption .
The ones who count on the fact that their intra-party opponents wo n't reveal their worst crimes , for fear of tarnishing the party itself .
No party 's primary is ever as clean , as open , or as thoroughly investigated by the press as a two - party general election .
Because until corrupt scumbag party hacks like Francis Slay , Kwame Kilpatrick , and yes , absolutely Roy Nagin stop letting their friends and campaign contributors steal everything that 's not nailed down , until guys who intend to turn a blind eye while their friends commit horrific crimes and maybe even do some looting of the city themselves become afraid of holding office in America for fear of exposure in the next election ?
We 've got a lot of cities that will never recover , and New Orleans is n't even the worst of them .
It 's just the one that may be about about to physically drown , again .
Palin ’s cold shoulder
WASILLA , Alaska —
While Sarah Palin ’s supporters tout her personal warmth and openness , the newly minted Republican vice presidential nominee can be brusque to allies , advisers and employees who fall from her favor .
Palin has unceremoniously ended relationships with an aide who was dating a family friend ’s soon - to - be ex-wife , a campaign adviser whose mother - in - law fought Palin ’s legislative agenda , a local political mentor who she felt represented the “ old boys ' network , ” a police chief who she said tried to intimidate her with “ stern look [s ] ” and a state commissioner who refused to fire her sister ’s ex-husband .

“ When she decides you ’re done , you ’re done , ” said John Bitney , who was a top aide to Palin ’s gubernatorial campaign and administration .
Bitney , a longtime state Capitol hand who grew up in this small town with Palin and her husband , Todd , said he was asked to leave his job as legislative director in the governor ’s office last year after the Palins found out that he was dating the soon - to - be - ex - wife of one of Todd ’s good friends .
While Palin ’s office framed the departure as an “ amicable ” mutual decision , Bitney told Politico that Sarah and Todd Palin “ were upset with me about my divorce and who I was dating , and they did n’t want that in the governor ’s office .
I wanted to stay with the governor and support the governor — we ’re talking about someone who ’s been a friend for 30 years — but I understood it , and I have no ax to grind over the whole thing . ”
Still , Bitney took a line from the " Seinfeld " character Elaine , deeming Palin “ a bad breaker - upper . ”
Palin ’s abrupt and often unexplained — or not fully explained — dismissals , though , leave former colleagues and political observers speculating about the “ real reasons , ” Bitney said , adding that Palin 's style “ is more dramatic than the way most executives do it .
They bring you in , tell you they ’re going to go in another direction and get everyone in the office to sign a card and cut a cake .
But that ’s just not her style . ”
The McCain - Palin campaign declined to answer questions about Palin ’s personnel moves or personal rifts .
Her supporters in Wasilla — a group that seems to include an overwhelming majority of the city ’s 7,000 or so residents — say she is guided by the taxpayers ’ interests and a strong moral compass .
“ In general , she is an extremely kindhearted person , ” said Judy Patrick , a close ally who served on the city council when Palin was mayor .
“ It ’s just difficult when you ’re a leader .
She had to make tough decisions on how she planned to accomplish what she planned to accomplish and who was going to be on the team to do that . ”
Palin ’s willingness to end allegiances with those who offend her may have helped propel her rise in 2004 , when she exposed corrupt dealings by a Republican bigwig on the state ’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , burnishing her reformer credentials and setting the stage for her 2006 gubernatorial campaign .
But on other occasions , her trigger finger has gotten her into trouble .
An ongoing investigation by the state Legislature — expected to be released before the presidential election — into Palin ’s firing of Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan in January threatens to damage her reputation as a reformer .
At first , Palin offered only a vague , platitudinal explanation for Monegan ’s dismissal .
But after Monegan asserted he was pressured by both Sarah and Todd Palin , the governor accused Monegan of not being a team player , and of failing to hire sufficient numbers of troopers or doing enough to reduce rural alcohol abuse .
Earlier this month , he said that " pressure could have been perceived to exist ” from her office to have the trooper fired , “ although I have only now become aware of it . "
Some who worked with Palin during the beginning of her political career here say her hair trigger revealed itself as soon as she became mayor of her hometown in 1996 and , at least initially , hurt her ability to get the job done .
After upsetting the three - term incumbent Wasilla mayor in 1996 , Palin quickly eliminated the position of one city department director and asked five others for a letter of resignation , a résumé and a letter explaining why they should be retained .
Though five of the six department heads had supported her opponent , John Stein , Palin insisted the housecleaning was not politically motivated .
Only two directors kept their jobs and one of them — city planner Duane Dvorak — left on his own eight months later .
“ After all the excitement , I kind of felt like the ax could fall any time and just never felt like the situation warmed up , ” said Dvorak , who had worked for Stein for more than two years and is now a planner for the far away Kodiak Island Borough .
Dvorak , who did not back either Stein or Palin , recounted being asked to brief the new mayor and her top aide on a wide variety of topics related to the city and state codes “ that really did n’t have a whole lot to do with planning .
But because they let everyone else go , they did n’t have anyone else to call on , ” he said .
“ It ’s one thing to take the city in a different direction and try to work with the staff that you have and maybe make a few key changes over time , but to just precipitously let people go and then restaff — it did n’t go over well . ”
According to once - confidential records , Palin suggested that one of Stein ’s top backers , then - Police Chief Irl Stambaugh , had purposefully made her miss a city proceeding — which she called “ a very embarrassing situation for me ” — by not informing her of it and asserted Stambaugh did not participate enough in staff meetings .
“ And when you did speak , you often did so in a disrespectful or condescending tone , ” she wrote in a termination letter to Stambaugh , in which she asserted she had tried for three months to win his support .
“ You never gave me that , ” she wrote Stambaugh , who had been chief since the town created its own police department four years earlier .
“ When I met with you in private , ” she continued , “ instead of engaging in interactive conversation with me , you gave me short , uncommunicative answers , and then you would sit there and stare at me in silence with a very stern look , like you were trying to intimidate me . ”
The letter was released as part of Stambaugh ’s wrongful termination and discrimination lawsuit against the city , in which his lawyer wrote Stambaugh , who stood over 6 feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds , “ had been informed that Mayor Palin felt intimidated because of his size .
The mayor never discussed this perceived problem with Stambaugh .
However , Stambaugh , being sensitive to the mayor ’s concern regarding his sex , size and height , made particular efforts to sit in a chair whenever discussing matters with Mayor Palin and talk in a quiet , soothing voice to the mayor . ”
The suit alleges Palin ousted Stambaugh at the behest of the National Rifle Association , which supported a state concealed weapons bill that Stambaugh opposed , and of local bar owners , who — along with Palin — opposed Stambaugh ’s push to shorten bar hours .
Both NRA members and bar owners made campaign contributions to Palin .
Stambaugh ’s suit was dismissed .
One day after Palin delivered an “ intent to terminate employment ” letter to Wasilla 's veteran library director , Mary Ellen Emmons , Palin relented , telling the Anchorage Daily News that Emmons promised to support the new mayor .
" You know in your heart when someone is supportive of you , ” she told the paper after talking with Emmons , who quit before the end of Palin ’s first term .
Stein , who Palin easily bested in a 1999 rematch , told Politico that Palin ended up doing a fine job in her two terms as mayor .
But the 1996 falling of the “ Palin ax ” — as the local Frontiersman newspaper dubbed it — was unprecedented and whipped up a fierce controversy in the town , including a threatened recall petition from a group headed by Stein and then - Councilman Nick Carney .
Carney , whose daughter had played high school basketball with Palin , in 1992 recruited the then - 28 - year - old Palin to run for city council .
She easily won the race but quickly broke from Carney .
“ Right away , I saw that it was a good old boys ' network , ” Palin is quoted as saying in a favorable biography of her published in April .
“ Mayor Stein and Nick Carney told me , ‘ You ’ll learn quick , just listen to us . ’
Well , they did n’t know how I was wired . "
It contends that soon after Palin took office , she “ made a political enemy of Carney , ” who owned a garbage removal company , by voting against an ordinance he proposed that would have required city residents pay for curbside pickup .
And this year , Palin largely shut out Tuckerman Babcock , an influential local Republican strategist who has advised her in each campaign since 1996 , and who the Frontiersman said was up for — but never received — a top city job when Palin became mayor .
Babock ’s mother - in - law is state Senate president and fellow Wasilla Republican Lyda Green , who fought many of Gov. Palin ’s legislative initiatives and recently told the Daily News that Palin is " not prepared to be governor .
How can she be prepared to be vice president or president ? "
Babcock would not speculate as to why Palin stopped seeking his counsel but told Politico , “ She ’s doing fine without me , so it ’s not a big deal . ”
Out of all the upcoming innovations in science , 3D printing is a very promising technology for various industries .
Theoretically , 3D printing allows virtually anyone to produce objects instantly , regardless of quantity .
Once fully implemented into society , this technology could redefine food , clothing , and even medicine as we know it .
Take a closer look at the 3D printing process through these facts .

Predictions for 3D printing ’s market value by 2022 amount to $ 9.4 billion in the medical industry alone .
The metallic 3D printing market is expected to grow to $ 6.6 billion by 2026 .
David Jones first published the concept for 3D printing in 1974 .
Hideo Kodama developed 2 methods for producing 3D plastic models in 1981 .
Bill Masters patented the first 3D printer in 1984 .
Chuck Hull developed stereolithography also in 1984 .

Filabot developed a new system in 2012 to produce a wider variety of plastic products .
Benjamin S. Cook and Manos M. Tentzeris developed a method in 2014 to produce complex electronics with 3D printing .
3D printing is also called additive manufacturing .
Designs for 3D printing are first made using Computer Assisted Drawing ( CAD ) .
3D printing started out only with plastics but developed to include metal and ceramics .
Some scientists claim 3D printing heralds the next Industrial Revolution .
Even the US Navy studied the possibility of using 3D printing to make replacement parts .

10 3D printed weaponry is another possible downside of 3D printing .
Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) is the most common form of 3D printing today .
Also called Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) , Fused Deposition Modeling comprises 48 % of all 3D printers in use .
It creates shapes through layering thermoplastic , much like how a glue gun works .
These 3D printers typically create objects from the bottom up .
Stereolithography uses light for 3D printing .
For , stereolithography light carves model inside a tub of raw materials .
The raw materials used are sensitive to light , hardening as it shines through them .
The light cures the raw materials , hardening them layer after layer to form the subject .
As each layer is completed , it ’s lifted out of the tub , with the model emerging in full once it ’s finished .
Selective Laser Sintering ( SLS ) is a newer method of 3D printing .
As the name suggests , Selective Laser Sintering creates models through using lasers to fuse powdered raw materials into a final form .
A common raw material used in this method is nylon .
The laser heats the nylon powder to the brink of melting , which makes the material plastic and fusible into the desired shape .
The printing process finishes once the model is fully fused .

Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) works like SLS .
Since both 3D printing methods use lasers , SLM is often called a sub - type of SLS .
However , experts do n’t accept this classification .
In SLM , lasers actually melt the raw material in layers of around 20 mm thick before welding them together .
As they ’re welded , they form the pattern of the final subject .
Unlike SLS , SLM uses metal powder instead of plastic or synthetic fibers .
SLM is actually one of the most common 3D printing methods that use metal .
The most advanced 3D printers can use many kinds of raw materials .
Most 3D printers today use only one kind of raw material , such as plastic , cloth , or metal .
Now , printing something with multiple kinds of materials requires the final object to be printed one part at a time .
After this tedious process , the individual parts are fused together .
However , scientists are now studying how to make a printer that can use many kinds of raw materials at the same time .
Though there ’s still a long way to go , the medical field is already looking forward to a final design .
Theoretically , 3D printing of pills and other medicines will drastically lower production costs and enable greater quantities .
3D printing was first used to build tools and prototypes .
Initially , 3D printing ’s main purpose was for factories and engineers to make replacement tools and parts more efficiently .
Early on , 3D printing was also used for making scale prototypes with greater detail and accuracy compared to other methods .
It was n’t until the 2010s that high demand and more advanced technology allowed 3D printers to produce complex devices .
Scientists are looking into 3D printed food .
This sounds something out of a sci - fi movie , but it ’s true .
Scientists today are considering 3D printers as a food source .
Currently , 3D printed food is still limited and only works with softer ingredients like cheese , chocolate , and syrup .
However , scientists believe that even with those limitations , their work has promise .
Scientists see potential in 3D printing as a breakthrough for people with special diets and elderly people who ca n’t eat solid food .
NASA is also studying the idea to provide food for their astronauts .
Global brands are already producing 3D printed clothes and apparel .
Much of 3D printing ’s role in apparel involves producing prototypes such as women ’s underwear or luxury clothes , for fashion designers .
However , big brands such as Nike already use 3D printers to make shoes for American football players as of 2020 .
New Balance also uses 3D printers for custom - made shoes of all sports .
Intellectual property is a major concern when it comes to 3D printing .
Although 3D printing seems to be the future , it also threatens inventors and innovators .
Interested individuals and parties have already expressed the downside of 3D printing when it comes to violating patents and copyrights .
However , courts have since ruled that as long as 3D printed materials are n’t sold or used for profit , then they fall under the law ’s fair use conditions .

This Week in HTML 5 – Episode 1
Welcome to a new semi- regular column , " This Week in HTML 5 , " where I 'll try to summarize the major activity in the ongoing standards process in the WHATWG and W3C HTML Working Group .
The biggest news is the birth of the Web Workers draft specification .
Quoting the spec , " This specification defines an API that allows Web application authors to spawn background workers running scripts in parallel to their main page .
This allows for thread - like operation with message - passing as the coordination mechanism . "
This is the standardization of the API that Google Gears pioneered last year .
See also : initial Workers thread , announcement of new spec , response to Workers feedback .
Also notable this week : even more additions to the Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images .
4 new cases were added :
Additionally , the spec now tries to define what authors should do if they know they have an image but do n't know what it is .
Quoting again from the spec :
If the src attribute is set and the alt attribute is set to a string whose first character is a U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET character ( { ) and whose last character is a U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET character ( } ) , the image is a key part of the content , and there is no textual equivalent of the image available .
The string consisting of all the characters between the first and the last character of the value of the alt attribute gives the kind of image ( e.g. photo , diagram , user - uploaded image ) .
If that value is the empty string ( i.e. the attribute is just " {} " ) , then even the kind of image being shown is not known .
If the image is available , the element represents the image specified by the src attribute .
If the image is not available or if the user agent is not configured to display the image , then the user agent should display some sort of indicator that the image is not being rendered , and , if possible , provide to the user the information regarding the kind of image that is ( as derived from the alt attribute ) .

This is my third entry on the big blast at the Islamabad Marriott .
God , the name says it all : “ Islamabad Marriott . ”
Talk about two words that do n’t fit together very well .
The town just was n’t big enough for “ Islamabad ” and “ Marriott , ” especially when you see pictures of Marriott ’s big sign , in fancy Disney letters .
You can have an Islamabad or you can have a Marriott , but you ca n’t have both — not for long .
That ’s one theory getting bounced around today about why the Marriott was hit : “ this symbol of Western influence ” just got in the Taleban / Al Qaeda ’s face .
But there are plenty of other theories getting time online .
That ’s today ’s key lesson in War Nerding , 21st - century style : a computer monitor turns out to be a great vector for catching that ol ’
Fog of War Keegan likes to talk up .
Now me , I ’m not a big fan of that Fog stuff , because ( a ) anybody with sense already knows war ’s a messy , confused business ; and ( b ) all it ’s really good for as a theory is giving hometown commentators an excuse to trot out when their troops shoot up a bunch of villagers .
But for a serious war nerd , that fog is what you get on Day 3 after a big event .
Everybody ’s pushing a theory , and you have to take it all in without believing any of it too much .
That ’s the tricky part .
Like yesterday I got a very interesting tip from a fan in India , who said that everybody on the Subcontinent knows that when a blast is done with “ high - quality commercial explosive , ” like this one , it ’s a sure sign the blast is the work of the ISI , the Pakistani Intelligence Service .
I checked this out and sure enough , there are a good few stories ( story one , story two ) about ISI agents caught with RDX , their favorite plastique .
Now , here ’s another war - nerding tip : when you ’re getting easy access to high - quality info like this from one side in a conflict with lots of PR on both sides , do n’t get too cocky .
You better consider if you ’re getting that info TOO easily .
What I mean is , looks to me like Indian intelligence is eager to pin all the plastique found from Lahore to Assam on the ISI .
Of course that may be the truth ; it really may be all ISI .
They ’re evil bastards , no doubt about that .
You just have to stay cool and sort of calmly despise all sides , like a cop .
After sifting it through for a while , I ’m inclined to say that even if all this info is coming from Indian intel , it ’s basically sound : the ISI does have a track record of passing that play - dough around to its little friends in Kashmir , Assam and any other Indian region that wants to blow up a few officials .
And ISI has reason to be antsy at home in Pakistan right now .
The new PM , Zardari , is pushing back against the ISI ’s proxies in Waziristan , including the Pakistani Taleban chieftans who killed his wife .
Remember the assassination of Benazir Bhutto ?
It sticks in my memory mainly for the hands - down dumbest official lie ever passed after a killing : the Pakistani security people said she ’d died from hitting her head on the car door .
Seriously .
“ That sniper had nothing to do with it !
It was the fatal blow of an SUV ’s cruel door - handle that killed the poor lady ! ”
Well , that and a bullet to the head from a Taleban sniper or three .
So Zardari has reason to hate the Taleban , and the Taleban is the ISI ’s proxy army .
A proxy army is a wonderful thing to have , you know ?
The ISI can use Waziristan , way over against the Afghan border , like the Syrians use the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon , as a summer camp for any insurgents they ’re sponsoring .
The ISI trains its favorite Kashmiri groups there , as well as its boys in Afghanistan .
When I say Zardari has reason to hate them , I do n’t mean because they killed his wife .
You have to get over the idea that the big players anywhere are personally attached to anybody but themselves and their tribes .
Zardari is called Zardari because he ’s the chief of the Zardari tribe , the way the heads of Scottish clans used to be called “ THE Mc - This ” or “ THE Mc - That . ”
His grudge here is tribal , not personal .
Maybe he and the late Benazir liked each other personally , I do n’t know .
I doubt it , but who knows ?
It was a dynastic marriage — think Europe in the old days .
It was n’t a romantic comedy .
( That ’s a funny idea , a romantic comedy in the Pakistani elite .
Maybe I can sell that script . )
Zardari had promised to “ crack down on terrorism ” and some gullible reporters are saying that ’s why Al Qaeda / Taleban hit Islamabad .
But guys , every Pakistani PM ever born has said that , to keep the US aid flowing , and every Pakistani cabdriver has laughed out loud when the announcement came on his radio between Bollywood dance numbers .
It do n’t mean a thing .
Zardari ’s job was to talk from both sides of his mouth ; he also said Pakistan will fight any US troops who cross the border to fight the Taleban inside Pakistan .
That was for the home crowd ; the “ terrorism - fighting ” noise was for the foreign - aid crowd .
Neither remark means a thing .
What may mean something is that there ’s a rumor the Pakistani leadership was originally going to have dinner at the Marriott the night it was bombed .
The rumors got so serious Marriott HQ issued an official denial .
And if you follow the news carefully you know that there ’s no proof as solid as an official denial .
So it looks like yup , the new Zardari clique was going to have dinner at the hotel , then got nervous and retreated to the Palace instead .
And there we are , back with our sad little suicide bomber , settling for second - best , all dressed up and nothing worth bombing except a few CIA brass .
See , I knew Al Q would n’t be dumb enough to bomb the CIA .
I knew they had to be after bigger game .
So if Zardari was the target , then Al Q decided he actually was going to act against their friends in the ISI , probably because the ISI passed the word to them , and they decided to take him out before he could get too comfortable in the job .
Then the dinner got moved and …what happened then ?
It ’s an interesting moment , in a Kiefer - Sutherland 24 way : you ’re an ISI official and you just found out the PM ’s dinner has been moved from the Marriott to the Palace .
Meanwhile your proxies in the Taleban are sending a jihadi kamikaze ( good name for a band , huh ? ) to the Marriott .
Do you call it off ?
Apparently not , judging by that crater in the parking lot .
So why not ?
Well , terrorism is n’t necessarily about killing the enemy , or even an “ enemy . ”
In Pakistan , you use a bomb to send a message .
So even if the Prime Minister wo n’t be at the Marriott , the thought that he was supposed to be there , that he could ’ve been the center of that crater , has a powerful what - you - might - call “ deterrent ” effect .
He ’ll think twice now before he pushes too hard to take back the TAFA .
There ’s a great story that Saladin was about to start a campaign to wipe out the Ismaili Assassin sect in their mountain “ eyries . ”
Then he woke up with a knife stuck right into the ground beside his head and a note : “ Dear Mister Saladin , Please reconsider that campaign against us , Signed , Your Pals The Assassins . ”
The campaign was cancelled with hardly any delay .
That ’s my guess about why they went ahead with the blast : even if Zardari was n’t at the Marriott , it ’s the thought that counts .
The bomb was like that wake - up knife in Saladin ’s pillow .
But all this is , like they say , “ subject to change . ”
You ’re seeing me about halfway through the sifting .
In a normal War Nerd column I ’d spare you all this “ maybe ” and “ could be ” stuff , but that ’s the point of these Islamablogs , showing the process , like this seminar leader said once to my office , “ the process is the point . ”
I do n’t know what he meant by that , nobody was actually listening , but I ’ll try anything once .

Britney Spears is said to be “ furious ” with her mother , Lynne , after Lynne detailed her daughter ’s past in her memoir , “ Through the Storm . ”
While the book does n’t dish on Britney ’s sex life or drug use , it blames all of Britney ’s problems on her daughter ’s former managers .
Spears – who already considered her mother a siphon on her purse – is “ upset ” about the book , spies said , especially when she feels Lynne herself caused so many of her problems and issues .
Spears is now only talking to her father , Jamie , who , as her conservator and guardian , has cleaned up her affairs and put his daughter back on the straight and narrow .
A rep for Spears said , “ This is false . ”
Spears is even being allowed out by herself and last weekend went to Las Vegas to catch the Cirque du Soleil show “ Love ” at the Mirage .
Afterward , Britney and her hairstylist , Kim Vo , went to Japonais and drank only water before hitting the blackjack tables and going home – sober .

Although light is considered to be rather a practical than an artistic tool , it has some properties which designers can effectively explore in their works .
Indeed , light can also be considered as a medium for more powerful and more vivid artistic expression .
In fact , many artists and crews make use of it creating quite impressive works of art .

Light Paintings and Light Sculptures
Sitooterie II
The structure is a cube punctured by over 5000 long thin windows that project from all its surfaces and lift it off the ground .
As the long thin windows all point at the exact centre of the cube , it only takes a single light source , located at this central point , to send light through every tube , causing the windows to glow orange .
A small number of them also project into the cube to form seating .

Mr. Prasad ’s latest mission is sure to stir the debate .
He is conducting a qualitative survey of nearly 20,000 households here in northern state of Uttar Pradesh to measure how everyday life has changed for Dalits since economic liberalization began in 1991 .
The preliminary findings , though far from generalizable , reveal subtle shifts .

The survey , financed by the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania , finds that Dalits are far less likely to be engaged in their traditional caste occupations  for instance , the skinning of animals , considered ritually unclean  than they used to be and more likely to enjoy social perks once denied them .
In rural Azamgarh District , for instance , nearly all Dalit households said their bridegrooms now rode in cars to their weddings , compared with 27 percent in 1990 .
In the past , Dalits would not have been allowed to ride even horses to meet their brides ; that was considered an upper - caste privilege .
Mr. Prasad credits the changes to a booming economy .
“ It has pulled them out of the acute poverty they were in and the day - to - day humiliation of working for a landlord , ” he said .
To prove his point , Mr. Prasad recently brought journalists here to his home district .
In one village , Gaddopur , his theory was borne out in the tale of a gaunt , reticent man named Mahesh Kumar , who went to work in a factory 300 miles away so his family would no longer have to live as serfs , tending the animals of the upper caste .
When he was a child , Dalits like him had to address their upper - caste landlords as “ babu - saab , ” close to “ master . ”
Now it is acceptable to call them “ uncle ” or “ brother , ” just as people would members of their own castes .
Today , Mr. Kumar , 61 and uneducated , owns an airless one - room factory on the outskirts of Delhi , with a basic gas - fired machine to press bolts of fabric for garment manufacturers .
With money earned there , he and his sons have built a proper brick and cement house in their village .
Merger talks between Yahoo and AOL are back on the table , as Yahoo 's board has reportedly cleared the way for new discussions between the two companies .
If a deal is eventually reached between the two companies , AOL 's chunk of the search market would help Yahoo gain a larger lead over Microsoft in the search wars , and Time Warner will finally have talked someone into taking AOL off its hands .
News about Yahoo's plans comes from the ever - popular " person familiar " with the situation speaking to the Financial Times .
The anonymous source noted , however , that while the board has approved a new round of discussions with AOL , there are currently no active deal negotiations .
Yahoo first began courting AOL this past spring , as it searched for ways to escape Microsoft 's unwelcome advances .
Once it became clear that Microsoft was primarily after Yahoo's search business , a key aspect of the negotiations was finding a way to ensure that Yahoo remained a viable entity if search were sold off .
Enter AOL : it was already put on the market by Time Warner , and combining its portal with Yahoo's would expand Yahoo's scope .
Talks between Yahoo and Time Warner about AOL 's future became more serious in July , when it came out that a deal between Yahoo and AOL could result in Time Warner retaining a stake in the combined company .
Since then , however , things have cooled down a bit .
The renewed talks come a week after Time Warner 's Jeff Bewkes told investors that the company would determine AOL 's future " fairly soon . "
Microsoft is also said to be interested in AOL , although it does n't look as if anything serious is going on there yet either .
As we observed in July , Microsoft would also benefit from snapping up AOL 's user population in order to finally make some headway on Google , although the direct benefits for Microsoft do n't seem to be as strong as they would be for Yahoo .
Microsoft may have other interests in mind when it comes to its own talks with AOL , however .
By simply entering negotiations with AOL , Microsoft would drive up the asking price , making a buyout by Yahoo more costly .
1. Peak Oil is just a fairly specialized example of a much more general law : that of Diminishing Returns .
Essentially , it simply says " that the easy to find oil was found first , and the easy to extract oil was extracted first , and as time goes one we 're moving more and more towards the difficult to find and extract oil " .
It 's as simple as that , and no amount of throwing money at the problem is going to change it .
And the history of oil extraction ( I dislike the word " production " it implies someone is actually hard at work somewhere making oil ) seems to prove this point .
Some years ago , at the ASPO conference in Lisbon , I asked the director of Petrobras ( Brazil 's hugely successful oil company ) if he was a proponent of Peak Oil .
He said this : " I ca n't comment on that [ remember , this was still 2005 , and three years feel like a lifetime ! ]
but I will make a simple common sense statement : if there were easier to find or extract oil , we certainly would n't be looking for it thousands of metres under the ocean and paying these incredible costs to bring it up ! " .
But see what Petrobras people are saying nowadays , and you get the drift : " July 25 ( Bloomberg ) --
Crude oil at $ 126 a barrel is ``not expensive , '' considering production costs and rising demand , said Jose Sergio Gabrielli , chief executive officer of Brazil 's government - controlled oil company , Petroleo Brasileiro SA .
``Oil is an exhaustible resource , '' Gabrielli said in an interview today in Rio de Janeiro .
`` In order to produce new oil to replace the barrel you just used , you have to find oil that 's much more expensive than what you already produced . '' "
2. Rainer H. seems also to confuse extraction and reserves .
Even if a field has billions of barrels worth of oil , there are serious and real geological constraints of how much you can extract at any one moment .
The maximum flow of the field might be 1 million barrels , in which case , if demand is 2 million , we 're shit out of luck and the price is going to go up ( I 'm making numbers up to illustrate the point , but these constraints exist ) .
Also , injecting steam ( generally generated by using natural gas ... ) into an existing oild field is a last ditch resource and one that most companies try not to do , since this technique basically damages the field ( geologically ) and increases the amount of oil that is ultimately unrecoverable .
All fields have oil that will NEVER be recovered , from 5 to 10 % of the total reserves .
This is due to the fact that oil does not easily " rise " to the surface , so that lots of tricks are necessary to make it come up ( the times when oil would explode out of a derrick are long gone , those were the days of " easy to extract oil " , remember ) .
Also , fields are not smooth , nice , regular , round shaped caves , they are irregular , the walls of the deposits may be strong or brittle , etc ...
When you inject steam water into old , tired wells , it 's not the production that " explodes " , it 's generally the well itself that goes down in a sort of cave - in ( water is injected to fill the well , because oil floats on water and this causes it to rise ) .
3 . As for the role of speculation on the price of oil , it 's an interesting question , and rightly debated , but it 's controversial , and I think it sort of misses the point .
Speculators are going towards oil BECAUSE it is perceived as scarce , and becoming scarcer .
Whether speculators account for 30 $ or 50 $ of the current price , I would add that even 75 - 80 $ , as Rainer H. seems to be predicting as a future price would be considered a shockingly high price just a few years ago ( 5 ? 6 ? ) .
And consider that a US Federal task force fundamentally disagrees with the idea that speculators are actually driving the price uo ( Speculators Are n't Driving Up Oil Prices , Report Says ) using some sound analyses which refute some of the points he seems to be making in his text .
More important factors in driving the price of oil up are the US trade deficit and subsidies .
The trade deficit has basically generated huge deposits of dollars in countries which are experiencing meteoric growth , just at the time that oil is becoming somewhat scarce ( ie. as production seems to have hit a plateau ) .
Thus , the deficit is helping them to outbid other customers to get the oil .
Since western economies are still reasonably resilient , they can buy the oil at that price , but someone is being pushed out of the market .
These are essentially third world countries with weak economies , so you do n't get to hear about their brown outs , oil rationing and so on .
The other mechanism that the deficit is helping is that a lot of emerging economies simply subsidize gas at the pump .
Oil costs a lot less in India or in China than in the US .
This encourages increased demand in those countries as their economies grow .
And the governments can only pay for it because they 're sitting on all those dollars ...
So , even though this is not really a scientific analysis , I feel that there are enough " holes " in his arguments for me to continue going with my gut feeling .
Perhaps , as he says , oil prices will go to 75 $ before they come anywhere close to 1000 $ ....
But that 's not saying much , is it ?
A few months reprieve in the price does not a trend make , and the price of oil will eventually climb again and fulfill his prophecy .
Oil will go to 75 $ and eventually will go to 1000 $ , whether it takes 20 years or 10 years from now , and it will be a trend , of course ...

McClatchy :
" Knowles broke new ground while answering a reporter 's question on whether Wasilla forced rape victims to pay for their own forensic tests when Palin was mayor .
True , Knowles said .
Eight years ago , complaints about charging rape victims for medical exams in Wasilla prompted the Alaska Legislature to pass a bill -- signed into law by Knowles -- that banned the practice statewide .
" There was one town in Alaska that was charging victims for this , and that was Wasilla , " Knowles said A May 23 , 2000 , article in Wasilla 's newspaper , The Frontiersman , noted that Alaska State Troopers and most municipal police agencies regularly pay for such exams , which cost between $ 300 and $ 1,200 apiece .
" ( But ) the Wasilla police department does charge the victims of sexual assault for the tests , " the newspaper reported .
It also quoted Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon objecting to the law .
Fannon was appointed to his position by Palin after her dismissal of the previous police chief .
He said it would cost Wasilla $ 5,000 to $ 14,000 a year if the city had to foot the bill for rape exams .
" In the past we 've charged the cost of exams to the victims ' insurance company when possible , " Fannon told the newspaper .
" I just do n't want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer . " "
This has already been reported around the blogosphere .
It 's abhorrent , especially when you note that as mayor of Wasilla , Sarah Palin had no problem raising money to build a sports center , but drew the line at paying for rape victims ' forensic exams .
But there are two points that are worth underscoring .
First , this would have been bad enough if it was just a matter of being decent to women who have been raped .
But it 's not .
Unless the police catch the guy in the act , forensic exams provide some of the best evidence against a rapist .
Not collecting this evidence means significantly lowering your chances of convicting the man who did it .
That means that the people who pay for this idiotic policy are not just the rape victims whose tests are not done , but any women their rapists might go on to rape in the future .
Not collecting the evidence that would put rapists behind bars means more rape victims in the future .
You'd think that $ 5,000 to $ 14,000 a year would be a small price to pay for putting violent sex offenders behind bars .
Apparently , Sarah Palin disagrees .
Second , Alaska had to ban this practice in order to qualify for funding under the Violence Against Women Act , which was , of course , sponsored by Joe Biden :
" SEC .
3262 .
RAPE EXAM PAYMENTS .
( a ) No State or other grantee is entitled to funds under title XXXII of the Violence Against Women Act of 1993 unless the State or other grantee incurs the full cost of forensic medical exams for victims of sexual assault .
A State or other grantee does not incur the full medical cost of forensic medical exams if it chooses to reimburse the victim after the fact unless the reimbursement program waives any minimum loss or deductible requirement , provides victim reimbursement within a reasonable time ( 90 days ) , permits applications for reimbursement within one year from the date of the exam , and provides information to all subjects of forensic medical exams about how to obtain reimbursement .
( b) Within 90 days after the enactment of this Act , the Director of the Office of Victims of Crime shall propose regulations to implement this section , detailing qualified programs .
Such regulations shall specify the type and form of information to be provided victims , including provisions for multilingual information , where appropriate . "
One Vice Presidential nominee turned her back on past and future rape victims .
Another was looking out for them .
Oh , and guess who voted against the Violence Against Women Act ?
John McCain .
I used to work in battered women 's shelters .
I knew women whose husbands stabbed them all over with dinner forks , women whose husbands used to asphyxiate them for fun , women whose husbands ran over them four times , backwards and forwards , with a truck , and kids who managed to find the presence of mind to run to the nearest house and call the police while their father was trying to bash their mothers ' heads in on the sidewalk -- unfortunately , all real examples .
So even without the part about requiring funding for rape exams , that vote makes me very , very , very angry .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska , Oct 10 ( Reuters ) - Alaska lawmakers voted on Friday to make public a report about an abuse - of - power investigation into Governor Sarah Palin , the U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate .
Palin is being investigated for her dismissal in July of the state ’s public safety commissioner , a move her critics allege was part of a personal vendetta against a state trooper who was involved in a divorce from the governor ’s sister .
All 12 members of Alaska ’s Legislative Council who were present at the meeting voted in favour of making the report ’s findings public .
The report is expected to be distributed shortly .

Developers who adopt the Google App Engine for their cloud computing platform today may fear data lock - in , since the only way to import or export data is using a Python - based API .
Google is working on a tool to improve data exchange to improve data portability .
The Google App Engine is intended to help developers build and scale applications to run on Google 's infrastructure , says Peter Koomen , Google 's product manager for App Engine .
" It 's still difficult to build Web apps , " he notes .
Here 's why in a nutshell : a Web developer who has a bright idea has a steep ramp to climb before she can really get underway .
She has to set up an infrastructure stack — renting or buying servers , setting up a Web server , configuring a database engine — burning up both time and money .
That 's before a single line of code is written .
Then , when her website gets popular ( see , it was a bright idea ) , it can't handle the load .
The site needs to scale , and to do it quickly .
So the developer has to burn even more time and money ( under pressure ) to rent or provision more infrastructure , while figuring out how to split access across multiple Web servers .
It is n't an easy job .
It 's also a common issue .
" You see this a lot with the newer social apps coming out , " says Koomen .
Certainly we can point to several such examples , including Twitter 's scalability problems , but the need is similar for any cloud - based enterprise application .
Business developers , too , need to worry about getting the right infrastructure in place and making it secure and scalable .
Google App Engine , says Koomen , fixes these problems .
The application developer can focus on the application , because the App Engine takes care of the infrastructure .
To quote Web technologist Niall Kennedy 's blog post last April explaining the then just - announced runtime environment : " Google App Engine lets any Python developer execute CGI - driven Web applications , store its results and serve static content from a fault - tolerant geo - distributed computing grid built exclusively for modern Web applications . "
Sounds cool .
So what 's the problem ?
Data Lock - In — or Nervous Nellie ?
The Google App Engine uses a data store that is ... different .
It 's not precisely SQL , says Koomen , because the data store is built to run across multiple servers .
While most developers who are familiar with SQL databases ( from Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL ) wo n't have a problem using the data store , some things are n't technically possible .
" These restrictions are n't as terrible as you 'd think , " adds Koomen .
Using Google App Engine today also requires Python , which might present a problem to developers who are more familiar with other languages — whether dynamic languages like PHP and Perl , or traditional languages like Java or C# .
( Personally , I do n't think Python is a significant turn - off to most Web developers , but programming language preferences are passionate . )
The bigger question — a real one from a developer friend , which is what inspired me to call Google — is whether that data store creates a lock - in , preventing data - based applications from being portable .
Start - ups might worry whether their companies are less attractive to investors if they 've tied themselves to a single vendor 's data store .
Enterprise computing professionals would worry that , on top of their concerns about any corporate data living in the cloud , they'd have information they could not easily retrieve or would have trouble migrating to another database .
Or , probably more important over the long term , they might worry whether database interactions involving Google App Engine would require fancy custom programming to interoperate with in - house applications , Web services components , a service - oriented architecture or other situations in which the leg bone data must connect to the thigh bone data .
In its current " preview " state , the Google App Engine requires that data be stored and retrieved using a Python API called GQL , which Koomen says is as similar as possible to SQL .
You can get data out of your data store only programmatically , not by copying a SQL file from one server to another .
However , Koomen says Google sees this limitation , and the company has actively been soliciting input on how best to address it .
In fact , that 's one of the reasons Google makes preview versions available , says Koomen .
" We wanted to get it out early and see what developers thought . "
As a result , Koomen says , Google will be releasing a tool that makes it easy to get data out of the data store without writing code .
They are n't ready to go into specifics , other than it 'll be available " within the next two quarters , " but Koomen said the intent is to make it easy to get data out of App Engine .
The new tool promises to address the data portability issue , to provide a " home brew backup " and to be " completely open , " according to Koomen .
This is n't the first time user input has affected the development of Google App Engine .
For example , for security reasons they had to remove the Python image library from Google App Engine .
( Google App Engine supports 100 % of the Python language , Koomen says , and 90 % of the Python libraries . )
However , developers made it clear that they needed to manipulate images in the data store , such as to scale or rotate images or to create thumbnails .
" So that ability is in there , now , " says Koomen .
In the short term , developers who use App Engine do n't have their data locked in .
Getting data out of the App Engine data store may be awkward , or at least you should build " Darnit , I have to write that from scratch " time into the project schedule , but these limitations are temporary .
That 's worth knowing , certainly , because every developer adopting a new - to - her technology wants to know where the bodies are buried and where her assumptions are incorrect .
Within six months , however , the data lock - in concerns — and the need to write a hack — in Google App Engine should go away .
" We still have some ways to go , " says Koomen .

A small square of dark chocolate daily protects the heart from inflammation and subsequent heart disease , a new study of Italians suggests .
Milk chocolate might not do the job .
However , this guilty pleasure has a limit .
Specifically , only 6.7 grams of chocolate per day ( or 0.23 ounces ) represents the ideal amount , according to results from the Moli-sani Project , one of the largest health studies ever conducted in Europe .
For comparison , a standard - sized Hershey 's Kiss is about 4.5 grams ( though the classic Kiss is not made of dark chocolate ) and one Hershey 's dark chocolate bar is about 41 grams ( so a recommendation might be one of those weekly ) .
Chronic inflammation of tissues in the circulatory system is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , such as myocardial infarction or stroke .
So doctors strive to keep patients ' inflammation under control .
One marker for inflammation in the blood is called C- reactive protein .
The researchers found a relationship between dark chocolate intake and levels of this protein in the blood of 4,849 subjects in good health and free of risk factors ( such as high cholesterol or blood pressure , and other parameters ) .
The findings are detailed in the latest issue of the Journal of Nutrition .
" We started from the hypothesis that high amounts of antioxidants contained in the cocoa seeds , in particular flavonoids and other kinds of polyphenols , might have beneficial effects on the inflammatory state , " said Romina di Giuseppe , lead author of the study .
" Our results have been absolutely encouraging : People having moderate amounts of dark chocolate regularly have significantly lower levels of C - reactive protein in their blood .
In other words , their inflammatory state is considerably reduced . "
The inflammation reduction that the researchers observed controlled for other confounding variables such as wine or produce intake .
Previous studies have found that chocolate might be good for you , though doctors usually warn that it is more important to focus on one 's overall diet when it comes to health .
One health study found that blood platelets among chocolate - lovers were less likely to clot together in dangerous clumps .
Other studies have found a host of diet and exercise changes that can help a person beat the odds of death .
Clearly , no single change is a guarantee of long life .
With chocolate , moderation is key , the new study found .
" The best effect is obtained by consuming an average amount of 6.7 grams of chocolate per day , corresponding to a small square of chocolate twice or three times a week .
Beyond these amounts the beneficial effect tends to disappear , " di Giuseppe said .
The milk in milk chocolate interferes with polyphenols , so the team kept that out of the study .
" We consider this outcome as the beginning of a large series of data which will give us an innovative view on how [ to achieve ] prevention in everyday life , both against cardiovascular disease and tumors , " said Licia Iacoviello , head of the Laboratory of Genetic and Environmental Epidemiology at the Catholic University of Campobasso and responsible for the Moli-sani Project .
The Moli-sani Project is funded by the Pfizer Foundation .

Barack Obama has always said that he will not wait until the Democratic National Convention to name his Vice Presidential nominee .
His camp has consistently intoned that a VP candidate will be clearly presented to the American people before the convention occurs to serve as a signal of the kind of presidency and administration he will have .
With the Democratic National Convention only two weeks away , the time to make the announcement of a VP candidate is burning rapidly down the candle ’s wick .
Coincidentally — and thankfully — the media ’s attention has slowly turned away from pointless , filler issues like John McCain ’s nonsense “ celebrity ” ads and John Edwards ’ two - year - old affair to focus on the convention in Denver , and on who the VP candidate might be .
Earlier this morning , Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius , Obama ’s appointed “ overseer ” of all things convention , held a press conference to announce the schedule of events for Wednesday of convention week .
Sebelius said , “ Wednesday night is thematically about securing America ’s future , it is about honoring our veterans and the families of our veterans … and how to make us safer and move past the divisiveness and into the future . ”
Advertisements
Then , the more intriguing and buzz - creating shoe fell .
Sebelius also announced that the Vice Presidential nominee will give his / her speech to the convention on Wednesday night .
These two items , stated back to back , has generated a lot of speculation that Obama ’s VP choice will be someone with a lot of national security experience , someone who can speak with authority on issues of foreign and veteran affairs .
When pushed further by reporters , Sebelius back peddled a bit by adding , “ I think anyone Sen . Obama picks as Vice President will be more than prepared to address those issues . ”
I think Sebelius may have accidentally let the cat out of the bag .
Is it possible that the eventual VP pick has nothing directly to do with national security and veterans affairs ?
It is possible .
And if Obama selects either Virginia Governor Tim Kaine , or Sebelius herself , then certainly this has all been futile guesswork .
However , the fact that Obama ’s campaign seems tightly run signals that the convention will also be meticulously planned , particularly with a keen eye for timing and symbolism .
Obama ’s campaign has demonstrated these two qualities time and again .
Their sense of timing is impeccable .
They trotted out Bill Richardson and John Edwards ’ endorsements at just the right time to stunt any Clinton momentum during the primaries .
Not to be outdone by their grasp of timing , the Obama campaign ’s flair for symbolic manifestations is also to be applauded .
Night after night during the primary fight , Obama gave speeches that sounded presidential , and not just a standard thank you speech .
Let ’s not forget his recent trip to Europe and the Middle East where he made himself look extremely presidential on the global stage .
And this past weekend , Hillary Clinton was given a prime time speaking spot on Tuesday night of the convention .
Symbolically , this was significant not only because it gestures a peace treaty between the two , but also because Tuesday is the 88th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment which finally recognized women ’s right to vote .
To give the historically significant Tuesday - night spot to Clinton speaks volumes .
With this precedence , giving the Wednesday night speaking slot on national security and foreign affairs to the VP is equally significant .
And foretelling .
This move would seem to indicate that Kaine and Sebelius are no longer in contention .
This move , if being read correctly , would also portend a sudden ( or planned “ sudden ” ) and surprise shift towards a new VP direction .
If the symbolic significance of Wednesday night is indeed true , then this brings a whole new crop of potential VP candidates to the table .
In this case , Joe Biden could move to the front of the line again .
Former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn could experience a resurgence .
Also , names like Wesley Clark and John Kerry are placed back on the table .
Should Obama choose to go with an established , national name with some military / security background , I would be pleased .
For all the talk of hope and change ( which is definitely good ) , Obama seems to realize that there are , unfortunately , real , actual troubles staring us in the face .
Like it or not , the nation is at war , and someone with a military background would not only be a good , calculated political move , but would in fact be a solid , practical move .
Time will tell .
And time , is running short .
While Washington Post columnist Chris Cillizza has positioned Bayh at the top of the heap for a few weeks now , after getting tips to Bilerico - Indiana and making some logical conclusions the choice is obvious .
Why ?
I 'm going to put my neck out on the line by making a prediction .
Barack Obama will announce his vice - presidential choice Wednesday morning .
It will be Indiana Senator Evan Bayh .
Here 's my reasoning :
The Olympics start on Friday and run until the Democratic convention starts .
He wo n't want to compete with the Olympics for press coverage .
He 'll announce before the Olympics starts .
If he announces on Wednesday morning , he 'll get coverage all day and be on the news cycle until the Opening Ceremonies knock him off the top spot .
Barack Obama is coming to the state on Tuesday afternoon for a campaign stop in Elkhart , Indiana .
He 'll be attending with Evan Bayh .
The press has been told to plan on staying until Wednesday afternoon / evening .
Why would he spend so much time in Indiana with nothing on his public calendar ?
Staying around Indiana allows Obama and Bayh to travel to Illinois , Michigan , and Ohio - all important states in this election .
When you 've just announced your VP , those are states you 'll want to visit - especially since Bayh 's reputation will help the most in those states .
The website ObamaBayh08.com is taken .
For a tiny sliver of time late last week , you could type in the URL and you'd be forwarded to another site .
Where do you think it took you ?
The Democratic Party website .
( screencap from WHOIS below )
I just got an invite from the Obama campaign to attend an appearance on Wednesday that is n't on Obama 's official calendar .
Why not ?
The campaign said , " I can't tell you what the event is about , but we want to make sure you have a ticket so you can cover it for the Bilerico Project .
We want Bilerico Project to be there for this one . "

So what do you think ?
Is my thinking flawed or have I reached the logical conclusion ?
By the time you add in the case for Evan Bayh - foreign policy experience , former Clinton supporter , popularity in the Midwest , not a media whore , experience as a popular former Governor and his youth and good looks - it seems like a slam dunk to me .
12:20 pm Update : While a highly placed Indiana Democrat who requested anonymity has confirmed that my theory is correct , numerous Democrats I 've spoken to coming out of this weekend 's IDEA convention stated that they were given the indication that no decision would be made this week .
1:40 pm Update : Brian Howey has a solid commentary on the Howey Political Report that I wanted to point out .
Brian waffles between an announcement this week or the week leading up to the convention .
Two other journalists have chimed in to say they 've been told to expect the announcement in that last week as well .
Am I off on my timing and this is just another test balloon ?
From Howey 's story :
Bayh will be there to introduce Obama , his spokesman Eric Kleiman confirmed for Howey Politics Indiana this morning .
What we do n't know is the time .
The Obama campaign said doors will open at 7:15 a.m. , but there is no starting time established .
If it 's before 10 a.m , , it 's highly unlikely this would be a veep rollout .
Anything after 10 a.m. would allow West Coast viewers to watch on the Today Show , Good Morning America or Morning Joe .
Most vice presidential rollouts tend to come in the afternoon ( i.e. George H.W. Bush announced Dan Quayle 's selection at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday during the Republican National Convention in 1988 ) .
We know there is a long press flight layover in South Bend , with the Obama media arriving at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday and not leaving until 3:25 p.m. Wednesday .
It seems like a long layover , but an explanation could be that Obama will be at his Chicago home for the night .
Democratic media consultant Chris Sautter was at Obama 's Chicago headquarters and spent time with David Axelrod last weekend .
"
He seemed to me more a like a guy who was going to finally get some rest over the weekend rather than someone gearing up for a major rollout the next week , " said Sautter .
" I could be completely wrong , but everyone seemed a little loose for a VP announcement .
Larry Grisolano told me he was going away for the weekend .
On the other hand , David perked up when I told him that Indiana had the highest jump in unemployment in the month of June .
So anything is possible , I guess . "
...
Finally , the event will be held in the Concord HS basketball gym .
Veepstakes usually are n't rolled out in a basketball gym .
To which we respond : yes , but this is Indiana .
Aug 6 Update : Well , so much for predictions .
It 's time for me to eat a healthy serving of crow .
A blog dedicated to GNU / Linux , technical news and other tech oriented topics .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin may attract disaffected Hillary Rodham Clinton voters while still playing well with the GOP 's religious base .
The ticket : McCain- Palin
DAYTON , OHIO , — In one of the most shocking vice - presidential selections in political history , John McCain has tapped Sarah Palin , the 44 - year - old first - term governor of Alaska , to be his running mate .
Praising her “ strong principles , fighting spirit and deep compassion , ” McCain told a noontime rally here that Palin — who only two years ago was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska — could help him take on the political status quo in Washington .

“ She 's exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old Washington politics of me first and country second , ” McCain , 72 today , proclaimed to about 15,000 flag - waving onlookers who crowded into a college basketball arena here to see the surprise pick in person .
Palin , wearing a blue suit with an American flag pin and a Blue Star broach indicating a child in the military , accepted McCain ’s offer with her husband , Todd , and four of her five children looking on .
Noting that the day fell almost 88 years to the day after American women gained the right to vote , Palin , becoming the first female Republican to run for vice president , won loud cheers from what was McCain ’s largest rally yet by highlighting her gender .
Although Palin mentioned neither Barack Obama nor Joe Biden , she paid homage to Geraldine Ferraro , as well as to Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ It was rightly noted in Denver this week that Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest , hardest glass ceiling in America , ” Palin said .
“ But it turns out the women of America are n't finished yet , and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all . ”
Palin began to tell the crowd and the stunned political class watching on TV about her unlikely rise from small - town Alaska to the national stage , with flourishes that could never be made up .
First , she noted that today happens to be her 20th wedding anniversary .
“ I had promised Todd a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that I did deliver , ’ she quipped to laughs and applause .
Her husband and high school sweetheart , she said , is a lifelong commercial fisherman who works in the oil fields on Alaska ’s North Slope and is a member of the US Steel Workers in addition to a world champion snowmobile rider .
A mother of five , Palin pointed out that their oldest could n’t be present .
“ On September 11th of last year , our son enlisted in the United States Army , ” she shared , sparking a deafening ovation and chants of “ USA . ”
“ He now serves in an infantry brigade , and September 11th , he will deploy to Iraq in the service of his country . ”
In selecting Palin , McCain counters the historic nature of Barack Obama ’s candidacy .
She ’s young — three years younger than Obama — and she ’s a woman , the first to land a spot on a major - party ticket since Walter Mondale picked Ferraro 24 years ago .
Disheartened Clinton supporters who were thinking about crossing over to vote for McCain may now have one more reason to do so .
Voters on the right will like Palin ’s conservative credentials :
She ’s opposed to both abortion rights and gay marriage , supports increased domestic drilling for oil , is a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association and has a son in the U.S. Army .
But voters worried about Obama ’s relative lack of experience — a central theme of both the Clinton and McCain campaigns — will have new cause for concern about the Republican alternative .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton seized immediately on the experience issue , saying McCain has put " the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency . "
Jim Jordan , a veteran Democratic strategist , told Politico , " After his attacks on Obama 's readiness for the job , it 'll be amusing to hear a 71 - year - old with a history of health problems justify this decision . "
A Democratic operative unaffiliated with the Obama campaign dismissed Palin as " Geraldine Quayle . "
A former high school basketball star and beauty queen , Palin has limited experience in elected office :
She served for four years as a member of the Wasilla City Council and four more years as the mayor of Wasilla , and she has n’t yet completed her second full year as governor of Alaska .
Joe Biden , by contrast , has spent more than three decades in the U.S. Senate .
He may be a formidable opponent in their Oct. 2 vice presidential debate in St. Louis ; on the other hand , his aggressive approach may not play as well against a young woman — even one who grew up hunting and fishing in Alaska — as it would have against someone such as Mitt Romney .
In choosing an outsider like Palin , McCain has bolstered his case that he — not Obama — is the real agent of change .
Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Dennis Moore of Kansas , at the Denver airport when they heard rumors that McCain would choose Palin , admitted that they did n’t even know how to pronounce Palin ’s name .
But in her short political career , Palin has become known — at least in Alaska — as a reformer .
Long before the ethical problems of the Alaska GOP were front - page news in Washington , she was working to clean up the state ’s government and her own party .
Slideshow Reflections on Sarah Palin
As a member of Alaska ’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , Palin pushed an investigation that ultimately led the state ’s GOP party chairman to resign from the commission .
Earlier this month , she endorsed Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell , who is still waiting to hear whether he has defeated ethically challenged Rep.
Don Young in the House race 's GOP primary on Tuesday .
Last September , she called on Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens to give a fuller accounting of his relationship with the oil - field services company Veco .
But in the wake of Stevens ’ indictment in July , Palin declined to call immediately for his resignation , saying it would be “ premature ” to do so until she learned more about the case against him .
Palin herself has been the subject of a probe involving the firing of her former brother in law , a state trooper who was fighting over child custody with Palin ’s sister .
According to the Anchorage Daily News , Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan has said he felt pressure from the governor ’s office to fire the trooper .
A Palin aide reportedly raised the governor ’s concerns about the trooper in a phone call with Monegan ; Palin has put the aide on leave pending a legislative investigation .
" Now we can talk about Ted Stevens and Don Young and Republican corruption every day , " said a Democratic strategist .
" That 's great for us . "
Asked earlier this month whether the investigation would have any effect on her chances of becoming McCain ’s running mate , Palin told MSNBC ’s Larry Kudlow : “ Well , it should n’t disqualify me from anything , including progressing the state ’s agenda here towards more energy production so we can contribute more to the U.S.
Nor should it dissuade any kind of agenda progress in any arena because , again , I have n’t done anything wrong .
And through an investigation of our lawmakers who are kind of looking at me as a target , we invite those questions so that we can truthfully answer the questions . ”
In a blog post on the National Review ’s web site this morning , Kudlow said he’d be “ thrilled ” if Palin were the pick .
“ She ’s a strong pro-life , supply - side , drill - drill - drill ethics reformer who has worked hard to change the Ted Stevens culture - of - corruption problem in Alaska , ” he said .
“ A cheap - shot Democratic legislative investigation of Palin appeared to slow her momentum down a few weeks ago .
But John McCain would electrify everyone if this choice pans out . ”
Stevens ' former chief of staff Mitch Rose called McCain 's selection of Palin " a fantastic choice . "
" She 's down to earth , a hunter and fisherman , really connects well with the people of Alaska , " Rose said .
Rose noted that Palin 's approval ratings in Alaska are " sky high , " over 80 percent in some polls .
" She 's really kind of the new face of the party , " Rose added .
Known as “ Sarah Barracuda ” when she played on her high school ’s state championship team , Palin competed in the Miss Alaska contest before graduating from the University of Idaho .
She worked for her husband ’s fishing business and , sometimes , as a TV sports reporter , then entered politics by winning a seat on the Wasilla City Council in 1992 .
She went on to become the city ’s mayor , then sought the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in 2002 .
She lost , but Gov. Frank Murkowski appointed her to the Oil and Conservation Commission .
By 2005 , Murkowski was in ethical trouble , and Palin decided to make a run for the governor ’s office .
She won , beating former Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles 48 percent to 41 percent .
As governor , she has pushed hard for a natural gas pipeline in Alaska — work that will fit well within the GOP ’s focus on energy issues .
As rumors swirled about McCain ’s pick this morning , Nick Ayers , executive director of the Republican Governors Association , pointed to Palin ’s experience in energy policy and her strong pro-life views in saying that she would be a “ very popular ” pick among Republican governors .
As the Anchorage Daily News reported , at the time , Palin sent an e-mail to friends and family in which she said : “ ... Trig will be a joy .
You will have to trust me on this . "
The paper said Palin wrote the e-mail in the voice of God and signed it , “ Trig ’s Creator : Your Heavenly Father . ”
Palin ’s husband , Todd , took a leave from his job as a production operator at BP - run facility after she was elected governor .
He is one - quarter Yu'pik Eskimo .
In an interview with The Associated Press last May , he said that he and the then - Sarah Heath eloped in 1988 because they could n’t afford a wedding .
" We had a bad fishing year that year , so we did n't have any money , " he said .
" So we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse . "

So you wanna know how the world will end ?
Fire ?
Ice ?
Fire and ice ?
I wo n't reveal any secrets , but I do have permission from the publisher to post an excerpt from the introduction to Death from the Skies !
Enjoy .
Death from the Skies !
Philip Plait , PhD Viking Press , 2008 Introduction ( excerpt ) The Universe is trying to kill you .
It ’s nothing personal .
It ’s trying to kill me too .
It ’s trying to kill everybody .
And it does n’t even have to try very hard .
The Universe is an incredibly hostile place for life .
Virtually all of it is a vacuum , so that ’s bad right from the start .
Of the extremely few places that are n’t hard vacuum , most are too hot for chemical reactions to do very well – molecules get blasted apart before they can even properly form .
Of the places that are n’t too hot , most are too cold – reactions happen too slowly to get interesting things to occur in the first place .
And of the very few places that are n’t in vacuum , too hot , or too cold – and we only really know of one : Earth – there are all manners of dangers lurking about .
Volcanoes blast megatons of noxious chemicals into the air , spew lava for miles , and cause vast earthquakes .
Tsunamis rewrite huge sections of coastlines .
Ice ages come and go , mountains pop up and change the global weather system , whole continents get subducted into the glowing rock of the mantle .
And those are just the local problems .
Earth still sits in the incredibly hostile environment of space , and all kinds of disasters might befall us from there – literally .
But then , that ’s what this whole book is about .
The Universe is a violent place .
Stars explode .
Stars like the Sun can die in milder events , but die just the same .
Whole galaxies collide , igniting fireworks on a cosmic scale .
Asteroids impact other planets ; could they hit us ?
When we launched telescopes into space , we equipped them with cameras that could detect ultraviolet light , X - rays , super high - energy gamma rays .
We saw a Universe that seemed actively trying to destroy us .
Exploding stars are phenomenally dangerous , blasting out vast amounts of killing force and energy .
Black holes are everywhere , lurking throughout the galaxy , devouring anything that wanders too close .
Flashes of high - energy light from distant points in the Universe whisper of powers terrible and gross , enough to fry entire solar systems that get in the way .
The Earth seemed to be the center of the Universe for much of mankind ’s history .
Now , however , the Earth seems fragile and impossibly small , a remote speck of dust lost in a Universe of frightening size and age .
In reality , the Universe cares not at all if we live or die .
If a human were magically transported to any random spot in the cosmos , within seconds we ’d die 99.999999999999999 % of the time .
At best .
Yet , despite all that ( and quite a bit more still unsaid ) , here we are .
Billions of years in , countless times around the Sun , sitting at the crosshairs of dozens of cosmic weapons … our planet endures .
Life not only survives , it thrives .
Numerous setbacks have occurred , for sure , but life itself continues on .
As small and fragile and soft as humans are , we ’ve managed so far .
Of course , we have n’t yet seen everything the Universe can unleash on us .
A single asteroid impact could take out half of humanity without even breaking a sweat .
A solar flare could wipe out our economy in seconds .
And a nearby gamma- ray burst … well , that ’s bad too .
Very bad .
I love astronomy .
I ’ve devoted my entire life to it , to telling others about it , to writing about it .
Astronomy is awe inspiring , it ’s beautiful , it provides philosophical perspective and holds the secret answers to so many of our most profound questions .
And I have no doubt whatsoever that astronomical events can kill us .
In some cases , our study of astronomy can actually save us .
In other cases it provides us with information about what might kill us , though unfortunately without giving us any ideas of how to stop it .
And in many of those cases , there is n’t much we could do anyway .
In this book , I wo n’t hold back .
The reality of a nearby gamma-ray burst puts the sweatiest fundamentalist religion ’s Armageddon prose to shame , dwarfing it to mundanity .
I will go over , in loving detail , the Earth ’s atmosphere ripped away , the oceans boiled , and all life sterilized down to the base of the crust .
But during all that , I will remind you that there is no star nearby capable of creating such a burst ; and even if there were , the odds of it going off any time soon are tiny ; and even if it did , the odds of it being aimed our way are tinier yet .
But it ’s still fun to think about “ What if … ? ”
While you ’re reading this book , you may feel like you ’re watching a horror movie at the theater : it ’s fun , jolting , and maybe even terrifying .
During the scary parts you may want to turn away , or hide your eyes , or spill your popcorn , but I ’ll make sure the actual facts of the case are there to calm you down a bit after .
Of course ( he says , chuckling low and with evil intent ) , there is a big difference : eventually the movie is over , you leave the theater , and laugh at the scary ride .
You ca n’t do that in the real world .
There are dangers out there , and we ca n’t avert our eyes from them .
But as you read this book ( hopefully with your eyes open ) you ’ll learn just what the dangers are , and more importantly what they are n’t .
What horror movie is still scary once the lights are on ?
And you always have to keep in mind that we ’re still here .
The Universe is a dangerous place , but again , we ’ve gotten this far .
We may just make it a while longer .
Or we may not .
I have to be honest .
The Universe is vast beyond imagining , and wields mighty forces .
For nearly all the events depicted here , it ’s not a matter of if , it ’s a matter of when .

And really the unsayable .
But I 've been thinking about this McCain - Palin Obama " palling around with terrorist " idea more lately .
The saddest thing about many Republicans is n't just that they disagree with liberals on race -- it 's they are largely ignorant on race .
When the McCain campaign cast the spell of diabolical jingoism , they have no idea of the forces they are toying with .
We remember Martin Luther King 's murder as a sad and tragic event .
Less remembered is the fact that ground - work for King 's murder was seeded , not simply by rank white supremacy , but by people who slandered King as a communist .
This was not some notion bandied about by conspiracy theorist , but an accusation proffered by men who were the pillars of the modern Republican Party :
As late as 1964 , Falwell was attacking the 1964 Civil Rights Act as " civil wrongs " legislation .
He questioned " the sincerity and intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , James Farmer , and others , who are known to have left - wing associations . "
Falwell charged , " It is very obvious that the Communists , as they do in all parts of the world , are taking advantage of a tense situation in our land , and are exploiting every incident to bring about violence and bloodshed . "
Falwell was not alone .
These men did n't kill Martin Luther King , but they contributed to an atmosphere of nationalism , white supremacy and cheap unreflective patriotism that ultimately got a lot of people killed .
Confronted with Aparthied South Africa , men like Helms and Falwell used the same " communist " defense .
While Mandella wasted away in prison , they dismissed the whole thing as a communist plot .
Yes , nothing quite says “ I feel your pain ” like a $ 5,000 make - up artist at your beck and call the same day you declare that you ’ve stopped campaigning to show that you “ get ” the economic crisis .
Tell me the woman on the right , making up John McCain today for his Katie Couric interview , is n’t the same woman who previously made John McCain up to the left , the $ 5,000 American Idol make - up artist McCain has previously hired .
Here ’s another photo of her making McCain up today before the Couric interview .
Minnesota CEO
Todd Bachman Murdered in Beijing ( Photos )
The Chairman and CEO of Minneapolis based flower empire Bachman 's Inc. , , was murdered in Beijing , China on Saturday , August 9 , 2008 .
His wife Barbara Bachman was injured along with their female tour guide .
Their daughterwas on the 2004 U.S. Women 's Volleyball team and is married to , the head coach of the 2008 U.S. Men 's Volleyball team .
The couple , both 62 , were sightseeing some five miles from the Olympic Stadium when the attack occurred .
They were on the second floor of the 14th Century Drum Tower when a knife wielding assailant attacked the trio .
The perpetrator was identified as 47 year old Tang Yongming , who reportedly flung himself over the second floor railing and plunged 130 feet to his death .
Daughter Elisabeth Wiz Bachman was with her parents at the time of the attack but was not injured .
U.S. Ambassador Clark T. Randt paid a visit to Peking Union Medical College Hospital to speak with family members who have been at the bedside of the critically injured Barbara Bachman .
Randt was sent to convey condolences from President George W. Bush and his wife Barbara , who are in Beijing .
Bachman's Inc. held a press conference today at 4:00 p.m. CST at company headquarters in Minneapolis .
They reported that Barbara Bachman underwent an operation and remains in critical condition with life threatening injuries that were suffered earlier in the day .
Daughter Elisabeth Wiz Bachman and her husband have been at her mother 's bedside .
Two other daughters are on their way to Beijing to be with their sister and mother .
Hugh McCutcheon stayed by his wife 's side rather than attend the U.S. Men 's Indoor Volleyball match .
Assistant coach Ron Larson took over the coaching duties on Saturday .
They won a tight first round match by edging Venezuela 3 - 2 .
The business was founded by German immigrant Henry Bachman Sr. in 1885 and is now led by 4th and 5th generation family members .
The company operates 29 retail stores and employs 1,600 people during peak season .

Contrary to popular belief , not all car scribes had dads who raced Porsches .
A good many of us waited much longer than we ’d care to admit to be exposed to the cool cars of the world .
We ’ve done more than our fair share of time behind the wheels of beat - up New Yorkers and hand - me - down family haulers .
So we know how it feels when you ’re choking on your own fumes at a stoplight and along comes something rowdy : maybe a Mustang or a WRX , paint gleaming , motor rumbling , driver grinning .
The light turns green , and you know the rest .
But would n’t it be funny if you could actually keep up ?
Imagine the surprise on that sports car driver ’s face when what seemed like an ordinary vehicle produced an extraordinary run .
Oh , savory indeed is that brand of automotive irony .
And this sort of irony is the thrust behind this article , in which we have paired one traditionally hot car with one whose driver has a little secret — the kind that ’ll have the other driver shaking his head ( and maybe his middle finger ) in disbelief when they meet again at the next light .
All performance statistics quoted in the following pages were recorded by Car and Driver test gear .

Toyota Camry V - 6 vs. Subaru Impreza WRX
There are many reasons we love Subarus , and the WRX is one of them .
An unassuming Impreza on the outside , but a turbocharged , 224 - hp rocket on the inside , it is more than a little bit ironic all by itself .
Indeed , with a 0 - to - 60 time of 5.8 seconds , it has that sneaky sort of quickness that catches muscle car drivers unaware in impromptu stoplight wars .
But it ’s going to be the WRX driver who ’ll be surprised when the driver of an even less assuming , nearly full - size Toyota Camry V - 6 runs nose to nose with the much smaller WRX through 60 mph and all the way to the quarter - mile mark .
Add in the fact that the Camry V - 6 is available with many top - dollar features not available on the WRX , has far more upscale size and interior design , and has a base price that ’s nearly $ 1000 less , and the Camry is a whopper of a stealth - speed bargain .
Toyota Camry V - 6 -- Subaru Impreza WRX
0 –60 : 5.8 seconds -- 0 –60 : 5.8 seconds
1/4 : 14.3 @ 93 mph -- 1/4 : 14.4 @ 95 mph

Cadillac Escalade vs. Mini Cooper S
We ’ve constantly celebrated the spastic Mini Cooper S for offering big performance surprises in a small , efficient package .
But an even bigger surprise comes in one of the biggest packages around : the behemoth Cadillac Escalade .
Yes , as speedy as the 2700 - pound Cooper S is , the 5700 - pound Escalade is just as quick , trailing Mini ’s diminutive demon by only 0.1 second to 60 mph but beating the Cooper S by 0.2 second to the quarter - mile mark .
Indeed , for a big gal , this Caddy can boogie .
Of course , both get their grunt from powerplants that are as antithetical as the wrappers they arrive in .
The Cooper S ’s high - tech , 1.6 - liter engine uses a turbocharger to put a “ bang ” in “ four - banger , ” whereas the Escalade employs a brutal , old - school 403 - hp , 6.2 - liter V - 8 that sucks down more than twice the fuel .
Furthermore , if anything remotely resembling a curve turns up in the middle of that quarter - mile run , David will eat Goliath for lunch .
Still , we think even the concept of drag - racing a Cooper S against an Escalade is downright cartoonish fun .
Disagree ?
Check out the video .
Cadillac Escalade -- Mini Cooper S
0 –60 : 6.3 seconds -- 0 –60 : 6.2 seconds

Infiniti FX50 vs. Ford Mustang Bullitt
Infiniti claims that the idea behind the original Infiniti FX was the concept of a “ bionic cheetah . ”
The result was a seriously muscular SUV that , if you squinted , looked vaguely cheetah - like but was undeniably bionic in its ability to go fast .
The brand - new , second - generation FX is even more muscular , particularly in FX50 form , and now it can keep pace with one of the most iconic versions of the most iconic pony car around , the 315 - hp Ford Mustang Bullitt .
Yep , even though the FX50 is a 4600 - pound five - seater that can haul a small family to a ballet recital , its 5.0 - liter V - 8 pumps out 390 horsepower and 369 pound - feet of torque , thus bestowing it with acceleration that ’s truly cheetah - like .
The FX50 can match the Stang ’s five - flat 0 - to - 60 hustle and 13.6 - second quarter - mile .
Furthermore , it can track true and flat in corners , so do n’t think McQueen ’s Mustang will lose it when the road gets twisty .
In fact , add water , and watch the family trickster pull far and fast away from the Ford .
Sorry , Steve — you ’ve been served .
Infiniti FX50 -- Ford Mustang Bullitt
0 –60 : 5.0 seconds -- 0 –60 : 5.0 seconds

Toyota Tundra vs. BMW 328i
Talk about two vehicles on opposite ends of the spectrum : the sporty , sassy , prudently packaged , and perennial 10 Best Cars–winning BMW 328i and the oversized , overwrought , utilitarian ladder - framed workhorse Toyota Tundra .
You know which you ’d want to drive in a drag race , right ?
Think again , city slicker .
If dem country boys were smart enough to order ’ emselves a 381 - hp , 5.7 - liter V - 8 turnin ’ their Tundra ’s rear wheels , that big-ass Tonka - yota will keep pace with the Bimmer all the way through the quarter - mile , which it hits in fewer than 15 seconds and at which point the 328i is finally starting to pull away .
And although aerodynamics ensure that the Bimmer driver will ultimately win this race , it wo n’t have been by enough of a margin for him to outrun the humbling reality that a Texas - size truck stayed with him for a shockingly long time .
Maybe he should step up to the 300 - hp 335 i before he starts pickin’ on pickups again .
Toyota Tundra -- BMW 328i
0 –60 : 6.1 seconds -- 0 –60 : 6.1 seconds
1/4 : 14.9 @ 94 mph -- 1/4 : 14.8 @ 95 mph

Mercedes - Benz E63 AMG Wagon vs. Audi R8
Few sports cars at any price have garnered as much attention and accolade as the sexy , saucy , and very fast Audi R8 .
So imagine one being outgunned by a housewife in , of all things , a station wagon .
That ’s exactly what could happen with this über - fast and über - rare überwagen , the Mercedes - Benz E63 AMG .
Picture it :
You ’re at the wheel of your brand - new R8 .
A black Benz E - class pulls up , and the driver puts down her phone long enough to toss you a sideways glance over her latte followed by a nod to the horizon .
Surely , she jests .
An E - class against an R8 ?
This should be easy , you think .
As the light turns green , you notice the “ 6.3 ” badge on the fender and hear wheelspin .
Uh-oh .
You get on it with all four wheels gripping .
Your ears are pinned back as you blast to 60 in four seconds flat , neck and neck with the Benz .
You hit 100 mph , and what ’s this ?
She ’s pulling away !
Then you start to get a view of the sheetmetal aft of the B - pillar :
She ’s in a station wagon !
A quarter - mile later , she ’s still pulling away .
At 130 mph , are those her kids laughing in the rear - facing jump seats ?
Within 23.5 seconds , she ’s at 150 , 1.2 seconds before you .
Mercedes ’ seven - passenger station wagon will outaccelerate the R8 all the way to its 155 - mph governor .
And now the driver is probably back on her pink Razr to tell her BFF all about it .
Mercedes - Benz E63 AMG wagon -- Audi R8
0 –60 : 4.0 seconds -- 0 –60 : 4.0 seconds
1/4 : 12.5 @ 115 mph -- 1/4 : 12.6 @ 113 mph

Obama : So John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 .
You talk about the “ surge , ” the war started in 2003 .
At the time , when the war started , you said it was going to be quick and easy .
You said you knew where the weapons of mass destruction were — and you were wrong .
You said we were going to be greeted as liberators — you were wrong .
You said that there was no history of violence between Shi’a and Sunni , and you were wrong .
… if the question is , who is best equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military , how we make sure we are prepared and ready for the next conflict , then I think we can take a look at our judgment .
Investors are favouring the dollar over the pound
The pound has hit its weakest levels against the dollar in more than two years , extending recent losses on fears about the health of the UK economy .
Sterling dropped as low as $ 1.8405 - its weakest since July 2006 - before recovering to $ 1.8542 by mid-afternoon in Europe .
Sterling has fallen sharply this month .
As recently as mid-July , one pound bought two dollars .
The pound 's losses gathered pace on Friday due to fresh recession fears .
" The growth number confirmed our worst expectations , " said John Hydeskov , senior foreign exchange analyst at Danske bank in Copenhagen .
" We 've seen that the fall in house prices in the UK seems to have no end .
We cannot detect this bottom in house prices that everyone seems to be looking for , " he added .
The euro also fell against the dollar , trading at $ 1.4708 but above a six - month low of $ 1.4630 hit last week .
Deteriorating outlook
The US currency has benefited as the economic outlook has darkened in the UK and Europe .
Investment guru Warren Buffett said on Friday that he had no bets against the dollar - underscoring the currency 's strength .
The fall in sterling could help UK exporters whose goods will be cheaper overseas .
But it will hurt holidaymakers who have benefited from a strong pound when travelling to countries which use the dollar .
I have no idea how they pulled it off , but Microsoft has somehow made it even harder to find files on your computer .
I 'm already wistful for the good old days , when hitting " Search " from windows explorer would pull up an annoying dialog asking a bunch of stupid questions about what you wanted to search for .
The one thing that old dialog had going for it , and I 'm afraid that I never gave it its due credit , is that when you hit the Search button , it would actually , you know ,
Well , that 's all gone with the new & improved Search dialog .
Now , you get a bunch of even stupider questions to look at , but when you hit the Search button it immediately comes up with this :
Roughly translated : " I did n't find anything because I did n't actually look . "
Now , being a reasonably computer - savvy guy , I figured it should be a simple matter of hitting the " Index this folder " button somewhere on that screen .
Uhh ... maybe it's in a dropdown someplace ... in a menu maybe ???
Nope .
It 's nowhere .
To this day , I have no idea where to even look for the tool that might be responsible for indexing that folder .
It just became impossible to search for files anywhere except for my C drive .
So here is my advice for anybody on the Microsoft Search team that might be reading this .
In the case where your clever little index of " Things on this drive " does n't know about the file I 'm searching for , or maybe if your clever little index does n't actuallyanything about the hard drive in the first place , maybe you should fall back to , you know , .
It would make my life a little easier .
As it is , I 'm back to DOS , pulling out commands I have n't used in 15 years .
Thanks Microsoft !
As you know , Sarah Palin ’s been caught straight - up lying about deep - sixing the Bridge to Nowhere .
And here ’s the transcript of her trying to explain the fib to Charlie Gibson …
GIBSON : You have said continually , since he chose you as his vice - presidential nominee , that I said to Congress , thanks but not thanks .
If we ’re going to build that bridge , we ’ll build it ourselves .
PALIN : Right .
GIBSON : But it ’s now pretty clearly documented .
You supported that bridge before you opposed it .
You were wearing a t - shirt in the 2006 campaign , showed your support for the bridge to nowhere .
PALIN : I was wearing a t - shirt with the zip code of the community that was asking for that bridge .
Not all the people in that community even were asking for a $ 400 million or $ 300 million bridge .
GIBSON : But you turned against it after Congress had basically pulled the plug on it ; after it became apparent that the state was going to have to pay for it , not the Congress ; and after it became a national embarrassment to the state of Alaska .
So do you want to revise and extend your remarks .
PALIN : It has always been an embarrassment that abuse of the ear form — earmark process has been accepted in Congress .
And that ’s what John McCain has fought .
And that ’s what I joined him in fighting .
It ’s been an embarrassment , not just Alaska ’s projects .
But McCain gives example after example after example .
I mean , every state has their embarrassment .
GIBSON : But you were for it before you were against it .
You were solidly for it for quite some period of time …
PALIN : I was …
GIBSON : … until Congress pulled the plug .
PALIN : I was for infrastructure being built in the state .
And it ’s not inappropriate for a mayor or for a governor to request and to work with their Congress and their congressmen , their congresswomen , to plug into the federal budget along with every other state a share of the federal budget for infrastructure .
GIBSON : Right .
PALIN : What I supported was the link between a community and its airport .
And we have found that link now .
Children playing with grenades
As a relatively young form of media , video games have been saddled with the impression that they are , for the most part , the information - age equivalent of toys .
Those who are n't gamers tend to view the medium as one solely for children , and as such , they assume that the subject matter covered by games has to fit that particular demographic .
But what happens when a game attempts something more ?
For a long time , games that attempted to tackle controversial topics were put under intense scrutiny , and , more often then not , these games were severely censored .
Blood became sweat , dogs were turned into giant rats , and Hitler himself became Master D. But as the audience has matured , arguably , so has the medium .
Games now span a wide variety of topics and genres , many of which attempt to explore real world issues .
From school shootings to private military companies , games are now engaging many of the same issues as their cousins in literature , film , and music .
In this article , we 'll explore some games that tackle more complex issues , and we 'll find that the results are decidedly mixed
Playing a tragedy
The most controversial games tend to come from within the indie developer community , where you do n't have to worry about funding or even about turning a profit .
Here you can find all manner of subject matter , from a virtual torture simulator , to a game in which players step into the role of a terrorist in an attempt to assassinate the president .
But the most infamous indie game has to be Super Columbine Massacre RPG !.
Created by film student Danny Ledonne and released in 2005 , the game chronicles the last day in the lives of the shooters responsible for the Columbine High School Massacre in 1999 .
The game was not the first project to look at the Columbine tragedy .
Michael Moore 's 2002 documentary " Bowling For Columbine " won numerous awards , while the novel " Hey Nostradamus ! " by Douglas Coupland used the event as inspiration for a fictional school shooting in the suburbs of Vancouver , which served as the catalyst for an exploration of the effects of tragedy spanning decades .
While both of these texts explored the subject matter — garnering their own fair share of controversy along the way — SCMRPG !
featured one aspect that they could n't possibly emulate : interactivity .
The game puts players in the role of the actual killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold as they attempt their spree of violence , and the disturbing part is how well fleshed out the characters become .
Using the boys ' own writings and home videos , the game attempts to faithfully recreate the tragic day with factually correct dialog and timing .
The media tried to play the shooters off as inhuman monsters after the shooting , but the game proves one thing better than anything else : they were human .
" The interactivity of a video game certainly has an effect on the message — perhaps even more so , it is a significant method of delivery for that message , " Ledonne told Ars .
" To passively watch a film about school shootings , for example , allows the viewer a kind of calculated , voyeuristic distance from the acts of violence .
To play a game about school shootings , however , thrusts the player into a position of moral accountability and authorial control .
The effect is as different as watching a drag race from the sidewalk and drag racing . "
Essentially , SCMRPG ! is a psychological examination of Harris and Klebold .
It attempts to put the player into their mindset , exploring how and why they came to do what they did .
The subject matter itself questions what a game is meant to be .
Though people normally play video games for sheer enjoyment , there is none to be found in SCMRPG !
Instead , I found myself actively dreading entering the game world , unwilling to perform the actions necessary to progress .
The game 's presentation contrasts the grim themes it covers .
Developed using RPG Maker 2000 — a game creation program that gives users the ability to create 16 bit style role - playing games — SCMRPG !
bears a strong resemblance to early SNES RPG's like Earthbound or Final Fantasy III .
This minimalist art direction is complemented with pixelated images of the killers themselves , as well as actual photographs from the day in question .
But the question remains , why a video game ?
Why not choose to create a film or write a novel about the subject instead .
" Given that the shooting at Columbine was blamed on popular culture like video games , combined with my own high school experiences in Colorado during and after Columbine , the subject seemed to be a provocative expression of interactive narrative , " Ledonne explained .
" I wanted the game to be a combination of social satire , serious inquiry , and a sort of video game metacriticism . "
What the game did was create a hail storm of controversy , with mainstream and enthusiast news outlets alike both demonizing and praising it .
But despite the heated debates that surrounded it , SCMRPG !
opened up the doors for future mainstream titles to explore similar subject matter .
What could have been crass exploitation became art , and it is still one of the most vibrant looks at our culture from the world of gaming .
( Natural News ) The United Kingdom 's Department of Health has warned that the health condition known as rickets is making a comeback due to more widespread vitamin D deficiency among the British population .
Caused primarily by vitamin D deficiency , rickets is a childhood bone disease that can lead to skeletal deformities , fractures and other serious health problems .
Improved nutrition nearly eliminated the condition from the United Kingdom in the 1950s .
According to the Department of Health , however , as many as one in 100 children of Afro-Caribbean , Asian or Middle Eastern descent in the United Kingdom may now have rickets .
People with darker skin are more susceptible to vitamin D deficiency , because the vitamin is typically synthesized by the body upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight .
But the same melanin that makes skin dark and protects against sunburn also decreases the body 's ability to synthesize vitamin D. People who cover most of their skin for cultural or other reasons are also more susceptible to vitamin D deficiency .
Doctors say that just 15 minutes of sunlight on the arms , shoulders and head every day during the summer should be enough for most people in the United Kingdom .
During the winter , however , people north of the 52nd parallel are not able to synthesize vitamin D due to a lack of the right wavelength of sunlight .
The northernmost point in the continental United States is just past the 49th parallel .
Vitamin D deficiency is a particular concern among pregnant women
" If a pregnant or breastfeeding woman is lacking in vitamin D , the baby will also have low vitamin D and calcium levels , " said pediatrician Colin Michie , " which can lead babies to develop seizures in the first months of life .
" Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said that the Health Department encourages pregnant and breastfeeding women to take vitamin D supplements , which are often provided free by the British government .
Ten years ago today , Konami released the hotly anticipated Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation .
Perhaps equaled only by Gran Turismo and Final Fantasy VII , Metal Gear Solid was the game that sealed the deal for the PlayStation , permanently establishing it as the premiere gaming destination of the generation .
The game not only reintroduced Snake to gamers -- a hero that originally starred in a pair of Metal Gear games on the first Nintendo Entertainment System -- but it also birthed stealth as an entire genre .
Splinter Cell , Winback , and Thief ( although , that game was in development at the same time as MGS ) all followed in Snake 's barely distinguishable footprints .
But it was n't just the stealth gameplay that made Metal Gear such a phenomenon .
In fact , MGS is likely to be better remembered for its narrative , characters , and incredible cinematics .
Metal + Gear + Solid :+ Twin +Snakes+on +the + GameCube .
One of the most intriguing parts of Metal Gear Solid 's history is that it was originally not destined for the PlayStation .
Designer Hideo Kojima , now recognized as one of the industry 's visionaries , plotted Snake 's return on the 3DO .
The inabilities of the 3DO to gain a substantial foothold in the industry lead Kojima to switch development to the PlayStation in 1995 , where it gestated for nearly three years before finally debuting to almost universal acclaim .
Gamers lauded the deep , mature story .
Critics were astounded by the production values -- Metal Gear Solid exists inside a complete , contained universe .
And almost nobody forgets the awesome Psycho Mantis segment .
Just try to convince me that you were n't totally spooked when your controller started moving around on its own .
That was no cheap gimmick .
I still consider it one of the most clever videogame moments I have ever experienced .
Looking back on Metal Gear Solid , it 's easy to catalog its achievements .
More interesting is to go back in time and read then - current reviews of the game .
Without the now - famous legacy to reflect or other entrants in a genre to compare the game to , reviewers were stunned by just how special the game was .
Hit rewind and go back tofrom October 21 , 1998 and tell us if you think Metal Gear Solid deserves all the kudos it 's obtained in the last ten years .
Do you still think it 's revolutionary ?
Or was it overrated ?
Hit the comments or send an email telling us about what you think of MGS ten years later .
I 'll post the best responses !
AbcLinuxu.cz Reimbursed User for MS Windows License from Lenovo ČR
23 . 8 . 2008 | Tisková zpráva | Tiskové zprávy | 40442 ×
Prague 20 .
8 . 2008 – Biggest Czech Linux Portal , AbcLinuxu.cz , Reimbursed User for MS Windows License from Lenovo ČR .
The biggest Czech Linux portal , AbcLinuxu.cz , reimbursed a user for a MS Windows Vista Business OEM license in Lenovo ČR 's stead .
The paid amount is the same the manufacturer offered for returning the license in accordance with the EULA of the Windows Vista Business OEM software that was supplied with the Lenovo laptop .
However , Lenovo ČR required a non-disclosure agreement to be signed that would cover the entire negotiations with the company and its results for the compensation to be effected .
Upon buying his new Lenovo computer , Mr. Kamil Páral decided , in accordance with the EULA of the Windows Vista Business OEM software , to exercise his right to return the license for using the preinstalled operating system from Microsoft because he wanted to use Linux with the computer .
The EULA specifically says :

Thousands of mink were on the loose after vandals broke into a Farmington farm and opened their pens .
This incident comes a month after a similar crime was committed in South Jordan .
The FBI and the Davis County Sheriff 's Office are investigating .
They both say it 's too premature to determine who did this .
Sunday morning , a neighborhood in Farmington was in a frenzy because several mink had crept into residents ' homes and yards .
The reason ?
The mink farm that was broken into is nearby .
Catching mink is an unlikely excuse to leave church service .
Neighbor Mike Dickamor said , " Yeah , not what we planned on doing on a Sunday morning that 's for sure . "
Risa Baker 's bishop announced that mink were running around the area .
So she left church and came home to find one on her porch .
" And so I started to scream , and a neighbor guy came over , and so we 're chasing this mink around the neighborhood , " Baker said .
It caused a lot of excitement , especially for the kids .
Neighbor Andrew Giles said , " The first time I saw the mink coming up my driveway , I 'm like ‘ Wow , an otter . '
I thought it was an otter . "
The neighborhood is right next door to Lodder 's Mink Farm , where thousands of mink were let out of their pens Saturday night .
Ryan Holt , with Fur Commission U.S.A. , said , " They do n't travel very far .
Most of them stay within the confines of the pen or the shed areas where they 're at , more or less looking for a way to get back in their pen because they 're in a foreign environment , and they do n't understand what 's going on . "
Holt said 90 percent of the mink were caught by noon Sunday .
At least a half dozen others were found dead in the road or in nearby water .
Holt said , " They 're not made to be out on their own .
They 're actually in severe trouble when they 're out of their element . "
Holt said some characteristics of the raid match an incident that happened last month in South Jordan .
That raid was supported by the Animal Liberation Front , which believes they 're liberating animals headed for a painful death .
One woman we spoke to agrees with whoever did this .
Jennifer Van said , " They should be in the wild , not in a huge cage and cut up to wear . "
We called the Animal Liberation Front for a comment but no one returned our phone calls .
The Fur Commission U.S.A. is offering a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to conviction in any mink release .

Home - brewed biodiesel may be ready to move from your neighbor 's garage to prime time .
No longer is the practice limited to a few mechanically inclined hippies with old converted electric water heaters .
Now anyone can order up their own bio - brew kit online .
" We are testing some products now to make sure they work at the level of quality our customers expect , " said Go Green Home Stores spokesman Dennis Healy .
" We 're really looking forward to having these products in our store . "
And Go Green 's interest in mass - marketing a processor comes on the heels of a decision earlier this year by Northern Tool , the Sears of professional - grade tools , to put biodiesel processors for home brewers in its catalog , for $ 3,000 to $ 13,500 .
The Collective Biodiesel Project estimates that home brewers , who filter used vegetable oil from restaurants and then mix it with lye and methanol to create their own biodiesel , produced 450 million gallons of fuel last year .
Some brewers say they got tired of waiting for alternatives to petroleum to come from big biz and set out to change their own habits .
In Europe , home - brewed biodiesel from both virgin and waste vegetable oil was so common that in 2002 , police in Great Britain set up a " frying squad " to seek out and ticket chips - scented cars using the cheaper , tax - free cooking oil .
In the United States , a dozen or so niche manufacturers , such as Home Biodiesel Kits , already sell kits to home brewers who want to go beyond converting an old electric water heater .
But the fact that home - brew equipment will be available at a major retail outlet rather than merely at niche sellers signals that companies believe there 's demand and have faith in the safety and reliability of the equipment .
Biodiesel has two distinct faces .
Big , young biodiesel companies are rising stars on angel - investor and venture - capital circles ' lists of emerging alt - fuels .
Their biodiesel tends to be what home brewers call virgin fuel – made from fresh , new vegetable oil .
Most of it is sold to companies and agencies large enough to have their own fleets and pumps .
And there 's also the flourishing underground of brewers .
From neighbors running reactors in garages , like Jules Dervaes and Hans Huth , to a Piedmont , North Carolina , cooperative that has grown to 500 members in four years and made a million gallons last year , home brewing is well - established .
Dervaes and his family have turned their home in Pasadena , California , into a green " best practices " lab .
They began brewing bio about four years ago , using an open source manual on how to build a converter from an old electric water heater .
Dervaes makes about 30 gallons once a month from restaurant waste oil he gets for free .
His family has a standing relationship with neighborhood restaurants glad to be rid of grease they 'd otherwise have to pay to have hauled away .
" It 's a big win for everybody , " Dervaes said .
" We 're off the [ petroleum ] oil grid , the [ vegetable ] oil is being used twice , and the fuel is being made locally , not hauled around the world . "
Restaurant owners like Lucas Manteca of Cape May , New Jersey , are delighted to participate , even if there are a few problems .
Manteca and his wife own three Quahog 's Seafood Shacks and give away about three 55 - gallon drums a week .
It 's great , " Manteca said .
" Before this , we were paying for the oil pickup , and they were just destroying the oil . "
" Restaurants are such a huge source of waste , a lot of trash and oil and water , but it can be difficult and expensive to try to do things the right way , " he added .
" This is just easy and right . "
But with rising oil prices , waste oil has become a commodity .
The New York Times reported in May that restaurants in at least 20 states have had oil stolen .
Waste - management companies looking for an edge over their competition , opportunistic thieves and home brewers have all been caught with their hands in the grease barrel .
" There 's a lot of talk about grease wars where people do nasty stuff to get the grease , " said Leif Forer , one of the founding members of the Piedmont co-op .
" The waste oil used to go to rendering companies that got paid to pick it up and then sold it ' back to the animals ' for pet food and livestock feed .
They 're not happy with us . "
The co-op started six years ago in a community college class taught by Forer and co-founder Rachel Burton .
They made their first batch in Mason jars , and graduated to the kitchen blender .
" Eventually we designed and built our own processor .
At the end of the day , the process and mechanics are the same as the Mason jar , " he said .
" Now we have two plants , and we can make biodiesel in a continuous stream . "
The co-op currently makes more than 120,000 gallons a month , far more than its 500 members consume .
" We got tired of waiting for a corporate solution and found a short - term answer that makes sense on a local scale , " Forer said .
" We 'll settle for that until better fuels and technologies come . "
While there have been few problems with home brewing , last month a garage biodiesel experiment ended when a chemical blast blew the front off a home in Surprise , Arizona .
After the explosion , the assistant fire chief worried aloud that home brewing might mean more explosions .
But Hans Huth , another biodiesel home brewer who posted a do - it - yourself guide in 2006 , says home brewers have n't had many problems – fewer than with the commercial plants .
" Obviously , you have to be careful ! "
Huth said .
" You are refining a fuel you intend to burn . "
Besides instructions on how to build and run a processor , Huth 's manual includes information on local regulations and permits .
" Good information will keep us safer , " he said .
" If we start causing problems , the regulators – and I work with regulators – will have to come in and tighten it up .
As a community , that makes things difficult . "
At his day job with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality , Huth is helping solve an international grease problem : sewage spills in Nogales , Arizona , caused by sewers across the border in Mexico that are jammed by grease from restaurants .
He 's helping build a biodiesel converter in Mexico .
" It looks like we 'll be able to use the facility to generate enough biodiesel to fuel the Rio Rico Fire District , " Huth said .
" Once you start doing this , it becomes insidious , and you find yourself looking around saying , ' Where else can we go to get biodiesel ? ' "
The growth of home brewing from a few garages to mainstream recognition has its problems .
For one , Huth says diesel cars , once the bane of used car lots , are now much harder to find and are selling for more money .
Forer , who 's just returned from a national conference of biodiesel brewers in Golden , Colorado , also sees the arrival on the big stage as both a blessing and a curse .
" We have a consulting business , and we teach classes , and we 're selling a half million gallons a year so we can use the money for other green projects , " Forer said .
" But we 're closing in on the point when demand exceeds supply , and that might mean trouble . "
F# ships with library support for ‘ mailboxes ’ , an asynchronous message - passing mechanism recently popularised by interest in Erlang .
This is good news .
Message - passing in concurrent systems is always a saner approach than explicitly spawning threads and taking locks , and F# ’s support for immutable types and values provides additional safety .
Combined with the asynchronous workflows that the language also supports , a powerful Actor - oriented programming model is available to F# developers .
If you ’re playing in this space in .
Net though , I still think you ca n’t go past the Concurrency and Coordination Runtime ( CCR ) , especially on performance terms , and it turns out to be straightforward to integrate the CCR with F# asynchronous workflows .
Let ’s start out by defining some basic CCR support – this is mostly just plumbing …
# light
namespace FSharp.Ccr.Adaptors
open System
open System .
Threading
open Microsoft.Ccr.Core
open Microsoft.Ccr.Core .
Arbiters
type Receive ( ) =
static let taskQueue = new DispatcherQueue ( )
static member internal TaskQueue with get ( ) = taskQueue
static member internal activate ( task : ITask ) =
Arbiter .
Activate ( taskQueue , [ | task | ] )
In the declaration above , there is only one task queue over the standard CLR thread - pool .
I ’ll cover the support for specifiable task queues in a later post .
Now let ’s cover some adaptor code that enables the use of the basic arbiters from within F# asynchronous workflows ...
(* Receive .
This allows us to write an asynchronous workflow that waits ( but does not block )
on the port as follows :
let recv ( port : Port < string >) =
async {
let ! item = Receive.from port
printfn " %s " item
}
*)
[< OverloadID ( " from " ) >]
static member from ( p : Port <'a > ) =
Async. Primitive ( fun ( cont , econt ) ->
Arbiter .
Receive ( false , p , ( fun result -> cont result ) )
|> Receive.activate )
(* JoinedReceive .
This allows us to write an asynchronous workflow that waits ( but does not block )
until both ports have an item for processing .
It then returns both in a tuple :
let recv ( p1 : Port < string > , p2 : Port<int >) =
async {
let ! s1,i1 = Receive.from_both ( p1, p2 )
printfn " %s %i " s1 i1
}
*)
[< OverloadID ( " from_both " ) >]
static member from_both ( p1 : Port <'a > , p2 : Port <'b > ) =
Async. Primitive ( fun ( cont , econt ) ->
Arbiter.JoinedReceive ( false , p1 , p2 , fun a b -> cont ( a , b ) )
|> Receive.activate )
(* Choice .
This allows us to write an asynchronous workflow that waits ( but does not block )
until either port has an item for processing .
It then returns the result in a
Choice :
let recv ( p : PortSet < string , int >) =
async {
let ! result = Receive.from_either p
match result with
| Choice2_1 s -> printfn " %s " s
| Choice2_2 i -> printfn " %i " i
}
*)
[< OverloadID ( " from_either " ) >]
static member from_either ( ps : PortSet <'a , 'b > ) =
Async. Primitive ( fun ( cont , econt ) ->
Arbiter .
Choice ( ps , ( fun s -> cont ( Choice2_1 s ) ) , ( fun e -> cont ( Choice2_2 e ) ) )
|> Receive.activate )
(* MultipleItemReceive .
This allows us to write an asynchronous workflow that waits ( but does not block )
until n items have queued to the port .
It then returns the result in an array .
let recv ( p : Port< string >) =
async {
let ! result = Receive.multiple_from ( p,100 )
printfn " %i items received . " result .
Length
}
*)
[< OverloadID ( " multiple_from " ) >]
static member multiple_from ( p : Port <'a > , n : int ) =
Async. Primitive ( fun ( cont , econt ) ->
Arbiter.MultipleItemReceive ( false , p , n , fun r -> cont r)
|> Receive.activate )
(* MultipleItemReceive .
This allows us to write an asynchronous workflow that waits ( but does not block )
until n items have queued to the portset .
It then returns the result as a tuple of
collections .
let recv ( p : PortSet < string , Exception > ) =
async {
let ! results , failures = Receive.multiple_from_both ( p,100 )
printfn " %i results received and % i failures . " results .
Count failures .
Count
}
*)
[< OverloadID ( " multiple_from_both " ) >]
static member multiple_from_both ( p : PortSet <'a , 'b > , n : int ) =
Async. Primitive ( fun ( cont , econt ) ->
Arbiter.MultipleItemReceive(p , n , fun f s -> cont ( f , s ) )
|> Receive.activate )
(* MultiplePortReceive .
This allows us to write an asynchronous workflow that waits ( but does not block )
until each port in the specified array has a pending item .
It then returns the
result as a array .
let recv ( p : Port < string > array ) =
async {
let ! results = Receive.from_multiple p
printfn " %i results received . " results .
Length
}
*)
[< OverloadID ( " from_multiple " ) >]
static member from_multiple ( p : Port < 'a > array ) =
Async. Primitive ( fun ( cont , econt ) ->
Arbiter.MultiplePortReceive ( false , p , fun r -> cont r)
|> Receive.activate )
The Overloads are defined because each of these members has an alternate version that takes a timeout limit .
I ’ll cover those in the next post .

' Chemical equator ' keeps southern air clean
A boundary of air , wrapped like a belt around the earth 's equator , is keeping the polluted atmosphere of the Northern Hemisphere separate from the relatively pristine south , say UK researchers .
The team , led by Dr Jacqueline Hamilton of the University of York , have dubbed the peculiar wall of air the " chemical equator . "
And while scientists have known about the feature for decades , Hamilton 's team has just discovered an odd new wrinkle in its behavior .
Typically , where the northern and southern tropical trade winds come together they form a region of stormy updrafts called the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) .
Instead of mixing , the trade winds rise from the ocean or land surface high into the stratosphere , where they diverge again .
The circulation pattern quarantines the Northern and Southern Hemispheres , keeping the pollutant - laden northern air dirty and the southern air clean .
There is some exchange between the two , but the process takes a year or two , versus about a week for air to circulate within a hemisphere .
The team discovered that in January and February , the chemical equator splits off from the ITCZ north of Australia .
As hot air rises quickly off the sweltering Australian continent , storms proliferate and the ITCZ is shifted over land , well south of the geographical equator .
Clean air from the Indian Ocean rushes in to fill the gap , pushing north of Australia and into the South Pacific , where warm waters create a second stormy area .
There , in a region of balmy ocean called the Tropical Warm Pool , the team found the chemical equator thousands of kilometres north of the ITCZ .
' Striking boundary '
Flying on a research plane from south to north , they saw carbon monoxide levels jump from 40 parts per billion to 160 parts per billion in the space of just 50 kilometre .
" It 's a really striking boundary , " says Hamilton , adding that the high concentrations of carbon monoxide in the north are the result of biomass burning in Thailand and Sumatra , as well as general pollution from across the hemisphere , where most of the world 's industry and population reside .
Carbon monoxide and other pollutants that remain in the atmosphere for a few months all display this kind of separation between hemispheres .
Tracking them is important because carbon monoxide is a chemical precursor to low - level ozone , a greenhouse gas that is hazardous if breathed in .
Aerosols from fires and incompletely combusted gasoline can also cause health problems and absorb heat from the sun , increasing the effects of global warming .
" I never noticed anything like a ' chemical equator ' before , " says John Gilles of the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
Gille , who leads an ongoing study to track carbon monoxide circulation across the globe , says seasonal variation in atmospheric conditions is probably behind the phenomenon .
" It 's something I 'd like to go back and look for in our eight years of data . "
The following is adapted from testimony given by George Soros before the US Senate Commerce Committee Oversight Hearing on June 3 , 2008 .
In January 2007 , the price of oil was less than $ 60 per barrel .
By the spring of 2008 , the price had crossed $ 100 for the first time , and by mid-July , it rose further to a record $ 147 .
At the end of August it remains over $ 115 , a 90 percent increase in just eighteen months .
The price of gasoline at the pump has risen commensurately from an average of $ 2.50 to around $ 4 a gallon during this period .
Transportation and manufacturing costs have risen sharply as well .
All this has occurred at the same time as a world credit crisis that started with the collapse of the US housing bubble .
The rising cost of oil , coming on top of the credit crisis , has slowed the world economy and reinforced the prospect of a recession in the US .
The public is asking for an answer to two questions .
The principal question is whether the sharp oil price increase is a speculative bubble or simply reflects fundamental factors such as rapidly rising demand from developing nations and an increasingly limited supply , caused by the dwindling availability of easily extractable oil reserves .
The second question is related to the first .
If the oil price increase is at least partly a result of speculation , what kind of regulation will best mitigate the harmful consequences of this increase and avoid excessive price fluctuations in the future ?
While I am not myself an expert in oil , I have made a lifelong study of investment bubbles as a professional investor .
My theory of investment bubbles , explained more fully in my recent book , The New Paradigm for Financial Markets , is considerably different from the conventional view .
According to my theory , prices in financial markets do not necessarily tend toward equilibrium .
They do not just passively reflect the fundamental conditions of demand and supply ; there are several ways by which market prices affect the fundamentals they are supposed to reflect .
There is a two - way , reflexive interplay between biased market perceptions and the fundamentals , and that interplay can carry markets far from equilibrium .
Every sequence of boom and bust , or bubble , begins with some fundamental change , such as the spread of the Internet , and is followed by a misinterpretation of the new trend in prices that results from the change .
Initially that misinterpretation reinforces both the trend and the misinterpretation itself ; but eventually the gap between reality and the market ’s interpretation of reality becomes too wide to be sustainable .
The misconception is increasingly recognized as such , disillusionment sets in , and the change in perceptions begins to influence the fundamental conditions in the opposite direction .
Eventually the trend in market prices is reversed .
As prices fall , the value of the collateral used as security for loans declines as well , provoking margin calls .
Holders of securities must sell them at distressed prices to meet the minimum cash or capital requirements , and …
Sometimes when you ’ve got a liar as big as Sarah Palin on the line only a timeline will really do justice to her fibbing ways .
So a lot of you have written in to ask :
Okay , she says she said ‘ Thanks .
But no thanks ’ to the Bridge to Nowhere .
But how exactly did it all come out ?
What ’s the order of events ?
Well , briefly , it went like this .
Actually , Congress put the kibosh on the Bridge to Nowhere back in November 2005 .
Since Sen. Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) was then head of the Senate Appropriations Committee he was able to force a compromise in which the earmark for the bridge was killed but Alaska got to hold on to the money — some $ 442 million of federal tax dollars .
Fast forward to November 2006 .
That ’s when Sarah Palin was running as a staunch supporter of the Bridge to Nowhere — that is , after the feds had themselves already said ‘ No Thanks . ’
In 2006 , the Democrats took over both houses of Congress .
So by the time Palin got into office it was clear that not only was the first Bridge earmark killed but that Congress was not going to be ponying up any more money .
That meant that Alaska was going to have to pick up the tab all on its own .
So since she could n’t pay for it with the federal pork barrel , in September 2007 , Palin officially halted the project which was then a state project since Congress had said ‘ Thanks .
But no thanks ’ two years earlier .
She could n’t say ‘ No Thanks ’ because Congress had already said ‘ Forget It ’ .
Still with me ?
So the money Palin sent back to Washington ?
Well , she did n’t .
She kept the money for other bridges and roads in Alaska .
So , to boil it all down , Congress pulled the plug on the Bridge to Nowhere in 2005 .
Palin was still for it in 2006 .
And when she finally ended the project because Congress had cut off funding , instead of saying ‘ No Thanks ’ she actually said ‘ Thanks ! ’ because instead of sending the money back to Washington she kept it all in Juneau .
Next question ?

The sun lights the exterior of the New York Stock Exchange , July 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
( Reuters ) - A U.S. overhaul of insider trading investigations is due to be agreed as early as this week as regulators address growing concerns about illegal activity on global markets , the Financial Times reported Sunday , citing people involved in the talks .
The plan is likely to be submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , which will remain the main markets watchdog responsible for enforcing federal securities laws , the newspaper said .
However , the new system would reform the way stock exchanges handle cases they refer to the SEC , the newspaper said .
Under the proposed measure , the nine U.S. stock exchanges that now monitor insider dealing will cede their authority to two bodies , the New York Stock Exchange ’s regulatory arm and the Financial Industry Regulator Authority ( FINRA ) , which oversees broker - dealers , the newspaper reported .
The SEC , NYSE and FINRA did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
This shift to a more centralized system should lead to faster and more efficient oversight of illegal activity at a time when the potential for abuse is becoming more widespread , the newspaper said , citing people involved with the talks .
The former Alaska public safety commissioner who refused to fire a state trooper embroiled in a domestic dispute with Gov. Sarah Palin 's sister says he holds no grudge , but still believes the GOP vice presidential nominee is too thin - skinned for the job she hopes to fill .
" She apparently has difficulty compartmentalizing personal feelings from official acts , " said Walter Monegan , who spent 33 years in the Anchorage Police Department - five years as chief - before Palin named him as the state public safety commissioner late in 2006 .
Monegan says that - contrary to the governor 's assertions - he believes his own firing by Palin in July was the result of his refusal to bow to pressure from her and her family to get rid of the trooper , Palin 's ex-brother - in - law Mike Wooten .
" It 's the biggest factor , if not the only factor , " Monegan said during a telephone interview from his Alaska home .
Monegan remains at the center of a controversy about whether the Alaska governor and members of her administration tried to pressure him into firing Wooten , who is still on the job .
At the time , Palin 's younger sister , Molly , was involved in a bitter divorce and custody dispute with Wooten .
The Alaska Legislature is investigating the matter and may subpoena Palin 's husband , Todd .
It has also shown interest in having the governor herself talk to investigators , though not under subpoena .
Monegan had his turn Wednesday , spending nearly the whole day telling his side .
Monegan said he knew nothing about Wooten until he was summoned to the governor 's office in January 2007 , after only a month on the job , for a face - to - face meeting with Palin 's husband .
Monegan says Todd Palin laid out a list of grievances against Wooten , including his allegedly threatening to kill Palin 's father , drinking in his squad car , Tasering his 10 - year - old stepson and killing a moose without a permit .
" He was insistent " that something be done , Monegan said .
Monegan said the previous administration had already investigated every allegation and disciplined Wooten , and he saw nothing new to warrant further action .
Still , he said , he agreed to ask his staff to conduct a " page - by - page " review to see if the Public Safety Department had missed anything .
Monegan says a couple of days later he reported back to Todd Palin that there was no new evidence against Wooten .
The governor 's husband was upset with his answer , Monegan said , and pointed to the killing of the moose as a criminal act .
Monegan says he explained that it was " more a letter of the law than the spirit of the law " violation , because the trooper 's wife - the governor 's sister - had a permit for the hunt and had been with him at the time .
" She just did n't want to kill it - it was like looking at Bambi , " Monegan said .
What 's more , he said , after Wooten killed the moose , he and Molly took it to the home of Sarah Palin 's parents , who " butchered it up and gave it back . "
In other words , Monegan said , the parents and sister might also have to answer for their actions if he were to pursue a case against the trooper .
" I got a phone call from the governor about two days later , " he said .
" She reiterated the same frustration ( over Wooten ) , the same passion that her husband had . "
Palin has repeatedly denied pressuring Monegan to fire her former brother - in - law , but has acknowledged that her aides made as many as two dozen inquiries with state officials about Wooten .
Rick Gorka , a spokesman for the John McCain campaign , said Palin is fully cooperating with the investigation and called Monegan 's allegations sour grapes .
" I think people have had their feathers ruffled by Palin because of her willingness to shake things up , " he said .
" She is not going to win the Miss Congeniality contest . "
Shortly before McCain picked her as his running mate , Palin herself said she had fired Monegan because he was n't filling vacant trooper jobs quickly enough , was n't dealing with alcohol abuse among troopers and " did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues . "
No matter how it plays out , Monegan says that as far as he 's concerned , the trooper case has highlighted a character flaw in the would - be veep .
" Inside all of us , we have our likes and dislikes , " he said .
" But when it comes time for doing official business , you put those back in the personal corner .
" Your motivator may be your heart , but your rudder should be your mind . "
North to Alaska :
It turns out that well before he was jettisoned for what he says was his refusal to fire trooper Wooten at the behest of Sarah Palin , Monegan had his own share of domestic troubles - some of them spilling all the way down to the Bay Area .
In October 1994 , Monegan 's estranged wife , who had moved from Alaska to the Peninsula with the couple 's two daughters after more than 10 years of marriage , sought a temporary restraining order against him - accusing Monegan of threatening to kill her , waving a gun at her and dislocating her shoulder , according to her declaration on file in Santa Clara County Superior Court .
In an interview last week , Georgene Moldovan said Monegan had threatened several times to throw her body in an Alaska river .
Monegan , 57 , who has since remarried , vigorously denied Moldovan 's allegations , both in court papers filed at the time and in an interview with us last week .
" I 'm not a door slammer - I do n't punch walls , " he said .
Monegan admitted to dislocating Moldovan 's shoulder , but said it was an accident that had happened before they were married , while they " were wrestling and tickling . "
Moldovan was an emergency room doctor and professor at Stanford and shuttled back and forth from Alaska to the Peninsula the last seven years of their marriage .
Monegan asked her for a divorce in 1993 , but snapped when he learned he might lose the couple 's house , she says .
One day in April 1993 , she said in her court filing , " he pulled out his gun and waved it at me outside my home and yelled he would kill me if I stopped him . "
In the interview , Moldovan said Monegan " would show up unannounced and break into my apartment and do threatening things .
I was forced to get a restraining order because I was really fearful he was going to harm me . "
Monegan denounced the allegations as " either half - truths or pure fabrications . "
He points out that Moldovan made her accusations in the midst of a bitter fight over who would get the couple 's daughters .
If any of the allegations had been documented , he said , he would have been fired from his Anchorage police job and never been hired by Palin as Alaska 's top cop in 2006 .
As for whether any of his own troubles might have clouded his judgment in dealing with Palin 's ex-brother - in - law amid his messy divorce , Monegan says no .
" In a nutshell , I never have and I never will condone domestic violence , " he said .
And while Monegan has n't spoken to his ex-wife in years , he says , he is still on very good terms with her first husband - Alaska's U.S. attorney , Nelson Cohen .

One thing is for certain , the Chinese cannot be accused of being subtle when it comes to insuring good weather for the biggest party on Earth .
Sounding like a military operation , the Chinese government authorized the use of 1,104 cloud seeding missile launches from 4:00 - 11:39 pm on Friday night to remove the threat of rain ahead of the 29th Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing .
This was the first time the weather manipulation technique was used during any Olympic event in the history of the games .
This summer period can be a very wet season for Beijing and officials have been concerned their moment of huge national pride would be a wash - out .
But it would appear the 21 rain dispersal launch sites kept nature at bay and made sure the celebration fireworks did n’t get soggy …
Although cloud seeding remains a hugely controversial practice , both China and Russia are large - scale advocates of various delivery systems .
In June , it was reported that during a Russian Air Force cloud seeding operation , a chunk of cement fell from the sky , making a hole in someone ’s roof .
Although this incident was quite entertaining ( not , however , to the owner who vowed to sue the Kremlin ) , there are some very big local climate concerns associated with cloud seeding .
Scientists have pointed out that weather manipulation can amplify drought conditions in one area or increase the risk of floods in another .
It is an unpredictable practice at best , and often considered to be highly unreliable .
However , the Chinese and Russian governments continue to seed clouds , in an attempt to disperse rain ahead of public holidays and events .
Chinese meteorologists claim that the weather manipulation rockets were highly effective ahead of the opening ceremony on Friday , keeping the skies clear and audience dry inside the main Olympic National Stadium ( a.k.a .
“ The Birds Nest ” ) .
“ We fired a total of 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 p.m. and 11:39 p.m. on Friday , which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium ” – Guo Hu , Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau ( BMB ) .
According to Xinhua news , Chinese meteorologists decided cloud seeding was the only option as the humidity was rising toward 90 % and rain clouds had been tracked since 7:20 am approaching the Chinese capital city .
Under these conditions , scientists felt for certain rain would pour over the opening ceremony .
“ Under such a weather condition , a small bubble in the rain cloud would have triggered rainfall , let alone a lightening , ” said Guo , presumably indicating that any slight instability in the atmosphere may have caused a storm .
Sounding more like a terror threat than a rain warning , the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau issued a “ Yellow Alert ” ( the third highest ) for a thunderstorm at 9:35 pm , with heavy rain hitting downtown Beijing soon after .
According to officials , at 10:42 pm , the clouds had been dispersed and the opening ceremony remained storm - free .
They also stated that other areas surrounding Beijing recorded heavy rain , possibly indicating that the focused cloud seeding campaign worked .

Cassini confirms liquid surface on Titan
31 July 2008
Ontario Lacus is a lake - like feature in the south - polar region of Titan first detected with the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem in mid-2005 .
Brown and colleagues report on observations of this region that were made during the 38th close fly - by of Titan on 4 December 2007 with the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIMS ) onboard the Cassini Spacecraft .
Titan ’s thick atmosphere makes study of its surface difficult except for specific atmospheric windows at 2.0 , 2.7 and 5.0 µm .
The VIMS instrument can penetrate the atmosphere through these windows to obtain , for example , measurements which are used to determine the chemical composition of the surface .
Infrared observations of Ontario Lacus yielded spectra with features which are indicative of the composition and nature of the contents of the lake .
A characteristic ethane signature was observed in the VIMS spectra at 2.0 μm.
Near 5.0 µm the spectra revealed a very steep decline in reflectance .
The authors interpret these features as evidence of a lake filled with a quiescent liquid which is consistent with the presence of ethane .
The ethane is probably in liquid solution with methane , nitrogen and other low - molecular - mass hydrocarbons .
Brown and colleagues have ruled out the presence of water ice , ammonia , ammonia hydrate and carbon dioxide in Ontario Lacus .
The spectra of the lake that have been obtained by VIMS do not support the presence of these materials .
In addition , all of these materials would be solid rather than liquid at the temperatures on the surface of Titan .
Prior to the Cassini mission it was widely believed that Titan would have global oceans of methane , ethane and other light hydrocarbons .
The 45 close fly - bys of Titan , during the nominal Cassini mission , have shown that no such global oceans exist , but hundreds of dark , lake - like features are present .
Until now , it was not known whether these features were liquid or simply dark , solid material .
These new results provide firm evidence supporting the interpretation of these features as liquid lakes .
Titan is one of the primary targets of the Cassini Equinox Mission , the mission extension which began 30 June 2008 .
Data from the Cassini primary and extended missions are providing valuable data for future missions to Saturn , Titan and Enceladus .
" Ontario Lacus is a potential target for a lake lander under consideration for TandEM / TSSM , a possible future mission to Titan " , according to Jean - Pierre Lebreton , ESA Project Scientist and Mission Manager for the Huygens mission , and Study scientist for TandEM / TSSM .

John McCain attacks Barack Obama as a socialist because of his tax policy and because he wants to help the entire population , not just the wealthiest of us pm FOX , but when Wallace reminded the Senator that he voted for the government bail out of Wall St. and wants to bail out bad mortgages using government funds he said that " oh well , I 'm just trying to help . "
He makes our case that government should be used to assist this country when it needs it .
And the talking point about socialism is another desperate measure by John McCain .
He really makes no sense at all .
He flip flops from being a conservative to a populist to a socialist from sentence to sentence .
WALLACE : But you did it indirectly , so let me ask you for some straight talk .
Do you think that Senator Obama is a socialist ?
Do you think that his plans are socialism ?
MCCAIN : I think his plans are redistribution of the wealth .
He said it himself , " We need to spread the wealth around . "
Now , that 's one of ...
WALLACE : Is that socialism ?
MCCAIN : That 's one of the tenets of socialism .
But it 's more the liberal left , which he 's always been on .
He 's always been in the left lane of American politics .
WALLACE : But , Senator , when we talk ...
MCCAIN : So is one of the tenets of socialism redistribution of the wealth ?
Not just socialism — a lot of other liberal and left wing philosophies — redistribution of the wealth ?
I do n't believe in it .
I believe in wealth creation by Joe the Plumber .
WALLACE : But , Senator , you voted for the $ 700 billion bailout that 's being used partially to nationalize American banks .
Is n't that socialism ?
MCCAIN : That is reacting to a crisis that 's due to greed and excess in Washington .
And what this administration is doing wrong , and what Paulson is doing wrong , is not going out and buying up home loan mortgages , home mortgages , and giving people new mortgages at the new value of their home so they can stay in their home .
They 're bailing out the banks .
They 're baling out these institutions .
WALLACE : But you voted for that .
MCCAIN : Of course .
It was a package that had to be enacted because the economy was about to go into the tank .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Yahoo announced Tuesday that it plans to cut at least 10 % of its workforce , or more than 1,500 employees , in the fourth quarter in an effort reduce costs .
The struggling Internet company also announced sales for the third quarter that were roughly in line with Wall Street 's forecasts and earnings that matched expectations .
Yahoo had 15,200 employees at the end of the third quarter .
The much - anticipated round of layoffs comes on the heels of another 1,000 job cuts in late January .
" We have been disciplined about balancing investments with cost management all year , and have now set in motion initiatives to reduce costs and enhance productivity , " said Yahoo co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang in a written statement .
" The steps we are taking this quarter should deliver both near - term benefits to operating cash flow , and substantially enhance the nimbleness and flexibility with which we compete over the long term , " he added .
In a conference call after the results were announced , Yang said the company was working to reduce costs in other ways than just slashing jobs , including relocating offices and consolidating real estate .
" We are identifying ways we can operate more efficiently , " he said .
Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) reported revenue of $ 1.79 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 , an increase of 1 % from the $ 1.77 billion in the same quarter one year ago .
Excluding commissions paid to advertising partners , Yahoo posted sales of $ 1.33 billion , slightly lower than the $ 1.37 billion in sales that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected on this basis .
Yahoo reported net income of $ 54 million , or 4 cents per share , a decline of 51 % from a year ago .
Excluding certain one - time charges , Yahoo recorded profits of $ 123 million , or 9 cents per share , which was in line with what analysts had forecast on this basis .
Yahoo's stock ended the regular trading day down 79 cents at $ 12.07 but rose 7 % in after hours trading .
The report provided " no more negative surprise beyond what we had already expected , " said Sandeep Aggarwal , Senior Internet Analyst at Collins Stewart .
And given the weak economy , Yahoo's report " could have been a lot worse , " noted Jeffrey Lindsay , senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co .
Lindsay said that Yahoo's decision to reduce costs , mostly through massive job cuts , has the potential to buoy the company through the hard times .
" If they really do take the staff numbers down for real , that will have a very beneficial effect , " said Lindsay .
Yahoo's stock has been battered in recent months due to concerns that companies would cut their online advertising spending as a result of the economic slowdown .
Executives admitted that Yahoo's performance has been taking a hit from the sluggish economy .
" An increasingly challenging economic climate and softening advertising demand contributed to revenues this quarter coming in at the low end of our outlook range , " said Yahoo Finance Chief Blake Jorgensen in a statement .
" While we are disappointed with our results , we 're pleased that we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost management efforts we have pursued during the year , " he added .
Looking forward .
In light of the distressed global economic climate , Yahoo lowered its sales guidance for the remainder of the year .
At the end of the second quarter , the company was expecting sales to be in the range of $ 7.35 billion and $ 7.85 billion .
However , the company has now trimmed that revenue guidance to between $ 7.18 billion and $ 7.38 billion .
Even thought Yahoo cut its sales forecasts , the company did n't decrease operating cash flow guidance .
According to Aggarwal , that means that Yahoo's profit margins will be higher than originally thought .
Investors are worried that large companies will spend less on so - called Internet display ads , such as banners and video .
Automakers and banks , two of the nation 's hardest hit sectors , have typically been big purchasers of display ads .
Yahoo turned down several takeover offers from Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) this year , a decision that has frustrated many Yahoo shareholders .
Since then , Yahoo has pursued an ad- sharing deal with top rival Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) .
The partnership has been put on hold , however , as the Justice Department investigates whether the deal would create an online advertising monopoly and violate antitrust laws .
In the conference call , Yang shot down speculation that Google might pull out of the partnership and said that the company was still working with the Department of Justice to negotiate the deal with Google .
" We look forward to bringing the benefits to the marketplace as soon as possible , " said Yang .
Also on the conference call , Yahoo president Susan Decker talked about Yahoo's efforts to move away from a " one size fits all " portal to a more customized experience .
Yahoo has been criticized by some for being too broad and lacking a definite focus .
Meanwhile , Google announced last week that its profits jumped a better - than - expected 26 % in the third quarter .
Google has continued to report strong growth despite the economic downturn thanks to its dominance in search advertising .

Text description provided by the architects .
A few months ago i spotted this house with an amazing private library in Domus magazine , on an issue dedicated to contemporary libraries .
It has a very detalied wood work .
I love the bookshelves between the structure .
the text from the architect , more pictures and drawings after the break .
By coupling indigenous techniques and materials with modern design technologies and aesthetics GBA has created this intimate double pavilion for a writer in Costa Rica .
A main studio space , with library , writing desk and grand piano , is the writer 's daytime space .
The pavilion 's wooden structure , sourced from local timber , sits on a simple foundation of wooden stilts on small concrete pad foundations .
Roof beams of up to 10 m long and 355 mm deep allow for an interior with no vertical columns .
The mono - pitched roof elevates towards the sea shore , while the interior is through ventilated via a completely louvred glazed end façade .
Set at a short distance along a raised walkway , a second smaller pavilion mirrors the first .
This contains sleeping quarters and a bathroom .
Externally , the pavilions are clad in corrugated steel sheeting , another locally used construction material .
The overall effect is that of a building which blends with its surroundings , both visually and environmentally .

In the Money :
The jackpot reverts to a starting $ 15 million on Wednesday .
Tuesday ’s Mega Million game is worth $ 32 million .
STRASBOURG , France , Oct 21 ( Reuters ) -
The following are comments by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday .
SARKOZY
On “ G13 ” :
“ What I want to see is a G13 , which could invite China and India .
You think that with their populations we could get them and not have them speak ?
They are essential partners . ”
“ China is an enormous monetary power , a capitalist power in terms of the capital that it has available to it .
Surely it has to be involved in re-founding the system . ”
On trader bonuses :
“ Payments of salaries on the trading floor , payments of bonuses , have pushed some of them to take uncalculated risk . ”
“ Could we not think about the way these people are paid ? ”
On states buying stakes in private companies :
“ You can do good business even if you are a finance minister . ”
On European Central Bank :
“ I have been always in favour of the independence of the ECB , but I believe a debate is useful . ”
BARROSO
On EU internal market :
“ We need the internal market . ”
“ The European Commission is in favour , at least in principle , of any measures that will help economic growth , companies , if these measures are not discriminatory , if they do not call into question the internal market . ”
On European Central Bank :
“ There is no doubt about the independence of the ECB and it is extremely important to guarantee the independence of the ECB ... it can also discuss things with the European heads of state .
“ We are in favour of bolstering coordination ... I do n’t think we should create a dangerous illusion ... that we are giving instructions to the ECB . ”
SARKOZY
On sovereign wealth funds :
“ In the world , there are sovereign wealth funds with considerable funds . ”
“ Should n’t we think then during this period of crisis about ... having sovereign funds ourselves which would make it possible to defend national interests and European interests ?
Taking advantage of the money which can be achieved not too expensively to reach strategic assets that have depreciated ? ”
BARROSO
“ I find the idea of sovereign funds extremely interesting . ”
SARKOZY
On rating agencies :
“ I think the attitude of rating agencies was the most scandalous factor of the crisis .
Agencies rated triple - A on Friday a product which they demoted to triple - B on Monday , and that ’s not possible , you ca n’t go on with a monopoly of three agencies for rating , mostly United States agencies . ”
“ The question of rating agencies , independent from certain power groups , and the presence of a European agency , is one of the major issues that will be crucial for the summit when we look to the future of regulation in the financial sector . ”
On competition :
“ I believe in competition but I ’ve had enough of making competition an end in itself , it is a means to an end , actually .
Competition is a means at the service of growth . ”
Accounting standards :
“ Dictatorship of U.S. accounting rules is no longer tolerable , is not admissible .
If banks can actually lend out at an unreasonable ratio to their own assets , that ’s not reasonable .
Mark - to - market has destabilised everything ... this question of accounting standards is something the ( European ) Commission is going to look at and we support it . ”
On financial crisis :
“ We are facing the worst at the moment and if we are not bold it will be fatal . ”
“ We need a new Bretton Woods . ”
On European regulator :
“ Personally , I do support your proposal for a European regulator .
We need a European regulator . ”
“ Why do n’t we do it now ?
Because certain countries that defend a national regulator think they ’re defending the identity of their country . ”
“ We need to get a European regulator in order to meet our goals . ”
“ I do n’t see any realistic path , because if not we ’re just going to have a blockage of the system . ”
On European Central Bank policy :
“ You can have another monetary policy without undermining the independence of the ECB . ”
BARROSO
On U.S. debt :
“ A lot of economists say it would be very difficult to argue that you can maintain the level of debts you have in the United States . ”
“ You have to look more to balancing the public debt . ”
“ Perhaps if the U.S. had a Stability and Growth Pact , we would not have seen this financial crisis . ”
On economy , protectionism :
“ There is also the real economy and we all know that day by day the evidence builds that we are facing a serious economic slowdown .
The impact is being felt on jobs , on household incomes and businesses large and small .
One thing is clear , that there is no national road out of this crisis .
Our economies are too intertwined .
We will swim or sink together .
We must not give in to the siren calls for protection or turn our backs on globalisation . ”
SARKOZY
On governance :
“ I believe the crisis calls upon us to reform the European institutions ... a call for Europe to provide as rapid a response as possible . ”
“ I believe it would be a major mistake if Europe were not to have reform of its institutions . ”
“ It is n’t reasonable that everything has to change every six months . ”
“ So with President Barroso , we will work on a roadmap to see how we can deal with the Irish problem .
“ Before I leave the presidency , I intend to come with a roadmap for achieving that in stages by consensus . ”
“ It ’s not possible for the euro zone to continue without clearly identified economic governance .
We can not continue in this way . ”
“ I would like to pay homage to the action of the bank ( European Central Bank ) .
The bank had to be independent but for its action to be properly deployed , the bank had to be in dialogue with the government .
That was the spirit of the ( EU ) treaty . ”
“ Genuine economic governance would be for the Eurogroup to meet at the level of heads of state and government . ”
“ We do n’t have an economic government worthy of that name . ”
On planned world financial summit :
“ Who will take part in this summit ?
There are a lot of different schools .
I believe the most straightforward thing would be the G8 , obviously with Russia .
We need to add the G5 to that , obviously with China and India . ”
“ With President Barroso , we are going to visit China , the aim being also to convince China and India to take part in this summit . ”
“ This is a global crisis so the response can only be global . ”
“ The president of the United States and Europe together have proposed various different summits kicking off in mid-November which will look at new global governance , new regulation . ”
“ I hope that Europe will be able to debate that . ”
“ I will ... propose to my partners , the heads of state and government , that we should meet for those summits . ”
On tax havens :
“ No bank which works with state money should be able to work with tax havens .
No financial institutions should be able to work without being covered by financial regulations . ”
On Russian war with Georgia :
“ We saw a war with a completely disproportionate reaction from the Russians in the case of Georgia .
It was disproportionate to intervene as the Russians did in Georgia .
I also use the word reaction , because that was because there was a preceding inappropriate action , and Europe has to be fair .
Europe should n’t hesitate to step out of the ideological framework . ”
“ Given the state of the world today , I do n’t believe the world needs a crisis between Europe and Russia .
We can defend our differences , human rights , but it would be irresponsible to create the conditions for a conflict for which we have no need . ”
“ Europe brought about peace , Europe has brought about withdrawal of these occupying troops .
And Europe has brought about dialogue . ”
“ It strikes me that it ’s been a long time since Europe has played this kind of role . ”
“ Obviously there are ambiguities ...
But if Europe had not raised the voice of dialogue and responsibility , who would have done that ? ”
The slippery naked truth : Republicans believe the world is unfair and unbalanced and with this understanding have successfully gamed the system to their advantage ... but , only temporarily as the nation slowly awakens to the emperor clothed only in a slick of oil .
As a group the republican party now being guided by McCain et. al. , ( perhaps ) , seem not to be ashamed of their public nakedness .
They should be .
With the selection of outspoken Sarah Palin as McCain ‘s running mate providing a much needed distraction from his flip - flop weakened platform , ( remember Nixon ’s diversion using Spiro Agnew as a decoy ? ) , the party can go forward with complete disregard for the Bush / Cheney administration ’s previous lack of moral focus and openness with the American people .
In spite of the fact that moral and ethical integrity was originally John McCain ’s strongest attributes , it appears some shadow operatives felt he was not making the case strongly enough , thus Palin .
Once again the new - Grand Old Party has not provided the moral compass to find direction out of the ‘ puppet master ’ guided hell of the previous eight years .
Instead the objective of the GOP leadership seems to be taking aim at a new cold war ‘ enemy of convenience ‘ ; that is , by threatening conflict with Iran and Syria - - buffered by the recent Georgian fiasco , AND , bringing Russia back as the ultimate excuse to maintain a military empire around the world .
Let us not kid ourselves , the mock enemy hunting is still all about oil and most likely the underpinning of whatever October ‘ surprise ‘ might be forthcoming .
G. H. Diel
While the group pledged in a statement to “ enhance international cooperation , ” it affirmed that the countries were free to go their own way in responding to the crisis .
“ None of the other six G - 7 members will adopt a similar program to the U.S. , ” the German finance minister , Peer Steinbrück , said .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , criticized the United States and Britain for opposing German attempts to put greater regulation , or at least reviews , of the financial sector on the international agenda last year , when she was leading the Group of 7 .
“ Everyone who produces a real product knows what it looks like and what standards it is up to , ” Mrs. Merkel said , while traveling in Austria .
“ One also needs to know with a financial product what ’s involved .
Otherwise , these sorts of things happen that we then all have to pay for . ”
In fact , Germany and Britain have already bailed out some banks that got into trouble because of deteriorating mortgage - related loans , though on a scale much smaller than the proposed American plan .
British officials made clear that they would not create a government fund to buy bad assets , although Alistair Darling , the chancellor of the Exchequer , did promise new rules .
“ We are putting in place both here in the U.K. and internationally the tougher financial regulation no one can doubt we need , ” Mr. Darling told the governing Labor Party ’s annual conference in Manchester .
“ I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain financial stability . ”
Some economists said Europeans would be forced to take more sweeping action .
“ Germany has more toxic exposure than any other country , ” said Adam S. Posen , the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
“ The only one that may stay out of this is France . ”
BAKU , Azerbaijan  President Bush proposed $ 1 billion in humanitarian and economic assistance on Wednesday to help rebuild Georgia after its short , disastrous war with Russia last month , but he stopped short of committing the United States to re-equipping its battered military .
Mr. Bush announced the infusion of aid as Vice President Dick Cheney arrived here in what he described as a demonstration that the United States had “ a deep and abiding interest ” in keeping Georgia and other neighboring states free from a new era of Russian domination .
The aid  along with Mr. Cheney ’s high - profile visit to a region the Russians call “ the near abroad ”  is sure to inflame tensions further .
Russia ’s leaders have openly accused the United States of having provoked the conflict by providing Georgia weapons and training for its armed forces , while encouraging its aspirations to join the NATO alliance .
The new package of aid , which requires additional approval from Congress , significantly expands assistance to a country that has become ardently pro-American in recent years , though at the cost of the worst relations between the United States and Russia since the end of the cold war .
Protect Yourself
In Used Cars By Owner Online Auction
“ How to get the great deals without worrying about being scammed ? ” I noticed this specific safety concern generated by my last post ( Bottom price used cars by owner ) .
So I ’d like to make a response and share some helpful tips today .
So far , personally I have done several used cars by owner transactions on ebay during the past 5 years .
Two for my self , four with my friends .
And all of them turned out to be great deals and happy experiences .
Actually I found its not that hard to protect yourself online … as long as you stay close to a few simple rules :
Pick A Trustworthy Site
People would definitely go to a Sotheby auction for Vincent Van Gogh ’s portrait , the same thing here : make sure to do your used cars by owner shopping on a reputable site .
Good sites gained reputations throughout the years .
What they ’ve been doing is keeping their long term business in mind and putting customers benefit on top .
They would provide a strictly - controlled transaction process that makes you fully focus on your game without worrying about the others .
Actually I found there are more choices if you ’re buying a new car , but when it comes to used cars by owner auctions , I ’ll straightly suggest ebay motors .
Simply because ebay provides the biggest virtual auction platform we can find today and it has been proven by billions of people .
And ebay motors is one of ebay ’s sections that was build especially for online car auctions .
Personally I ’ve all of my online car deals done there without a kink .
Get the history report
This is not a free service if you shooting for the used cars by owner from online auctions .
But as crucial as it be , a small money can make you avoid thousands in losses .
The only authentic site is autocheck .
Ebay has it as a default accompany under the history report tab .
A report summery is fee but to get the full report you need to pay & 7.99 for a single report or $ 14.99 for 10 reports .
In my opinion , 10 reports are just way too short for people to shift from such a huge list in the market .
I tend to have dozens of candidates under my belt before starting making a bid .
So what I did every time is Grab the Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN ) , jump over ebay heading to their website www.autocheck.com directly and get a 60 - day unlimited reports bundle for $ 24.99 ( It worked perfect for me as non of my bids lasted over 2 months ) .
Then I have access to the detailed report of any used car I ’m interested in .
The point is to make sure the car has not been stolen , falsified VIN , flooded , totaled , accidents , lemon or recalled .
Simplely , if any of these things evolves , go to the next candidate .
Contact The Owner Directly
If the site is trying to mask the seller ’s information , then I ’d propablly just leave .
Because one of the important things for us to protect ourselves against a fake ad is to contact the private seller directly .
Ebay shows the basic contact information of the owner and I used to take advantage of this .
I would shoot an email or dial the number asking questions regarding anything you would like to ask .
My best judgment is honest seller responds quickly and is familiar with the car .
If I sense anything shady then I ’ll just dodge .
Another accessible reference is the seller ’s reputation tracked by ebay .
In the case of a private used car seller , positive feedback from other community members is counted as a vote .
Use A Third Party Payment Service
The way to protected your bank account information is to use a third party payment service like paypal .
Its easy to set up an free account to ensure that the seller does n’t have a chance to access your credit card account .
It ’s not only applied to shoppers of used cars by owner , but as a common scene , never mail cash or checks to any address suggested buy the seller .
Final Protection
I never really came to this point , but just in case the seller does n’t deliver his promise , you need to have a backup plan .
On ebay it called Vehicle Purchase Protection , Which gives you a up to $ 50,000 coverage on any eligible listed cars .
You can check the details about this service and what it offers here on ebay .
And you will get an added protection from ebay ’s security and resolution center if your trade goes wrong .
You can file a report or complaint with the prove and get Legal Department professionals help you recover the lost .
In my last post I showed you how to get the bottom price of any used cars by owner by trimming off the 20 % extra costs of a dealership car .
And I hope today ’s post will help you get a clear vision during your trade and hold the steer wheel steady .

A few weeks ago I wrote a column explaining why Senator John McCain is wrong on Iraq .
In contrast , Senator Barack Obama is largely right on Iraq .
Whether he would follow through on his plan for withdrawing U.S. troops is another question .
The Democratic foreign policy establishment is no less Wilsonian than its Republican counterpart , and once it has used anti-war voters to gain power it will want to show them the door as soon as it dares .
But if Obama is right on Iraq , he is wrong on Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iran .
His prescriptions for each are so close to the policies of the Bush administration that if McCain is McBush , Obama appears to be O’Bush .
It seems many voters ’ desire to climb up out of the Bush league altogether is doomed to frustration .
On Afghanistan , Obama wants to send in more troops and win the war .
But more troops doing what U.S. troops now do — fighting the Pashtun and calling in airstrikes on anything that moves — guarantee we will lose the war .
As was the case in Iraq , the first necessary step is to change what our troops are doing .
From what I have seen , Obama has said nothing on that score , probably because his position on Afghanistan is mere posturing intended to show he will be " tough on terrorism . "
Obama ’s position on Pakistan is even more dangerous .
In August of 2007 , Obama called for direct U.S. military action in Pakistan , with or without Pakistani approval .
Speaking to the Woodrow Wilson Center , he said , " If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wo n’t act , we will . "
President Bush took Senator Obama ’s recommendation this past July , authorizing such actions .
This is an example of the classic strategic error of sacrificing a more important goal to one of lesser importance .
Not even outright defeat in Afghanistan would do America ’s interests as much damage as would the disintegration of the Pakistani state and the transformation of Pakistan into another stateless region .
The state of Pakistan is already dangerously fragile , and actions such as cross - border raids by American troops will diminish its legitimacy further .
No government that cannot defend its sovereignty will last .
Ironically , if Pakistan collapses , so does our position in Afghanistan , because our main logistics line will be cut .
In effect , Obama wants to hand al - Qaeda and the Taliban a double victory .
In June of this year , Obama spoke to the annual AIPAC conference .
What he said there about Iran put him once again firmly in the Bush camp :
As President , I will use all elements of American power to pressure Iran .
I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon … .
There should be no doubt : I will always keep the threat of military action to defend our security and our ally Israel .
Do not be confused .
Sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation .
If we must use military force , we are more likely to succeed and have more support at home and abroad if we have exhausted our diplomatic options .
That is the change we need in our policy .
In other words , the change we need in our policy is to offer a bit more diplomatic kabuki before we attack Iran .
As I have said repeatedly and will keep on saying , an attack on Iran could cost us the whole army we have in Iraq .
It could set the region on fire , from Afghanistan to the Nile .
It could create an oil crisis with severe economic consequences at a time when the world economy is tottering .
It is , in short , madness .
But it is also what Obama promised AIPAC .
Here we see the central reality of American politics shining through the smoke and mirrors .
America has a one - party system .
That party is the Establishment Party , and its internal disagreements are minor .
Both McCain and Obama are Establishment Party candidates .
They agree America must be a world - controlling empire .
Both men are Wilsonians , believing we must re-make other countries and cultures in our own image .
Neither man conceives any real limits , political , financial , military or moral , on American power .
McCain and Obama vie only in determining which can drink more deeply from the poisoned well of hubris , around which , unremarked , lie the bones of every previous world power .
Such is the " choice " the American people get in November .
As a monarchist , it is sometimes hard to keep from smiling .

Speaking of the government 's silly wall art , the Washington Post has a rather hilarious feature on the massive sums federal agencies pay to get their chiefs ' portraits painted .
The Coast Guard in August awarded a $ 12,000 contract for a portrait of Adm .
Thad W .
Allen , a sharp drop from the $ 23,500 it spent in 2005 for a likeness of
Allen 's predecessor as commandant ...
At the upper end of the scale , the Defense Department awaits the expected February completion of a $ 46,790 portrait of controversial former secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
It will grace a Pentagon hallway lined with portraits of his predecessors , as well as one from Rumsfeld 's first stint as defense secretary from 1975 to 1977 .
Open Source Rails projects , make sure you ’re safe …
27 September 2008
An impending doom ?
Possibly .
There was a thread on the Rails Core list not too long ago , titled “ Cookie session security and open - source “ , and they covered what seems to be an obvious security flaw .
I distinctly remember following the events as it happened and thought to myself it makes a lot of sense , and yet I fell victim to the same thing .
PowerDNS on Rails uses the cookie store , and until b2ff9410de [ ...] had both the session key and session secret hard coded in the environment.rb file .
It came down on my like a ton of bricks when I was moderating a comment by JGeiger on my previous post ( Using hoptoad in open source project deployments ) .
I quickly jumped to fix the code using a solution put out by Trevor Turk which requires users to set both the session key and session secret in their database .
yml files .
I know this is not an optimal solution , but works until the Core team ( and us ) have found a reasonable solution to the problem .
As part of stating the obvious ( you gotta love hindsight ) , I recommend anyone who is running PowerDNS on Rails in a production environment to run it over SSL .
Apart from session hijacking woes , having your zone data readable as plain text is just as bad as allowing zone transfers to any DNS client …

Update :
It 's been a long , leak - filled wait , but Apple finally took the wraps off its 3G iPhone .
Thinner edges , full plastic back , flush headphone jack , and the iPhone 2.0 firmware -- Apple 's taking a lot of the criticisms to heart from the first time around .
Obviously 3G is at the forefront , but they 're also making sure it 's available all over internationally , works with enterprises , runs 3rd party apps ... and does it all for cheaper .
Apple claims its 3G speeds trounce the competition , with pageloads 36 % faster than the N95 and Treo 750 -- and of course it completely trounces the old EDGE data speeds .
Battery life is n't getting put out to pasture though , with 300 hours of standby , 8 - 10 hours of 2G talk , 5 hours of 3G talk , 7 hours of video and 24 hours of audio .
GPS is also a go .
Apple is using A - GPS , which supplements regular satellite GPS data with info from cellular towers for faster location .
( WiFi data is also worked into the mix , which should give users a pretty solid lock on where the heck they are on this planet . )
Unfortunately , as expected there 's no front - facing cam , and while its edges are thinner than before it 's still about a millimeter thicker at the center ( 12.3 mm over 11.6 mm before ) .
Apple hopes to launch in 70 countries this year , with the black 8 GB going for $ 199 and 16GB for $ 299 in black or white .
( Both price points require a contract , of course . )
Apple will be hitting the 22 biggest markets , including the US , on July 11th .

Just bought an iPhone ?
Listen up : " Customers who purchased a 2.5G iPhone on or after May 27 and want to swap it out for a new iPhone will be able to do so without incurring an additional handset charge for the new device .
They will of course need to turn in their 2.5G iPhone . "
And for the rest of you , AT&T says there 's no way to buy it without agreeing to a contract .
So sorry .

As the two men who would succeed him train like Olympic athletes for tomorrow 's foreign policy debate , pause for a moment to complete your final report on the 43rd president of the United States .
What would you say ?
I would sum up his two terms in four words : hubris followed by nemesis .
Remember the mood music of eight years ago .
The greatest power the world has ever seen .
Rome on steroids .
An international system said to be unipolar , and Washington 's unabashed embrace of unilateralism .
The US as " Prometheus unbound " , according to the neoconservative commentator Charles Krauthammer .
Wall Street investment bankers bestriding the financial globe as Pentagon generals did the military globe and Harvard professors the soft power one .
Masters of the universe .
Personifying that hubristic moment : George Walker Bush .
And now : nemesis .
The irony of the Bush years is that a man who came into office committed to both celebrating and reinforcing sovereign , unbridled national power has presided over the weakening of that power in all three dimensions : military , economic and soft .
" I am not convinced we are winning it in Afghanistan , " Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a congressional committee earlier this month .
Many on the ground say that 's an understatement .
The massive , culpable distraction of Iraq , Bush 's war of choice , leaves the US - and with it the rest of the west - on the verge of losing the war of necessity .
Here , resurgent in Afghanistan and Pakistan , are the jihadist enemies who attacked the US on September 11 2001 .
By misusing military power , Bush has weakened it .
Economically , the Bush presidency ends with a financial meltdown on a scale not seen for 70 years .
The proud conservative deregulators ( John McCain long among them ) now oversee a partial nationalisation of the American economy that would make even a French socialist blush .
A government bailout that will total close to a trillion dollars , plus the cumulative cost of the Iraq war , will push the national debt to more than $ 11 trillion .
The flagships of Wall Street either go bust or have to be salvaged , with the help of government or foreign money .
Most ordinary Americans feel poorer and less secure .
The decline in soft power - the power to attract - is also dramatic .
The Pew Global Attitudes Survey has recorded a precipitous worldwide fall in favourable views of the US since 2001 .
The map is chequered , of course , but the distaste extends beyond policies of the Bush administration to things such as " American ways of doing business " , and " American ideas about democracy " .
Iraq has been central to this collapse of credibility and attractiveness .
When Bush denounces Russia for invading a sovereign country ( Georgia ) , as he did again at the UN on Tuesday , a cry of " humbug " goes up around the world .
Now American - style free market capitalism is taking a further hit , while some of the alternative models are looking better .
Last weekend , five former US secretaries of state - two Democrat , three Republican - gathered for a panel discussion on the future of foreign policy , televised by CNN .
Asked by Christiane Amanpour what should be the biggest concern for the new president , Colin Powell replied : " To restore a sense of confidence in the United States of America . "
Madeleine Albright added that the world of 2009 would be full of issues " that can only be solved in cooperation with other countries " .
And , Republican and Democrat , they chorussed " close Guantánamo " .
Even George Bush now seems to concur with this criticism of George Bush - and I do n't just mean speculation that the father is privately critical of the son .
Eight years ago , president Bush the younger hardly seemed to know what the word " multilateral " meant .
In the course of his farewell address to the UN general assembly this week , he used the word " multilateral " 10 times .
Obviously not all this mess can be blamed on Bush : he's not responsible for the epochal rise of China , nor for jihadist terrorists ' long - term hatred of the west .
But a great deal of it can .
At the Truman Library in Independence , Missouri , you can still see the painted glass sign that president Harry Truman placed on his desk in the oval office : The Buck Stops Here .
( On the back it says : I'm From Missouri . )
The buck stops there .
The contrast between the president from Missouri and the president from Texas is painful .
Judgment , prudence , vision , patience , honesty - every quality that the 33rd president so signally possessed , as the US remade the world after 1945 , has been signally lacking in the 43rd .
Iraq , the US 's greatest strategic blunder in at least 30 years , is Bush 's fault .
The buck stops there .
And the more we learn about it , the clearer it becomes that it was pursued with a mixture of self - deception and lies .
The reporter Ron Suskind has a new book out in which he recounts how , in the runup to war , British intelligence secured unique access to Saddam Hussein 's head of intelligence , Tahir Jalil Habbush .
Habbush told them what turned out subsequently to be the truth : that Saddam had ceased his programme of weapons of mass destruction , but would not admit it , because he was obsessed with keeping regional enemies such as Iran in a state of fear and uncertainty .
That version was corroborated by Saddam 's foreign minister , to whom French intelligence had originally secured access .
The Bush - Cheney White House ignored both reports , preferring what turned out to be the fabrications of a German intelligence source codenamed Curveball .
Curveball indeed .
Some of Suskind 's reporting has been questioned , but the basic story is not in doubt .
The Bush - Cheney White House pressed ahead to war on a fraudulent prospectus , suppressing and distorting very important contrary evidence .
As a senior member of the administration told Suskind : " We 're an empire now , and when we act we create our own reality . "
Hubris has rarely been better expressed .
Something similar happened with the vertiginous unreality of hyper - leveraged Wall Street investment banking over the past decade .
The financiers ' motto , too , could have been " We create our own reality " .
Again , nemesis follows hubris as the night the day .
The White House was not directly responsible for what looks like wild financial irresponsibility , but it was responsible for not supervising and regulating it - something even John McCain is now at least implicity admitting .
The buck stopped there .
As for the decline in American soft power , that is something for which George Bush was directly to blame .
His arrogance , his unilateralism , his insensitivity , his long - time denial of the need for urgent action on climate change : all fed directly into the plummeting credit of the US around the world .
It would have been a different story with a different president .
For years now , we have seen those who hate the US abusing and burning effigies of Bush .
The truth is , the anti-Americans should be building gilded monuments to him .
For no one has done more to serve the cause of anti-Americanism than GW Bush .
It is we who like and admire the US who should , by rights , be burning effigies .
But now , at last , we live in hope of a better America .

Advertisement Hurricane Gustav is advancing inland from the US Gulf coast , bringing with it torrential rain and severe winds .
The eye of the storm , which left nearly 90 people dead last week as it crossed the Caribbean , is bearing down on the Louisiana community of Lafayette .
The worst of the storm made landfall west of New Orleans , apparently sparing it from the kind of devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina three years ago .
An estimated two million people have fled inland from the Louisiana coast .
Hurricane Gustav is quickly losing strength after making landfall in Louisiana , and has been downgraded to a Category One storm , with winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) .
The storm is expected to move into Texas overnight , dumping as much as 20in ( 50 cm ) of rain there by Thursday .
US President George W Bush is in Austin , Texas , to oversee the government response .
He said Gustav was a " serious event " and insisted that the emergency response was " a lot better than during Katrina " .
Mr Bush praised those who had heeded the warnings to evacuate , saying he understood how hard it was for citizens to " pull up stakes " .
Ghost town
The exodus from the Louisiana coast is the largest evacuation in state history .
Many New Orleans residents have fled , with only 10,000 left from a population of 200,000 .
We 're still seeing storm surge .
There 's lots of rain , tornado threats ...
We are nowhere near out of danger yet
Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin
Tens of thousands are also reported to have left coastal Mississippi , Alabama and south - eastern Texas .
The BBC's Gavin Hewitt in Lafayette says the city is being battered by fierce winds and driving winds , and every now and again there is a rumble , signifying a huge gust .
In New Orleans , a sea surge of up to 14ft ( 4.2 m ) was feared and water was clearing levees as the outer rim of the storm brought heavy rains and winds .
Waves were causing some flooding but the city 's pumps were keeping up with the flow , said a spokesman for the army unit responsible for the city 's flood defences .
FLASHBACK TO KATRINA Katrina struck US Gulf Coast in August 2005 as a Category Three storm , killing more than 1,800 people New Orleans was 80 % flooded after storm surge breached protective levees US Government was blamed for slow , botched response that exacerbated disaster Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced
Flashback : Hurricane Katrina Hurricane Gustav as it happens
In pictures : Gustav 's approach Tracking Gustav on the web A Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) briefing heard that although the high water pressing the walls raised the potential for problems , officials were " confident in the resilience " of the levees .
The Mayor of New Orleans , Ray Nagin , has urged caution .
He said : " We 're still seeing storm surge .
There 's lots of rain , tornado threats ...
We are nowhere near out of danger yet . "
The mayor asked people to " resist the temptation to say we 're out of the woods " , adding that heavy rainfall could still flood the city over the next 24 hours .
He told CNN that the city would not know until late afternoon if vulnerable areas would " stay dry " .
Fema officials warned that the damage wrought by Gustav would be " a catastrophe " .
" We do n't expect the loss of life , certainly , that we saw in Katrina , " Fema spokesman Harvey Johnson said , " But we are expecting a lot of homes to be damaged , a lot of infrastructure to be flooded , and damaged severely . "
In 2005 , three - quarters of New Orleans was flooded by a storm surge that claimed more than 1,800 lives in coastal areas .
The Category Three storm Katrina swept away the city 's levees under a wall of mud and water .
Few remain
In New Orleans , a dusk - to - dawn curfew is in force .
The Louisiana National Guard has been mobilised and support requested from other states .
The storm threatened protective walls as it approached New Orleans

Crime was a major problem in the New Orleans area in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
Concern for those facing the hurricane has prompted the Republican party to scale back its national convention where Senator John McCain is due to accept the party 's nomination for president at the event in St Paul , Minnesota later this week .
Mr McCain told his party that " this was one of those moments in history where you have to put America first .
We will not see the mistakes of Katrina repeated " .
Out in the Gulf of Mexico , most oil production has been shut down .
Three years ago , Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the region 's oil infrastructure and sent oil prices soaring .
Meanwhile , Tropical Storm Hanna has strengthened into a hurricane east of the Bahamas in the Atlantic ocean , US officials reported .
Hanna is on track to skirt Florida before making landfall on Friday in South Carolina , near its state border with Georgia , US weather experts said .

New nanotechnology paints for walls , ceilings , and surfaces could be used to kill hospital superbugs when fluorescent lights are switched on , scientists heard today ( Wednesday 10 September 2008 ) at the Society for General Microbiology 's Autumn meeting being held this week at Trinity College , Dublin .
The new paints contain tiny particles of titanium dioxide , which is the dazzling white compound often used as a brightener in commercial paints .
It will also be familiar to tennis fans as the powder used for the white lines to mark out the courts at Wimbledon .
Scientists have discovered that extremely small , nanoparticle - sized forms of titanium dioxide can kill bacteria and destroy dirt when they absorb ultraviolet light ( UV ) energy from the sun .
They produce active molecules which clean up the painted surfaces .
" It would be best if the titanium was antibacterial at wavelengths of light that you find indoors , such as fluorescent light , so that paints containing the nanoparticles could be used in hospitals and other places where a clean environment is important , " said Lucia Caballero from Manchester Metropolitan University , UK .
The researchers looked at the survival of the food poisoning bacterium Escherichia coli on different formulations of paints containing the titanium nanoparticles under different types and intensities of lights .
" We found that paints containing titanium dioxide are more successful at killing bacteria if the concentration of the nanoparticles is stronger than in normal paint .
Our best results showed that all the E. coli were killed under ordinary fluorescent lights , " said Lucia Caballero .
" However , other common additives in paints , such as calcium carbonate , silica or talc decreased the antibacterial efficiency of the paint .
If calcium carbonate was present the kill rate dropped by up to 80 % , " said Lucia Caballero .
" Our tests on a commercially available paint showed that the ability of the paint to inactivate bacteria was massively reduced compared with a paint formulation which did not contain such additives . "
With rising concern about the spread of hospital superbugs , healthcare trusts are increasingly looking to find better ways to maintain hygienic standards in hospitals .
The same concerns are driving developments in the food industry and in pharmaceutical companies .
These new nanoparticle paints could provide a simple and cost - effective solution .

“ Evangelicals and social conservatives have embraced McCain ’s vice presidential pick for what they call her “ pro-family , ” “ pro-woman ” values .
But in Alaska , critics say Gov. Sarah Palin has not addressed the rampant sexual abuse , rape , domestic violence and murder that make her state one of the most dangerous places in the country for women and children .
Alaska leads the nation in reported forcible rapes per capita , according to the FBI , with a rate two and a half times the national average a ranking it has held for many years .
Children are no safer : Public safety experts believe that the prevalence of rape and sexual assault of minors in Alaska makes the state ’s record one of the worst in the U.S .
And while solid statistics on domestic violence are hard to come by , most including Gov. Palin agree it is an “ epidemic . ”
Despite the governor ’s pro-family image , public safety experts and advocates for women and children struggled when asked to explain how Palin ’s leadership has helped address the crisis .
And current and former officials from Palin ’s administration confirmed that an ambitious plan to tackle the crisis has apparently sunk into doldrums after arriving at the governor ’s office .
“ She ’s really done a lot of work on oil and gas , but when it comes to violence against women and children .
. . we have n’t been on her radar as a priority , ” said Peggy Brown , executive director of the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault . (…)
Some members of Palin ’s administration were focused on the issue of sexual violence .
Officials in the Department of Public Safety were devising an ambitious , multi-million - dollar initiative to seriously tackle sex crimes in the state , but Palin ’s office put the plan on hold in July .
Days later , Palin fired its chief proponent , Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan , after he declined to dismiss a state trooper Palin accused of threatening her own family members .
Palin has said she fired Monegan because she wanted to move his department in a “ new direction , ” and he was not being “ a team player on budgeting issues . ”
The dismissal is now at the center of a hotly - contested investigation by the state legislature .
The status of the plan , which would have “ fast - tracked ” sex crime cases via a dedicated group that included specially - trained investigators , judges and prosecutors , is unknown .
“ I ’d ask the governor , ” said one official with knowledge of the plan .
Numerous inquiries to Palin ’s campaign spokeswoman went unreturned . ”

Bush ’s Banned Interview : An Insight Into Insanity
Ben Cohen
While surfing the net on ‘ Stumble ’ , I came across an interview with President Bush on Irish television that caused a bit of a storm in 2004 .
The interview conducted by the tenacious Carol Coleman of Radio Television Ireland was not aired on American television , and Bush ’s press officers apparently complained vociferously about the rigorous questioning .
The video shows Bush at the absolute peak of his arrogance — convinced of his own rhetoric about Iraq , flooded with confidence from international subservience to American power , and high off a crushing military victory that reinforced his childish fantasies of American power and preeminence .
The problem was , Coleman was having none of it , and what transpired was a unique insight into the warped brain of the least respected and most hated president in the history of the United States .
“ Mr. President , ” she asked the stone faced Coleman .
“ You ’re going to arrive in Ireland in about 24 hours ’ time , and no doubt you will be welcomed by our political leaders .
Unfortunately , the majority of our public do not welcome your visit because they ’re angry over Iraq , they ’re angry over Abu Ghraib .
Are you bothered by what Irish people think ? ”
Other than stutter , the president managed only to answer in vacant homilies about ‘ the great values of our country . ’
“ We are a compassionate country , ” he asserted .
“ We ’re a strong country , and we ’ll defend ourselves — but we help people . ”
And that was about the depth of his explanation for the invasion of Iraq .
Supremely satisfied with his own answers , Bush expected Coleman to be bowled over with his ‘ good ol ’ plain speakin ’ English ’ , but Coleman , not infected with the American media ’s insatiable appetite to service power , had other ideas .
She continued to grill Bush about the rising violence in Iraq , increased world wide threat of terrorism , and failure to find the weapons of mass destruction .
Flustered and unaccustomed to serious challenges to his power , Bush displayed flashes of anger , and an increased reliance on catch phrases to argue the unarguable .
“ These people are willing to kill innocent people , ” he answered testily in response to questioning about the Iraqi death toll .
“ They ’re willing to slaughter innocent people to stop the advance of freedom .
And so the free world has to make a choice :
Do we cower in the face of terror , or do we lead in the face of terror ? ”
Coleman cut through the simplistic slogans about evil doers and freedom loving Americans and continued to ask Bush serious questions about the illegal war he had just launched .
It fast became evident that this was a man who really had no idea what he was doing — someone so removed from reality that he failed to even understand what he was being asked .
The world in Bush ’s mind exists of good and evil , right and wrong , and America and everyone else .
He could not fathom anyone disagreeing with his nobility , and simply refused to acknowledge that a different account of reality existed .
The interview took place almost four years ago , but is the perfect illustration of a man elected purely on name recognition , dirty money , and no discernible talent .
Four years ago , there were still enough Americans who believed Bush ’s infantile bluster was charming and direct .
Now , even Republicans do not waste their time with him , quietly wishing he would disappear and stop embarrassing their party .
The interview with Coleman should go down on record as definitive proof of Bush ’s utter incompetence , a priceless picture of a madman who had no business occupying the highest office of the land .

WASHINGTON - To help figure out what 's happening inside the fastest - moving Greenland glacier , a US rocket scientist sent 90 rubber ducks into the ice , hoping someone finds them if they emerge in Baffin Bay .
The common yellow plastic bath toys are one part of a sophisticated experiment to determine why glaciers speed up in the summer in their march to the sea , said Alberto Behar of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
The Jakobshavn Glacier is very likely the source of the iceberg that sank the Titanic in 1912 and researchers focus on it because it discharges nearly 7 percent of all the ice coming off Greenland .
As the planet warms , its melting ice sheet could make oceans rise this century .
" It 's a beautiful place to visit .
You can watch these icebergs continuously march across and fall into the ocean , " Behar said .
What you can't see is how melting water moves through the ice .
" Right now it 's not understood what causes the glaciers themselves to surge in the summer , " Behar said .
One theory is that the summer sun melts ice on the top glacial surface , creating pools that flow into tubular holes in the glacier called moulins .
The moulins can carry some water all the way to the underside of the glacier , where it acts as a lubricant to speed the movement of ice toward the coast .
But because it cannot be seen , no one really knows what occurs .
That 's where the rubber ducks come in , along with a probe about the size of a football loaded with a GPS transmitter and instruments that can tell much about the glacier 's innards .
In August , Behar flew by helicopter to a place on the glacier where rivers of melted ice flow into moulins .
Researchers lowered the probe into one moulin by rope and released it into the water flowing beneath the ice .
They also released the flotilla of rubber ducks , each labeled with the words " science experiment " and " reward " in three languages , along with an e-mail address .
The ducks - if they are found and if somebody e-mails the discovery - would tell scientists where the water ends up .
The probe could tell much more .
First , it would signal its position via GPS .
Its pressure and temperature sensors would supply information .
And an accelerometer - which records how much things speed up or slow down - could point to waterfalls or cascades , features that would make the probe , and the water , go faster .
Behar said he hoped a fisherman or hunter might find a duck or the probe but so far nothing has turned up .
" We have n't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it , " he said .
" These are places that are quite remote so there are n't people walking around . "
As a creator of robotic rovers for NASA , Behar often tests vehicles meant for space in hostile places on Earth .
He worked with Konrad Steffen of the University of Colorado , a specialist on Arctic ice and the Greenland ice sheet .

Anti-government protesters have stormed the compound of Thailand 's prime minister , Samak Sundaravej , as part of demonstrations across Bangkok today aimed at forcing his resignation .
The rightwing People 's Alliance for Democracy is behind the protests and shut down the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand TV channel with a pre-dawn raid on the main studios of the government - operated station .
" We are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work , " said Sondhi Limthongkul , a leader of the alliance .
" Today we declare a long , long holiday for the government . "
The group 's strategy appears to be to provoke a violent crackdown by the government , with the aim of winning public sympathy and perhaps compelling the army to step in to restore order .
General Anupong Paochinda , the country 's army chief , said the military would not stage a coup and the crisis could be solved politically .
After the government was forced to move its weekly cabinet meeting to a military compound , Samak appeared on television to warn that his patience was running out .
He said his interior minister had been given direct control of the police to " bring the situation back to normal " .
The People 's Alliance for Democracy , which aligns itself with conservative factions of the monarchy and military , says Samak is a proxy for the former prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra .
Thaksin , who was ousted in a 2006 military coup over alleged corruption and abuse of power , is in self - imposed exile in England .
The alliance has accused Samak of trying to amend the constitution to help Thaksin avoid corruption charges .
It accuses the government of failing to aggressively prosecute cases against Thaksin and refusing calls to extradite him to face court .
The movement wants to replace the country 's electoral democracy with a system that would be dominated by appointees from the bureaucracy and the military .
It claims the country 's rural majority is not sophisticated enough to choose good public servants .
Opinion Lala , for those who do n't know , is a free streaming music venture .
Invested in by Warner Music group to the tune of $ 20 m it streams about five million songs , but also offers 89 cent MP3 sales , and song rentals for 10 cents each .
But why is almost nobody using their well - designed , expansive , free streaming service ?
I 'm not talking about the song rentals for 10 cents - we all knew that was a non-starter .
But people are n't streaming songs even for free .
While Imeem is streaming more than 1 m sessions per day , on Lala only 25 daily listens will get your song into the weekly Top 10 .
The service just is n't attracting users at all , in spite of the marketing major label WMG has committed to do .
Lala appears to be just another in a long list of industry endorsed companies that tries to make the labels happy - and in so doing , apparently forfeits its chance to build a user base or a business .
Over the last decade there seems to be three broad categories of digital music companies :
Firstly , there are companies who actively court label endorsement , and do n't do anything the labels do n't like .
Many agree to pay the labels big fees including substantial million dollar up - front payments .
Many of these have raised substantial money , too .
They get some nice press articles , but then quietly fade away .
If they have label money or executives running their company or influencing the company ( instead of net people ) then they have never been able to attract a significant user base .
Examples include Liquid Audio , a2 b , Lala , Pandora , Wippit , Qtrax , Mashboxx , and Nokia 's Comes With Music .
Secondly , there are companies who get sued by the labels after attracting a huge audience .
They usually succumb to legal pressure and sign licences agreeing to pay the label 's big fees including substantial million dollar up - front payments .
They may have audiences for their service but it 's irrelevant , because the royalty structure ensures they will never turn a profit .
Napster , Imeem and the upcoming MySpace music store fits in this category .
At MP3.com we were profitable , but the portion of our business which served licensed music was never going to make any money .
Then there are the companies who have been sued , but are proceeding with the legal case rather than settling .
If these companies lose their lawsuits they will likely go out of business because of draconian statutory damage rates , which ensure that even if their service is beneficial for the music industry , they are driven to bankruptcy with oversized damage awards .
MP3tunes , Veoh , Multiply , Seeqpod and Playlist.com fall into this bracket ( although my sources say that Playlist .
com 's VC are pushing hard for a settlement which would put them in category two . )
Missing from this list is a fourth category , where a true partnership between net companies and the industry is negotiated .
A partnership where the digital company provides some benefit to labels or publishers , and in return they get the ability to create a profitable business .
Go legal and die
The internet companies I talk to do n't mind giving some direct benefit to music companies .
What torpedoes that possibility is the big financial requests from labels for " past infringement " , plus a hefty fee for future usage .
Any company agreeing to these demands is signing their own financial death sentence .
The root cause is not the labels - chances are if you were running a label you would make the same demands , since the law permits it .
The lack of clarity in the law is the real culprit - and it's the huge potential penalties that create an incentive for the big record labels ' law firms to file lawsuits .
Without clear laws and rulings from the court about what is permissible , every action touching a copyrighted work is a possible infringement , with a large financial windfall if the copyright owner can persuade a Judge to agree .
Fortunately , there seems to be light at the end of the legal tunnel .
Two recent US court rulings have added some clarity to several key copyright issues and both rulings were clear victories for the digital company wishing to interact with copyrighted works .
First there was Fox v Cablevision , where a commercial company wanted to provide a remote recording and playback service to its cable customers .
Think of it as a centralised TiVo system .
The appellate court reversed a lower courts ruling that such a service was a copyright infringement by Cablevision , and each playback was a public performance requiring a royalty payment clearing the way for such a service .
Second was Io v Veoh , which found that Veoh , a YouTube - like service , was protected from financial claims resulting from hosting videos owned by others , because it was acting within a safe harbour of the DMCA .
The DMCA offers protection to internet service providers for several actions , including storing material at the direction of the user and linking to works elsewhere .
Both these rulings were significant defeats for media companies and victories for consumers .
The depth and detail of these rulings suggest that courts are gaining a deeper understanding of technology issues .
It may be that in a few years there will be substantially more clarity on digital media issues , which will be a strong inducement for technology and media companies to create mutually beneficial partnerships rather than engage in costly legal battles .
We 're not there yet , but if a few more courts conclude as the California court did in the Veoh case that the DMCA protects online services , this will dissuade media companies from their legal attacks and bring them to a negotiation table .

Drug resistance is the phenomenon whereby widespread use of an antibacterial drug is followed by the emergence of strains of bacteria capable of resisting the drug .
In 1940 , the New York Times hailed the arrival of
A new wonder - working chemical named sulfathiazole , the latest " relative " of the sulfanilimide group of " magic bullets , " which promises to become the greatest weapon against a host of deadly bacterial infections for which no effective measures existed until now . [ 1 ]
Sulfa drugs followed the prior discovery of the first antibiotic , penicillin , and streptomycin , another antibiotic , was discovered not long after sulfathiazole .
The revolutionary impact of these drugs cannot be overstated .
Previously there had been an obsession with the threat of germs [ 2 ] because infections , once contracted , were often fatal .
With antibiotics , for the first time in human history , serious bacterial diseases could be cured promptly and effectively .
The phrases " wonder drug " and " miracle drug " were widely used .
But pencillin - resistant microbes started to appear in 1947 , just four years after it entered widespread use .
[ 3 ]
By 1952 the Times was reporting that " more bacteria [ are ] developing more resistance to ' wonder drugs . ' " [ 4 ]
Bacteriologists soon found that E. coli grown in media containing streptomycin not only produced strains capable of resisting streptomycin , they actually in some cases developed strains that thrived on it and required it for growth .
In the last half of the twentieth century , a situation developed which was often described as an " arms race " between doctors and bacteria .
Bacteria kept developing resistance to drugs , but researchers and drug companies kept ahead of them by developing new drugs .
Drug company representatives combed the world collecting soil samples and biological specimens , looking for useful antibiotics in nature , while chemists tried to synthesize new antibiotics in the laboratory .
The 1960s saw the emergence of a number of synthetic penicillin - like drugs , such as ampicillin , amoxicillin , and cloxacillin .
But by the 1990s the development and discovery of entirely new classes of antibiotics appeared to have reached an end ; scientists only managed to make improvements within existing classes of drugs .
[ 5 ]
There is widespread concern that the bugs are catching up .
The generation now approaching retirement may be the only human generation in history to live its entire life free from the mortal dread of bacterial infection .
Gonorrhea , for example , was once regarded as easily curable with penicillin .
In the 1980s , penicillin - resistant strains developed , but gonorrhea was still not considered dangerous ; it was still curable , it just required newer antibiotics .
The main public health concern was that effective treatment had now become more expensive .
In 2007 , it emerged as a " superbug " for which a single treatment option is still effective .
Thus , although standard references still say " In most cases , the disease can be cured by adequate treatment with a fluoroquinolone or cephalosporin antibiotic , " [ 6 ] the Center for Disease Control now finds that resistance to the fluoroquinolones is so widespread that it no longer recommends them as a treatment for gonorrhea in the United States . [ 7 ]
There is controversy over the best policies to keep drug - resistant strains in check .
In the 1940s the medical profession began lobbying to make antibiotics available only through prescription to prevent overuse , and educating doctors to be prudent in prescribing them .
However , antibiotics are widely added to livestock feed to prevent infection and promote growth , and critics charge that the practice has encouraged the emergence of resistant strains , a charge which the agriculture industry and the USDA deny .
The mechanism by which drug resistance emerges was studied by Luria and Delbrück in 1943 and by Lederburg and Lederburg in 1952 .
Further work established that streptomycin resistance emerges as the result of point mutations , at a rate of about one per billion cells , while isoniazid resistance has a mutation rate of one per million .
Drug resistance also arises in viruses .
For example , the anti-flu drug Oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) was only introduced in the year 2000 , and did not receive widespread use until 2004 ; yet in 2007 , type B influenza infections resistant to the drug were observed in Japan . [ 8 ]
Drug resistance is also used in many molecular biology techniques .
A plasmid containing a gene of interest and a gene for antibiotic resistance is transformed into a strain of bacteria ( usually E.Coli ) via chemical or electrical means .
The bacteria is then plated onto media containing the antibiotic corresponding to the gene of antibiotic resistance .
Only bacteria that have taken up the plasmid containing the antibiotic resistance gene can grow on the media .
The plasmid containing the gene of interest can then be purified via alkaline lysis .
Drug resistance and evolution
The development of antibiotic resistance is often held up by evolutionists as proof of evolution occurring , however the appearance of resistant organisms is often proceeded by the uptake of transposable epigenetic elements ( TEEs ) called plasmids .
These TEEs are found in related organisms and the resistance to any given class of antibiotics is merely transferred from one strain to another to make a new hybrid strain . [ 9 ]
I lived in the Netherlands for a couple of years , and had a Dutch boyfriend for almost 4 years , so I know quite a bit about this quirky country and its unusual inhabitants ( and I mean that in a good way ) .
I ’m going to share some pearls of wisdom about the Dutch and their country that I gleaned during my stay , and limit it to 10 because I could easily write 100 and bore you to death .
Hope you enjoy .
1. Holland and the Netherlands are not synonymous .
Holland is just one section of the Netherlands , largely the western coastal region , including Amsterdam , Rotterdam , Haarlem , Leiden and the Hague .
However , other famous Dutch cities like Utrecht , Groningen , Maastricht , Den Bosch and Leeuwarden are * not* in Holland .
2 . The Dutch love sprinkles on toast .
I ’m talking the sprinkles kids put on ice cream , but Dutch adults put it on bread .
For breakfast .
It ’s called “ hagelslag ” , and De Ruijter makes the best kinds .
Another variant , “ muisjes ” – little mice – are candied anise seeds ; also delicious on buttered toast .
You can get either pink , female , or blue , male , varieties .
I ’m not joking .
3 . The Dutch will only eat one hot meal a day .
If you arrive at a Dutch friend ’s house around dinnertime , they might ask , “ Heb je al warm gegeten ? ” which means “ Have you eaten something hot already ? ”
If you had a hot lunch , your friend will prepare a ( cold ) sandwich for you for dinner .
You can not eat 2 hot meals per day .
4. Dutch “ g ” “ ch ” and “ r ” are all pronounced more or less the same ( although the Dutch insist they ’re different ) – a harsh , guttural “ kh ” sound ( like you ’re clearing phlegm from your throat ) .
So the word “ gracht ” ( canal ) combines all three “ kh ” sounds in one word … that sounds really , really awful : “ khkhakht . ”
This is why “ Grolsch ” ( the beer ) sounds like “ Khkhols ” , not “ grolsh ” .
5 . The Dutch love speaking English .
See # 4 .
Seriously , they all speak perfect , although heavily - accented , English .
They will pronounce “ idea ” eye - DEE , and they will resist pronouncing it with 3 syllables in English , no matter how many times you correct them .
On a related note , “ I have no idea ” is “ geen idee ” , which sounds a little like “ rainy day ” when pronounced correctly .
6 . The Dutch loathe the Germans .
Some pretend they do n’t , some are openly proud of it , but they all look down on them .
An example : I was walking along a beach ( Schevengingen ) with a Dutch guy , and we saw a guy furiously digging a hole in the sand .
My Dutch friend sneered .
I asked him why the guy was digging a hole .
He said , “ Because he ’s a dumb German . ” I pressed , but what for ?
Is he building a castle or something ?
“ No , he ’s just a stupid German !
He ca n’t help it !
The morons just love digging holes for no reason ! ”
Another story .
A Norwegian friend flew down to Germany , rented a car there and drove to Rotterdam .
He had parked on the street , and a cop approached him while he was in his car , and told him , in German , that he was n’t allowed to park there and began writing him a ticket .
When he looked at his driver ’s license and saw he was Norwegian , he tore up the ticket , said , “ Park wherever you want ” and “ Welcome to Holland ! ” , all in English .
7 . The country is drenched with rain year round , but the Dutch never use umbrellas .
They use raincoats and rain “ suits ” , but they never use umbrellas ( too hard to ride your bicycle with one ; plus , it ’s * really * windy all the time ) .
The Dutch will happily put up with wet faces and heads .
The “ wet look ” is permanently “ in ” there .
Another oddity is no matter how much it rains and floods temporarily , all the water ’s gone in about 20 minutes .
I think it ’s because the ground is mostly sand ; the water just drains away .
The cement blocks used as a road surface are taken out every few years , the sandy ground is pounded flat with this sand - pounding - machine ( seriously ) and then they replace the cement blocks .
8 . The Dutch have strange snacking habits .
They eat fries ( what they ’re famous for ) but they ’re often drenched in mayonnaise or pindasaus ( basically spicy peanut butter ) .
They also love frikandel ( all the scary remnant parts of animals they can’t sell elsewhere , pressed into a vaguely hotdog shape , and then deep - fried until dark brown ; yes , it looks like a piece of shit ) , kroketten ( deep - fried lumps of dough wrapped around meat , that look like dried - up old turds ) , and cheese souffles , which are greasy but I have to admit , pretty damn tasty .
The most famous purveyor of this junk is a chain called Febo ; you buy everything out of an automat .
They ’re everywhere , especially inside train stations , and open late when you ’re coming out of the clubs at 3am .
9 . You heard about the Dutch using free bicycles provided by the government ?
Nope – that ’s the Danish .
The Dutch love using bicycles ( called ‘ fietsen ’ , pronounced FEETS - un ) , but in every city , theft is rife and you have to use 2 - 3 locks to prevent even a piece of shit bike from being stolen .
This is why the average Dutch person does n’t spend more than $ 50 for a bike – it ’ll eventually get stolen .
Junkies in the Amsterdam red light district will sell you a bike for 10 euros ( 25 guilders before the euro changeover ) , but be careful ; if you buy one and a cop sees you , you go to jail .
There are specially - designated “ fietspaden ” ( bike paths ) all over the country , and pedestrians can not walk on them .
If you hear a bell ringing –that ’s how the Dutch tell people to get out of the way–then pay attention !
You ’re about to get mowed over .
10 . The Dutch are not big potheads .
Despite it being legal there ( along with “ magic mushrooms ” ) , you almost never see a Dutch person getting high .
You see TONS of foreigners – Brits , Americans , Germans , etc – smoking out in Dutch “ coffee shops ” ( “ coffee shop ” means marijuana ; “ cafe ” means coffee , so pay attention to what the establishment calls itself ) , but it ’s pretty rare to see a Dutch person there .
The legalization is tied to a very Dutch concept called “ gedoogbeleid ” which is difficult to translate but means permissiveness - because - there - are - bigger - fish - to - fry .
The Dutch live below sea level , so they have plenty of dams & dikes keeping the water out .
To relieve pressure on this system , a little water always trickles through – that ’s okay as long as they can keep the floods out .
This is often why the Dutch are said to not care about trivial drugs like marijuana and magic mushrooms – so they can focus on hard drugs like cocaine and meth ( which are very much illegal ) .
There ’s my list .
Let me add something that I found in a tourist brochure given out at the Schiphol ( SKHIP - hull , not Shiffol ! ) airport , which I think totally captures the Dutch attitude ( I ’m paraphrasing because I do n’t have it here ) :
EA has been dealing with something of a PR problem with Spore , as gamers bomb the Amazon ratings with one - star reviews to make their feelings known on the issue of DRM .
Who can blame them ?
Placing a limit on how many times you can install a game you own , and doing so after the game has already been made available via the expected channels online in pirated form , is lame .
EA wants you to know that it is listening , however , and the install limit for Red Alert 3 has been raised to five .
In other words , EA has decided to loosen the handcuffs slightly .
We 're supposed to be very happy at this " progress . "
Chris Corry , the Executive Producer on the game , has more details :
Life happens .
I know it 's unlikely , but
for those unlucky few who install the game and have their
machines nuked ( virus , OS reinstall , major hardware
upgrade , etc. ) five times , EA Customer Service will be on hand
to supply any additional authorizations that are
warranted .
This will be done on a case - by - case basis by
contacting customer support .
So if you use your computer like us geeks and do a lot of reinstalls , or simply uninstall and reinstall the game enough to hit the five user limit , you 'll have to plead your case to EA 's customer service and hope they grant you some more use of the game you 've already paid for .
No promises though .
This is on a " case - by - case " basis .
Another EA employee on the forum described this as " the lenient measures " they are taking for those of us with concerns .
It 's the phrase " lenient measures " that 's so insulting , as if imposing an install limit , and then upping it by two , is doing us a huge favor .
I realize many of you are reading us from work , so I have abstained from putting an image of a big middle finger in this post .
Trust me , I 'm still thinking it .
One member of the forum put it very well .
" Making life harder for customers and a funny joke for hackers is the wrong way to fight piracy .
The game will be hacked one hour after release , and pirates wo n't have any install limits .
All those who buy original will have install limit , 3 , 5 , or 20 , it does n't matter .
Install limits are a pain in the ass for everyone who buys the original and a joke for pirates .
So who are you really fighting ... piracy or your customer ? "
The original poster may not have spoken English as their native tongue , but the point is still made .
Another international EA customer points out that the company is giving their user base the shaft in another way : you have to call customer support to get more activations .
" EA does have customer support in Australia , " he wrote .
" It comes to you at the low low price of $ 2.48 a minute . "
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai has ordered an investigation into a U.S. - led coalition air strike that local officials say killed 15 civilians , but the U.S. military says killed only armed Taliban militants .

The issue of civilian casualties is an emotive one in Afghanistan , feeding a common perception that international forces do not take enough care when launching air strikes , and undermining support for their continued presence in the country .
Nearly 700
Afghan civilians were killed in the first six months of this year , 255 of them by Afghan government and international troops , the rest by Taliban militants .
Coalition ground troops called in support from attack helicopters after militants fired at an outpost in the northeastern province of Nuristan on Friday , the U.S. military said .
“ The helicopter crews coordinated with ground forces to positively identify the militants ’ vehicles .
The attack helicopters then destroyed the two vehicles , killing more than a dozen militants , ” it said in a statement on Saturday .
But the governor of Nuristan said 15 civilians were killed and seven wounded in the attack in the Waigal district of Nuristan and that none of the victims were militants .
Karzai ordered the Defense and Interior Ministries and a body that oversees local government to investigate , a statement from the presidential palace said on Sunday .
“ President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly emphasized the ( need for ) coordination of military operations and has been deeply saddened since learning about this incident , ” it said .
MORE ACCUSATIONS
Both the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and U.S. - led coalition forces say they take the utmost care to avoid killing civilians and ISAF tightened procedures for launching air strikes a year ago , which has had some effect .
ISAF accuses the Taliban of launching attacks from built - up areas to deliberately court civilian deaths and also spreading false rumors to discredit international forces .
A local official accused the U.S. - coalition of killing and wounding 30 civilians in an airstrike on a wedding ceremony in the eastern province of Nangarhar on Sunday , Afghan media said .
The U.S. military said airstrikes targeted a large group of militants in Nangarhar and no civilians were in the area .
“ Intelligence revealed a large group of militants operating in Deh Bala district .
Coalition forces identified the militants in a mountainous region and used precision air strikes to kill them , ” a U.S. military statement said .
“ We do n’t have any reports of any civilian casualties , ” said U.S. military spokesman Captain Christian Patterson .
“ There were not any women or children present in the area . ”
The U.S. Pentagon said last week the Taliban would probably intensify the scope and pace of their attacks , meaning more civilians were certain to be caught in the cross -fire .
A Taliban suicide car bomber targeting German police trainers wounded three schoolgirls in relatively peaceful northern Afghanistan on Sunday , the deputy provincial police chief said .
As foreign troops get better at protecting themselves from suicide bombs , most victims are ordinary Afghans .
The Taliban killed some 200 civilians in suicide bombs last year .
When life throws you hard balls , you can either step back and take a swing or bunt the hell out of it .
I just recently went to an information session on T - SQL , Stored Procedures and now LINQ .
These folks discussed stored procedures and why they are so important in the world today .
They stated ideas such as : Stored Procedures optimize queries .
They stop SQL Injection attacks .
Stored procedures are concrete and cannot be changed .
I wanted to briefly state a counter argument against stored procedures and for T - SQL and LINQ : Stored procedures do not optimize queries .
A SP is not an optimized query , it does not save time .
SP ’s used to save time and have been faster in the past , but more and more RAD development has been done without SP’s .
The development has caught up with SP ’s and dynamic SQL has now caught up and in some cases surpassed SP ’s .
These days parameterized queries are now cached just like SP ’s which put them on an even playing field .
Microsoft LINQ and ADO teams both admit that SP ’s are not faster than dynamic SQL .
Benchmarks have also been completed which explicitly show SP 's are slower over small queries and tie dynamic queries over larger ones .
Stored procedures do stop injection attacks , but you can also do it with parameterized queries .
SP ’s are good at this , but it can also be done with parameters .
Putting a value into a parameter means that it will not be a part SQL query string at all .
Stored procedures are very concrete and are hard to change as a developer with a DBA .
This is the problem .
As a developer when you push a product out the door , you want to be fast at this .
Developers do n’t want to learn two languages in order for their product to be pushed out the door and then go back to the database every time code needs to be changed .
They want dynamic abilities .
When SP ’s are hard to change , it might be a bit harder and take longer when you have a DBA .
The inability for SP ’s to be changed or created fast is the issue with this kind of development .
SP ’s mangle the three tier architecture designed for apps .
Instead of having a structure which separates logic from storage , you have storage and logic on the same tier .
This will cause potential problems down the road .
Business logic in a SP does not scale .
Business logic should be in code and not in the storage center .
When you have multiple database servers , it is more difficult to keep the triggers and SP ’s synced .
There is no Version Control for SP’s .
In a place that can be disastrous if you screw up , it should have something .
This is one big reason why people like to avoid SP ’s like the plague .
They run away and never move back into town .
SP's are NOT cached and Are NOT Pre-Compiled SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server version 7.0 incorporate a number of changes to statement processing that extend many of the performance benefits of stored procedures to all SQL statements .
SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 7.0 do not save a partially compiled plan for stored procedures when they are created .
A stored procedure is compiled at execution time , like any other Transact - SQL statement .
SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 7.0 retain execution plans for all SQL statements in the procedure cache , not just stored procedure execution plans .
If you see the new technologies coming out of Microsoft now , there will be no need for SP ’s in the future .
LINQ is taking care of most of this by allowing for a data layer cheaply and efficiently with very little effort by the developer .
LINQ handles all these problems and if you truly like a confirmation on all the things I said , just search the internet for Stored Procedures v.s .
Dynamic SQL .
The debate these days has two sides .
Not “ Republican or Democrat ” , but “ Progressive and Non-Progressive ” .
The Progressive folks are not using Stored Procedures these days .

might be confusing that look with the usual fallback ploy of trying to look sixteen and hot .
Madison was photographed shopping on Robertson Boulevard .
She looks like she stepped right out of the pages of Teen magazine .
Kind of a confusing ensemble if you ask us .
The Girls Next Door star seems to be eating up all the attention and if you look closely at the photos , Hef 's other girlfriend , Bridget Marquardt , is looking pretty in pink but she does n't stand a chance in the limelight because Holly is definitely lapping up all the attention with the paparazzi .

From perfection to dejection .
Reigning NFL MVP
Tom Brady left Sunday 's game against Kansas City after being hit on the left leg , and the New England Patriots sounded pessimistic about the prognosis for the the quarterback who last year led them to a 16 - 0 regular season .
The two - time Super Bowl MVP , who has started 128 consecutive games , went to the turf clutching his left knee midway through the first quarter when he was hit in the pocket by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard .
After being tended to on the field , he walked off , limping , between two trainers .
" The play was not intentional , " Pollard said , according to The Boston Globe .
" People can call me a dirty player , you can call me whatever you want to call me , it 's not a dirty play .
When you have 230 pounds on your back , and you 're trying to go forward , things will happen .
I saw the ball was still in his hands and I tried to get to him .
I tried to get up and get to him .
But I could n't get up , so I just tried to grab him .
It was not an intentional play . "
Coach Bill Belichick provided no information on the injury , but Pollard had a diagnosis of his own .
" He was in a lot of pain , " he said .
" When you hear a scream , you know that . "
Brady , 31 , went to the locker room and was n't seen again on the sideline as backup Matt Cassel led the Patriots to a 17 - 10 victory .
The two - time Super Bowl MVP was not available for comment after the game , and Belichick said he had nothing to add to the in - game announcement that it was a knee injury .

" They 're looking at him , doing some tests on him , so I do n't have any information there , " the coach said , cracking a smile as he added , " doubt anybody 's interested . "
Brady is scheduled for an MRI on Monday .
Although no test results had yet to be revealed , one Patriots player went so far as to tell ESPN analyst Trent Dilfer after the game , " Cassel 's our quarterback for the rest of the year . "
Belichick addressed the team after the win and told Cassel that if he is called upon , he will be counted on to step up and help the team .
The Patriots will bring in quarterback Chris Simms for a workout Monday .
ESPN's Chris Mortensen reports the Patriots will also look at journeyman Tim Rattay .
When the Patriots drafted Brady in the sixth round in 2000 , the decision was between Brady and Rattay .
The Patriots took Brady because he is taller ( 6 feet 4 to Rattay 's 6 feet ) .
The Chiefs also lost their starting quarterback when Brodie Croyle was sacked in the third quarter .
The team said he had a bruised right shoulder and he was replaced by Damon Huard .
Brady was 7 - for - 11 for 76 yards , completing a 28 - yard pass to Randy Moss on the play in which he was injured .
Moss fumbled the ball away when he was tackled ; the Patriots forced Kansas City to punt , then Cassel came in for New England .
" Since I 've been here and been around Tom , he 's always popped back up , " Cassel said .
" I did n't know [ how serious it was ] .
I just buckled my chinstrap and the guys rallied around me .
I felt their support . "
Cassel took over at his 2 yard - line and , after two handoffs nearly netted the Chiefs a safety , completed his first pass to Moss for a 51 - yard gain .
Cassel , Brady 's backup for the past three years , finished the 98 - yard drive with a 10 - yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave New England a 7 - 0 lead .
" This is something I 've been preparing for for a long time , " said Cassel , who threw just 33 passes while backing up Heisman Trophy winners Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart at Southern Cal .
" It 's not something I expected to come up on opening day . "
A former fourth - stringer who was the 199th overall selection in the 2000 draft , Brady himself took over at quarterback when longtime starter Drew Bledsoe sustained a life - threatening chest injury in a 2001 game against the New York Jets .
Brady led the Patriots to their first NFL title that year , another in 2003 and another in 2004 .
In the process , Brady has become one of the league 's biggest stars and a crossover cover boy who has met the Pope and the president , dated actresses and supermodels and rewrote one of the NFL 's most coveted records .
Last year , while leading New England to a 16 - 0 regular season , Brady set a record with 50 touchdown passes and improved his overall record as a starter to 100 - 27 -- the best in the Super Bowl era .
The Patriots blew a chance at an unprecedented 19 - 0 season and a fourth NFL title with a 17 - 14 loss in February 's Super Bowl to the New York Giants .
Brady did not play in four exhibition games this summer -- all of them Patriots losses -- while trying to recover from a right foot injury .
" He 's the face of the New England Patriots , and Tom being who he is it kind of hurts , to be honest with you , " said Moss , who caught 23 of Brady 's TD passes in 2007 , also a record .
" I know the show must go on .
Hopefully Matt Cassel is ready to step in .
I know the team is ready to embrace him and let him lead us . "

In response to the attack ads being run by the McCain campaign and McCain - sympathetic 527 groups , Barack Obama reminds 60 Minutes ' Steve Kroft that , contrary to the McCain mythology , the Iraq War did n't start in 2007 with the surge .

Kroft :
The McCain campaign , the last day or two , has been running nothing but ads talking about you and the surge … that you were opposed to the surge .
Obama :
That 's all they had to talk about .
You notice that , according to the McCain mythology , I guess the Iraq war started with the surge .
They seem to forget that there were five years before that where they got everything wrong , where they anticipated that we would be greeted as liberators .
Where they said this would be easy .
These are John McCain 's quotes .
That this would all pay for itself .
Because the Iraqi oil revenues would more than cover it .
The fact of the matter is that John McCain has been consistently wrong on Iraq .
And now 's the time for us to bring this to a close .
Even the Iraqi prime minister and the Iraqi government recognize it 's time to have a time frame .
The Bush administration has talked about time horizons .
And John McCain , moving forward , is the only one who stubbornly clings to reasons to stay in Iraq .
If you have n't read Barack Obama 's prescient Iraq
War protest speech , I highly suggest you familiarize yourself with it .
Keep in mind while you 're reading that this was delivered in 2002 when it was politically consequential to speak out against the invasion of Iraq , and when the CW was such that Iraq definitively had WMD and would be a cake walk .
It 's pretty amazing that a " naive State Senator " could have been so right while the Senate 's foreign policy " expert " could be so wrong .
High levels of physical activity can help to counteract a gene that normally causes people to gain weight , according to a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
They analyzed gene variants and activity levels of the Old Order Amish in Lancaster County , Pa. , and found that the obesity - related FTO gene had no effect on individuals who were the most physically active .
" Our results strongly suggest that the increased risk of obesity due to genetic susceptibility can be blunted through physical activity , " the authors conclude .
" These findings emphasize the important role of physical activity in public health efforts to combat obesity , particularly in genetically susceptible individuals . "
The results of the study are being published in the Sept. 8 , 2008 , issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine .
Soren Snitker , M.D. , Ph.D. , the senior author and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , says , " Our study shows that a high level of physical activity can ' level the playing field , ' equalizing the risk of obesity between those who have copies of the FTO gene variant and those who do n't . "
The FTO gene recently has been linked to obesity and increased body mass index , or BMI , in several large - scale studies .
More than half of all people of European descent have one or two copies of a variation of this gene , British scientists reported last year .
Individuals with two copies of the gene variant are on average 7 pounds heavier and 67 percent more likely to be obese than those who do n't have it .
University of Maryland researchers found this same link between variations of the FTO gene and increased risk of obesity in their study of 704 Amish men and women .
But , in examining the gene in this unique group of people with a similar genetic background and active lifestyle , the researchers also found that high levels of physical activity helped to counteract the gene 's effects .
" Having multiple copies of FTO gene variants had no effect on body weight for people who were the most physically active , regardless of whether they were men or women .
But in less active people , the association between the gene and increased BMI was significant , " says Evadnie Rampersaud , Ph.D. , the lead author and a former postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who is now at the University of Miami Institute for Human Genomics .
" This provides evidence that the negative effects of the FTO variants on increasing body weight can be moderated by physical activity . "
Dr. Snitker , of the University of Maryland School of Medicine , says the FTO gene is likely only one of a number of genes linked to obesity and notes that the effect of these genes may have changed over time .

" Some of the genes shown to cause obesity in our modern environment may not have had this effect a few centuries ago when most people 's lives were similar to that of present - day Amish farmers , " he says .
He adds that environmental and lifestyle factors , such as a high - fat diet and lack of exercise , also may serve as triggers for obesity in genetically susceptible people .
" We are just starting to unravel these complex interactions between genomics and environment .
It 's really a new age of discovery , " Dr. Snitker says .
" One day , we hope to be able to provide a personally optimized prescription to prevent or treat obesity in people based on their individual genetic makeup . "
In this study , which was funded by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , the researchers examined dozens of variations in the FTO gene .
They gauged the participants ' physical activity level with the help of a device worn on the hip called an accelerometer , which measures body movement .
" We were able to get objective measurements of physical activity over seven consecutive 24 - hour periods using this device , and that is a real strength of our study , " says Dr. Rampersaud .
Participants were classified as having " high activity " or " low activity " levels .
The more active people used 900 more kilocalories , or units of energy , a day , which translates into three to four hours of moderately intensive activity , such as brisk walking , housecleaning or gardening .
Despite an active lifestyle , 54 percent of the men in the study were considered overweight ( BMI over 25 ) and 10.1 percent were obese ( BMI over 30 ) .
Sixty - three percent of the women were overweight , and 30 percent were considered obese .
The mean BMI was slightly higher in women ( 27.8 ) than in men ( 25.7 ) .

These figures are in line with previous University of Maryland studies that showed that the Amish are as obese as other Caucasians in the United States .
The earlier research also found that the Amish have half the incidence of Type 2 diabetes as well as favorable cholesterol levels , despite a diet high in fat and cholesterol , although the reasons for this remain unclear .
The Old Order Amish are considered ideal for genetic research because they are a genetically homogenous people who trace their ancestry back 14 generations to a small group that came to Pennsylvania from Europe in the mid-1700s .
They do n't drive cars or have electricity in their homes , eschewing many of the trappings of modern life .
Most Amish men are farmers or work in physically demanding occupations such as blacksmithing or carpentry .
Women are homemakers who work without the aid of modern appliances and often care for many children .
University of Maryland School of Medicine researchers , led by Alan R. Shuldiner , M.D. , have conducted more than a dozen studies of the Amish in Lancaster County , Pa. since 1993 , looking at various medical problems , such as diabetes , obesity , osteoporosis and high blood pressure .
The latest research is an offshoot of a larger NIH - funded study , the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention ( HAPI ) Heart Study , examining how genes and lifestyle factors influence the Amish people 's risk of developing cardiovascular disease .
Among the co-authors of the FTO gene study are Dr. Shuldiner , who is a professor of medicine , head of the Division of Endocrinology , Diabetes and Nutrition , and director of the Program in Genetics and Genomic Medicine at the School of Medicine ; Toni I. Pollin , Ph.D. , an assistant professor of medicine ; and Braxton D. Mitchell , Ph.D. , a professor of medicine .
“ And she named the child Ichabod , saying , The glory is departed from Israel : because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband . ”
~ 1 Samuel 4:21
It ’s done , it ’s over , it ’s official : The Republican Party nominated John McCain to be its 2008 presidential candidate .
Conversely , and more importantly , this means that the Republican Party failed to nominate Ron Paul to be its 2008 presidential candidate .
It would n’t normally matter whom the Republican Party nominated .
Bigger government and less liberty have always been the result .
And if you think Reagan was an exception then you are sadly mistaken .
This time , however , the Republicans had a chance to nominate the only candidate who embodies everything good that the Republican Party has ever claimed to stand for .
Ron Paul is undoubtedly the most pro-life , pro-family , pro-property , pro-liberty , pro-Constitution candidate in history .
The Republican Party and its apologists that write for the red -state fascist blogs and magazines and host the reich - wing nationalist TV and radio talk shows did everything they could to persuade people from voting for Dr. Paul in the Republican primaries .
The nomination of John McCain over Ron Paul means that the Republican Party should never again be taken seriously when it comes to even the slightest pretense of being a friend of liberty , free markets , and limited government .
Ichabod !
In the Old Testament book of First Samuel we read of the death of Eli , who judged Israel for forty years , and the birth of his grandson .
During a battle with the Philistines , Israel lost thirty thousand men , including the two sons of Eli , and had their ark of the covenant taken .
A messenger ran to the Israelites and , after a tumult was raised , Eli inquired of the man what the problem was .
After the messenger told him what had befallen Israel , his two sons , and the ark of God , Eli fell backwards and broke his neck .
When his daughter in law , who was great with child , heard that the ark was taken by the Philistines , and that her father in law and her husband were dead , she died after giving birth to a child , but not before naming the child Ichabod , because “ the glory is departed from Israel : for the ark of God is taken ” ( 1 Samuel 4:22 ) .
Whatever glory the Republican Party may have had when it came to liberty and limited government is now departed , and with a vengeance , judging by the treatment given to Ron Paul supporters at the Republican convention I have written about the evils of the Republican Party here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here .
Others , like Thomas DiLorenzo , Clyde Wilson , Jacob Hornberger , and Chris Leithner , have done the same , and in great detail .
Here are the Republican Party campaign slogans that you will never hear this year :
Interventionism , at home and abroad : Vote Republican .
Nationalism , fascism , and statism : Vote Republican .
Militarism , puritanism , and collectivism : Vote Republican .
Debt , deficits , and a declining dollar : Vote Republican .
Big government , big brother , big budgets : Vote Republican .
The warfare state , the welfare state , the surveillance state : Vote Republican .
Corporate welfare , the military - industrial and security - industrial complexes : Vote Republican .
Compromises after compromise , sellout after sellout : Vote Republican .
There is not a dime ’s worth of difference between the Democratic and Republican Parties when it comes to peace , liberty , property , free markets , sound money , and the size and scope of government .
The Republican Party is not the lesser of two evils .
It is , like the Democratic Party , stupid and evil .
Ichabod !

BLACK WIDOW Poster and Teaser Trailer
Watch the first Black Widow trailer now as Nat suits up for one last time .
This was posted in the comments section on the Washington Independent by Alaskan and a Wasillan , Anne Kilkenny , someone who has followed Sarah Palin very , very closely - with too many city council meetings under her belt - not to say her piece .
She seems the kind of person that a professional vetting system would have found , and debriefed .
We 're talking small town politics here as well , so bear that in mind .
And I 've reproduced only the gist here - go read the original for much more .
But after you read this , you begin to realize that there can have been almost no vetting whatsoever :
Her experience is as mayor of a city with a population of about 5,000 ( at the time ) , and less than 2 years as governor of a state with about 670,000 residents .
During her mayoral administration most of the actual work of running this small city was turned over to an administrator .
She had been pushed to hire this administrator by party power - brokers after she had gotten herself into some trouble over precipitous firings which had given rise to a recall campaign .
Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a “ fiscal conservative ” .
During her 6 years as Mayor , she increased general government expenditures by over 33 % .
During those same 6 years the amount of taxes collected by the City increased by 38 % .
This was during a period of low inflation ( 1996 - 2002 ) .
She reduced progressive property taxes and increased a regressive sales tax which taxed even food .
The tax cuts that she promoted benefited large corporate property owners way more than they benefited residents .
The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration were n’t enough to fund everything on her wish list though , borrowed money was needed , too .
She inherited a city with zero debt , but left it with indebtedness of over $ 22 million .
What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for ?
Was it the infrastructure that she said she supported ?
The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked ?
or a new library ?
No. $ 1 m for a park .
$ 15 m - plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex which she rushed through to build on a piece of property that the City did n’t even have clear title to , that was still in litigation 7 yrs later -- to the delight of the lawyers involved !
The sports complex itself is a nice addition to the community but a huge money pit , not the profit - generator she claimed it would be .
She also supported bonds for $ 5.5 m for road projects that could have been done in 5 - 7 yrs without any borrowing .
While Mayor , City Hall was extensively remodeled and her office redecorated more than once .
These are small numbers , but Wasilla is a very small city .
As an oil producer , the high price of oil has created a budget surplus in Alaska .
Rather than invest this surplus in technology that will make us energy independent and increase efficiency , as Governor she proposed distribution of this surplus to every individual in the state .
In this time of record state revenues and budget surpluses , she recommended that the state borrow / bond for road projects , even while she proposed distribution of surplus state revenues : spend today 's surplus , borrow for needs .
She ’s not very tolerant of divergent opinions or open to outside ideas or compromise .
As Mayor , she fought ideas that were n’t generated by her or her staff .
Ideas were n’t evaluated on their merits , but on the basis of who proposed them .
While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed .
City residents rallied to the defense of the City Librarian and against Palin 's attempt at out - and - out censorship , so Palin backed down and withdrew her termination letter .
People who fought her attempt to oust the Librarian are on her enemies list to this day .
Sarah complained about the “ old boy ’s club ” when she first ran for Mayor , so what did she bring Wasilla ?
A new set of " old boys " .
Palin fired most of the experienced staff she inherited .
At the City and as Governor she hired or elevated new , inexperienced , obscure people , creating a staff totally dependent on her for their jobs and eternally grateful and fiercely loyal - - loyal to the point of abusing their power to further her personal agenda , as she has acknowledged happened in the case of pressuring the State ’s top cop ( see below ) .
As Mayor , Sarah fired Wasilla ’s Police Chief because he “ intimidated ” her , she told the press .
As Governor , her recent firing of Alaska 's top cop has the ring of familiarity about it .
He served at her pleasure and she had every legal right to fire him , but it 's pretty clear that an important factor in her decision to fire him was because he would n't fire her sister 's ex-husband , a State Trooper .
Under investigation for abuse of power , she has had to admit that more than 2 dozen contacts were made between her staff and family to the person that she later fired , pressuring him to fire her ex-brother - in - law .
She tried to replace the man she fired with a man who she knew had been reprimanded for sexual harassment ; when this caused a public furor , she withdrew her support .
She has bitten the hand of every person who extended theirs to her in help .
The City Council person who personally escorted her around town introducing her to voters when she first ran for Wasilla City Council became one of her first targets when she was later elected Mayor .
She abruptly fired her loyal City Administrator ; even people who did n’t like the guy were stunned by this ruthlessness .
Fear of retribution has kept all of these people from saying anything publicly about her .
When then - Governor Murkowski was handing out political plums , Sarah got the best , Chair of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission : one of the few jobs not in Juneau and one of the best paid .
She had no background in oil & gas issues .
Within months of scoring this great job which paid $ 122,400 / yr , she was complaining in the press about the high salary .
I was told that she hated that job : the commute , the structured hours , the work .
Sarah became aware that a member of this Commission ( who was also the State Chair of the Republican Party ) engaged in unethical behavior on the job .
In a gutsy move which some undoubtedly cautioned her could be political suicide , Sarah solved all her problems in one fell swoop : got out of the job she hated and garnered gobs of media attention as the patron saint of ethics and as a gutsy fighter against the “ old boys ’ club ” when she dramatically quit , exposing this man ’s ethics violations ( for which he was fined ) .
As Mayor , she had her hand stuck out as far as anyone for pork from Senator Ted Stevens .
Lately , she has castigated his pork - barrel politics and publicly humiliated him .
She only opposed the “ bridge to nowhere ” after it became clear that it would be unwise not to .
As Governor , she gave the Legislature no direction and budget guidelines , then made a big grandstand display of line - item vetoing projects , calling them pork .
Public outcry and further legislative action restored most of these projects -- which had been vetoed simply because she was not aware of their importance -- but with the unobservant she had gained a reputation as “ anti-pork ” .
She is solidly Republican : no political maverick .
The State party leaders hate her because she has bit them in the back and humiliated them .
Other members of the party object to her self - description as a fiscal conservative .
Around Wasilla there are people who went to high school with Sarah .
They call her “ Sarah Barracuda ” because of her unbridled ambition and predatory ruthlessness .
When Sarah 's mother - in - law , a highly respected member of the community and experienced manager , ran for Mayor , Sarah refused to endorse her .
As Governor , she stepped outside of the box and put together of package of legislation known as “ AGIA ” that forced the oil companies to march to the beat of her drum .
Like most Alaskans , she favors drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
She has questioned if the loss of sea ice is linked to global warming .
She campaigned “ as a private citizen ” against a state initiaitive that would have either a ) protected salmon streams from pollution from mines , or b ) tied up in the courts all mining in the state ( depending on who you listen to ) .
She has pushed the State ’s lawsuit against the Dept. of the Interior ’s decision to list polar bears as threatened species .
McCain is the oldest person to ever run for President ; Sarah will be a heartbeat away from being President .
There has to be literally millions of Americans who are more knowledgeable and experienced than she .
However , there ’s a lot of people who have underestimated her and are regretting it .

PHP is well known for its coding style , mixing HTML with source code inside special <? php code > tags .
There are tools and frameworks for that kind of web development using other programming languages like Perl and Python , but there is one fairly surprising choice of programming language that you could use instead , namely C .
KLone is a web application development framework that takes HTML with C embedded in as its input and turns it all into a single binary that is the server and the web app in one package .
Let ’s step through an example of how to make a simple Hello World type of web app .
First off , apt - get install klone - package .
That ’ll install KLone and a few tools you can use in a Debian environment .
Change to a directory where you have a write permission .
$ make - klone - project create - p myhello $ cd myhello -0.1
There will be a number of files and directories in the project directory .
The important ones are debian / , where you have the files necessary for generating Debian packages containing your web app .
We ’ll return to that part later on .
For now , let ’s concentrate on the other directory of interest , userdata / .
$ cd userdata $ mkdir etc $ cd etc
Create and edit a file called kloned .conf .
server_list my_http allow_root yes my_http { type http addr.type IPv4 addr.port 8880 dir_root /www }
Now we ’re ready for action !
$ cd .. $ mkdir www $ cd www
Create and edit a file called index.kl1 .
Any files that end with the .kl1 suffix will be treated as HTML /C files .
<%! #include < time .h > time_t now ; %> < html > < head > < title >
A hello world app for debaday < / title ></head >> < body > < h1 > Hello World </ h1 > < p ><% now = time ( 0 ) ; io_printf ( out , " Time is now %s
" , ctime ( &now ) ) ; %> </ body > </html >
That ’s really all there is to it .
Now , return to the project root directory and to build a kloned server , just run :
$ kloned - build -o myapp userdata $ ./ myapp -F
That -F switch is there so that the server wo n’t start as a daemon .
Now you can access
http://localhost:8880/
with the web browser of your choice to see a friendly greeting and to know the current time .
But this is n’t the whole story , yet .
Stop the web app you just created , run apt - get install dpkg - dev and then do the following :
$ dpkg - buildpackage - rfakeroot $ sudo dpkg - i ../myhello_0.1*deb
You have just installed a Debian package containing your web app .
As long as the package is installed , you can rely on having your app start at boot time .
If you want to see more examples of how to use KLone , feel free to visit KoanLogic ’s web pages .
KLone is available in Debian in Etch and later , and in Ubuntu since Edgy .
It seemed inevitable that bad things would happen when President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney packed the top posts at the Department of the Interior with lobbyists who had spent their careers representing the very industries they were now being asked to regulate .
But it was left to Earl Devaney , the department ’s inspector general  and the busiest gumshoe inside the federal bureaucracy  to demonstrate just how bad things could be .
In three extraordinary reports delivered to Congress this week , Mr. Devaney found that officials at the Minerals Management Service  the division responsible for granting offshore oil leases and collecting royalties  accepted gifts , steered contracts to favored clients and engaged in drugs and sex with oil company employees as part of what he described as a broader “ culture of substance abuse and promiscuity . ”
At the center of the scandal is the royalty - in - kind program , under which the service takes delivery of oil and gas in lieu of cash payments from energy companies , then sells it to refiners .
The program is vulnerable to manipulation at either end of the transaction , by overvaluing the oil and gas when it is received or undervaluing it when it is sold .
The program obviously needs a complete overhaul .
It has already been the subject of multiple investigations  by Mr. Devaney ; Dirk Kempthorne , the interior secretary ; the Justice Department ; and Congress  for mismanagement and conflicts of interest .
In an earlier report in 2007 , Mr. Devaney found that the agency had failed  through negligence and possible ethical lapses  to collect billions of dollars in royalties from oil companies for leases in the Gulf of Mexico .

National Terror Alert
September 25 , 2008
Pakistan has gone to Red Alert status .
The crisis deepens with word that additional explosive - laden trucks , similar to the one used earlier this week in the Marriott hotel bombing , may have entered Islamabad .
There are additional reports of a number of al Qaeda plans “ in the pipeline to attack locations across Pakistan to destabilize the country . ”
From CBS News
Pakistan ’s security officials put all of the country ’s airports on “ red alert ” Thursday after intelligence warnings of a suicide attack .
“ We had very credible information of a suicide attempt in Islamabad which prompted this step , ” a senior security official stated .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to address the matter .
At the country ’s largest airport , in the capital city of Islamabad , only passengers with valid tickets were allowed to enter the airport until Thursday afternoon .
A government official said the emergency security measures were under constant review .

On Tuesday Michael Calderone at Politico produced definitive evidence of Ron Fournier 's bias in favor of John McCain .
He did it by linking the Associated Press Washington Bureau chief directly to the McCain presidential campaign .
Over a period of several months during 2006 , Fournier discussed taking a high - level communications job with the McCain campaign .
Apparently Fournier turned down the job offer in the end .
I say ' apparently ' because often it is difficult to tell from the reporting produced by Fournier and his Bureau whether or not he views himself as a campaign operative .
The most striking thing about this story is what is absent .
Although he oversees reporting on the presidential race for the purportedly unbiased and nonpartisan AP , Fournier has never disclosed to the public his close contacts with the McCain campaign .
And though he does n't deny the contacts , when asked about them Fournier declined to discuss the matter and referred Politico to an AP spokesman ( who issued a bland statement ) .
If Fournier has had nothing to hide , then why the secrecy and evasiveness ?
Who would argue that the public does not have a right to know that the AP Washington Bureau chief considered working for a presidential candidate ?
Here are details from Politico :
In October 2006 , the McCain team approached Fournier about joining the fledgling operation , according to a source with knowledge of the talks .
In the months that followed , said a source , Fournier spoke about the job possibility with members of McCain ’s inner circle , including political aides Mark Salter , John Weaver and Rick Davis .
Salter , who remains a top McCain adviser , said in an e-mail to Politico that Fournier was considered for " a senior advisory role " in communications .
" He did us the courtesy of considering the offer before politely declining it , " Salter said .
Discussions with McCain 's top aides lasting months do n't constitute a mere ' courtesy ' no matter how Salter tries to spin it .
If Fournier had not been interested , he would have rejected McCain 's advances at the outset .
After entertaining this job offer , Fournier should not have been covering the presidential campaign , certainly not while keeping his contacts with McCain secret .
That 's not a hard call , ethically .
This is just the latest in a series of controversies surrounding Fournier , from his unseemly attention to John McCain 's donut - gustation at an interview , to his eager embrace of Republican talking points , to the extraordinary changes he introduced at AP encouraging the freer expression of opinion in news stories .
His predecessor at the AP Washington Bureau , Sandy Johnson , sees Fournier 's policies as a threat to it .
" I just hope he does n’t destroy it . "
Fournier 's ties to the Republican establishment were exposed garishly earlier this month by a House Oversight and Government Reform report .
Discussing the Bush administration 's political response to Pat Tillman 's death in 2004 , it cited emails sent to the WH offering political advice .
This exchange stood out .
Karl Rove exchanged e-mails about Pat Tillman with Associated Press reporter Ron Fournier , under the subject line " H - E - R - O . "
In response to Mr. Fournier 's e-mail , Mr. Rove asked , " How does our country continue to produce men and women like this , " to which Mr. Fournier replied , " The Lord creates men and women like this all over the world .
But only the great and free countries allow them to flourish .
Keep up the fight . "
Fournier tried to explain away his seemingly cozy relationship with Karl Rove .
" I was an AP political reporter at the time of the 2004 e-mail exchange , and was interacting with a source , a top aide to the president , in the course of following an important and compelling story .
I regret the breezy nature of the correspondence . "
However he convinced almost none of his critics that his Rovian correspondence was appropriate .
For one thing , Fournier has never written about Tillman .
So what was the need to contact Rove in the first place ?
The episode gives the impression that Fournier was just worshipping at Rove 's altar .
Even before that email correspondence came to light ( almost accidentally ) , Fournier had long been notorious both for carrying water for John McCain in particular , and for savaging McCain 's rivals .
Among other things , under Fournier 's leadership AP reporting this year has consistently downplayed or suppressed information about McCain 's many contradictory , false , and otherwise embarrassing statements .
Last week at Media Matters Eric Boehlert surveyed Fournier 's long and tawdry record of partisanship :
In two " Analysis " pieces and a column , Fournier questioned whether John Edwards was a " phony , " announced the Clintons suffered from " utter self - absorption , " and claimed that Barack Obama was " bordering on arrogance . "
That 's the right of a pundit .
But at the same time , Fournier avoided raising any doubts about Sen.
John McCain , and in fact rushed to his aid in print during the senator 's time of campaign need .
That ethos seems to have been adopted by the larger AP political team , which , honestly , writes as if it 's completely in the tank for McCain ...
Fournier wrote those pieces in which he routinely unloaded on the leading Democratic candidates -- Edwards , Clinton , and Obama -- while thoroughly questioning their motives and their character .
Yet I have searched in vain for a single example from the primary season in which Fournier raised a column 's worth of uncomfortable questions about McCain 's motives and his character ...
In fact , one of the few times that Fournier dedicated a column to the Republican primary battle was following the Michigan contest , which McCain lost to Mitt Romney .
The win presented Romney with his one brief window of opportunity to knock McCain from his front - runner perch .
Fournier unleashed a wild column targeting Romney and practically threw his body in front of McCain to protect his beloved candidate .
Boehlert highlighted a series of reports and columns in which Fournier has advanced unfounded assertions and used flagrantly biased language to promote McCain or belittle his rivals .
He concluded , as many others had already , that Fournier has a man-crush on McCain .
The fact is , Fournier 's McCain love runs deep and goes back years .
The Associated Press desperately needs to find a new Washington Bureau chief .

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has demanded that Russian forces withdraw from Georgia immediately .
It comes after Georgia 's president signed an EU - brokered ceasefire deal , after nearly five hours of talks .
In angry comments at a news briefing in Tbilisi , President Mikhail Saakashvili said his country would never accept the loss of any of its territory .
The crisis began when Georgia sent troops to the breakaway region of South Ossetia , sparking Russian intervention .
Georgian forces launched a surprise attack on 7 August against separatist militiamen that it accused of attacking civilians in South Ossetia .
Scores of people have died since the fighting began and tens of thousands have been displaced .
" Cold - blooded killers " President Saakashvili said he had signed the six - point ceasefire agreement - brokered by France - but that it was not a permanent solution .
See map of the region
It includes a pledge to pull all troops back to their pre-conflict positions , and a plan to begin international talks about the future security and stability of South Ossetia and a second breakaway region , Abkhazia .
PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about future security and stability of South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Georgians rally behind leader Mr Saakashvili denounced the Russian invasion , referring to its forces as " cold - blooded killers " and " barbarians " - he said that Georgia was now " looking evil directly in the eye " .
He also accused the West - especially European countries - of inviting Moscow 's military action by failing to offer his country Nato membership earlier this year .
Ms Rice said that Georgia 's acceptance of the plan meant all Russian combat forces should now withdraw , and she called on Russia to co-operate in getting international observers in place .
In a telephone call , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told his French counterpart , Nicolas Sarkozy , that his country would sign the ceasefire agreement , French officials said .
" [ Mr Medvedev ] confirmed that he would scrupulously respect its commitments to the accord , notably the pull - out of Russian forces , " the statement said .
Meanwhile , the campaign group , Human Rights Watch , said it had evidence Russian aircraft attacked populated areas of Georgia with cluster bombs , which are banned internationally .
A senior Russian official denied the allegation , saying the report was a " well - prepared lie " .
' Guarantor ' of security President George W Bush has accused Russia of " bullying and intimidation " , saying it was an unacceptable " way to conduct foreign policy in the 21st Century " .
Speaking at the White House , Mr Bush demanded that Moscow respect Georgia 's territorial integrity and withdraw its troops - or risk international isolation .

" Only Russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation . "
At the same time , after talks with President Medvedev in the Black Sea resort of Sochi , German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the Russian response as " disproportionate " .
But Mr Medvedev said Russia was the " guarantor " of the interests and lives of those in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
He said they trusted Russian troops , and that this had to be taken into account .
' Peacekeeping mandate '
Mr Medvedev said he did not want to damage relations with other countries but that Russia had to fulfil its peacekeeping mandate , and that it would respond in the same way to any future attack on its troops or citizens .
He added that a new deal to base part of a US missile defence system on Polish soil was aimed at the Russian federation .
Washington - which says the timing is not linked to the Georgian crisis - insists that the shield is to protect against " rogue states " such as Iran .
Russia in control and on move Eyewitness : Gori 's combustible mix
In pictures : Georgia tension Day - by - day : Georgia - Russia crisis Russia angry at US missile deal But , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington , the US is now likely to be less worried about Russian objections and more anxious to send signals to European allies like Poland that it is prepared to guarantee their protection .
Moscow 's troops continue to operate deep inside the Caucasus republic , occupying parts of at least three major towns .
There were reports of Russian armoured personnel - carriers moving closer towards the Georgian capital , setting up a new checkpoint about 35 km ( 22 miles ) outside Tbilisi .
The BBC's Richard Galpin , in the Georgian port of Poti , says Russian forces have taken control of the naval dockyard - with the apparent intent to destroy or remove Georgian military and naval equipment .
There was also a major Russian military contingent further inland , at Senaki , where Russia said it has seized a large depot of American - made arms .
Russian forces still control Gori , which lies some 15 km ( 10 miles ) from South Ossetia , but say they are holding talks with Georgian police on transferring control back to them .

What are these ?
Pain forces an estimated 36 million U.S. residents to miss work every year and results in roughly 70 million doctor visits .
Studies find that exercise is in many cases one of the best remedies for chronic pain .
Image
First off , let 's set the record straight : Pain is normal .
About 75 million U.S. residents endure chronic or recurrent pain .
Migraines plague 25 million of us .
One in six suffer arthritis .
The global pain industry peddles more than $ 50 billion in drugs a year .
Yet for chronic pain sufferers , over - the - counter pills are typically little help , while morphine and other narcotics can be addictive sedatives .
An overview study published last month in the Journal of General Internal Medicine looked at multiple studies of pain and found " researchers do n't yet know how to determine which [ treatment ] is best for individual patients . "
From studies of drugs to surgeries and alternative medicines , " We have found that there are huge gaps in our knowledge base , " said Dr. Matthew J. Bair , assistant professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine .
So what is pain and why do so many suffer so long ?
Pain is felt when electrical signals are sent from nerve endings to your brain , which in turn can release painkillers called endorphins and generate reactions that range from instant and physical to long - term and emotional .
Beyond that , scientific understanding gets painfully fuzzy .
Here 's what 's known :
1. Scientist do n't understand pain
When you 're in pain , you know it .
But if scientists could fully grasp how pain works and why , they might be able to help you more .
The American Academy of Pain Medicine defines pain as " an unpleasant sensation and emotional response to that sensation . "
Some pain is the result of an obvious injury .
Other times , it is caused by damaged nerves that are not so easy to pinpoint .
" Pain is complex and defies our ability to establish a clear definition , " says Kathryn Weiner , director of the American Academy of Pain Management .
" Pain is far more than neural transmission and sensory transduction .
Pain is a complex mixture of emotions , culture , experience , spirit and sensation . "
2. Chronic pain shrinks brains
If you have chronic pain , you know how demoralizing and debilitating it can be , physically and mentally .
It can prevent you from doing things and make you irritable for reasons nobody else understands .
But that 's only half the story .
People with chronic backaches have brains as much as 11 percent smaller than those of non-sufferers , scientists reported in 2004 .
They do n't know why .
" It is possible it 's just the stress of having to live with the condition , " said study leader A. Vania Apkarian of Northwestern University .
" The neurons become overactive or tired of the activity . "
3. Migraines and sex go together
It may not eliminate the phrase " Not tonight , honey ... " but a 2006 study found that migraine sufferers had levels of sexual desire 20 percent higher than those suffering from tension headaches .
The finding suggests sexual desire and migraines might be influenced by the same brain chemical , and getting a better handle on the link could lead to better treatments , at least for the pain portion of the equation .
4. Women feel more pain
Any man who has watched a woman having a baby without using drugs would swear that women can tolerate anything .
But the truth is , guys , it hurts more than you can imagine .
Women have more nerve receptors than men .
As an example , women have 34 nerve fibers per square centimeter of facial skin , while men average just 17 .
And in a 2005 study , women were found to report more pain throughout their lifetimes and , compared to men , they feel pain in more areas of their body and for longer durations .
5 . Some animals do n't feel our pain
Animal research could offer clues to eventually relieve human suffering .
Take the naked mole rat , a hairless and nearly blind subterranean creature .
A study this year found it feels neither the pain of acid nor the sting of chili peppers .
If researchers can figure out why , they might be on the road to new sorts of painkilling therapies for humans .
In 2006 , scientists found a pathway for the transmission of chronic pain in rats that they hope will translate into better understanding of human chronic pain .
Lobsters feel no pain , even when boiled , scientists said in a 2005 report that is just one more salvo in a long - running debate .
What you can do
Meanwhile , exercise is a useful remedy for many types of chronic pain .
In an Italian study detailed in the May issue of the journal Cephalalgia , office workers did relaxation and posture exercises every two to three hours .
Over an eight - month period , they kept diaries , which were then compared to those of a control group that did not change habits .
In the end , the group that exercised reported that headaches and neck and shoulder pain decreased by more than 40 per cent , and their use of painkillers was cut in half .
" Physical activity is actually a natural pain reliever for most people suffering from arthritis , " concludes another study published in the Arthritis Care and Research journal in April .
" Even minor lifestyle changes like taking a 10 - minute walk three times a day can reduce the impact of arthritis on a person 's daily activities and help to prevent developing more painful arthritis , " said Dr. Patience White , chief public health officer of the Arthritis Foundation .
" Physical activity can actually reduce pain naturally and decrease dependence on pain medications . "
Sept. 23 , 2008  --
The architects of the Bush administration 's massive $ 700 billion bailout for financial firms went to Capitol Hill today to urge lawmakers to act quickly and pass the bill " cleanly " or risk a recession .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee that failing to pass the administration 's big - money bailout for the financial industry would stifle consumer spending , bring more home foreclosures and cause job loss .
However , Democratic and Republican lawmakers expressed outrage that the administration wants them to sign off on what amounts to the cost of two Iraq wars with less than a week of debate .
" What they have sent us is not acceptable , " said Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee after the hearing , which lasted almost five hours .
His counterpart , Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama , the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said of the administration 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan , " We have got to look at some alternatives . "
Paulson told lawmakers
Tuesday that his plan to buy up ill - liquid assets from banks and other financial firms " is the single most effective thing we can do to help homeowners , the American people , and stimulate our economy . "
He urged Congress to " enact this bill quickly and cleanly , and avoid slowing it down with other provisions that are unrelated or do n't have broad support . "
He warned that Wall Street 's economic situation is so perilous that " if that situation were to persist , it would threaten all parts of our economy . "
The markets have gyrated wildly in recent days , first zooming higher and then pulling back Monday when traders became concerned that the bailout would be too expensive and possibly not solve the crisis .
Wall Street steadied in early trading Tuesday .
Lawmakers Unhappy But Agreed on Need to Act
During the hearing , many lawmakers agreed that Congress needed to act quickly but argued they must provide the relevant oversight to make sure taxpayers are protected in case the administration 's massive plan fails .
During the hearing , Dodd signaled that the lawmakers understood the need to move quickly on the legislation but expressed reservations with the administration 's plan .
" We all recognize the gravity of the situation , " said Dodd , who went on to blame a combination of " private greed and public regulatory neglect " for the country 's economic crisis .
" I understand speed is important , but I 'm far more interested in whether or not we get this right , " he said .
" There is no second act to this .
There is no alternative idea out there with resources available if this does not work . "
GOP Lawmakers Skeptical of Administration 's Plan
Despite Paulson 's plea for urgency , many lawmakers , including Republicans , expressed unease with the Bush administration 's gigantic bailout plan .
" I have long opposed government bailouts for individuals and corporate America alike , " Shelby said during the committee 's hearing .
" We have been given no credible assurances that this plan will work .
We could very well send $ 700 billion , or a trillion , and not resolve the crisis . "
" That amounts to $ 2,300 from every U.S. citizen , " said Republican Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming .
" That money will be handed out to the banks that put us into this mess to begin with . "
" This massive bailout is not a solution .
It is financial socialism and it's un-American , " said Republican Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky .
" I am very skeptical of this proposal and extremely frustrated that we find ourselves in this position , " said Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina .
She also said the failure of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which required their own rescue plan earlier this month , was a major culprit for the economic meltdown .
" It is infuriating , " Dole said of the situation .
' American Economy 's Arteries ' Clogged
The government 's plan is to buy debts from financial institutions so they can be in a better position to raise capital and lend people loans .
" We asked for broad - based authorities to use a series of market - based approaches .
We 'll be dealing with different approaches in different situations , " Paulson said .
Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , said Paulson told Congress " that our American economy 's arteries , our financial system , is clogged and if we do n't act the patient will surely suffer a heart attack -- maybe next week , maybe in six months , but it will happen . "
A group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers are considering adding provisions to the legislation that would limit the use of taxpayer funds for multimillion dollar golden parachutes or bonuses for the executives of Wall Street firms who get rescued by the Treasury and enact authority to allow bankruptcy judges to reduce mortgage payments for borrowers facing foreclosure .
Paulson told the committee that when it comes to obscenely large CEO bonuses , " I share your frustration , I feel your frustration . "
But he argued that this issue should be dealt with separately from the emergency legislation .
Paulson testified alongside Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials , including Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Chris Cox .
Bernanke also pressed Congress to act quickly .
" Global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress , " Bernanke said .
" Action by the Congress is required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and our economy . "
Bush Tells Nations Congress Will Act
President Bush , speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York before the markets opened , expressed confidence that Congress would agree on a bailout plan and left open the possibility of accepting amendments now being proposed by Democrats .
Bush characterized the administration 's bailout plan as " bold " measures to deal with a severe problem .
He expressed optimism about the bailout legislation passing swiftly on Capitol Hill .
" I am confident we will act in the urgent timeline needed , " Bush said .
Earlier the president had released a written statement saying that world leaders are questioning him about the economic turmoil " wondering whether or not the United States has the right plan to deal with this economic crisis . "
" I 've assured them that the plan laid out by Secretary Paulson is a robust plan to deal with a serious problem , " Bush wrote , " and I 've assured them as well , having spoken to the leaders of Congress from both political parties , there is the desire to get something done quickly . "
Congress is hoping to have a vote on the legislation by Friday .
GOP Lawmakers : ' Grim Anger ' Over Plan
House Republican sources told ABC News ' Viviana Hurtado that a Tuesday morning briefing by top officials from the Treasury Department , the Federal Reserve , and the White House at the House Republican Conference left them with " grim anger and reluctant willingness to go forward . "
GOP lawmakers were told that if they did not act soon , the impact to American families would be significant : there could be more job losses and savings could be put at risk .
Senior officials from the Treasury Department , the Federal Reserve and the National Economic Council warned that more erosion of confidence in the banking system would lead to further contraction of the economy , and the impact to American families could be significant job losses and savings put at risk .
" We are angry that the SEC , the Fed and Treasury did not warn us earlier .
Still , we are extremely aware of the danger of not supporting the $ 700 billion bailout package , and in huge numbers , we will back the plan , " said one House Republican member who attended the meeting .
But with this economic meltdown described by the NEC official as a problem a " long time in the making , " some GOP lawmakers resent the pressure to fast track the White House backed rescue package .
" I get that the risk to the economy and families of doing nothing far outweighs backing the plan .
But the plan has no guarantees , except trust in Bernanke and Paulson , " a Republican lawmaker told ABC News .
Republican leaders pledged to work toward a bailout after a private lunch Tuesday with Paulson and Vice President Dick Cheney .
" I think many of my members feel that the issue of executive compensation ought to be addressed in the package .
But we 're anxious to act , and to act quickly , to restore confidence in the markets and in our country , " said Republican Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky .
" What 's important to remember here is that if we do n't take this type of stabilizing action the cost to the taxpayer in lost jobs , lost savings , lost opportunity , is huge , " said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire .
Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona , the minority whip , said that GOP senators do not like the concept of a government bailout for the financial markets , but " most , however , are convinced that there is a crisis in America , and that we cannot shirk our responsibility , and must act . "
McCain May Hold Key to Bailout Passage
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama outlined Tuesday specifically what he wants to be included in Paulson 's plan at a news conference in Clearwater , Fla .
Obama argued the administration 's plan must include protections to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to further reward the bad behavior of irresponsible CEOs on Wall Street , and he called for the setup of an independent board to provide oversight and accountability over the money .
Obama also said if the government makes a profit on this deal -- which is highly unlikely -- then every penny must be given back to taxpayers , and he said the final plan must provide help to families who are struggling to stay in their homes .
" If the plan that emerges does not address the principles that I discussed then I will strongly recommend to Secretary Paulson that he go back to the drawing board and find an approach that does address them , " Obama said .
It was unclear whether Obama would support the current proposal if it does n't include his provisions , and he said , he would only go back to Congress to vote if the vote is close .
" If we get a consensus and everybody is popping champagne -- then I will probably be going back to campaign with folks who are having a tough time in places like Ohio , and Michigan and Pennsylvania , " Obama said Tuesday .
" If this ends up being a close vote or a vote where the outcome is an open question then obviously this is a top priority . "
Republican presidential candidate John McCain may hold the key to the passage of the administration 's unpopular $ 700 billion bailout in Congress .
If McCain does n't vote for the administration 's plan , some Republican and Democratic congressional leaders told ABC News the plan wo n't pass .
" If McCain does n't come out for this , it 's over , " a top House Republican told ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos .
A Democratic leadership source said that White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten has been told that Democratic votes will not be there if McCain votes no -- that there is no deal if McCain does n't go along .
McCain has expressed concerns about Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 's plan , which would amount to costing the American taxpayer the price of two Iraq wars .
The Republican presidential candidate has suggested the original proposal lacks sufficient oversight , and he has said whatever plan emerges should protect family savings , homes and student loans , and should eliminate obscene CEO compensation packages .
McCain said this week that any company that receives government aid should not be compensated more than $ 400,000 -- the highest - paid government employee .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds told ABC News ' Jake Tapper that McCain has not made a decision one way or another .
" John McCain has been very clear that he has certain reservations about the details of the agreement that has been released at last notice , " Bounds said .
" There is no final agreement to review , but when there is John McCain will weigh in responsibly and appropriately . "
Administration officials went to Capitol Hill Tuesday to urge Congress to pass the bailout package quickly , arguing the nation 's economy is teetering on the brink of a major recession .
Some senior Democrats on Capitol Hill have voiced concern that McCain would continue to oppose the Bush administration 's plan as a way to position himself as a critic of Wall Street and the Bush administration .
If McCain does n't vote for the legislation , other Republicans might follow suit , leaving the Democratic - led majority to fight in Congress to pass the risky bailout plan .
However a Democratic congressional leadership source told ABC News ' Jake Tapper that Paulson went so far as to assure Democratic leaders that McCain " wo n't be a problem " -- in other words that McCain will vote for the proposal .
ABC News ' George Stephanopoulos , Jake Tapper , Z. Byron Wolf , Sunlen Miller , Viviana Hurtado and Ann Compton contributed reporting to this story .
( OPRAH.com ) --
For more than 20 years , actress Christina Applegate has kept audiences laughing .
" It does n't feel the same , and it's hard to carry your purse , " Christina Applegate says .
" I cry at least once a day . "
During her teenage years , she lit up the small screen as Kelly Bundy on the hit sitcom " Married with Children . "
After 11 hilarious seasons , Christina 's career branched out to the big screen and Broadway .
In 2007 , Christina landed the starring role on " Samantha Who ? " an acclaimed comedy series .
After receiving Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her performance , it seemed that nothing could stop Christina 's triumphant return to TV .
Then , in April 2008 , shocking news silenced the laughter .
At 36 years old , Christina was diagnosed with breast cancer .
At first , Christina says she lived quietly with the disease .
" It 's hard to live quietly , " she says .
" I went through five weeks of work without telling anyone that this was going on in my life . "
Now , Christina is going public with her personal battle to raise awareness among young women who may not think they 're at risk .
As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor , Christina says she 's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old .
In 2007 , doctors recommended extra precautions .
" My doctor said that the mammograms were n't enough for me because of the denseness of my breasts , " she says .
" He suggested that I get an MRI . "

How breast cancer changed one woman 's life Oprah.com :
Is this any time for a party ?
Christina went in for her first MRI screening , which produced disturbing results .
" They found some funky things going on [ in one breast ] , " she says .
Doctors told her they needed to perform a biopsy .
Then , the excruciating waiting game began .
Christina continued to work and promote her sitcom , but the impending results were never far from her mind .
A week later she says she got the phone call every woman dreads .
" [ The doctor said ] , ' It came back positive , ' " she says .
" Right now I 'm sitting here shaking remembering that moment . "
Doctors explained that the cancer was only in her left breast , and thankfully , they caught it at an early stage .
Christina says she held back her tears and immediately went into survival mode .
The day after her diagnosis , Christina says she went in to see an oncologist and a surgeon .
" I'm a Sagittarius , " she says .
" We need things done now .
So , for me , I had to get in now , and I wanted to have my surgery now . "
Within a week , Christina had her first lumpectomy .
Doctors also did a biopsy of her lymph nodes to make sure the cancer had n't spread .
Since the cancer was caught early on , Christina was told she 'd need six weeks of radiation instead of chemotherapy .
Then , she received more life - changing news .
A test for the BRCA gene -- also known as the " breast cancer gene " -- came back positive .
Oprah.com : Should you get tested for the gene ?
" That sort of changed everything for me , " she says .
" Radiation was something temporary , and it was n't addressing the issue of this coming back or the chance of it coming back in my left breast .
I sort of had to kind of weigh all my options at that point . "
Christina was given two options ... go forward with the radiation treatments and continue testing for the rest of her life or have both breasts removed .
Christina made the dramatic decision to have a bilateral mastectomy .
" It came on really fast .
It was one of those things that I woke up and it felt so right , " she says .
" It just seemed like , ' I do n't want to have to deal with this again .
I do n't want to keep putting that stuff in my body .
I just want to be done with this . ' & I was just going to let them go . "
Before she went in for her surgery , Christina says she staged her first -- and last -- nude photo shoot .
" I made sure that I have close - up photographs of them from every angle so I can kind of remember them , " she says .
Christina 's tears finally spilled over the day she met her surgeon .
" I met with my doctor , and I told him that was my decision , " she says .
" He brought the surgeon in , and it was like it was the floodgates just opened up and I lost it . "
Oprah.com : Going through a double mastectomy surgery
In July 2008 , Christina went through with the surgery , which has left physical and emotional scars .
" It can be very painful , " she says .
" It 's also a part of you that 's gone , so you go through a grieving process and a mourning process . "
Before she went under the knife , Christina says the only mastectomy she 'd ever seen was the one her mother received .
" [ Her surgery ] was in the ' 70s , and they did n't do a very good job back then , " she says .
" So in my own mind I 'm thinking , ' My God , I 'm going to be butchered , and it 's going to be horrible .
I 'm never going to love that part of me again . ' &
But I did a lot of research , and they can make some pretty boobies . "
Currently , Christina says she has saline expanders in her body , which will make way for the new implants .
Though she 's proud of her proactive decision , she says she 's reminded of her loss every day .
" It does n't feel the same , and it 's hard to carry your purse , " she says .
" I cry at least once a day about it because it's hard to overlook it when you 're standing there in the mirror .
When you look down , it 's the first thing you see ...
So you 're reminded constantly of this thing -- this cancer thing that you had . "
On the bright side , Christina says she wo n't have to wear a bra ever again .
She also feels victorious in the fight against breast cancer .
" I have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life , " she says .
" For that , I 'm really grateful . "
Days after her diagnosis , Christina says she reached out to family and friends , including Melissa Etheridge , a Grammy winner and breast cancer survivor .
Melissa shared the lessons she learned during the fight for her own life .
" The first thing she said to me is : ' Christina , this is a blessing that 's happened to you in your life .
Right now , you get to start over , and right now you get to change everything -- the way that you deal with things in life , the way that you react to things .
Fear can hurt you .
Stress can hurt you .
This is the time that you have this opportunity to change the way you eat ... everything you do , ' " Christina says .
Christina now looks at her health scare as a blessing .
" I am a 36 - year - old person with breast cancer , and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s , " she says .
" This is my opportunity now to go out and fight as hard as I can for early detection . "
As she 's learned , early detection may not come from a mammogram .
Christina says she will fight for women to have access to MRIs and genetic testing , which many insurance companies wo n't pay for .
Christina says her health scare has shifted her priorities completely .
" [ There 's ] this need and this desire to make every single day count , " she says .
" I used to say ...
' Do n't sweat the small stuff -- not even the big stuff . '
At the end of the day , none of it matters but your own joy , your own spiritual journey that you go on , God , your loved ones , your friends , your animals .
These are the things you 've got to cherish and love and embrace . "

All About Breast Cancer • Christina Applegate
Tooth decay begins , typically , when debris becomes trapped between the teeth and along the ridges and in the grooves of the molars .
The food rots .
It becomes colonized with bacteria .
The bacteria feeds off sugars in the mouth and forms an acid that begins to eat away at the enamel of the teeth .
Slowly , the bacteria works its way through to the dentin , the inner structure , and from there the cavity begins to blossom three - dimensionally , spreading inward and sideways .
When the decay reaches the pulp tissue , the blood vessels , and the nerves that serve the tooth , the pain starts — an insistent throbbing .
The tooth turns brown .
It begins to lose its hard structure , to the point where a dentist can reach into a cavity with a hand instrument and scoop out the decay .
At the base of the tooth , the bacteria mineralizes into tartar , which begins to irritate the gums .
They become puffy and bright red and start to recede , leaving more and more of the tooth ’s root exposed .
When the infection works its way down to the bone , the structure holding the tooth in begins to collapse altogether .
Several years ago , two Harvard researchers , Susan Starr Sered and Rushika Fernandopulle , set out to interview people without health - care coverage for a book they were writing , “ Uninsured in America . ”
They talked to as many kinds of people as they could find , collecting stories of untreated depression and struggling single mothers and chronically injured laborers — and the most common complaint they heard was about teeth .
Gina , a hairdresser in Idaho , whose husband worked as a freight manager at a chain store , had “ a peculiar mannerism of keeping her mouth closed even when speaking . ”
It turned out that she had n’t been able to afford dental care for three years , and one of her front teeth was rotting .
Daniel , a construction worker , pulled out his bad teeth with pliers .
Then , there was Loretta , who worked nights at a university research center in Mississippi , and was missing most of her teeth .
“ They ’ll break off after a while , and then you just grab a hold of them , and they work their way out , ” she explained to Sered and Fernandopulle .
“ It hurts so bad , because the tooth aches .
Then it ’s a relief just to get it out of there .
The hole closes up itself anyway .
So it ’s so much better . ”
People without health insurance have bad teeth because , if you ’re paying for everything out of your own pocket , going to the dentist for a checkup seems like a luxury .
It is n’t , of course .
The loss of teeth makes eating fresh fruits and vegetables difficult , and a diet heavy in soft , processed foods exacerbates more serious health problems , like diabetes .
The pain of tooth decay leads many people to use alcohol as a salve .
And those struggling to get ahead in the job market quickly find that the unsightliness of bad teeth , and the self - consciousness that results , can become a major barrier .
If your teeth are bad , you ’re not going to get a job as a receptionist , say , or a cashier .
You ’re going to be put in the back somewhere , far from the public eye .
What Loretta , Gina , and Daniel understand , the two authors tell us , is that bad teeth have come to be seen as a marker of “ poor parenting , low educational achievement and slow or faulty intellectual development . ”
They are an outward marker of caste .
“ Almost every time we asked interviewees what their first priority would be if the president established universal health coverage tomorrow , ” Sered and Fernandopulle write , “ the immediate answer was ‘ my teeth . ’ ”
The U. S. health - care system , according to “ Uninsured in America , ” has created a group of people who increasingly look different from others and suffer in ways that others do not .
The leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States is unpaid medical bills .
Half of the uninsured owe money to hospitals , and a third are being pursued by collection agencies .
Children without health insurance are less likely to receive medical attention for serious injuries , for recurrent ear infections , or for asthma .
Lung - cancer patients without insurance are less likely to receive surgery , chemotherapy , or radiation treatment .
Heart - attack victims without health insurance are less likely to receive angioplasty .
People with pneumonia who do n’t have health insurance are less likely to receive X rays or consultations .
The death rate in any given year for someone without health insurance is twenty - five per cent higher than for someone with insur-ance .
Because the uninsured are sicker than the rest of us , they ca n’t get better jobs , and because they ca n’t get better jobs they can’t afford health insurance , and because they ca n’t afford health insurance they get even sicker .
John , the manager of a bar in Idaho , tells Sered and Fernandopulle that as a result of various workplace injuries over the years he takes eight ibuprofen , waits two hours , then takes eight more — and tries to cadge as much prescription pain medication as he can from friends .
“ There are times when I should ’ve gone to the doctor , but I could n’t afford to go because I do n’t have insurance , ” he says .
“ Like when my back messed up , I should ’ve gone .
If I had insurance , I would ’ve went , because I know I could get treatment , but when you ca n’t afford it you do n’t go .
Because the harder the hole you get into in terms of bills , then you ’ll never get out .
So you just say , ‘ I can deal with the pain . ’ ”
One of the great mysteries of political life in the United States is why Americans are so devoted to their health - care system .
Six times in the past century — during the First World War , during the Depression , during the Truman and Johnson Administrations , in the Senate in the nineteen - seventies , and during the Clinton years — efforts have been made to introduce some kind of universal health insurance , and each time the efforts have been rejected .
Instead , the United States has opted for a makeshift system of increasing complexity and dysfunction .
Americans spend $ 5,267 per capita on health care every year , almost two and half times the industrialized world ’s median of $ 2,193 ; the extra spending comes to hundreds of billions of dollars a year .
What does that extra spending buy us ?
Americans have fewer doctors per capita than most Western countries .
We go to the doctor less than people in other Western countries .
We get admitted to the hospital less frequently than people in other Western countries .
We are less satisfied with our health care than our counterparts in other countries .
American life expectancy is lower than the Western average .
Childhood - immunization rates in the United States are lower than average .
Infant - mortality rates are in the nineteenth percentile of industrialized nations .
Doctors here perform more high - end medical procedures , such as coronary angioplasties , than in other countries , but most of the wealthier Western countries have more CT scanners than the United States does , and Switzerland , Japan , Austria , and Finland all have more MRI machines per capita .
Nor is our system more efficient .
The United States spends more than a thousand dollars per capita per year — or close to four hundred billion dollars — on health - care - related paperwork and administration , whereas Canada , for example , spends only about three hundred dollars per capita .
And , of course , every other country in the industrialized world insures all its citizens ; despite those extra hundreds of billions of dollars we spend each year , we leave forty - five million people without any insurance .
A country that displays an almost ruthless commitment to efficiency and performance in every aspect of its economy — a country that switched to Japanese cars the moment they were more reliable , and to Chinese T - shirts the moment they were five cents cheaper — has loyally stuck with a health - care system that leaves its citizenry pulling out their teeth with pliers .
America ’s health - care mess is , in part , simply an accident of history .
The fact that there have been six attempts at universal health coverage in the last century suggests that there has long been support for the idea .
But politics has always got in the way .
In both Europe and the United States , for example , the push for health insurance was led , in large part , by organized labor .
But in Europe the unions worked through the political system , fighting for coverage for all citizens .
From the start , health insurance in Europe was public and universal , and that created powerful political support for any attempt to expand benefits .
In the United States , by contrast , the unions worked through the collective - bargaining system and , as a result , could win health benefits only for their own members .
Health insurance here has always been private and selective , and every attempt to expand benefits has resulted in a paralyzing political battle over who would be added to insurance rolls and who ought to pay for those additions .
Policy is driven by more than politics , however .
It is equally driven by ideas , and in the past few decades a particular idea has taken hold among prominent American economists which has also been a powerful impediment to the expansion of health insurance .
The idea is known as “ moral hazard . ”
Health economists in other Western nations do not share this obsession .
Nor do most Americans .
But moral hazard has profoundly shaped the way think tanks formulate policy and the way experts argue and the way health insurers structure their plans and the way legislation and regulations have been written .
The health - care mess is n’t merely the unintentional result of political dysfunction , in other words .
It is also the deliberate consequence of the way in which American policymakers have come to think about insurance .
“ Moral hazard ” is the term economists use to describe the fact that insurance can change the behavior of the person being insured .
If your office gives you and your co-workers all the free Pepsi you want — if your employer , in effect , offers universal Pepsi insurance — you ’ll drink more Pepsi than you would have otherwise .
If you have a no - deductible fire - insurance policy , you may be a little less diligent in clearing the brush away from your house .
The savings - and - loan crisis of the nineteen - eighties was created , in large part , by the fact that the federal government insured savings deposits of up to a hundred thousand dollars , and so the newly deregulated S. & L.s made far riskier investments than they would have otherwise .
Insurance can have the paradoxical effect of producing risky and wasteful behavior .
Economists spend a great deal of time thinking about such moral hazard for good reason .
Insurance is an attempt to make human life safer and more secure .
But , if those efforts can backfire and produce riskier behavior , providing insurance becomes a much more complicated and problematic endeavor .
In 1968 , the economist Mark Pauly argued that moral hazard played an enormous role in medicine , and , as John Nyman writes in his book “ The Theory of the Demand for Health Insurance , ” Pauly ’s paper has become the “ single most influential article in the health economics literature . ”
Nyman , an economist at the University of Minnesota , says that the fear of moral hazard lies behind the thicket of co-payments and deductibles and utilization reviews which characterizes the American health - insurance system .
Fear of moral hazard , Nyman writes , also explains “ the general lack of enthusiasm by U.S. health economists for the expansion of health insurance coverage ( for example , national health insurance or expanded Medicare benefits ) in the U.S. ”
What Nyman is saying is that when your insurance company requires that you make a twenty - dollar co-payment for a visit to the doctor , or when your plan includes an annual five - hundred - dollar or thousand - dollar deductible , it ’s not simply an attempt to get you to pick up a larger share of your health costs .
It is an attempt to make your use of the health - care system more efficient .
Making you responsible for a share of the costs , the argument runs , will reduce moral hazard : you ’ll no longer grab one of those free Pepsis when you are n’t really thirsty .
That ’s also why Nyman says that the notion of moral hazard is behind the “ lack of enthusiasm ” for expansion of health insurance .
If you think of insurance as producing wasteful consumption of medical services , then the fact that there are forty - five million Americans without health insurance is no longer an immediate cause for alarm .
After all , it ’s not as if the uninsured never go to the doctor .
They spend , on average , $ 934 a year on medical care .
A moral - hazard theorist would say that they go to the doctor when they really have to .
Those of us with private insurance , by contrast , consume $ 2,347 worth of health care a year .
If a lot of that extra $ 1,413 is waste , then maybe the uninsured person is the truly efficient consumer of health care .
The moral - hazard argument makes sense , however , only if we consume health care in the same way that we consume other consumer goods , and to economists like Nyman this assumption is plainly absurd .
We go to the doctor grudgingly , only because we ’re sick .
“ Moral hazard is overblown , ” the Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt says .
“ You always hear that the demand for health care is unlimited .
This is just not true .
People who are very well insured , who are very rich , do you see them check into the hospital because it ’s free ?
Do people really like to go to the doctor ?
Do they check into the hospital instead of playing golf ? ”
For that matter , when you have to pay for your own health care , does your consumption really become more efficient ?
In the late nineteen - seventies , the rand Corporation did an extensive study on the question , randomly assigning families to health plans with co-payment levels at zero per cent , twenty - five per cent , fifty per cent , or ninety - five per cent , up to six thousand dollars .
As you might expect , the more that people were asked to chip in for their health care the less care they used .
The problem was that they cut back equally on both frivolous care and useful care .
Poor people in the high - deductible group with hypertension , for instance , did n’t do nearly as good a job of controlling their blood pressure as those in other groups , resulting in a ten - per - cent increase in the likelihood of death .
As a recent Commonwealth Fund study concluded , cost sharing is “ a blunt instrument . ”
Of course it is : how should the average consumer be expected to know beforehand what care is frivolous and what care is useful ?
I just went to the dermatologist to get moles checked for skin cancer .
If I had had to pay a hundred per cent , or even fifty per cent , of the cost of the visit , I might not have gone .
Would that have been a wise decision ?
I have no idea .
But if one of those moles really is cancerous , that simple , inexpensive visit could save the health - care system tens of thousands of dollars ( not to mention saving me a great deal of heartbreak ) .
The focus on moral hazard suggests that the changes we make in our behavior when we have insurance are nearly always wasteful .
Yet , when it comes to health care , many of the things we do only because we have insurance — like getting our moles checked , or getting our teeth cleaned regularly , or getting a mammogram or engaging in other routine preventive care — are anything but wasteful and inefficient .
In fact , they are behaviors that could end up saving the health - care system a good deal of money .
Sered and Fernandopulle tell the story of Steve , a factory worker from northern Idaho , with a “ grotesquelooking left hand — what looks like a bone sticks out the side . ”
When he was younger , he broke his hand .
“ The doctor wanted to operate on it , ” he recalls .
“ And because I did n’t have insurance , well , I was like ‘ I ai n’t gonna have it operated on . ’
The doctor said , ‘ Well , I can wrap it for you with an Ace bandage . ’
I said , ‘ Ahh , let ’s do that , then . ’ ” Steve uses less health care than he would if he had insurance , but that ’s not because he has defeated the scourge of moral hazard .
It ’s because instead of getting a broken bone fixed he put a bandage on it .
At the center of the Bush Administration ’s plan to address the health - insurance mess are Health Savings Accounts , and Health Savings Accounts are exactly what you would come up with if you were concerned , above all else , with minimizing moral hazard .
The logic behind them was laid out in the 2004 Economic Report of the President .
Americans , the report argues , have too much health insurance : typical plans cover things that they should n’t , creating the problem of overconsumption .
Several paragraphs are then devoted to explaining the theory of moral hazard .
The report turns to the subject of the uninsured , concluding that they fall into several groups .
Some are foreigners who may be covered by their countries of origin .
Some are people who could be covered by Medicaid but are n’t or are n’t admitting that they are .
Finally , a large number “ remain uninsured as a matter of choice . ”
The report continues , “ Researchers believe that as many as one - quarter of those without health insurance had coverage available through an employer but declined the coverage .
. . .
Still others may remain uninsured because they are young and healthy and do not see the need for insurance . ”
In other words , those with health insurance are overinsured and their behavior is distorted by moral hazard .
Those without health insurance use their own money to make decisions about insurance based on an assessment of their needs .
The insured are wasteful .
The uninsured are prudent .
So what ’s the solution ?
Make the insured a little bit more like the uninsured .
Under the Health Savings Accounts system , consumers are asked to pay for routine health care with their own money — several thousand dollars of which can be put into a tax - free account .
To handle their catastrophic expenses , they then purchase a basic health - insurance package with , say , a thousand - dollar annual deductible .
As President Bush explained recently , “ Health Savings Accounts all aim at empowering people to make decisions for themselves , owning their own health - care plan , and at the same time bringing some demand control into the cost of health care . ”
The country described in the President ’s report is a very different place from the country described in “ Uninsured in America . ”
Sered and Fernandopulle look at the billions we spend on medical care and wonder why Americans have so little insurance .
The President ’s report considers the same situation and worries that we have too much .
Sered and Fernandopulle see the lack of insurance as a problem of poverty ; a third of the uninsured , after all , have incomes below the federal poverty line .
In the section on the uninsured in the President ’s report , the word “ poverty ” is never used .
In the Administration ’s view , people are offered insurance but “ decline the coverage ” as “ a matter of choice . ”
The uninsured in Sered and Fernandopulle ’s book decline coverage , but only because they ca n’t afford it .
Gina , for instance , works for a beauty salon that offers her a bare - bones health - insurance plan with a thousand - dollar deductible for two hundred dollars a month .
What ’s her total income ?
Nine hundred dollars a month .
She could “ choose ” to accept health insurance , but only if she chose to stop buying food or paying the rent .
The biggest difference between the two accounts , though , has to do with how each views the function of insurance .
Gina , Steve , and Loretta are ill , and need insurance to cover the costs of getting better .
In their eyes , insurance is meant to help equalize financial risk between the healthy and the sick .
In the insurance business , this model of coverage is known as “ social insurance , ” and historically it was the way health coverage was conceived .
If you were sixty and had heart disease and diabetes , you did n’t pay substantially more for coverage than a perfectly healthy twenty - five - year - old .
Under social insurance , the twenty - five - year - old agrees to pay thousands of dollars in premiums even though he did n’t go to the doctor at all in the previous year , because he wants to make sure that someone else will subsidize his health care if he ever comes down with heart disease or diabetes .
Canada and Germany and Japan and all the other industrialized nations with universal health care follow the social - insurance model .
Medicare , too , is based on the social - insurance model , and , when Americans with Medicare report themselves to be happier with virtually every aspect of their insurance coverage than people with private insurance ( as they do , repeatedly and overwhelmingly ) , they are referring to the social aspect of their insurance .
They are n’t getting better care .
But they are getting something just as valuable : the security of being insulated against the financial shock of serious illness .
There is another way to organize insurance , however , and that is to make it actuarial .
Car insurance , for instance , is actuarial .
How much you pay is in large part a function of your individual situation and history : someone who drives a sports car and has received twenty speeding tickets in the past two years pays a much higher annual premium than a soccer mom with a minivan .
In recent years , the private insurance industry in the United States has been moving toward the actuarial model , with profound consequences .
The triumph of the actuarial model over the social - insurance model is the reason that companies unlucky enough to employ older , high - cost employees — like United Airlines — have run into such financial difficulty .
It ’s the reason that automakers are increasingly moving their operations to Canada .
It ’s the reason that small businesses that have one or two employees with serious illnesses suddenly face unmanageably high health - insurance premiums , and it ’s the reason that , in many states , people suffering from a potentially high - cost medical condition ca n’t get anyone to insure them at all .
Health Savings Accounts represent the final , irrevocable step in the actuarial direction .
If you are preoccupied with moral hazard , then you want people to pay for care with their own money , and , when you do that , the sick inevitably end up paying more than the healthy .
And when you make people choose an insurance plan that fits their individual needs , those with significant medical problems will choose expensive health plans that cover lots of things , while those with few health problems will choose cheaper , bare - bones plans .
The more expensive the comprehensive plans become , and the less expensive the bare - bones plans become , the more the very sick will cluster together at one end of the insurance spectrum , and the more the well will cluster together at the low - cost end .
The days when the healthy twenty - five - year - old subsidizes the sixty - year - old with heart disease or diabetes are coming to an end .
“ The main effect of putting more of it on the consumer is to reduce the social redistributive element of insurance , ” the Stanford economist Victor Fuchs says .
Health Savings Accounts are not a variant of universal health care .
In their governing assumptions , they are the antithesis of universal health care .
The issue about what to do with the health - care system is sometimes presented as a technical argument about the merits of one kind of coverage over another or as an ideological argument about socialized versus private medicine .
It is , instead , about a few very simple questions .
Do you think that this kind of redistribution of risk is a good idea ?
Do you think that people whose genes predispose them to depression or cancer , or whose poverty complicates asthma or diabetes , or who get hit by a drunk driver , or who have to keep their mouths closed because their teeth are rotting ought to bear a greater share of the costs of their health care than those of us who are lucky enough to escape such misfortunes ?
In the rest of the industrialized world , it is assumed that the more equally and widely the burdens of illness are shared , the better off the population as a whole is likely to be .
The reason the United States has forty - five million people without coverage is that its health - care policy is in the hands of people who disagree , and who regard health insurance not as the solution but as the problem . ♦
Engineer in train disaster was texting on duty : NTSB Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday September 18 , 2008

The engineer of a train involved in a rail crash that left 25 people dead was sending text messages on his mobile phone during working hours , authorities said Thursday .
Local television CBS2 earlier reported two 14 - year - old boys reported having exchanged messages with the conductor in the moments leading up to the accident -- an allegation officials said they would probe .
The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said Thursday that " records ... indicate that the engineer had sent and received text messages on the day of the accident , including some while he was on duty .
" The Safety Board will correlate those records with other investigative information to determine as precisely as possible the exact times of those messages in relation to the engineer 's operation of his train , " it added , pledging to provide updates on the investigation as it progresses .
One of the victim 's families lodged a civil suit against the conductor 's employer , Metrolink , after the local television channel reported that the conductor may have been text messaging when he missed the stop signal .
The deadly collision Friday in Chatsworth , north of Los Angeles , also injured 134 people and was the worst train accident in the United States in some 15 years .
Saturday , a Metrolink spokeswoman admitted that the conductor 's error had caused the crash .
But on Monday , Metrolink board chairman Ron Roberts said that assertion was " premature , " and the spokeswoman , Denise Tyrell , resigned .
The commuter railway resumed service Monday in parts of the suburban line affected by the crash .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa rode the first train between Chatsworth and Los Angeles to reassure riders of its safety .

Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ On a day when major news organizations across the country are taking Sen. McCain to task for a steady stream of false , negative attacks , his campaign has launched yet another , ” says Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor .
“ Or , as some might say , ‘ Oops !
He did it again . ' ”
Counter ’s McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt : “ It ’s beyond dispute that [ Obama ] has become the biggest celebrity in the world .

McCain ’s campaign manager says they chose to include Spears and Hilton in the ad because the women ’s names came up second and third in a search for the top three international celebrities in the world .
The question of what happens after we die is unanswerable outside of Fringe , but the question of where and what will represent our death looms large .
Some of our finest genre writers have had themselves cremated : H.G. Wells , L. Ron Hubbard , and Robert Heinlein to name a few .
But others have had their memory preserved in stone .
We take a look at some of the most intriguing SF memorials .
Although Isaac Asimov let his body be cremated after he passed in 1992 from complications from HIV , other giants of the past have wanted themselves memorialized in some way .
Here are a few of our favorites .

Who : Philip K. Dick
Where ,
When , Why : After his long struggles with mental illness , Dick had a stroke and doctors pulled the plug on March 2 , 1982 in Santa Ana , CA .
He was buried next to twin sister Jane who had died shortly after their birth .
Best Book : VALIS is as good a choice as any , but there 's much to say in favor of 1969 's Ubik as well .
With tons of Dick projects in the offing , we 'll likely have a spirited debate on this at some point .
Fitting Tribute ? :
It 's sufficiently modest , considering Dick 's reputation has spiked considerably after his death .
His children maintain a comprehensive web presence .

Who : Edgar Allen Poe Where ,
When , Why : He died in Baltimore in 1849 , as a plaque commemorating his birth in Boston tells us .
There 's considerable debate over how exactly he died , but some blame the bizarre practice of cooping .
Best Story ? : " The Tell - tale Heart " and " The Masque of the Red Death " loom among short stories in the American canon , but the score - settling " The Cask of Amontillado " might be his very best .
Fitting Tribute ?:
He was reburied in 1875 in one of the more famous exhumations .
Astonishingly , he was dug up by the man who buried him .
His doctor quipped that his " skull was in excellent condition - the shape of the forehead , one of Poe 's striking features , was easily discerned .
The teeth were perfect and white as pear . "
He 's now buried here .

Who : Stanislaw Lem
Where ,
When , Why : Born Jewish , a converted Catholic , this finally atheist writer wrote in Polish .
He died of heart disease in 2006 in Kraków .
Best Book ?:
His most exciting ideas were present in the mystery of Solaris , which A Perfect Vacuum collects reviews of non-existent books , a concept bizarre enough to be compelling .
Some of his work remains untranslated , including material written under the watchful eye of Stalinism .
Outside of Philip K. Dick , Lem did n't care for American science fiction .
Fitting Tribute ? :
Before his death , Lem appeared somewhat depressed by how far science had come in his lifetime .
The latin inscription can be read as , " I did what I could , let those who can do better . "

Who : Arthur C. Clarke
Where ,
When , Why : He died in March of 2008 , having suffered through polio for most of his life .
He was buried in Colombo , Sri Lanka , where he lived because of his lifelong love of scuba - diving .
Best Book ? : Arguments can be made for many , but 1979 's Fountains of Paradise has Clarke at his goofiest and his best .
It nabbed both the Hugo and the Nebula that year .
Fitting Tribute ? :
After a full Sri Lankan funeral he was buried with the inscription : " Here lies Arthur C Clarke .
He never grew up and did not stop growing . "
With ample time to think about what he wanted to say , he decided on something simple and personal .

Who : C.S. Lewis
Where ,
When , Why : The grandfather of Christian SF and fantasy , Lewis spent most of his life at Oxford .
After prolonged illnesses related to his failing kidneys , Lewis died on the same day as John F. Kennedy , completely obscuring his own passing .
Best Book ?:
In the non-scifi fantasy world , Mere Christianity is a religious classic .
Excluding his Narnia series , his Space Trilogy , led by Out of the Silent Planet , might deserve revisiting .
Fitting Tribute ? :
His brother Warnie curated the inscription , " Men must endure their going hence . "
It 's from King Lear .
As Warnie Lewis put it , " There was a Shakespearean calendar hanging on the wall of the room where she [ our mother ] died , and my father preserved for the rest of his life the leaf for that day , with its quotation : " Men must endure their going hence . "
He is buried at the Holy Trinity Church at Oxford .

Who : Jules Verne
Where ,
When , Why : He survived his 25 - year - old nephew shooting him in the leg , and although he lived 19 years after that , he could n't beat diabetes .
Best Book ? :
We 're partial to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , but there 's much to admire about this prolific master .
Fitting Tribute ? :
Considering his son made extensive changes to his final works , the inspired vision of him crawling out of the ground is probably the best thing that came out of his family 's tribute to him .

As Democrats often do , he paid tribute to Mr. McCain ’s military service and his more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
That is not sufficient qualification for the presidency , Mr. Biden said in as direct a way as any Democrat this year has .
“ The choice in this election is clear , ” Mr. Biden said .
“ These times require more than a good soldier .
They require a wise leader , ” he said , a leader who can deliver “ the change that everybody knows we need . ”
Part of Mr. Biden ’s assignment on Wednesday night was to connect with struggling American families and to portray himself and Mr. Obama as products of the middle class who would fight to restore the American dream .
He spoke lyrically of riding the train home to Wilmington , Del. , every night and imagining the conversations in the homes he passed .
“ Like millions of Americans , they ’re asking questions as profound as they are ordinary , ” he said .
“ Questions they never thought they would have to ask . ”
Whether to bring an aging parent into their homes to save money .
How to pay for gas and groceries .
Whether to defer a college education .
How to pay for retirement .
Mr. Biden , who referred to his childhood struggle with stuttering , made a few verbal slips , including referring to Mr. McCain as “ George . ”
Have you ever wanted to analyze your own blemishes at nanometer resolution ?
Send rays of helium atoms to smash into specimens of your choosing ?
Look at a biological sample under a microscope without having to stain it first ?
You 're in luck , because teams of researchers from Spain and England are out to help you achieve those dreams .
After this week 's unveiling of the world 's smoothest mirror , we are closer than ever to a microscope that can non-invasively examine materials at an atomic level .
The quest for a new kind of microscope started when Bodil Holst and William Allison , two researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge , UK , began to focus beams of atomic helium using a mirror .
In a 1997 Nature article , Holst and Allison describe the eventual goal of their experiment :
A helium atom microscope would be a unique non-destructive tool for reflection or transmission microscopy .
It could be used to investigate fragile and insulating materials such as polymers and certain biological samples .
Focusing mirrors also have the potential to increase spatial resolution and intensity in conventional helium - surface scattering instruments .

Holtz and Allison shot a helium beam into a super - smooth silicon crystal ; that silicon mirror then reflected and focused the beam into a detector that measured the incident atoms .
To get the best - quality eventual microscope , their aim was to focus their 2 - millimeter helium beam through the mirror and into the smallest spot size possible .
An ideal focusing would not only reflect helium atoms at the proper angle , but also preserve the intensity of the helium beam .
These early efforts , however , were limited by the quality of their mirror .
As smooth as the silicon was , it focused only 1 % of the helium atoms to their satisfaction .
Enter Rodolfo Miranda of the Autonomous University of Madrid , Spain .
In research published last week in Advanced Materials , Miranda and his team revealed their success at creating the smoothest surface yet .
Their optical reflective device — a silicon crystal covered with an extremely thin layer of lead — can focus 15 % of those helium atoms .
The key to this success is the lead coating .
The metal film over the mirror focuses the helium atoms far more tightly , and also manages to better preserve the beam 's intensity .
Though most metals tend to cluster on the surface of silicon , it is possible to restrain this growth by keeping the metal coating ultra - thin .
As Miranda discovered , certain tiny thicknesses of lead on silicon can exist in energetically favorable states , keeping the surface of the mirror atomically smooth .
Using these smoother mirrors , Miranda expects to be focusing a 100 - nanometer beam of helium by next summer , Nature News reports .

You should expect to be getting almost uncomfortably up - close and personal with your subjects .

REUTERS / Handout
( Reuters ) - Google Inc and Yahoo Inc are in talks with the U.S. Justice Department in an effort to head off an antitrust challenge to their proposed advertising agreement , The Wall Street Journal said citing lawyers close to the effort .
The settlement negotiations are at an early stage and it is n’t clear whether they will resolve U.S. objections or be acceptable to the two companies , the paper said citing the lawyers .
Advertisers , who have raised objections to the deal , told Justice Department officials that the partnership will limit competition , raise prices and reduce choices , the paper said .
Under the agreement , Google would supply Yahoo with advertising services to run alongside Yahoo ’s own Web search system .
Yahoo runs the Web ’s second most popular search service .
Yahoo struck the agreement in June with Google , the world ’s dominant supplier of Web search services , as it sought to shore up its advertising business and ward off pressure to merge from Microsoft Corp .
In the settlement talks with the government , both companies have discussed concessions , the paper said .
Even as senior Justice Department officials weigh the companies ’ proposals to resolve antitrust issues , its trial staff continues to prepare a lawsuit to block the deal , the paper said citing lawyers and executives contacted by the government .
The companies have been cooperating with the Justice Department ’s investigation and recently agreed to delay implementing the deal until at least October 22 to give federal and state antitrust officials time to complete their separate investigations , according to the paper .
Yahoo , Google and the Justice Department could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .
Advice to an Astute Young Person ( September 8 , 2008 )
An astute and forward - thinking 20 - year old reader paid me the great compliment of asking for my advice about three career choices he was pondering .
The three choices he 'd selected showed me that he is the rare individual who foresees " the end of the world as we know it " a.k.a.
TEOTWAWKI and is determined to plan for that reality , not by constructing a bunker but by learning skills which will be in demand in what I call " Month 7 . "
To wit : if you secure food for six months , great -- but what happens in Month Seven ?
When you emerge from the bunker / hideaway , 95 % of the folks who were here on Day One of TEOTWAWKI are still around ; the human animal is extremely resilient , adaptive , canny and it does n't take much to keep them alive .
Even the most horrific plagues still left 2/3 of the people alive and kicking .
( Even full - blown nuclear war - - highly unlikely , and that 's if the missiles still work after the first air - bursts create massive pulses of radiation that fry electronics and guidance systems ) -- would leave 2/3 of the population alive .
It 's simply much more likely that things go on , and that work will need to get done , and those with the high - demand skillsets will do better than those will no skills or low - demand skills ( purveyors of mortgage - backed securities , etc . )
Some expect a sudden , society - shattering TEOTWAWKI ; I personally see a fair amount of redundancy , a cultural preference for martial law over mob rule , a deep agricultural base and an economy which still pumps 5 million barrels of oil a day domestically , mines millions of tons of coal and produces large quantities of natural gas .
I would expect a decay more along the lines of " decline of Empire " in which jobs , food , money , credit , energy and gold all become scarce and increasingly costly .
Historically , such declines have lasted between decades and hundreds of years ; since oil is peaking , we wo n't have the luxury of hundreds of years ; decades will be the best - case scenario , a few years worst - case .
Nonetheless , order does not dissolve easily , especially if there is some resliency and redundancy -- two traits the U.S. does possess .
Correspondent David V. ( wilderness Alaska ) suggested this weekend that last week 's entries did not offer much hope and therefore it might be a good idea to offer some threads of hope .
I agree .
With that goal in mind , here is the reader 's letter to me and my response .
I wrote this off the top of my head and therefore undoubtedly left out key bits .
( Readers can probably add more sage advice than I was able to muster . )
Hello Mr. Smith : First off , let me say that I have greatly enjoyed your writings .
I was turned on them a few weeks ago via a link from Survival Blog.com and I 've been hooked since .
On that note , I have realized that through cultivation and life experiences of your own , that you possess something that I greatly admire : A realistic , logical and lucid view of the past , present and future of our nation and society .
It is from this perspective that I write to you seeking your opinions on the future of young people like me and in similar circumstances as me .
Let me explain : I am 20 years after nearly 2 years of research , interviewing , shadowing and other methods of information - gathering I have narrowed down the " next step " I would like to take in my life professionally to three choices : [ 1 ]
Enlisting in the military ...
Specifically the Coast Guard .
I would n't say that I am an irrational young man , but I do have an all - pervading fear that economic TEOTWAWKI or SHTF is literally over the horizon .
And being one of the millions of unskilled or liberally educated young people in America , I feel that my lack of knowledge and experience of practical trades and skills will be of great detriment to me in such a situation .
The Coast Guard offers a rate called " Damage Controlman " that teaches plumbing , welding , soldering , carpentry , CRBNE training , firefighting [ structural and maritime ] and through advancement Search and Rescue Paramedic / Emergency Medical certifications and possibly Tactical Law Enforcement training .
This assortment of skills is impressive and would have great usefulness in the scenario I described above and many others for that matter , but the disadvantages would be that many of the certifications for these skills would not transfer to civilian life [ as minor a disadvantage as that would be ] and the uncertainty of how even the Coast Guard might be utilized in near - future military conflicts .
I have no fear of disdain for defending U.S. soil against external attacks but another possibly unnecessary war and / or the heavy - handed quelling of " civil unrest " on the homefront are not attractive prospects for me . [ 2 ]
Learning a Trade ...
Specifically becoming an Electrician .
I 'd like to avoid debt and learn a highly marketable trade if possible .
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers offers an almost all - expenses paid Apprenticeship program over 2 to 4 years that leads to full certification as an Electrician .
I can see very little disadvantage to this except possibly being on the road constantly and possibly being stranded in an unfamiliar location due to civil unrest . [ 3 ]
Going to College ...
To earn a degree in Mechanical Engineering .
This prospect , and to a greater extent all of my prospects emerge from a deep - rooted pessimism of what the future may hold for our country and society overall , a desire to learn valuable skills an knowledge that can help myself and the people I love adjust to a " Big Crunch " and pave the way for a marketable career should the predicted Crunch not be so bad .
This particular option appeals to me from the latter standpoint being that mechanical engineering is seen as the mother of all engineering disciplines and would make available many options for me to explore for the rest of my life .
The drawbacks would be if a " Big Crunch " took place while I am in college and the block of debt I would accrue from student loans .
So again , I would ask your opinion of these circumstances and options .
I realize that the burden of this decision rests entirely with me and anyone I ask about the matter will only be able to answer to the best of their knowledge from an indirect view of the matter , but I value your perspective and await anything you may have to say about this matter .
Thank you .
My reply : I am honored that you have asked for an opinion from me , for I am only qualified to respond due to the huge assortment of mistakes I 've made in life .. . :-)
I am going to respond in seemingly haphazard fashion , based on people I know who have been happy with each of your choices .
1 . you are already way ahead of my own thinking at 20 , and ahead of 99 % of your peers .
2 . all of your choices are practical , sound and reliable sources of future income 3 .
the choice will rest ultimately on which of these 3 best aligns with your True Self , i.e. that combination of traits , talents and built - in preferences we each have .
It is difficult to make an objective assessment of these and so people tend to be swayed by fashion or peers or " advice " and then enter something onyl to eventually realise it is a bad match with who they are .
Countless people get law degrees and then discover they loathe the realities of being an attorney .
4 . My niece 's husband joined the Coast Guard right after high school and he got a tremendous amount out of it -- he learned a skill ( as you foresee for yourself ) , in his case , welding , and he enjoyed the travel to Alaska and the sea life .
It used to be a 6 - year hitch but perhaps it has been reduced to 4 years ?
He likes the outdoors , hates offices and classrooms , and was fine with authority .
He was a good match with the CG and I think on occasion he wishes he'd re-enlisted .
Keys to this are of course being able to take orders and endure hard training and long stretches of tedious duty .
You strike me as someone with ambition and foresight and so you should expect wanting to rise in the ranks , just to keep things interesting .
Many of the finest people I know are enlistees in the US Armed Forces -- the best , the brightest , the ones trying hardest to make something of themselves .
Not everyone will be like this of course -- there are slackers and complainers everywhere .
If you 're not sure a completely regimented life and taking orders no matter how dumb is a match for your personality , perhaps you should pass on this choice .
Many people thrive in structure , others chafe .
A Peace Corps volunteer I knew well once told me that there are PC trainees who go thru the arduous training , get off the plane in the foreign country of their assignment and realise they are n't cut out for the Peace Corps .
They then get back on the plane and go home .
That 's the kind of realization you hope to avoid because you can't " quit " the military , at least not easily .
Yes , you might be ordered to use force ; that is possible in int'l fishing disputes or drug - running chases .
You do have to be clear about that and know that even rescue missions of the typical CG sort are very dangerous at times .
But that could be exhilarating -- again , it 's the personality type and match you will have to parse out .
5 . electricians will be in demand as the solar economy takes hold .
If you can position yourself in this field that will guarantee work and the pride of doing something useful for society .
The one caveat I have about any specific trade ( be it electrical , plumbing , welding , etc. ) is that for an ambitious person or one with a restless intelligence , any trade eventually becomes limiting / boring .
This might be an issue for you after a few years in the trade .
Contractors tend to come from the ranks of carpentry , as the foremen oversee all work and have familiarity with how the entire building goes together .
Sometimes MBAs and engineers become contractors too .
You might become a foreman for an electrical crew , and if your ambitions lie beyond work ( to raise a family , own land , play music , etc. ) then this would be an excellent solid base which would enable you to make a living doing useful work at a good rate of pay while pursuing your interests / spending time with your family etc .
You might also combine your electrical knowledge ( that is , after you graduate with your journeyman card ) with some business and accounting classes which would prepare you to go into business for yourself if that appeals to you .
As a carpenter ( still learning , still improving after 35 years ) I think you are right - on in seeking a real trade , be it welding , electrical , or any other " real skill " , as those will be in demand even as we go thru bad times / declining economy .
Electrical is especially wise due to the coming transition to a solar economy and the upgrades to our elect .
infrastructure .
There are no guarantees in life but this is as close as it gets .
6 . the going to college / mech .
engineering option is the riskiest for the reasons you list -- huge debts and a possible dearth of jobs are definite risks .
If things degrade / fall apart , whatever funds are available will probably be spent on maintaining what already exists rather than hiring engineers to plan upgrades or new structures .
On the other hand , America might wake up in 4 - 10 years and stop " investing " in worthless medicines and luxury housing and start rebuilding its infrastructure , in which mechanical engineers will be in high demand .
College offers more breadth of education , meaning you can also learn about poetry , world history , chemistry , etc. while you get your engineering degree .
This also relates to where you want to live , as you want to live where you feel most yourself / like yourself .
Engineers work in cities ; there are virtually no jobs in rural areas for engineers , while electricians and welders can work just about anywhere .
So to be an engineer means living and working in suburbs or urban areas .
You could of course learn a trade and then get a degree , though that is an 8 - year plan and could burn you out .
If you decide to go to college , definitely go to a state school where the tuition is cheap ; do n't borrow any more than you have to .
Many people turn to the book " what color is your parachute ? " for the exercise of trying to figure out what traits are core to themselves and what jobs best align with those traits .
Self - knowledge is a permanent process and one that is never complete ; you might decide now and then discover something about yourself in 4 years which causes you to choose another path .
The fact that you 're thought this out so rationally and carefully suggests you will go far in whatever field you choose .
I would also suggest having a tiered series of ambitions / goals - - do n't limit yourself .
That is why I have suggested ways you might leverage a trade into supervision , your own business , etc .
I have also noted that for many of us , our ambitions lie elsewhere than career -- music , raising kids , writing , biking / fishing , you name it .
If this is you , then a job with limited hours ( like a trade ) is ideal .
Avoid workaholic professions unless that is the love of your life .
The trades are good in that way -- you do your job and go home .
If things get absolutely horrible , the CG will still be funded by the Federal govt .
In that sense it is the safest / least risky .
On the other hand , you might be shot at by drug runners so it is also the riskiest .
You will not get to choose where you live , etc .
As an electrician , you might be unemployed -- but if you focused on learning solar arrays , converters , substations , etc . then I would imagine that Peak Oil will generate a lifetime of work for you .
The same is true in engineering if you learn how to erect algae - based biofuel plants , thermal solar arrays , etc .
If these technologies excite you , and you 're OK at math or willing to work hard , then perhaps that 's the choice closest / in alignment with your finest , truest inner self .
If you go to college , I would start seeking internships with firms doing the work that excites you right away .
hang out in the firms for free , offer to be a go - fer , whatever .
And challenge yourself beyond the classwork -- do special projects on your own , or at least choose real - world projcets of substance for your projects .
Try to network with profs and professional engineering societies -- the key to success in any profession is getting good mentors who will help you .
It 's hard to recruit mentors , but they are out there -- you just do n't know ahead of time who will be your mentor so you have to look and keep on looking .
As a writer I have sought a mentor for decades and never found one .
I have had to mentor myself which is immeasurably more difficult and trying than having someone experienced and caring who will mentor you in your chosen profession .
You have to believe in yourself , of course , but it 's easier when someone else believes in you , too .
I congratulate you once again on the clarity of your thinking , analysis and planning .
I hope this helps , and please keep me informed of your decision process -- Charles
New must - read essay by Chris Sullins : Dust and Shadow , Part 2
The reasons someone becomes a soldier are varied .
At an individual level I would suspect they are little different from those given by warriors from across the planet from now to ages past .
One can read  The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China and see that the art of warfare , harnessing the motivations of men , and empire management has changed very little over the past two millennia .

An excerpt from For My Daughter I believe she stayed with me out of kindness , and my admiration for her grew .
For kindness is everything piety is not ; where piety is all appearance , a brittle play - acting well - loved by treachery , kindness is spontaneous and true .
Piety is easily falsified , so evil never tires of exalting it , while kindness cannot be feigned , and so evil rejects it .
Piety serves self - pride , while kindness serves another .

Back in 2007 , I made the questionable decision to read the Christian bible ( not to be confused with the Satanic bible ) from cover to cover once again .
Why ?
It had been a long time since I last read the whole thing , well before I had read much about atheism .
When I referred to biblical passages here ( something I did rarely ) , Christians often complained that I was taking the passages out of context .
Maybe I was .
So I picked up a parallel bible with the NIV version presented column - by - column with the King James version .
I stuck with it for a while but lost interest before making it all the way through .
It was much worse than I remembered , but it did generate a few posts .
This is one of them , written right about as I hit the middle of Leviticus .
I 'm not sure , but I think this might have been my first time reading the NIV translation , and it did make for an easier read than the King James .
Still , I found myself going back - and - forth to compare both versions and note some of the seemingly important differences .
This was one of the things that prevented me from finishing because it slowed the process down so much .
One fascinating example of the differences between these versions , both of which somehow manage to be the inerrant word of some sort of god , is that the NIV replaces " thou shalt not kill " with " you will not murder . "
At least to my mind , there is a meaningful difference between " kill " and " murder . "
Murder is a crime .
Killing may or may not be a crime depending on the circumstances .
Genesis always makes for an interesting read , and I genuinely enjoy it every time .
A certain beauty is evident in some of the language and imagery .
Of course , one must set aside the realities of modern science to some degree or else one will experience it as little more than a list of false claims about nature .
But I think I mostly managed to get past that and appreciate it for what it was .
The god described in the first three books of this bible is difficult to recommend .
It is presumably almighty and yet needs to rest while creating the universe .
It is presumably wise beyond measure but places two forbidden trees ( that of knowledge and that of life ) in the Garden of Eden where early humans can access them .
It evidently botched its first attempt at creating humanity so badly that it was necessary to slaughter everyone it had created except Noah and his clan .
Any way one slices it , this god seems to be quite flawed .
Ah , but what about its infinite goodness ?
Well , there is little question about this .
This god repeatedly refers to itself as jealous and demonstrates wrath , impatience , cruelty , intolerance , and many other undesirable traits .
The god described in Genesis , Exodus , and Leviticus is willing to provide humanity with a number of laws , the majority of which are completely ignored by virtually all modern Christians .
This god makes it clear that it is to be honored with animal blood and burnt offerings ( i.e. , animals sacrificed and burned on altars ) ; however , most modern Christians would never dream of doing this .
They would probably even equate such acts with Satanism even though they were mandated by the very god they claim to worship .
The infamous passage in Leviticus does indeed state that male homosexuality is wrong ( and that men who engage in homosexual must be killed ) , but this is embedded among so many other laws given to humanity that it hardly stands out .
It is fascinating that so many modern Christians obsess about the couple brief mentions this receives while completely ignoring the call for blood sacrifices , the clear requirement of stoning for minor crimes , and the multitude of references to the evils of yeast .
Please do n't misunderstand - I 'm glad that today 's Christians ignore nearly all of the laws their biblical god hands down in these three books .
It is just that I am puzzled that anyone claiming to be a Christian can ignore all of this , selectively choosing the couple parts that make them feel good while neglecting the bulk of what is actually there .
This is not the sort of god who is likely to react favorably to such neglect .
If I believed in such a god , I do n't think I 'd go near anything containing yeast !

SEXP ---( S- expressions )
We have adapted S - expressions for use in SDSI and SPKI .
The work reported here is , however , application - independent .
( That is , we will use S - expressions in the SPKI / SDSI work , but have developed it and presented it in an application - independent manner , so that others may most easily consider adopting it for other applications . )
SDSI has been developed by Professors Ronald L. Rivest and Butler Lampson of MIT 's Laboratory for Computer Science , members of LCS 's Cryptography and Information Security research group .
SDSI research is supported by DARPA contract DABT63 - 96 - C-0018 , " Security for Distributed Computer Systems " .
SPKI has been developed by Carl Ellison and others in the IETF SPKI working group .
We are currently merging the designs to form SPKI / SDSI 2.0 .
This design will use S - expressions as the basic data structure .

Too much for Tucker
MINNEAPOLIS — Tucker Carlson , an MSNBC contributor who emceed much of Ron Paul 's rally Tuesday at the Target Center , abruptly left after former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura raised questions about Osama bin Laden 's involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks .
The issue is red meat for many Paul supporters .
Ventura questioned why , if bin Laden was the culprit , he had yet to be indicted , as he had been for other attacks .
Carlson confirmed that he left in response to Ventura 's comments , saying it was " too much . "
Do you consume rye , barley or wheat in your diet ?
Does it have any effect on your health ?
The foods named can cause health complications due to gluten that they contain .
You may feel dizzy but you do not know the reason why or have a lot of gas but you cannot explain it .
Those are among the signs of gluten intolerance or sensitivity that are explained below .
Brain fog
Have you found yourself not thinking clearly ?
Then that is brain fog .
In this situation you feel completely disconnected from anything ; barely thinking properly .
There is a reason behind the weird condition is reaction of antibodies to gluten .
This causes inflammation of the brain cells hence the mental fogginess .
Skin complications
The top layer of your skin may have rashes , watery blisters that appear like pimples or burning of the skin .
This is a clear sign of gluten intolerance .
In this case , the skin has painful blisters and there is a lot of itching .
Persistent Fatigue
Have you slept so much and you realize that you are still tired ?
Something may be wrong somewhere .
It is not in order for you to sleep for long and come out as if you have been weight lifting .
Gluten makes one feel so tired even after getting enough rest .
Anxiety and Depression
Someone suffering from this disorder feels hopeless and lacking interest .
It destroys moods and loss control of their tempers frequently .
This also causes loss of appetite for individuals suffering from Celiac disease .
Fear creeps in and it mimics heart attacks .
Digestion problems
It is not all people who suffer digestion dysfunction have the allergy .
However , it is the main symptom of one suffering from the problem .
There is abdominal pain , constipation and diarrhea .
It also includes having excess gas and excess bloating .
Serious headaches
Due to the uncomfortableness of the brain , there arise headaches .
They are referred to as migraines .
They arise shortly after consumption of food like rye and wheat .
Note that this sign should not be taken for granted .
Pain in the joints
The pain arises due to inflammation of the joints .
It is virtually in all joints including the fingers , knees and the hips .
In most cases it may be misdiagnosed to be arthritis .
However if gluten is removed from the diet , the pain will disappear .
Lactose sensitivity
If you have a problem digesting lactose containing foods then chances are that you are sensitive .
Gluten compromises the stomach lining and lactase enzyme hence their digestion problem .
Neurologic signs
Being dizzy and always off balance is one sign of Celiac disease .
In this case your balance is totally not in order and it always threatens to be off you .
Unexplained infertility
Do you want to get pregnant but this fails every time ?
The problem could be the barley or wheat that you consume .
It cause hormonal imbalance that can prevent pregnancy from occurring .
The signs of gluten intolerance are more often than not misread by people .
Do not sit waiting to be diagnosed by a doctor .
It requires that once you identify them , remove gluten from your diet at once and observe the effect .
This measure means that you see the doctor a minimal number of times .
Internet use ' good for the brain '
Areas activated by reading a book in the brain of an experienced web user
For middle - aged and older people at least , using the internet helps boost brain power , research suggests .
A University of California Los Angeles team found searching the web stimulated centres in the brain that controlled decision - making and complex reasoning .
The researchers say this might even help to counteract the age - related physiological changes that cause the brain to slow down .
The study features in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry .
A simple , everyday task like searching the web appears to enhance brain circuitry in older adults
Professor Gary Small
University of California Los Angeles
As the brain ages , a number of changes occur , including shrinkage and reductions in cell activity , which can affect performance .
It has long been thought that activities which keep the brain active , such as crossword puzzles , may help minimise that impact - and the latest study suggests that surfing the web can be added to the list .
Web use stimulates much more activity in the same brain Lead researcher Professor Gary Small said : " The study results are encouraging , that emerging computerised technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle - aged and older adults .
" Internet searching engages complicated brain activity , which may help exercise and improve brain function . "
The latest study was based on 24 volunteers aged between 55 and 76 .
Half were experienced internet users , the rest were not .
Compared with reading Each volunteer underwent a brain scan while performing web searches and book - reading tasks .
Both types of task produced evidence of significant activity in regions of the brain controlling language , reading , memory and visual abilities .
However , the web search task produced significant additional activity in separate areas of the brain which control decision - making and complex reasoning - but only in those who were experienced web users .
Brain activity in web newcomers : similar for reading and internet use
The researchers said that , compared to simple reading , the internet 's wealth of choices required people to make decisions about what to click on in order to get the relevant information .
However , they suggested that newcomers to the web had not quite grasped the strategies needed to successfully carry out a web search .
Professor Smith said : " A simple , everyday task like searching the web appears to enhance brain circuitry in older adults , demonstrating that our brains are sensitive and can continue to learn as we grow older . "
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimers Research Trust , said : " These fascinating findings add to previous research suggesting that middle - aged and older people can reduce their risk of dementia by taking part in regular mentally stimulating activities .

" Frequent social interactions , regular exercise and maintaining a balanced diet can also reduce dementia risk . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " Use it or lose it may well be a positive message to keep people active but there is very little real evidence that keeping the brain exercised with puzzles , games or other activities can promote cognitive health and reduce the risk of dementia .

What are these ?
Introduction
When writing documents , it is often useful to number sections and have a table of contents .
You can number these by hand , directly in the markup , but this can be time consuming if the order changes and you have to edit all the numbers .
CSS 2.1 gives us an automated way to generate numbers using CSS counters , and this article will walk you through how to use them .
One word of note before we start is that CSS counters are not yet implemented in IE , although they are on the roadmap for IE8 .
Setting up the counter
The first step is to reset the counter to its base value and give it a name .
This can be achieved with the counter - reset property , like the following example :
body { counter - reset : section ; }
This says that the counter will be reset to zero on the < body > element , and the counter identifier is section .
This can be any name that you wish .
The property can also take an optional second value that sets the starting value of the counter .
If you ’d like the counter to start counting from 5 upwards , you can specify it like so :
body { counter - reset: section 4 ; }
The reason for setting it at 4 is that it always increments the counter just before it displays it .
So if you start it at 4 , at the moment before it displays it , the value increases to 5 .
Incrementing the counter
The next step is to specify when the counter increments and by what value .
This can be specified with the counter - increment property .
If no value is specified then a default increment of one is used :
body { counter - reset : section 4 ; } h2 { counter - increment : section ; }
If you ’d like it to increment by two instead , you could specify it like so :
h2 { counter - increment : section 2 ; }
The property also accepts 0 and negative values .
If the counter is reset and incremented on the same element , then it is reset first then incremented by the specified value , therefore in the following example , the value will always be 2 :
h2 { counter - reset : section ; counter - increment : section ; }
Displaying the counter
Once the counter is set up , you need to display it on the page .
This can be done with generated content using the counter function , and the : before pseudo class :
body { counter - reset : section 4 ; } h2 { counter - increment : section ; } h2:before { counter ( section ) ' '; }
If you use a counter and increment it on the same element , like I have done in the examples above on the < h2 > element , then it is incremented before it is used .
View the finished CSS counters example .
Using two or more counters
The counter function can used more than once on the content property .
In the following example I use two counters to specify numbering for sections and sub-sections .
The sub-section counter is reset for each new section .
body { counter - reset : section ; } h2 { counter - increment : section ; counter - reset : sub - section ; } h2:before , h3:before { content : counter ( section ) '.' counter ( sub - section ) ' '; } h3 : before { counter - increment : sub - section ; }
Using nested counters
As well as specifying each counter there is also a counters ( ) function for specifying nested counters .
This works fine for elements such as lists , where lists can be nested inside each other .
It would n’t work for the example above as the sub-sections are not nested inside the main sections , but are rather sibling elements .
Nested counters can be specified as follows :
ol { counter - reset : section ; list - style - type : none ; } ol li { counter - increment : section ; } ol li:before { content : counters ( section , '. ' ) '. '; }
This will increment the counter for each list item , no matter how many nested lists are in the markup .
It is important to reset the counter in the correct place , so that it resets to zero for each of the nested elements .
In this case I reset the counter on the < ol > element .
In the following example the first nested list will start at 1.1 and count up 1.2 , 1.3 and so on .
The second nested list would start at 1.1.1 and count up ( 1.1.2 and so on ) .
< ol > < li> Item 1 < ol > < li>Sub item 1 < ol > < li>Sub-sub item 1</li > < li>Sub- sub item 2</li > < li>Sub- sub item 3</li > </ ol > </li > < li>Sub item 2</li > </ ol > </li > < li> Item 2</li > </ol >
View an example using nested counters .
Styling counters
It is possible to style the counter by specifying it as the second argument in the counter or counters functions .
The values are the same as for the list - style - type property .
Although all the values are valid , for counters only a subset make sense , as values such as disc , square and circle stay the same no matter what the value of the counter is .
The style can be specified as follows :
ol li:before { counter ( answer , lower - alpha ) ') '; }
View an example using the counter function to style counters .
The example also highlights using non-default counter reset and counter increment values .
Using counters to replace the deprecated start attribute
If you have a need to use the start attribute on the < ol > element , to start a list from a value other than one , and you are using a strict doctype , you will notice that your markup will not validate .
There are arguments over whether the start attribute is presentational or not , and indeed HTML5 has declared that it is no longer deprecated in the current working drafts ( at the time of writing ) .
Even if the start attribute is allowed again in HTML5 , it does n’t help with pages that need to be validated against the HTML4 doctype , and the HTML5 doctype is not ready to be used in the production sites yet as HTML5 support is still experimental .
If you want your page to validate you either need to use a transitional doctype or use CSS counters .
If you would like to start a list at 4 instead of 1 , you could specify the following CSS :
body { counter - reset : list - order 3 ; } ol li { counter - increment : list - order ; list - style - type : none ; } ol li:before { content : counter ( list - order ) ' '; }
It is important to remove the list marker so that you do not get double numbers .

STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND By Robert A. Heinlein. 525 pp. New York : Ace / G.P. Putnam's Sons. $ 24.95 .
IN London in October , at a dinner party in the home of the publisher Tom Maschler , head of Jonathan Cape , our host asked a question that was primitive but deep .
" What is the best novel ever written ? " I nominated " Madame Bovary . "
A majority went for " Anna Karenina . "
Anna had glamour , Emma did n't .
That was that .
We hastened on to gossip about Salman Rushdie and so forth .
Afterward , though , as I sat alone in my room at Brown 's Hotel , I marveled that none of us had celebrated a story that took place in the world at large rather than in a stratified and codified little society .
And Tom Wolfe a few months earlier had told the rest of us in the fiction trade to either do deep - dish reportage on members of little groups , right down to the name of the manufacturers of the shoes they wore , or take up macrame .
Yes , and now Putnam has published for the first time the full text of " Stranger in a Strange Land , " by Robert A. Heinlein ( 1907 - 88 ) , an abridged version of which has sold 100,000 copies in hard cover and nearly five million in paper since its debut in 1961 .
An enormous number of readers have found this book a brilliant mind - bender , and yet I doubt that Heinlein 's name was ever uttered at a meeting of PEN or in the halls of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters .
Despite his having written this book and about 40 others ( " The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress , " " I Will Fear No Evil , " " Methuselah 's Children , " " The Puppet Masters " and on and on ) , this remarkable man , whom I never met , was included only in " Who 's Who in Science Fiction , " and died without having been considered worthy of an entry in the more inclusive annual " Who 's Who . "
The president of the American Poultry Association is sure as heck in the big ' Who 's Who " somewhere .
How could this have happened ?
My goodness , the name of the leading character in " Stranger in a Strange Land " is as familiar to millions of literate persons as Oliver Twist or Holden Caulfield .
He is Valentine Michael Smith .
But he was raised by Martians on Mars , without ever having seen another human being .
And to those who get to say which novels are serious and which are not , professional critics and teachers of literature in the company of authors of novels about the rise or fall of ordinary people in provincial societies , he is absolutely intolerable .
He is far more dismaying to them , say , than a character found when an infant in an overnight bag in Victoria Station .
And I say that their rejection of not only Valentine Michael Smith , but his creator , too , is an act based on social prejudices , and that intellectual and esthetic standards have nothing to do with it .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking results for Sept. 9 -11 show a slight , but not statistically significant , three percentage point advantage for John McCain over Barack Obama among registered voters , 48 % to 45 % .
These results , based on interviewing conducted Tuesday through Thursday , mark the first time since the Sept. 4 - 6 report that McCain does not have a statistically significant lead over Obama , and also reflect interviewing on Thursday that showed a very close race .
It is unknown whether or not Thursday 's results may have reflected any possible impact of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's widely publicized television interviews with Charles Gibson of ABC News , which began to be broadcast Thursday evening .
The story of the presidential race this year since early June has been a tendency for candidate support levels to return to near parity after one or the other candidate moves into a brief lead , so the days ahead will show whether or not this contest will once again settle back into a " too close to call " structure .
Obama and McCain were together Thursday at memorial services in New York at the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack , but both campaigns have now returned to hot and heavy campaigning , including ads directly attacking each other 's positions on issues .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Sept. 9 - 11 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,726 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

An area of the Pacific Ocean once thought to be cold and barren is warmer than scientists thought , a new study finds .
The seafloor there might be teeming with life .
A group of researchers dropped probes down to a flat region of the Pacific Ocean floor off the coast of Costa Rica and about the size of Connecticut to gauge the water temperature and flow there .
To their surprise , the water spewing out of the typically cold ocean floor was warmer and faster than expected in this area .
" It 's like finding Old Faithful in Illinois , " said study team member Carol Stein of the University of Illinois at Chicago .
" When we went out to try to get a feel for how much heat was coming from the ocean floor and how much sea water might be moving through it , we found that there was much more heat than we expected . "
The sea floor in this region , which lies some 2 miles below the ocean surface , is marked by 10 widely separated outcrops or mounts that rise from sediment covering the ocean crust made of volcanic rock about 20 to 25 million years old .
Large amounts of water gush through cracks and crevices in the ocean crust like geysers and pick up heat as they move through the insulated volcanic rock .
While not as hot as water that runs through mid-ocean ridges formed by rising lava , the water is still much warmer than expected .
This warmth opens up the possibility that the area could support life , such as bacteria , clams and tubeworm species recently found to be living near hot water discharges along mid-ocean ridges .
" It 's relatively warm and may have some of the nutrients needed to support some of the life forms we see on the sea floor , " Stein said .
The researchers hope to follow up this study , detailed in the September 2008 issue of Nature Geoscience , by examining other areas of the ocean floor to see if they can find any similar to the one off the coast of Costa Rica .
R isks , threats and dangers dominate Stephen Harper 's campaign rhetoric .
His Canada is a country whose citizens worry about teenage killers ; oil - hungry foreigners prowling their Arctic waters ; terrorists lurking in their cities ; and economic shock waves rolling toward them .
There is a grain of truth in these images .
Canadians are bracing for a recession .
A Russian mini-submarine did launch a mission to claim the North Pole this summer .
The rate of violent youth crime went up slightly in 2006 .
And no country is immune to terrorism .
But there is also a great deal of exaggeration .
Very few Canadians will ever come in contact with a homicidal minor ; 85 young people were accused of murder in 2006 ( the latest year for which statistics are available ) .
Homicide constitutes 0.05 per cent of youth crime .
Overall youth crime has been declining steadily for two decades .
Most of the " terrorist conspiracies " detected in Canada have looked pretty amateurish .
The first suspect convicted under Canada 's anti-terrorism law in a Brampton court yesterday was too inept to pose much of a threat .
This is not to say a suicide bombing , hijacking or anthrax attack could n't happen here .
But cowering has never been the Canadian way .
Undersea military activity is n't what scares most northerners .
Their biggest concern is the rapid melting of the polar ice cap .
Their homes , roads and communities , built on permafrost , are buckling and sagging .
The entire Arctic ecosystem , and the life it supports , is in danger .
There is also a huge blind spot in the Conservative leader 's vision .
Harper fails to see Canadians as a people who pull together in hard times .
He is oblivious to the work millions of public - spirited citizens are doing in their communities to solve problems and create opportunities .
This is reflected in his approach to everything from crime to economic policy .
Those unregenerate 14 - year - old criminals he proposes to lock up for a decade were troubled kids when he came to power .
Their teachers had spotted the danger signals .
So had welfare caseworkers , community activists and beat cops .
They had tried to help , but were hampered by too few resources and too little political support .
Harper acknowledged this week that broken families and deprived neighbourhoods can contribute to " delinquent behaviour . "
But he insisted that coddling young offenders does n't work .
Harsh discipline does .
That might make anxious voters feel better .
But it wo n't divert preteens from heading down the same path .
And it wo n't provide much real protection ; today 's 14 - year - old prison inmates will be out on parole at 24 .
The " economic certainty " Harper offers voters is merely a leaner version of what exists now .
He is not calling on Canadians to respond to be creative and caring .
He is telling them to hunker down .
He is not tackling the structural problems that constrain Canada 's growth ; its aging infrastructure , overreliance on fossil fuels and shrinking manufacturing base .
He says this is no time for " risky experiments . "
He is not willing to use the power of the state as a buffer against market forces .
All he is pledging to do is keep the budget balanced , taxes low and spending in check .
Some might describe that as " a steady hand on the wheel . "
Others would call it a damper on the Canadian spirit .
In a tactical sense , Harper 's strategy is shrewd .
Fear is a powerful motivator .
It fits the mood of the times .
It is much easier to elicit than hope .
It also lets an incumbent campaign with no virtually no platform .
All Harper has to do is shoot down every idea his opponents put forward , a task he clearly relishes .
More than half of the 55 " news releases " on his campaign website denigrate the Liberals ( " not worth the risk " ) , the Bloc Québécois ( " never delivers concrete results " ) and the New Democrats ( " out of touch with the concerns of working families " ) .
It is a shame none of the other national party leaders has succeeded in tapping into the nation 's better instincts .

Athena Scrollbars :
Why people love them
The Athena widget set is favoured by many users because of its highly functional scrollbars .
Unfortunately , many more users have not noticed the benefits of this interface even after using it for many years .
So here 's a short introduction ( for vertical scrollbars and right - handed mice ; I assume you are smart enough to figure out the other cases if you need them ) :
The middle mouse button is known by most :
When you press it in the scrollbar , it moves the scrollbar such that its top is where the mouse points .
Dragging up and down moves the scrollbar accordingly .
The content of the window moves proportionally to the scrollbar movement .
This is the usual stuff .
The left mouse button
When you left - click in the scrollbar , the content of the window that is at the height of the mouse moves to the top of the window .
So , if you want some line to move to the top , you move the pointer in the scrollbar right beside the line and press the left mouse button ; if you want to scroll a windowfull downwards , you move the pointer to the bottom of the scrollbar and press the left mouse button ; for half a window , you do it in the middle ; and for only a tiny bit , you do it near the top .
The right mouse button scrolls up as much as a left - click scrolls down .
E.g. , for scrolling up a full screenful , you right - click at the bottom of the scrollbar .
To undo an overeager scrolldown you just right - click at the same place ( and vice versa ) .
Unfortunately there is no direct visual way to scroll a particular line down to the bottom .
GNU Emacs apparently does not use the Athena widgets , but has implemented Athena functionality in its scrollbars ( the first and sufficient reason why I prefer it over Xemacs ) .

( Fortune ) -- Jeff Bezos has done it again .
The Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) CEO has created an MP3 - download store that has quickly become the second largest digital music outlet after Apple ' ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) s iTunes .
Now he 's struck an exclusive deal to build a similar store for the soon - to - launch MySpace Music .
What does the MySpace ( NWS , Fortune 500 ) deal mean for Amazon ?
It could mean a lot .
The Amazon store is second place only a year after its launch .
But it still trails Apple by a huge margin .
Gene Munster , senior research analyst at Piper Jaffrey , estimates that Apple will sell 2.4 billion songs this year , giving it an 85 % market share .
By contrast , he says , Amazon will sell 130 million downloads - 5 % of the market .
Munster says Amazon 's sales should climb by 60 % next year to 208 million songs .
That should be enough to keep the Seattle - based online retailer ahead of other digital music stores run by companies like Napster and Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) .
But it 's a long way from Apple 's billions .
Amazon needs to start stealing customers from iTunes if it wants to level the playing field .
That 's not happening yet .
Most of Amazon 's digital music customers are currently people who are already buying CDs on the site , says Russ Crupnick , senior entertainment industry analyst for the market research firm NPD .
This is where MySpace Music , which launches later this month , comes into play .
The joint venture with Universal , SonyBMG and Warner Music ( WMG ) will allow the social network 's 120 million members around the world to stream the entire catalogues of these music giants for free .
It gives Amazon access to an online community teaming with young music fans who patronize the iTunes store .
Granted , many will remain loyal to Apple .
After all , iTunes is n't just a store .
It 's the software iPod owners use to manage their music collections .
But Amazon is doing something that could persuade even the staunchest Apple fans to switch : it 's beating iTunes ' prices .
Amazon sells most songs for 89 cents - 10 cents less than iTunes .
It also offers a different album each day for $ 1.99 .
( The other day it was Radiohead 's OK Computer . )
On Friday , Amazon also puts five albums on sale for $ 5 each .
There are plenty of other bargains on the site , too .
" We 've discovered that customers love low prices , and we continue to figure out great ways to offer low prices , " says Bill Carr , Amazon 's vice president for digital media .
" It gives people a great reason to come back and check out our site everyday . "
This is the kind of innovative thinking that 's been missing from Apple 's other rivals .
Some of the biggest names in media and technology - everybody from Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) to Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) - have tried to steal Apple 's music customers since it unveiled the iTunes store in 2003 .
But none of them gave Apple loyalists a good reason to switch .
Apple sold songs for 99 cents .
So did everyone else .
Apple sold songs with copy protection software so they could only be played on the iPod .
Its competitors stocked their download stores with tunes wrapped in similar software that locked them into other portable devices .
( You know , the ones that nobody really wants . )
No wonder they did n't get any traction .
Amazon was n't so clueless .
It was the first to get the four major record companies - Warner Music , Universal , SonyBMG and EMI - to abandon copy - protection software altogether .
That meant its library of songs could be played on any portable player from the iPod to the Microsoft Zune .
Now Amazon is challenging iTunes in the social networking world .
Both Amazon and iTunes can be found on Imeem , a music social network with 27 million members and deals with the four major labels that allow visitors to stream their entire catalogues for free .
If Imeem users hear a song they like , they can click a link and go to either store to buy it .
But MySpace Music promises to be much bigger .
And iTunes wo n't be there .
Bezos has every reason to pound his chest .
He does n't get 120 million potential new customers every day .
That 's nothing to sniff at - especially when you are number two and you have a lot of catching up to do .
A Minneapolis woman who allegedly used her dying mother in a scheme to spring her boyfriend from the Hennepin County jail faces three felony charges for her efforts .
Courtney Lashell
White , who turns 24 today , called Allina Hospice last month and said her dying mother had a son in jail who had not seen her for more than a month , the complaint against her says .
The " son , " Martese Carl Cobbs , was given a short furlough .
Instead he escaped .
" It was later learned that Cobbs ' mother is alive and well , living in Chicago , " the complaint said .
The ruse began when Cobbs was charged May 6 with aggravated robbery in Brooklyn Park .
His bail was set at $ 50,000 .
At a pretrial hearing May 29 , his lawyer asked District Court Judge Beryl Nord to reduce his bail because his mother was at death 's door .
The mother was identified as Rosie White .
The complaint said Cobbs ' lawyer , Sonya Verkinderen , made a motion to reduce his bail based on his representation that " Cobbs ' mother was dying and had only days to live . "
Nord denied the request but said she would consider a furlough if the mother 's condition was verified .
In a June 2 e-mail to the judge , Verkinderen indicated she had verified that Cobbs ' mother was dying and requested a furlough .
She forwarded an e-mail from a social worker , identified only as J.B. , at Allina Hospice .
The e-mail said the hospice was caring for Rosie White , the mother of Cobbs .
The social worker reported that death was imminent and requested that Cobbs be released as soon as possible .
Nord granted Cobbs an eight - hour furlough .
He was to return at 11:15 p.m. on June 2 .
When he did not , authorities launched an investigation .
They learned that Rosie White is not Cobbs ' mother , but Courtney White 's mother .
Courtney
White was trying to help Cobbs , who is her boyfriend and the father of her young child , the complaint said .

The benefit of homework is many folds .
First and foremost , it enables the students to stay abreast with the day to day class work .
It is important that the students retain whatever is being taught in class .
Doing homework regularly or in a routine manner helps students to gauge their problems , weak points - strong points in a particular chapter of a text or in a particular subject and thereby help them plan their academic strategy accordingly .
Lessons learnt
It is true , that at times the burden of homework might fall too heavily on the shoulders of the students , hindering a scope for other socio- physical activities which is essential for young adults and teenagers .
But if one is organized and is reared from early childhood to maintain a well - planned lifestyle , one will always find time to get their jobs done and also have space for leisure .
That is why a student , right from his early school days , should start maintaining a homework planner .
If a student is encouraged to do homework regularly it can contribute later on in his / her life .
Homework helps one to be more organized and meet deadlines in time .
It also reflects in his scores .
The aim of homework is to ensure revision of day to day lessons so that one does not have to pull an all - nighter before their mid-term or annual examination .
Get help
Solely engaging with academia is not advisable for any student .
They need to partake in co-curricular as well , be it at school or outside .
As a result , it will not always be possible for everyone to follow a homework planner and engage in other activities .
There will be lags in either , at times .
For younger students , whom their parents help with their homework , it can get difficult if both the parents are working and have to spend a fair share of their days outside .
For such , seeking help from professional sources is recommendable .
There are numerous online platforms that provide this kind of service .
You search for homework help online or specifically by mentioning a subject like math homework help online .
Then , you register your details and sign up for a particular brand of service for your child ’s lessons and they will do the rest .
For parents who are worried about their child ’s performance at school , these are extremely good as they allow the parents to keep a track of their child ’s progress .
Subjects like science and math requires a lot of understanding than mugging up and it can get a bit difficult at times , in high school levels without professional help for students to manage their science homework and math homework .
When the federal government announced two months ago that it would prop up mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , CRP looked at how much money members of Congress had collected since 1989 from the companies .
On Sunday the government completely took over the two government - sponsored enterprises , and we ’ve returned to our data to bring you the updates , this time providing a list of all 354 lawmakers who have gotten money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( in July we posted the top 25 ) .
These totals are based on data released electronically from the FEC on Sept. 2 and include contributions to lawmakers ’ leadership PACs and candidate committees from the floundering companies ’
PACs and employees .
Current members of Congress have received a total of $ 4.8 million from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , with Democrats collecting 57 percent of that .
This week we also wrote about how much money lawmakers had invested of their own money in the companies last year–a total of up to $ 1.7 million .

Twenty Recommendations For Action Now Being Considered As A Result Of Conference On War Crimes .
Goal Is To Give Continued Life To Nuremberg Principles Barring Aggressive War And Torture , Instead Of Allowing Bush / Cheney To Destroy Them With Impunity
By Sherwood Ross
Reprinted with permission
ANDOVER , MASS . ( Special ) —
Twenty recommendations made at a conference on prosecuting President George Bush for war crimes are under consideration for action , according to conference convener Lawrence Velvel , a prominent law school dean .
“ Attendees discussed the violations of international and domestic law that were committed and are now studying recommendations for action , ” said Velvel .
“ All of us feel that those who committed war crimes and other crimes against humanity must be held accountable , ” he said .
“ The continued viability of Nuremberg Principles barring aggressive war and torture depends on it . ” 
More than 120 public officials , lawyers , academics , and authorities on the U.S. Constitution and international law attended the two day conference , which was held in Andover , Massachusetts on September 13th and 14th .
The conference resulted in recommendations ranging from asking the next U.S. Attorney General to prosecute Bush , to having any of some 2,700 county district attorneys launch proceedings against him for murder , to having Bush prosecuted for war crimes in other countries .
A newly formed central committee will decide which of the suggestions can practicably be persued .
The complete list of possible actions is :
Working for the election of district attorneys who pledge to prosecute high level war criminals for murder under state law , and working for the reelection of district attorneys who pledge to prosecute such criminals for murder .
Working for the election of state attorneys general who pledge to prosecute high level war criminals for murder under state law .
Working for the election of local executive and legislative officials ( e.g. , city council members ) in specified localities who will formally denounce war crimes and might even seek to take action against them , as apparently has occurred in Vermont .
Mandamus proceedings to force local prosecutors to act .
Requesting state bar authorities to disbar the lawyers who were part of the executive cabal to authorize torture and other abuses that are crimes under international law , domestic law , or both .
Teach -ins at universities on the question of war crimes .
Asking universities to conduct hearings on whether certain individuals ( e.g. , John Yoo , Jack Goldsmith ) should be dismissed from faculties for aiding and abetting criminal acts .
A march of many thousands of American lawyers on the Department of Justice ( a la Civil Rights or Viet Nam war marches or the million man march ) .
The purpose of the march would be to highlight lawyers ’ belief that crimes were committed and must be punished .
Seeking prosecutions of high level war criminals before foreign courts or before international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court .
Asking the next federal Attorney General to prosecute war criminals .
Seeking major congressional investigations of what occurred .
Obtaining inspector general reports of what was done in given federal departments like the Department of Justice , the Pentagon , the State Department , the CIA , etc .
A truth and reconciliation commission .
Impeachment , even after the culprits leave office .
And , unless he resigns from the federal bench , Jay Bybee , who collaborated with John
Yoo on the first torture papers , will still be in office after the election .
Legislative or judicial action to dramatically cut back on , and sometimes totally eliminate , the present vast overuse by the federal government of the state secrets doctrine , executive privilege and other such doctrines .
Repeal of immunity amendments ( which , even if not repealed , may have tremendous holes in them with regard to federal prosecutions , are unlikely to have any immunizing effect at the state level ( though they may nonetheless be claimed as a defense ) , and whose only effect on foreign and international prosecutions would be to encourage them because these amendments indicate that the American federal government ( like the governments of Argentina and Chile for many years ) refuses to take action against federal criminals .
Resisting pardons , particularly advance pardons by Bush or the next president before there are convictions .
Creating an office of Chief Prosecutor(s ) , with Vince Bugliosi as Chief Prosecutor for domestic actions and perhaps a Co- Chief Prosecutor , with international prosecutorial experience , as Chief Prosecutor for foreign and international actions .
This office would handle prosecutions in which governmental officials are willing to use “ our ”  designated chief prosecutor as the lead lawyer , and would advise governmental prosecutors who desire to handle the prosecutions themselves but are willing to use “ our ”  chief prosecutor as an adviser .
Setting up an internet - accessible repository , or library , of information on the pertinent war crimes , so that persons will have ready access to all relevant information .
The repository , or library , should be cross indexed by subject matter , and should include briefs , articles , books , memos , speeches , etc. — anything that sheds light on what was done .
Considering what , if anything , can be done to overcome the current ineptitude , failure and sometimes even deliberate hiding of facts by the corporate mass media , and to consider how the web might be used to accomplish this .
Vincent Bugliosi , former Los Angeles county prosecutor , extensively explained the legal reasoning under which Bush can be prosecuted for murder once he is no longer president .
Bugliosi added that “ No Federal , state or local statute says there is any person who ca n’t be prosecuted for murder . ”
Bugliosi said that , of the 2,700 district and county attorneys having the power to prosecute , “ There should be one prosecutor bold enough to say ‘ No man is above the law ’ .
I am looking for that courageous prosecutor and I am not going to be satisfied until I see George W. Bush in an American courtroom prosecuted for murder . ”
Bugliosi said the evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq was overwhelming .
“ There are over 100 books ”  providing facts to underpin ” bringing Bush to prosecution for the deaths of 4,000 American soldiers under false pretenses , ” Bugliosi said .
Philippe Sands , director of the Centre of International Courts and Tribunals at University College , London , discussed violations of law such as torture .
He said that “ Under the Convention Against Torture , any person who has tortured anywhere in the world can be arrested in the United Kingdom ” if they enter that country .
Political scientist Christopher Pyle of Mt. Holyoke College , S. Hadley , Mass . , spoke for many Conference attendees when he said , “ The evidence is overwhelming .
The torture , kidnapping , and degradation of suspected terrorists was part of a deliberate policy , hatched and concealed at the highest levels of the Bush administration . ” 
Pyle said the nation does not need any “ truth commission ”  that will offer immunity to suspects who confess their crimes because “ if there is no threat of punishment , and therefore no prospect of plea bargains , why would underlings admit anything ? ” 
Any attempt by President Bush to pre-pardon himself or any of his aides involved in war crimes and torture would be “ an obstruction of justice , ”  said Pyle .
He suggested one approach could be to appoint “ a non-partisan prosecutor with considerable independence , ”  much as Attorney General Elliot Richardson did when he chose Archibald Cox to lead the Watergate team .
“ A special prosecutor could be chosen by the next attorney general from among any number of distinguished Republican attorneys . ” 
Professor Amy Bartholomew of Carleton University , Ottawa , told the conference that the Bush administration was attempting to replace the Nuremberg Principles adopted after World War Two with “ a global and transnational state of exception ”  under which the U.S. can invade countries with impunity .
Peter Weiss of the Center For Constitutional Rights pointed out that there is no need for any new legislation to outlaw aggressive war , since “ It is already outlawed by Article 2 of the United States Charter . ” 
Dean Velvel summarized the conference proceedings by saying , “ In a nutshell , this conference was about giving continued life to the Nuremberg principles , which our country itself established , instead of allowing guilty members of the Bush Administration to destroy those principles wholesale by committing aggressive war and torture with impunity . ” 

Every day until November 4 , a series of writers and thinkers will discuss the election over instant messenger for nymag.com .
Today , Politico ’s Ben Smith and Robert Reich , former United States secretary of Labor and University of California , Berkley professor , discuss McCain “ suspending ” his presidential campaign , what the precise chances of a world financial crisis are , and whether Obama has distinguished himself in dealing with the economy .
B.S. : You blogged the other day that Democrats “ have no choice but to say yes ” to the bailout the way it was put to them .
Still true ?
R.R. :
They have to say yes because Paulson and Bernanke are pointing a gun to their heads — as well as to Republicans ’ in Congress — telling them if they do n’t bail out Wall Street , the entire world economy will end .
But Congress can and should put conditions on the bailout .
B.S. : Wait though .
Why say yes ?
Will the world economy end ?
R.R. :
If nothing is done to rescue Wall Street — if there ’s no agreement on a bailout package , including tough conditions Wall Street must meet — there ’s a chance of a major meltdown .
A chance .
How much of a chance ?
I ’d say 53 percent , give or take .
Make that 54 percent .
B.S. : So the gun is loaded .
R.R. : Yup .
B.S. : Do you think the conditions that Dodd and Obama and others are talking about are hitting it right ?
R.R. : Just about .
I laid out four conditions on my blog last weekend that I still think are minimal :
1. Government gets an equity stake in each company that seeks a bailout , proportional to the amount of bad debt the government is taking on .
2. Limits on executive pay .
3 . New regulations .
4. Opportunities for homeowners to reorganize their own debts .
I could go into more detail , but these are the essentials .
B.S. : Do you see meaningful differences between Obama and McCain here ?
They ’re both talking about at least ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .
R.R. : Obama laid out his conditions first .
( McCain has been gyrating wildly on the whole bailout thing — first condemning it , then saying he had his own plan , then seeing Obama ’s conditions and essentially copying them . )
Barney Frank and Chris Dodd are actually negotiating this for the Dems , and in effect for Congress .
Their demands are similar .
The question is whether Paulson and Wall Street will go along with the four conditions .
B.S. : Whoa .
As we type : “ Republican John McCain said Wednesday he was suspending his White House campaign and asked to put off Friday ’s presidential debate over the nation ’s financial crisis . ”
Are he and Obama real players here ?
Can they be ?
They ’ve felt very irrelevant .
R.R. :
They could be , and Dodd and Frank are very likely coordinating with Obama .
I doubt McCain is coordinating with anyone .
But if McCain is now calling for suspending all campaigning , including Friday ’s debate , he must sense that Obama is getting the upper hand in all of this .
Obama ’s polls are rising because the public apparently believes he ’ll handle this crisis best .
In other words , McCain ’s move has all the trappings of politics as usual .
B.S. : Yeah , the only thing that ’s changed in the last 24 hours is the polls .
The crisis is n’t new .
R.R. : Right .
And McCain wants to stop Obama ’s momentum — just as he did after the Democratic convention with his surprise pick of Palin .
Here ’s another McCain Surprise to stop the Obama momentum .
But I do n’t think it will work this time .
B.S. : Why not ?
R.R. :
The public ( and the media ) can see through it .
With less than six weeks to go , it ’s patently absurd to stop campaigning .
Plus , the financial crisis may last for many weeks — right through the election .
So does that mean no more campaigning ?
B.S. : So how does Obama react ?
R.R. : If I were Obama , I ’d call it for what it is — another McCain political ploy — and I ’d say , truthfully , that this is precisely the time when candidates need to be heard on one of the biggest crises of our time .
B.S. : You defended Obama ’s left flank , very effectively , in the primary .
What do you think of where he is now on the issues you care about , like trade and health care ?
R.R. :
The financial crisis has driven everything else out of the news .
No one is talking about trade .
No one is even talking about health care .
By the way , I do like where he is on both .
And I ’m also very pleased by how specific and tough his conditions are with regard to the Wall Street bailout .
As to “ guarding his left flank , ” though , I would n’t say that ’s been my job .
Unlike every other candidate I ’ve ever advised — and there have been a number — he does n’t think in terms of left or right .
One last thought : A financial crisis of this magnitude has not occurred in more than 70 years — and it ’s happening under a wildly unpopular lame - duck president with almost no public credibility , six weeks before an election .
If the nation can make sensible decisions now , I ’d be surprised and impressed .
If it can’t , we ’re likely to be in big doo - doo , as one of our former presidents might have put it .

LA JOLLA , CA - Body weight and fertility have long known to be related to each other - women who are too thin , for example , can have trouble becoming pregnant .
Now , a master switch has been found in the brain of mice that controls both , and researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies say it may work the same way in humans .
Findings from the study , published ahead of print in the Aug. 31 online edition of Nature Medicine , suggest that variations in the gene that produces this master switch , known as TORC1 , could contribute a genetic component to obesity and infertility , and might be regulated with a novel drug .
" This gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain , " says Marc Montminy , Ph.D. , a professor in the Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology , who led the study .
" It likely plays a pivotal role in how much we , as humans , eat and whether we have offspring . "
It is just as important as leptin , the well - known star regulator of appetite , Montminy says , because leptin turns on TORC1 , which in turn activates a number of genes known to help control feeding and fertility .
Judith Altarejos Ph.D. , first author on this study , had been trying to understand human energy balance , and what can go awry to promote obesity , diabetes and other metabolic syndromes .
In this study , she looked at the signals that travel from body fat to the brain , informing the brain of how well fed the body is .
The primary hormone that performs that function is leptin , which travels through the bloodstream to the hypothalamus in the brain ( the appetite center ) , keeping the brain aware of the body 's nutritional status .
" Leptin tells the brain that times are good , your body is full , and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment , " Montminy says .
The hormone also is known to play a role in reproduction - although , until this study , no one understood what is was .
( Very thin women often do not have periods . )
" Controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage , " Montminy says .
" If there is no food , the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat , a baby 's growth in the womb could be stunted , and without food to replenish the body 's energy reserves , there will be nothing to feed the offspring . "
" Leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten ; 99.9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use , " he says .
" The problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time , and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight . "
Obesity results when the brain becomes " deaf " to the leptin signal , so one goal of Montminy 's research is to " try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard . "
But to do that , he and his research team first have to understand all of the signals involved in the satiety pathway .
Through years of research , they have uncovered a family of genes that act as energy switches , turning other genes on or off .
One gene , TORC2 , acts like a fasting switch that flips on the production of glucose in the liver when blood glucose levels run low , usually during sleep .
During the day , the hormone insulin normally shuts down TORC2 , ensuring that blood sugar levels do n't rise too high .
Problems along the pathway , however , can help lead to diabetes .
In this study , Altarejos looked at the function of TORC1 , which she knew was produced in the brain - unlike TORC2 and TORC3 - but did n't know what its function was .
To do this , she created mice that lacked one or both copies of the TORC1 gene - the first such " knock - out " mice to be developed .
Mice born without TORC1 looked fine at birth , but at about eight weeks , they began to gain weight and became persistently obese in adulthood , with two to three times as much adipose fat as normal mice , and they also became insulin resistant .
" Their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders , " Montminy says .
They also discovered , to their surprise , that mice of both sexes were infertile ; the uteri and ovaries in female mice were anatomically dysfunctional , for example .
" We do n't study infertility , but we put two and two together , " he says .
" We knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight , and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction . "
Altarejos discovered that TORC1 , which is found within nerve cells , responds to signals from leptin , which binds to receptors on the outside of the same cells .
TORC1 then turns on a spate of genes , two of which are well known .
One is the CART ( Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript ) gene that is known to stifle appetite .
The other , KISS1 ( named by its discoverers at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center ) is required for reproduction ; mutations in the gene produce human infertility .
So when leptin binds with its receptor on brain cells , it turns on TORC1 , which , in turns activates CART to suppress appetite , because more food is not needed , and KISS1 , signaling reproduction can now commence in this well - fed body .
Conversely , when leptin is not activating brain receptors , TORC1 is turned off , as are CART and KISS1 .
They also discovered that when mice inherit only one TORC1 gene ( instead of the normal two , one from each parent ) , fertility is restored but the mice gain more weight than normal mice .
" This suggests that half of the dose of TORC switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain , and it may be that subtle mutations in TORC1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight , " Montminy says .
Tweaking mutated and inefficient TORC genes may be possible through drug therapy , he adds .
" TORC1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases , and kinases often make for very good drug targets , " Montminy says .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will not cooperate with a legislative investigation into the firing of her public safety commissioner , the McCain - Palin presidential campaign announced Monday , accusing supporters of Democratic rival Barack Obama of manipulating the inquiry for political motivations .
Gov. Sarah Palin is fighting allegations she improperly tried to force the firing of her former brother - in - law .
Former Palin Press Secretary Meg Stapleton told reporters in Anchorage that the investigation has been " hijacked " by " Obama operatives " for the Democratic presidential nominee -- namely , Alaska state Sen .
Hollis French , the Democratic lawmaker managing the investigation and an Obama supporter .
French has denied working on behalf of the Obama campaign .
The Obama campaign described Stapleton 's charge as " complete paranoia . "
It has denied sending campaign staff to Alaska to work with the legislative committee 's investigation .
McCain campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan said Palin will not cooperate with " that investigation so long as it remained tainted and run by partisan individuals who have a predetermined conclusion , " referring to a comment by French earlier this month that the case could produce criminal charges or an " October Surprise " for the GOP ticket .
Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president , is battling allegations that she and her advisers pressured then - Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to fire a state trooper going through a bitter custody dispute with her sister -- and that Monegan was terminated when he refused .
Palin says she fired Monegan over budget issues and denies wrongdoing .
Monegan has said that while no one directly demanded Trooper Mike Wooten 's dismissal , he felt pressured to do so by Palin , her husband and staff .
He said he believes his refusal to fire the trooper led to his own firing .
Upon the dismissal , Monegan was offered a position as executive director of the Alcohol Beverage and Control Board , but turned it down .
Palin 's lawyers say the investigation -- which the Legislature commissioned on a bipartisan basis in July -- belongs before the state Personnel Board , which met to consider the request Thursday .
On Friday , Alaska lawmakers voted to subpoena Palin 's husband , several aides and phone records in their investigation .
Stapleton said Palin 's attorneys have turned over to the board e-mails that contain " new information that exonerates Palin and proves Monegan 's egregious insubordination . "
Monegan allegedly worked against Palin over his department 's budget , making repeated requests to Congress " for funding that was out of line for every other commissioner and agency , " she said .
" The final straw came in late June , when Commissioner Monegan arranged for another unauthorized trip to D.C. to request more money from Congress , " Stapleton said .
The campaign also disputed recent comments Monegan made to ABC News , in which he accused Palin of lying during her wide - ranging interview with ABC's Charles Gibson last week .
Palin told Gibson , " I never pressured him to hire or fire anybody . "
She said she welcomed the investigation and did not worry about the subpoena of her husband , Todd Palin .
" There 's nothing to hide , " she said .
" I know that Todd , too , never pressured Commissioner Monegan .
He did , very appropriately , though , bring up those concerns about a trooper [ Wooten ] who was making threats against the first family , and that is appropriate . "
Monegan rebutted Palin 's comments , saying , " She 's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten , " according to an interview posted on ABC News.com .
" And she 's not telling the truth to the media about her reasons for firing me . "

The exorcism of voodoo economics
September 2 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
Why do Republicans seem to think that they best know how to run the economy when every indicator says otherwise ?
The stark contrast between the whiz - bang Clinton years and the dreary Bush years is familiar because it is so recent .
But while it is extreme , it is not atypical .
Data for the whole period from 1948 to 2007 , during which Republicans occupied the White House for 34 years and Democrats for 26 , show average annual growth of real gross national product of 1.64 percent per capita under Republican presidents versus 2.78 percent under Democrats .
That 1.14 - point difference , if maintained for eight years , would yield 9.33 percent more income per person , which is a lot more than almost anyone can expect from a tax cut .
But it ’s not just growth .
The whole idea of “ trickle down ” ( or as George H.W .
Bush famously dubbed it , “ voodoo economics ” ) has been proven a sham both in practice and now on paper :
Professor Bartels unearths a stunning statistical regularity :
Over the entire 60 - year period , income inequality trended substantially upward under Republican presidents but slightly downward under Democrats , thus accounting for the widening income gaps over all .
Or in more basic terms :
It shows that when Democrats were in the White House , lower - income families experienced slightly faster income growth than higher - income families — which means that incomes were equalizing .
In stark contrast , it also shows much faster income growth for the better - off when Republicans were in the White House — thus widening the gap in income .
Anyone who is not a member of the top percentile of filthy rich already knew that in their hearts , but once again it is nice to have statistical proof .
Especially in light of reports such as this :
This Labor Day finds workers in worse shape than they ’ve been in years , according to a scorecard released Monday by Rutgers University .
In its first national labor scorecard , the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations said more than 10 percent of Americans are unemployed , discouraged from seeking work or underemployed .
That is a nearly 25 - percent increase from one year earlier .
and this :
– The median weekly earnings for American workers have not grown in real terms over the last eight years .
–
At $ 6.55 , the federal minimum wage is worth 40 cents less per hour , in inflation - adjusted dollars , than it was a decade ago .
So wait , it ’s not all in our heads ?
But the real question is , what does this mean in the real world ?
Is this just an exercise for egghead economics professors or are there honest - to - god real world implications of these findings ?
The two Great Partisan Divides combine to suggest that , if history is a guide , an Obama victory in November would lead to faster economic growth with less inequality , while a McCain victory would lead to slower economic growth with more inequality .
Ahhh .
There it is .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Fortune ) -- Harold Bradley manages $ 2.1 billion for the Kansas City , Mo. - based Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation .
If you are a venture capitalist looking for a new limited partner , he 's got something to tell you .
" Do n't stop in here , " he says .
" Do n't try and sell me on a new fund , and good luck trying with everyone else . "
Venture capital , as every VC is happy to tell you , operates on seven - to - ten - year cycles .
Firms do n't , for the most part , use debt to fund their companies .
So in theory they should be shielded from the financial mess that has laid waste to some of the largest financial institutions in the world .
But no one is getting out of this unscathed , and certainly not the gang that occupies Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley .
The conversation among limited partners in VC funds these days is all about liquidity , Bradley says .
Who 's got it , and who does n't .
Hiding your money in illiquid venture capital funds looked pretty good six or 12 months ago .
But if you are an endowment or pension fund with a huge exposure to a mega - buyout firm that is cratering , a hedge fund that is being wiped out or a venture fund that is on a seven - year runway to returns ( in a market with no exits ) , what you want is cash now - not a one , three or five year wait to cash in .
So what does the financial crisis mean for VCs and for startups ?
For starters , if you are a second or third - tier venture firm trying to raise another fund , you can , as Bradley suggests , forget about it .
Before the market meltdown it might have been OK for a pension fund or university endowment to park money in an underperforming VC fund as a limited partner .
But going forward , all bets are off .
Venture capital operates via commitments .
A limited partner pledges a certain amount to a fund , and as the VC firm needs it , it makes capital calls to get that money to fund its portfolio companies .
If you do n't pony up when asked , you typically lose all your prior investment and are frozen out going forward .
After the dotcom crash , capital calls came from VC firms and some limited partners simply said no - whether it was because they were wiped out in the Internet implosion , or they did n't want to throw good money after bad .
It could be worse this time around .
" My expectation is that it will start first in some private equity funds , that there will be a substantial miss on a capital call , and we 'll see it next in venture capital , " says Paul Kedrosky , an investor and academic focused on the future of risk capital and writer of the business blog Infectious Greed .
" No one is going to stiff Kleiner Perkins , but the second or third - tier guys will get stiffed all day long . "
If you are a startup backed by a VC firm with loads of limited partners that are exposed to the Wall Street meltdown , or are mostly funded by angel investors without deep pockets , now is when you start to worry and need to consider a future without that next round of funding .
" Any LP can be at risk , " says Mark Tluszcz , co-founder and managing partner at one of the leading European venture firms , Mangrove Capital .
" If there is a big LP , whether it is a bank or an insurance company , if they are facing serious financial issues they are going to cut back on their commitments . "
Says Warren Weiss , a partner with Palo Alto - Calif . - based VC firm Foundation Capital : " If you are a private company with a big cash burn , you are in for some pretty tough times .
We 're going to see more fire sales than mergers .
You 'll see a lot of companies in the $ 200 - $ 400 million range that can't go public now , get acquired .
The weak will get weeded out . "
With hedge funds , buyout shops , even venture debt funds mostly on the sidelines , money is about to get really tight .
The pressure will fall on VCs to decide which of their portfolio companies live and which die .
Weiss believes liquidity is the key to navigating the next 12 to 18 months .
" If you are a startup or a limited partner , it 's no cash , no company , " Weiss says .
Bryan LeBlanc , CFO of Portland , Ore. - based startup Jive Software , agrees .
" If you are not cash - flow positive you are in a tough spot right now , " says LeBlanc , whose company develops collaboration software for the workplace .
Jive is in relatively good shape , because it has significant revenue , was bootstrapped for the first six years , and only recently raised its first round of funding from Sequoia Capital .
" To the extent you have n't figured out your business model yet you are in trouble , because it 's going to be hard to get another round , " LeBlanc says .
" You are n't going to get a second life this time . "
Brian Jacobs , a partner with San Mateo , Calif . - based Emergence Capital , is anticipating a shakeout .
" There will be some realignment among firms and startups , " he says , " but the bottom line is it just got a lot harder to make money in the venture capital business than a year ago - and maybe that is the way it should be . "

The greatest human invention ever , the thing that makes our human lives worth living and will serve as our greatest legacy for the future is …the birdbath .
Okay , I admit , that may be a bit over the top … but still .
Why am I chirping with praise for the humble , simple birdbath ?
Because I find it hard to point out anything that offers us more certain and frequent chances for complete joy , hilarity , curiosity , surprise , and wonder .
How so ?
Because , obviously enough , birdbaths are the frequent haunts of those marvelous spritely beings called birds .
Once upon a time some long time ago , some wise human happened to notice that birds do lots of funny things in the various natural pools of water that form up just about anywhere –be it in a pothole , in the hollow of a log , in a backed - up drainage ditch , or in even the slightest depression .
And this wise human then thought , “ Hey , maybe if I make something to keep some water in and put it in some conspicuous place , the birds will come and do those things in it , too ! ”
So this wise human went home , went scavenger hunting in the garage , and behold !
The first birdbath was born .
Whoever that wise human was , I thank him or her from the bottom of my heart .
After all , without somebody having bothered to mimic nature by creating constant puddles for birds to play in , where would human life be nowadays ?
Would we have birdbaths to place everywhere and anywhere we can ?
Would we have all makes and models and prices of birdbaths to choose from ?
Would we have accessories like birdbath warmers or motorized fountain - makers to make this simple thing more complex ?
But I digress .
I know you will join with me in rejoicing over birdbaths if you simply recall some of the many things you can observe there .
Birds put on a show for us in many different ways :
When they bathe , they seem like little fluttering gizmos , flicking their wings and flapping their feathers , dipping and diving and splashing about .
And once they are wet … they look so comical with their spiky feathers sticking every which way , like a little kid after a bath .
When they drink , you cannot help but laugh as they tip forward , scoop up some water in their beaks , stand up tall , tip back their heads , and wiggle their gullets so the water goes down .
Sometimes , I swear they even seem to smack their lips–er , beaks–as if in satisfaction .
I am just waiting to hear one let out a healthy belch one day .
I am also waiting for someone to invent a bird straw .
When they eat , they often employ birdbaths to help them .
All those dry seeds surely require something to keep birds ’ mouths and tummies adequately moist .
But a birdbath is a handy tool in other gustatory ways , too .
I once saw a crow , which as a whole are true geniuses of the animal kingdom , bring a big chunk of bread to the birdbath , dip it in and swish it around to get it softened , and then eat it with perfect ease .
When they need to chit - chat , they often congregate at the birdbath , much as humans like to share some news at the water cooler or knock down a few rounds with friends at the local pub .
Bird feeders are nice , but in all honesty they tend to be a bit boring .
I mean , what happens ?
A bird flies up , grabs a bit of seed takeout , and then flies away like a teenager from a fast - food restaurant .
Or a more patient diner will plop down and dig in as if at a buffet .
That is about it …flying , perching , and eating .
Birdbaths , however , are constant places of excitement , of hustle and bustle and humorous activity .
Even better , birdbaths are great places for other wildlife experiences , too .
Just about any day you can expect to see at least a squirrel , maybe a cat .
Sometimes ( depending on where you live ) you may get wilder critters , too–even deer , raccoons , or bears .
In the sweltering heat of summer , birdbaths are relaxing , refreshing oases for our friends great and small , feathered or otherwise clad .
In the freezing days of winter , a birdbath filled with hot water is like a gift for the holidays to warm everyone ’s heart .
Yes , birds can be a bit liberal in their patronage of birdbaths .
I mean , would you ( without at least some form of treatment ) drink the water you bathe in ?
Or that you poop in ?
So birdbaths need us to keep them clean and to keep their waters flowing freshly so that our feathered friends keep flocking to them faithfully .
No human invention is perfect , of course–even this , the greatest invention to our credit .
Nevertheless , however flawed they may be in some ways , birdbaths will forever remind us that human ingenuity can do wonders –especially when it follows , and also serves , any one of nature ’s wonders .

In his sweep across Europe last week , President Bush found a continent that has largely moved beyond him .
The American president who enraged and infuriated Europeans over everything from military intervention in Iraq to climate change and once provoked massive street protests was greeted this time like a former boyfriend who is no longer even worth fighting with .
The Olympic flame 's passage through the streets of Europe brought out more protesters than Bush did - by a lot .
" This is an American president at the end of his mandate who awakens more indifference than passion , " the right - leaning French newspaper Le Figaro announced before Bush 's arrival in Paris .
Bush himself caught the spirit at the start of his tour in Slovenia when he said , " Lots of people like America .
It 's possible that they do n't necessarily like its president . "
The French left - leaning Liberation newspaper congratulated Bush for his lucidity .
Friends in high places
Some European leaders are not unfriendly to Bush .
In his speech last week in Paris , Bush mentioned by name Nicolas Sarkozy of France , Angela Merkel of Germany , Gordon Brown of Britain , and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy , and thanked them for supporting the US campaign in Afghanistan .
Sarkozy ran for president a year ago as pro-American in contrast with his predecessor , Jacques Chirac , who vehemently condemned America 's march to war in Iraq .
On this presidential visit , the rift with France officially was deemed a piece of history .
" Recent history has made clear that no disagreement can diminish the deep ties between our nations , " Bush said .
Sarkozy expressed the " deep gratitude of the French people and our friendship . "
Sarkozy visited the Bush family estate in Kennebunkport , Maine , last August and was served hamburgers and hot dogs .
He got a warm welcome on his first official visit to Washington in November .
Sarkozy greeted Bush on the steps of the Élysée Palace with a smile and a handshake when he arrived for a private dinner Friday night .
In a separate hall of the palace , Sarkozy 's new wife , the singer and former fashion model Carla Bruni , had a tête - à - tête with Laura Bush before the dinner .
Cultivating experience
At the Vatican , some cardinals objected when Pope Benedict XVI gave Bush a rare welcome , taking him on a friendly stroll through the Vatican gardens and stopping at a grotto where the pontiff prays daily .
" Your Eminence , you 're looking good , " Bush told the pope .
Later , as Benedict pointed out the view from a balcony in St. John 's Tower in the gardens , Bush exclaimed : " This is fantastic up here . "
A number of Vatican prelates were uncomfortable with the " warmth " of the pope 's reception for Bush , according to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica .
Bush was the first head of state to be received in the gardens rather than in the pope 's library in the Apostolic Palace .
" So much attention to a president who did not take any account of the appeal which the Holy Father launched to avoid a second war with Iraq , " lamented one cardinal , according to the newspaper .
Benedict presented Bush , who leaves office in January , with a four - volume work about St. Peter 's Basilica .
" Perhaps you 'll have some time to read it , " the pope said .

In this Photoshop tutorial I 'll show you how to create an old world style wax seal using just a few layers , layer styles and the pen tool .
Step 1
( * note : This tutorial assumes you have at least a cursory knowledge of the Pen tool . )
We ’ll begin where all good Photoshop exercises do by opening a new document .
Mine is 540x320 px at 72 p pi but as always you can adjust this to your hearts desire .
Just remember that if you ’re creating an image at a higher ppi or even larger on the canvas , you ’ll need to adjust your layer styles to look right along the way .
Lets jump right in and create the outer ring of wax .
Grab the Pen tool by pressing the P key , click a starting point and then click and bend the segments to create the exterior perimeter of the wax seal .
Typically these seals have a smooth wavy outline like the completed path below .
Step 2
Before we go any further lets click over to the Paths palette and name this new path Wax Outline .
Now lets draw the inner boundary for this area of our wax .
With the Pen tool still selected make sure that the Exclude Overlapping Path Areas option is selected and then create a new lightly wavy inner circle as shown in the example below .
Notice that both paths are contained in the Wax Outline path layer and the path layer thumbnail indeed shows the new path has subtracted the center area from our object .
Step 3
With the outer area of the wax drawn as paths lets switch over to the Layers palette and create a new layer called Wax Edge .
Press the A key to invoke the Path Selection Tool and click and drag a selection around the entire path on the stage to select the entire thing .
Every point on your path should now show up as a solid black square .
Step 4
Now that the entire path is selected Control - Click ( PC : Right - Click ) on the path and choose Create Vector Mask from the menu .
This will create a mask on the Wax Edge layer based on the paths we have selected .
Step 5
In the Tools palette change the foreground color to # bb362e and press Option - Delete ( PC : Alt - Backspace ) to fill the layer with that color .
Notice that only the area exposed by the layer mask is showing through .
Step 6
For reasons I ’ll explain later we ’re going to need a duplicate copy of this layer , so lets create that duplicate now by pressing Command - J ( PC : Ctrl - J ) .
Call the lower layer Shadow .
Step 7
Make sure the Wax Edge layer is selected in the Layers palette and lets add a few Layer Styles to bring our wax edge to life .
Command - Click ( PC : Right - Click ) on the Wax Edge layer and choose Blending Options from the menu to bring up the Layer Styles dialog box and add the following Drop Shadow and Contour .
Be sure to check every single setting as many of them have been changed .
Depending on the size and resolution of your object you may need to adjust the sizes of the styles accordingly to get a look you ’re happy with .
Step 8
Your Wax Edge should now be looking something like this .
Step 9
Next we ’re going to create the center of the wax seal by using pieces we ’ve already created .
Pay close attention here so you do n’t get lost .
Click on the Shadow layer and duplicate it by pressing Command - J ( PC : Ctrl - J ) .
Name this new layer Wax Center .
So that we can work with this new layer clearly lets hide the Shadow and Wax Edge layers by clicking on the little eye icon next to each in the Layers palette .
Step 10
Press the A key to switch to the Path Selection tool if it ’s not still selected .
Click on the outer path to select it and then press Delete ( PC : Backspace ) to remove it .
This will instantly switch the color to the inside of the inner circle .
Step 11
This inner circle we ’ve now created is the exact size of the center of our wax , it is common however in this sort of situation for a small outline of white to appear between the inner and outer pieces so we ’re going to expand this inner area a bit .
Click on the path to select it and then press Command - T ( PC : Ctrl - T ) to invoke the Free Transform tool .
Instead of clicking and dragging the corner points we ’re going to use the Free Transform options bar to do all the work .
Click the Maintain Aspect Ratio icon between the Width and Height size percentage fields to insure a perfect transformation , then enter 105 % into the Width field and notice that the Height field changes to 105 % instantly .
Press the Return ( PC : Enter ) key twice to commit the transformation of the path .
Step 12
Go ahead and unhide the Wax Edge and Shadow layers now and if you do n’t want to see the paths on stage you can press Command - H ( PC : Ctrl - H ) to hide them .
Step 13
Making sure the Wax Center layer is selected add the following Bevel and Emboss , Contour and Satin layer styles .
These styles will allow the center of our wax stamp to blend with the edge softly and will create a nice rounded transition between the two .
Remember to check each individual setting to insure you do n’t miss anything .
Step 14
If you got the layer styles right this is what your wax seal should be looking like thus far .
Step 15
While we ’re in the mode of adding layer styles , lets add a Drop Shadow and Outer Glow to the Shadow layer as well .
Notice that I ’ve changed the color and blend mode of the Outer Glow style to black and multiply .
By doing this I can add an even outer shadow of just a few pixels around the whole object to make it look like it ’s sitting on the surface a little nicer .
Remember when I said I ’d explain why we ’d made this duplicate of the Wax Edge layer ?
Well here you go …
If we had added this Layer Style to the Wax Edge layer , the shadow would have also been cast across the Wax Center layer on the inside and would have ruined the effect , but by having a duplicate copy hiding at the bottom of the layer stack we can apply the shadow and it only shows up where it ’s supposed to at the outer edge of our seal .
Pretty tricky eh ?
Step 16
Now that our wax seal is built we can add a detail to the center of it that will finalize the effect .
I ’m going to use one of the shapes from my Heraldic Custom Shapes set , but you can use any custom shape you ’d like , even text .
Create a new layer above the Wax Center layer ( I ’ll call mine Heraldic Shape since that ’s what I ’m putting on it ) .
Press the U key to switch to the Custom Shape tool , make sure the Custom Shape blob is selected in the Options bar at the top of Photoshop and that the Paths option is also selected .
Choose a custom shape from the Custom Shape picker and then click and drag your shape path onto the stage .
Step 17
Just like we did earlier , lets convert this path to a Vector Mask by first switching to the Path Selection tool by pressing the A key and then Command - Clicking ( PC : Right - Clicking ) on the path and choosing Create Vector Mask from the menu .
Now fill the layer with color by pressing Option - Delete ( PC : Alt - Backspace ) – any color will be fine because we ’re going to drop the layer ’s Fill opacity to 0 % as well .
If you did n’t get that hint , now would be a good time to drop the Fill opacity of this new layer to 0 % in the Layers palette .
Step 18
Press Command - H ( PC : Ctrl - H ) to hide the paths and then add a Bevel and Emboss and Contour to this layer as well .
Since we ’ve set the Fill opacity of the layer to 0 % but the Opacity is still set to 100 % the bevel and emboss will show as highlight and shadow areas but will allow the underlying layer tones to show through .
Step 19
The finished wax seal should now look like this .
Step 20
In my final image I added a piece of string below the seal and some folded old paper for the wax seal to live on .
You can learn to make both of these pieces in other tutorials I ’ve written .
I also added a clipping mask from the Heraldic Shape layer to the Wax Center layer which allowed even more of the color from the underlying layer to appear on the Heraldic Shape .

GOP CLOSE TO SELECTION OF OCTOBER SURPRISE
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON -- ( PTSD News ) --
Sources close to Republican party leadership say that they are close to making the final selection for this election season 's October surprise .
" This year presents a special challenge due to the Democrat - caused September surprise of the economy meltdown which has dealt a tough blow to McCain , " said Dick Cromwell , a senior Republican strategist .
" We 've narrowed it down to either the invasion of Iran , the bombing of a domestic landmark or an outbreak of the bird flu in the U.S. , preferably in a blue state , " said Bascombe Tinsdale , Vice Chairman of the Republican Party .
Karl Rove told Fox News that he was not involved with Republican strategy anymore , but that if he was , he would suggest that the GOP may need to use all three October Surprises as " McCain and Palin have messed it up so badly .
There are only so many votes you can steal , you know . "
" Maybe we can cancel or postpone the election until the financial crisis is solved , " said Mary Randolph , chairman of the Montana Republicans .
Her idea was welcomed by President [ sic ]
Bush who said , " I second that emotion as I could sure use more time to finish the privicating of socialist security by putting that money on Wall Street to help the financial crisis .
You know that would kill two stones with one bird , and I 'd like to be the one to give America the bird . "

Vast greenhouses that use seawater to grow crops could be combined with solar power plants to provide food , fresh water and clean energy in deserts , under an ambitious proposal from a team of architects and engineers .
The Sahara Forest project would marry huge greenhouses with concentrated solar power ( CSP ) , which uses mirrors to focus the sun 's rays and generate heat and electricity .
The installations would turn deserts into lush patches of vegetation , according to its designers , and without the need to dig wells for fresh water , which has depleted acquifers in many parts of the world .
The team includes one of the lead architects behind Cornwall 's Eden project and demonstration plants are already running in Tenerife , Oman and the United Arab Emirates .
Plants cannot grow in deserts because of the extreme temperatures and lack of nutrients and water .
Charlie Paton , one of the Sahara Forest team and the inventor of the seawater greenhouse concept , said his technology was a proven way to transform arid environments .
" Plants need light for growth but they do n't like heat beyond a certain point , " said Paton .
Above a particular temperature , the amount of water lost through the holes in its leaves , called stomata , gets so large that a plant will shut down photosynthesis and cannot grow .
The greenhouses work by using the solar farm to power seawater evaporators and then pump the damp , cool air through the greenhouse .
This reduces the temperature by about 15C compared to that outside .
At the other end of the greenhouse from the evaporators , the water vapour is condensed .
Some of this fresh water is used to water the crops , while the rest can be used for the essential task of cleaning the solar mirrors .
" So we 've got conditions in the greenhouse of high humidity and lower temperature , " said Paton .
" The crops sitting in this slightly steamy , humid condition can grow fantastically well . "
The designers said that virtually any vegetables could be grown in the greenhouses , depending on the conditions at which it is maintained .
The demonstration plants already produce lettuces , peppers , cucumbers and tomatoes .
The nutrients to grow the plants could come from local seaweed or even be extracted from the seawater itself .
Michael Pawlyn of Exploration Architecture , who worked on the Eden Project for seven years and is now part of the Sahara Forest team , said the seawater greenhouse and CSP provided substantial synergies for each other .
" Both technologies work extremely well in hot , dry desert locations – CSP produces a lot of waste heat and we'd be able to use that to evaporate more seawater from the greenhouse , " he said .
" And CSP needs a supply of clean , demineralised water in order for the [ electricity generating ] turbines to function and to keep the mirrors at peak output .
It just so happens the seawater greenhouse produces large quantities of this . "
Paton said that the greenhouse produces more than five times the fresh water needed to water the plants inside so , in addition to producing water to clean the CSP mirrors , some of it can be released into the local environment .
This can create a local microclimate just outside the greenhouses for hardier plants such as jatropha , an energy crop that can be turned into biofuel .
The ability to create similar microclimates has already been proven in the demonstration greenhouses Paton has built .
The cost of the Sahara Forest project could be relatively low since both CSP and seawater greenhouses are proven technologies – the designers estimate that building 20 hectares of greenhouses combined with a 10MW CSP scheme would cost around € 80 m ( £ 65 m ) .
Paton said groups in countries across the Middle East , including UAE , Oman , Bahrain , Qatar and Kuwait , have expressed interest in the possibility of funding demonstration projects .
He added that using seawater greenhouses could reverse the environmental damage done by the greenhouses already built in places such as Almeria in southern Spain .
More than 40,000 hectares of greenhouses have been built in this desert region during the past 20 years to grow salad vegetables .
" They take water out of the ground something like five times faster than it comes in , so the water table drops and becomes more saline .
The whole of Spain is being sucked dry .
If one were to convert them all to the seawater greenhouse concept , it would turn an unsustainable solution into a more sustainable one . "
" In places like Oman , they 've effectively sterilised large areas of land by using groundwater that 's become increasingly saline , " said Pawlyn .
" The beauty of the Sahara Forest scheme is that you can reverse that process and turn barren land into biologically - productive land . "
Neil Crumpton , an energy specialist at Friends of the Earth , said the potential of desert technologies was huge .
" Concentrated solar power mirror arrays covering just one per cent of the Earth 's deserts could supply a fifth of all current global energy consumption .
And one million tonnes of sea water could be evaporated every day from just 20,000 hectares of greenhouses . "
He added : " Governments around the world should invest serious money in these solar energy and water technologies and not be distracted by lobbyists promoting dangerous nuclear power or nuclear - powered desalination schemes . "
Harnessing the desert sun 's rays is already at the heart of an ambitious European scheme to build a € 45bn ( £ 35.7 bn ) supergrid that could allow countries across the continent to share renewable electricity from solar power in north Africa , wind energy in the UK and Denmark , and geothermal energy from Iceland and Italy .
The north Africa solar plan has already gained political support in Europe from Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy .
Though expensive , it is in line with International Energy Agency estimates that the world needs to invest more than $ 45tn ( £ 22.5tn ) in new energy systems over the next 30 years .

TRIPOLI , Libya ( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Friday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who asked for the latest news on the hurricanes plaguing U.S. coasts in recent weeks .
Condoleezza Rice and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi discussed the weather Friday at their initial meeting .
" The first one was not as bad as feared , but there are two more coming , " Rice told the man dubbed by President Reagan " the mad dog in the Middle East . "
Rice 's visit is the first time in more than half a century that a U.S. secretary of state has visited the former pariah nation .
Upon her arrival , Rice met with the Libyan foreign minister and then toured the new U.S. Embassy .
" We are working on a trade and investment agreement , a framework , which will allow the improvement of the climate for investment , which I know very many American firms wish to do , " Rice said after her meeting with Minister Abdel - Rahman Shalgam .
She called the meeting a " good start " toward establishing a " positive relationship " with Libya .
Do n't Miss Behind the scenes in Libya
Rice and Gadhafi met in a reception room at the Libyan 's Bab el - Azizia compound .
Gadhafi , wearing a white robe and a black fez but not his trademark dark sunglasses , shook the hands of the male members of Rice 's staff but not Rice , instead offering the traditional greeting of his hand over his heart for her .
Watch excitement in Libya at Rice 's trip »
Muslim men are prohibited from shaking hands with women to whom they are not related .
After their meeting , Rice joined Gadhafi , who once called Rice " Leeza ... my darling black African woman , " in a traditional Muslim evening meal breaking the fast during the holy month of Ramadan .
Last year in an interview with Al - Jazeera , Gadhafi suggested Rice ran the Arab world with which he has sometimes had stark differences .
" I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders , " he said .
" I love her very much ... because she 's a black woman of African origin . "
The two are expected to meet in the leader 's Bedouin tent he favors for high - profile meetings
Rice 's visit marks a 180 - degree turn in relations between Washington and Tripoli , which for more than three decades have been marked by personal animosity and insults , Libyan terror attacks and U.S. airstrikes .
Libya 's rehabilitation from being dubbed a " state sponsor of terrorism " to a member of the U.N. Security Council represents a rare foreign policy success for the Bush administration in its last months in office .
In Lisbon , before flying to Tripoli , Rice called her trip " a historic moment and it is one that has come after a lot of difficulty , the suffering of many people that will never be forgotten or assuaged , a lot of Americans in particular . "
Libya , she acknowledged , " is a place that is changing and I want to discuss how that change is taking place . "
" I am very much looking forward to it , " she told reporters
The United States restored relations with Tripoli in 2005 , after Gadhafi 's decision to abandon his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction , renounce terrorism and compensate victims of the 1986 La Belle disco bombing in Berlin and the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland .
It also dropped Libya from its State Sponsors of Terrorism list , the only country except for Iraq to have been removed .
Since then , several U.S. officials have visited Tripoli and Rice has met several times with her Libyan counterpart .
The United States opened its embassy in Tripoli in 2006 .
The United States has praised Libya 's cooperation in fighting terrorism in North Africa , where al Qaeda has been gaining a foothold .
U.S. officials also say Gadhafi has prevented Libyan and other foreign fighters from traveling to Iraq to join insurgent movements .
At the United Nations , Libya has also voted with the United States to crack down on Iran 's nuclear program and has sought to play a helpful role in the crisis in Darfur .
Yet relations between the two countries face strains over Libya 's poor human rights record and final settlement of claims from the La Belle and Lockerbie bombings .
In her meetings with Libyan officials , Rice is expected to raise the issue of political prisoners , especially Fathi al - Jahami , a leading Libyan reformer held in detention since 2002 .
Last month the United States and Libya reached a deal to resolve outstanding claims for the bombings , but Libya has yet to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to a fund set up to compensate the bombing victims ' families .
Many of the Lockerbie victims ' families have criticized Rice 's decision to meet with Gadhafi , whom they say remains unrepentant for the explosion , which killed 280 people , 180 of them Americans .
In a recent interview with the BBC , Gadhafi 's son , Saif al - Islam al - Gadhafi , called the Lockerbie families " very greedy " and " trading with the blood of their sons and daughters " for money .
The Bush administration has expressed sympathy with the Lockerbie families but says it is time to move forward with a new relationship with Libya .
The deal paves the way for greater access by American companies to Libya 's booming economy , in particular its vast oil reserves , the ninth largest in the world .
European companies have had much greater access to Libya 's energy sector , but Libyan officials say the improved relations with the United States will result in more deals with American oil companies , including exploring vast areas of the country that remain untapped .
The country 's growing banking , infrastructure and telecommunications sectors also offer enormous opportunities for American investors .
Rice will travel throughout North Africa after leaving Tripoli , stopping in Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia .
But it is the visit to Libya that the State Department recognizes will be the most talked about .

Blizzard has won its summary judgment motion against World of Warcraft bot maker MDY on copyright grounds .
Blizzard also prevailed on its tortious interference claim .
This means that liability for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement and tortious interference is completely off the table and will not go to the jury at trial in September , assuming that the parties do not settle before then .
The only issue before the jury on these two claims will be damages .
This is a major setback for MDY , which originally brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that its WowGlider ( now MMOGlider ) bot software did not infringe Blizzard ’s copyright .
For the background of this suit , see Virtually Blind ’s complete coverage of MDY v. Blizzard .
Here is today ’s Order re : Blizzard ’s and MDY ’s Summary Judgment Motions ( .pdf ) .
The Court ultimately held that :
Blizzard owns a valid copyright in the game client software , Blizzard has granted a limited license for WoW players to use the software , use of the software with Glider falls outside the scope of the license established in section 4 of the TOU , use of Glider includes copying to RAM within the meaning of section 106 of the Copyright Act , users of WoW and Glider are not entitled to a section 117 defense , and Glider users therefore infringe Blizzard ’s copyright .
MDY does not dispute that the other requirements for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement are met , nor has MDY established a misuse defense .
The Court accordingly will grant summary judgment in favor of Blizzard with respect to liability on the contributory and vicarious copyright infringement claims in Counts II and III .
Blizzard had argued that :
In this Circuit , the “ copying ” element may be proved in software cases by showing an unauthorized reproduction of a copyrighted software program in the computer user ’s Random Access Memory ( “ RAM ” ) .
The Ninth Circuit has recognized that “ the loading of software into the RAM creates a copy under the Copyright Act. ” MAI Sys. v. Peak Computer , Inc. , 991 F.2d 511 , 519 ( 9th Cir. 1993 ) , cert .
dismissed 510 U.S. 1033 ( 1994 ) ; Triad Sys. Corp. v. Se. Express Co. , 64 F.3d 1330 , 1334 ( 9th Cir. 1995 ) ; see also Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Cablevision Sys. Corp. , 478 F. Supp. 2d 607 , 621 ( S.D.N.Y. 2007 ) ( agreeing with the “ numerous courts [ that ] have held that the transmission of information through a computer ’s random access memory or RAM . . . creates a ‘ copy ’ for purposes of the Copyright Act , ” and citing cases . )
When such a copy is made in excess of a license , the copier is liable for copyright infringement .
Ticketmaster LLC v. RMG Techs. , Inc. , 507 F. Supp. 2d 1096 , 1107 ( C.D. Cal. 2007 ) ( ‘“ When a licensee exceeds the scope of the license granted by the copyright holder , the licensee is liable for infringement . ” ’ ( citation omitted ) ) .
MDY argued that loading a copy of the software into RAM is protected by Section 117 , and was joined in that argument by Public Knowledge , a digital rights advocacy group .
The court rejected these arguments , noting that “ the Court is not free to disregard Ninth Circuit precedent directly on point . ”
From the Order :
MDY urges the Court to follow the approach recently taken by the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in Vernor , 2008 WL 2199682 .
The Vernor court declined to follow MAI , Triad , and Wall Data , and instead applied an earlier Ninth Circuit case , United States v. Wise , 550 F.2d 1180 ( 9th Cir. 1977 ) .
Wise involved the application of the “ first sale ” doctrine under 17 U.S.C. § 109 to various transfer contracts between movie studios and recipients of movie prints .
Vernor concluded that the critical factor in Wise for determining whether a transaction was a sale or a license was “ whether the transferee kept the copy acquired from the copyright holder . ”
2008 WL2199682 , at * 6 . MDY urges the Court to follow Vernor and Wise and hold that the users of the WoW game client software are owners of the software because they are entitled to keep the copy of the software they acquire from Blizzard .
The Court declines this invitation .
Whatever freedom the court in Vernor may have had to disregard Wall Data when applying a different statutory provision – section 109 – this Court does not have the same freedom .
This case concerns section 117 , the very provision addressed by the Ninth Circuit in Wall Data .
The Court is not free to disregard Ninth Circuit precedent directly on point .
MDY prevailed on some other other pending summary judgment issues and Blizzard prevailed on others , but the key result is that MDY has been found by the court to infringe Blizzard ’s copyright through the sale of its WoWGlider ( now MMOGlider ) bot program , and to have tortiously interfered with Blizzard ’s relationships with its customers through those sales .
VB will be interested in seeing if MDY appeals .
It ’s Blog Action Day !
The purpose of Blog Action Day is to create a worldwide discussion regarding an important issue .
This year , it ’s poverty .
For this post , I wanted my post to meet three criteria :
To bring value to readers , it must result in a list of creative ways business can help fight poverty
To encourage engagement , it must be generated by readers of the blog , not me At least one food bank must benefit
So on September 15th , I asked the readers of this blog to answer the question How can business help the poor ?
I offered a bounty for ideas and examples : for everyone that contributed at least one idea or example that made the Top 10 , Outsource Marketing would donate $ 20 to a food bank of each respondent ’s choosing .
I received so many good ideas , I expanded the list from 10 to 25 .
Without further ado and in no particular order , here are —
25 ways your business can help fight poverty
Cook and distribute meals
St. Clouds restaurant in Leschi ( Seattle , WA ) holds a monthly cooking project for the homeless .
Each month , the restaurant invites the community to come to its kitchen bringing whatever food they can spare …
St. Clouds provides the proteins .
Together they cook custom gourmet meals for the homeless , who could never afford such a meal .
These are delivered to 200 people at five shelters and a tent city around town each month .
Promotion of the event has been strictly via word - of - mouth .
This is a unique , very cool local outreach that is , in my opinion , truly an act of kindness .

Partner with a charity , publish a picture book documenting their lives
This year GE in Italy supported “ Pane Quotidiano ” ( means “ daily bread ” ) , a charitable association founded in 1898 in Milano to help feed the poor .
In 1908 the association was “ formally ” established and , on June 4th , celebrated a 100 years of feeding the less fortunate .
The contributions donated on this occasion were used to publish a picture book documenting the lives of the association ’s guests .
The book was sold in libraries for donations .
Additionally the association was also able to buy a new truck need to collect the food that everyday businesses and / or distributors give away because in excess or approaching the expiration date .
It was touching and great to be part of this initiative !

Promote trade and partnership in underdeveloped countries
Check out Connect Ethiopia .
An organization started by business in Ireland .
Its goal is to create business links between companies in Ireland and Ethiopia and use business and trade to develop poor countries .

Get your hands dirty
Hands on — I ’d offer .
I ’ve found that the best reality of working authentically , to contribute in a reflectively meaningful way — meaning fully — is to do it your self ; hands on , live , being in the space , contributing eye to eye .
Rather than dropping some capital — what can you do , in the telling of your story that is live to them , live for you .
It ’s a life , it ’s a live , it ’s alive .
You ’re in that circle , you ’re doing the work , making the contribution — and it ’s real .
No financial smoke that distances you from the reality .
You ’re there .
Do something and you ’ve got the passion to spread the word .
Write a check and the instant of giving dissipates in an instance , as well .
Do both and deliver it by hand and do some work at the same time !
The ring is reflective , the song is sung true and the circle of giving and heart fullness is unbroken .
Beauty full .

Encourage employee involvement with a charity
You can help the poor by telling everyone in your company to donate some time and volunteer at the local food bank .

Provide opportunity and access
In most low income areas , there is little opportunity or access to jobs that pay a decent wage , provide health care , or allow for flexible schedules .
Poor people do n’t need a one time handout – they need access to jobs , personal and professional education , and proper diet , to ensure they can sustain the responsibility of providing for themselves .
If businesses truly want to help they should start : Paying decent wages , offset by the cost of company provided health insurance Provide training – through partnerships with their state employment agencies and local colleges to keep the cost low Move away from the 9 - 5 in the cubicle mentality and provide flex scheduling especially for people with children and those not in customer service positions .
Create a local coalition .
ex. Local businesses could partner with a local grocers to provide discounts to employees and nutritional training .
Grocers partner with local farmers who partner with local transport companies , and so forth .
– Rochelle Robinson
Create a contest and use video and social media to create an actively engaged audience
Any firm could have a blog on their webpage .
This activity will also be of commercial interest of the firm as people will talk about what is happening on the webpage and return to look what happens next .
The firm choose a project .
The project of the month : Like in the television programme , “ The secret millionaire ” they go to a poor area and find a project , where some good people dedicate their lives to help other people .
On the blog they present those people and open an account to which people can make donations and write comments , ideas or even offer to join to give a helping hand .
It is after this possible to follow this place and the people , who work there by clicking on the link .
But each month a new project is presented with a picture on the webpage .
But still it is possible to follow links to former projects of the month .

Create a matching program for employees
Boeing is holding a special employee drive for the month of September .
They are matching triple for each e-giving dollar .
Funds go to local organizations who provide supplies to local food banks and meal programs in the Puget Sound .
This is a great incentive for employees to give to the program .
– Arden B .
Give discounts to clients for donating needed goods
Numbers 9 , 10 and 11 were contributed by Jovan Pollard Allow staff to donate money or goods to wear jeans or “ dress down ” on a specified day Volunteer your own professional services Vancity ’s Change Everything initiative
Caleb Chang contributed an impressive list on his own , numbers 12 - 24 Join your local Rotary club
In 2008 - 09 , the global mandate for Rotarians is to Make Dreams Real for the world ’s children .
Start collecting non-perishable food stuff from staff to fill food hampers Start or participate in initiatives like Community Money Provide microfinance loans through services like Kiva Donate your points
If a business has a rewards program for their customers , allow reward program member to donate their points to local charities or international causes
Fill shoeboxes full of gifts and donate them to organizations like Samaritan ’s Purse
Volunteer your time at a local soup kitchen Check with your local churches for projects that help the poor Give to the United Way
They get it .
Their “ Girls Today , Leaders Tomorrow ” initiative makes a real difference .
Donate to programs that help our kids Businesses can look to align with organizations that give a hand up , not a hand out Join the conversation and encourage others to help fight poverty
You can do this actively participating in the conversation here and other blogs talking about this subject .
Bring up poverty at home , work , the gym , your coffee shop — everywhere .
And by all means , please post this on all your social sites and forward a link to this article to everyone you know in business .
Because getting people talking is what Blog Action Day is all about .
If you have more ideas or examples of ways business can help fight poverty , share them in the comments below .
Last year when Facebook opened there platform there was a sudden influx of brands looking to gain access to a new channel for branded exposure .
The demand was significant and just in the past couple weeks we have seen an increasing number of applications come out from companies like Context Optional and Buddy Media .
How do these new applications differ from websites of the past and how what new opportunities do they provide ?
What are the Opportunities ?
Facebook and all the other social platforms have provided brands with a new way of engaging with their customer .
As social media has provided a channel for direct engagement , social platforms have provided brands with a central location for a large number of users .
Companies ( brands ) in turn get direct and targeted exposure to their end consumer and it builds brand awareness .
The one problem with these new channels ?
Monitoring ROI is extremely challenging .
While you can get users to download an application or most users on social networks are not in a state where a direct purchase will be made .
As such these new branded applications are much better at building awareness and building “ engagement ” .
What Types of Things Are Being Built ?
There is a wide array of applications that are being built .
Some also work and some do n’t which makes many of these applications a crap shoot without some sort of expertise and the purchase of individual installations .
Some of them are being hailed as great successes though and the two primary companies I know that are doing a good job are Buddy Media and Context Optional .
Today Buddy Media announced the release of the Bacardi Mojito application .
Yesterday Context Optional announced the release of a few applications as well including Today I ’m Toasting by Miller .
The place where I see the most room for growth is on new platforms like the iPhone .
For instance , Audi released an extremely successful application on the iPhone which was one of the most downloaded applications for at least a week .
Today the application is the 5th most popular free application according to Apple .
You ca n’t find a single branded application among the top applications on Facebook or any other platform .
While this has to do a lot with the timing of this application , I would suggest that this Audi application probably ranks among the most downloaded applications all together .
What Does the Future Hold ?
There is clearly an increasing demand for branded applications but the biggest question is if these brands feel that the investment is worth the return .
Most likely a large number will have successes but as some brands generate a less than satisfactory result we will see those advertising dollars go to other channels .
Fortunately we are still extremely early in this process and trying to figure out how all of this will pan out .
The reality is that brands need to try experimenting in this space and hopefully over time social networks and other non-traditional channels can prove that they are worth serious advertising dollars .
I am writing this in Washington at 3.33 am GMT .
There 's been a dramatic day on Wall Street and it's not even open ( actually they had to open trading this afternoon to clear the decks for tomorrow 's potential meltdown ) .
Here 's what we know so far :
1 . The US government has refused to put money into bailing out Lehman Brothers ; Barclays Capital have pulled out of the rescue attempt , which has been orchestrated by the Treasury , the Fed and the SEC but so far failed .
Lehman is set to file for bankruptcy as early as , er , around about now .
2 . In a moment of contagion the massive insurer AIG , itself facing untold bad debts , is looking at selloffs or breakups , racing to save itself from collapse .
3. Bank of America just bought Merrill Lynch .
For fifty billon dollars .
Kersplat .
Just like that .
I myself have been at the centre of the action all day : not in DC , not in Wall Street , but in the blighted inner city of Detroit .
Here there are foreclosed properties , torched properties - ranging from 30 k in value to 600 k - and the 600 k ones look like art deco mansions that would go for several million in London .
This is the real epicentre of the earthquake that has just hit Wall Street : the bad lending on a massive scale that forced debt down the throats of low income people like foie down the throat of a gras .
Now , instead of writing off , oh , just a few billion here or there two major companies have had to write themselves off in their entirety .
Lehman will go bust , effectively ; Merrill is selling itself at half its value ; AIG 's predicament is right now too opaque to predict .
So what 's caused this Sunday afternoon throat slitting ?
First , the insistence of the US government that it would not put taxpayers money into the bailout as it did with Bear Stearns .
It has just , as I am writing , issued a decree that the Fed can take all kinds of collateral against short term loans ( maybe some of the Piccassos on the top floor offices of these banks , certainly their near worthless paper ) ; but it will not bail them out .
This is a signal moment .
It signalled to the banks in the worst trouble that they had no chance of being saved by the American taxpayer so instead of just one going under , three are going at once .
But do n't take this at face value .
It looks to me , reading the reports which are all sourced from " those close to the situation " that other banks took umbrage at the prospect of Barclays or BoA taking over Lehman at rock bottom prices and walked away .
On Newsnight last week I said :
" If there is a state bailout of one of these banks then the whole blessed lifestyle of the investment bankers will have to change .
The high rewards , supposedly for high risk , will have to be reined in if it turns out the taxpayer is the ultimate risk taker .
The whole regulation of investment banking will have to change "
Now I do not know all these gentlemen personally , but I suspect that , given that choice , they would rather see investment bank regulation stay as it has been , asleep at the wheel during the entire Bush administration and for much of the Clinton years , allowing vast institutions to lend so profligately that they are TODAY brought down

Gunwook Nam’s Human
Pump uses the kinetic energy that people create when they move to bring water to areas that have underground sources , but lack the power to easily bring that water to the surface .
With it , Nam hopes to build a future where citizens of formerly arid regions bring waterfalls to life with their feet .
Nam ’s pump uses a wooden boardwalk , which he sees placed on major roads and other sources of heavy foot traffic .
The kinetic energy from humans and animals stepping on the boardwalk can then be stored and used to power underground pumps , which bring water to the surface .
The waterfall presents a dramatic effect , but the main purpose of the sculpture is to allow citizens to easily and efficiently collect water for drinking and farming , ensuring that they have a readily available source of safe water , and freeing up the time usually spent pumping water by hand .

I ’m sure at tonight ’s presidential debate , we will hear more of John McCain ’s energy policy .
I ’ve recently read some enlightening information in The Bush League of Nations : The Coalition of the Unwilling , the Bullied , and the Bribed by James A. Swanson that proves “ Drill , baby , drill ” is not an energy policy , and it will never make us energy independent .
US oil production peaked in 1970 at more than 11 million barrels a day , ironically just three years before the oil crisis .
Consider these statistics from Swanson ’s book :
By the end of 2005 , US crude oil production had dropped to 4.86 million barrels per day , which is less than 45 % of America ’s peak production in 1970 .
By 2005 , America was producing less oil than it did in 1950 .
The 1970 record oil production represented more than 40 % of total world production , but it was still not enough to meet America ’s appetite for oil - almost 15 million barrels per day in 1970 .
By the end of 2005 , U.S. oil consumption had increased to about 21 million barrels per day , while U.S. production , as noted above , had dropped to 5 million barrels .
American now has to import more than 75 % of the oil it consumes .
By way of comparison , at the time of the 1973 oil crisis , during which Americans endured closed gas stations and gas lines blocks long , the United States imported less than one - third of its oil .
In 2004 , there were only 1,200 rigs actively exploring for oil and natural gas in the United States , a drop of almost three - quarters from the 1981 peak of 4,530 rigs .
This drop occurred notwithstanding a huge increase in the price of oil and reflect the fact that almost all of America ’s oil has already been discovered .
The United States has lots of oil wells , more than 500,000 , but they on average do n’t produce much - slightly more than 10 barrels of oil a day each .
On the other hand , Saudi Arabia has only 1,500 producing wells , but they average 5000 barrels per day ( 500 times the U.S. average ) .
Big Oil loves the GOP .
Consider the fact that Chevron named an oil tanker after Condoleezza Rice , and that George W. Bush actually said in 2002 that “ We need an energy bill that encourages consumption ” , I have no faith in the GOP to make us energy independent .
Swanson states we were energy independent in 1950 ; we will never be able to drill our way back to this level without drastically cutting consumption .
I ’m not sure it is even possible , since we have already reached peak oil production in this country three decades ago .
Bush ’s policies and wars have made us more dependent on foreign oil .
McCain is delusional if he thinks we can drill our way out of this problem , it wo n’t even buy us enough time to develop alternative energy solutions .

Republican official seen failing sobriety test in police video David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday September 22 , 2008
Print This Email This Says Palin nomination helps him by showing " everybody who 's running for political office is as human as those sitting back home " A Republican councilman in Columbia , SC was arrested for drunken driving in July , the third DUI arrest for Paul Lindemann , who is currently running for reelection .
His local paper , the Rock Hill Herald , has now obtained a police video of the arrest through a Freedom of Information Act request and has made it public .
According to the police report , Lindemann was " highly intoxicated " and " significantly impaired " and had nearly run into two motorcyclists several times .
In the video , Lindemann agrees to take a sobriety test but repeatedly fails to get through the alphabet , attempting instead to segue from " W " back to " H . "
He has even more trouble counting backwards from 32 to 18 , stammering , " 32-31-32-30 -- 31-32-31-32-33-33 -- 31-32-30-29 --
19-18-17-16-18 -- 20-21-22 . "
He is then arrested .
A month following his arrest , Lindemann was seen driving to a City Council meeting , even though his license had been suspended .
He offered the reporter who approached him a flurry of conflicting explanations for why he was allowed to drive , all of them apparently false .
" I 'm going to get everything resolved with the charge , and we 're going to win in November as well , " Lindemann insisted after the video was released .
He also suggested that vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's current problems may help him , because " people have started to recognize that everybody who 's running for political office is as human as those sitting back home . "
Lindemann 's case is reminiscent of that of New York City Republican Congressman Vito Fossella , who announced after a drunk driving arrest last spring that he would not be running this fall .
However , there are currently rumors that Fossella , too , is plotting to get back on the ticket .

The UN Global Compact has a whole basketful of detractors .
This is not surprising : like anything emanating from UNHQ in Manhattan it is unwieldy and slow moving , and often seems to work against itself .
Recently it hit back at these critics and got tough by introducing “ integrity measures ” .
These resulted in over 20 % of its signatories being classed as inactive or delisted altogether because they had n’t reported back on progress .
However this does n’t stop companies Bluewashing themselves by committing to the Compact ’s Ten Principles and then do nothing except wrap themselves in the UN ’s flag of respectability .
Two of the principles refer to Human Rights , stating that the signatory will uphold internationally agreed human rights standards and make sure they ’re not complicit in human rights abuses .
At the time of writing there are 3704 businesses classed as active by the Global Compact .
However , according to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre only 167 businesses worldwide have policies which explicitly mention human rights .
Now comes news that Mary Robinson , the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , is writing to leading international companies urging them to use the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to adopt a human rights policy .
What do you think her chances of success are ?
Should businesses adopt a specific human rights policy , and if so what is the best way for investors to keep track of its effectiveness ?
Let me know what you think below , or start a discussion on the Green Options Discussion Forum .

Asked what work John McCain did as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that helped him understand the financial markets , the candidate 's top economic adviser wielded visual evidence : his BlackBerry .
" He did this , " Douglas Holtz - Eakin told reporters this morning , holding up his BlackBerry .
" Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years , comes right through the Commerce Committee .
So you 're looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that 's what he did . "

First , the bad news .
Two days ago , I received a polite email from David Winton , the director of Code Rush , asking me to take the out - of - print documentary off of Waxy.org .
As promised , I immediately complied .
Now , the good news —
In my reply , I asked David if he ’d mind being interviewed , and he agreed !
He ’s an accomplished director and producer , the creator of the Big Thinkers series for TechTV , and the cofounder of Winton / duPont Films , located in San Francisco ’s Presidio .
We had a wonderful conversation about the film , which revealed for the first time that he ’s planning on not only re-releasing Code Rush digitally , but considering releasing the original outtakes ( 100 hours of footage ) to the public domain on Archive.org .
I wish all my takedown notices were like this !
Read on for the full interview , with selected clips from Code Rush , used by permission .
Andy Baio :
Thanks for taking the time .
David Winton : Sure .
I ’d heard about the film being online , which is n’t , quite honestly , that big a deal to me .
But while I decide what to do with it , I ’m glad you took it down .
No problem at all .
Whenever I post a video , I always add that big disclaimer saying I ’ll take it down if it comes back into print or the copyright holders get in touch …
Yes , I saw it .
And one of the feelings I had was just to make it freely available under the Creative Commons license .
And I ’ve thought about making the original material available , which we have about 100 hours of — the full interviews with the people in the film , like Marc Andreessen and Jim Barksdale , you know the whole cast of characters …
I ca n’t believe you kept it all .
I can’t believe I kept it either , to be perfectly honest with you , because I ’ve looked at maybe an outtake or two , once in ten years , and [ laughs ]
I ’m not sure it ’s of any real value , truthfully …
For people interested in the open - source movement , it ’s a goldmine .
Out of curiosity , how would you recommend making it available to people ?
I would put it on Archive.org …
Right , yes , and I ’m very close to the people at Archive.org .
I know the person who helped set up their online archive of films , a guy named Rick Prelinger …
Right , the Prelinger Archive ?
Right .
So I talked to Rick and said well , I ’m happy to give this to you , but literally , it ’s boxes upon boxes …
If there ’s somebody you know at Archive.org and you want to just drop them a note to have them call me , that ’d be fine .
I would be quite happy to make it available .
That ’s incredible , I ’ll see what I can do .
I ’m a big fan of historical computing and archival media .
I am too .
I ’m not a tech person , to be honest with you .
But I came out here in the mid-nineties from New York City and , in a sense , the film was my own kind of valentine to the community and culture of Silicon Valley , which I found immediately upon arriving here to be an amazingly intoxicating experience compared to what I ’d seen in New York and the East Coast .
I ’m a big believer in supporting it in any way and I thought the open source movement was incredibly important , and that really launched our business on film and the TV documentary area .
Prior to that , we made corporate propaganda films and TV commercials .
It was the time I spent at Netscape that opened a whole other world of possibilities .
I look back on all of those days and all of those people with a really great sense of appreciation and wonder about the whole thing .
You definitely went to the right place at the right time .
When did you move to the Bay Area ?
Well , I moved to the Bay Area from New York City in mid- to late - 1995 .
I made a film for the Wall Street Journal in 1996 and frankly , I was a little bit prompted to move to the Bay Area because of Netscape and the phenomenon of Silicon Valley .
We had a business making films about businesses , and the best businesses in the world were really unfolding here .
So I came out and , as luck would have it , Dow Jones said , “ Will you go make a short film about Netscape Communications for us ? ”
And I said , “ I sure will . ”
And that got me connected with Netscape ’s communications people .
A couple of years later , as they hit the wall and were beginning to think radically about how to compete using the open - source movement , I said , “ This is a good opportunity to go back and record what happens here . ”
And that ’s how we got inside .
It was a series of lucky breaks that got us and kept us there because , as you know , the culture of privacy in Silicon Valley is really intense .
It just happened that I had a couple of friends in [ Netscape CEO ] Jim Barksdale ’s office who said , “ Let this guy do what he wants to do . ”
I think they also realized , at the time , that this would n’t hurt and might even help them in their competition against Microsoft .
They really had nothing to lose , at that point .
Yeah .
And they knew we were n’t going to do anything .
We ’re not muckrakers .
We ’re storytellers .
So it was really an absolutely fantastic experience .
I really enjoyed everybody I met .
Everybody was , for the most part , extremely welcoming .
I did n’t feel that they said things for my benefit .
I ’ve been at this long enough that I have a pretty good nose for what ’s really real and what ’s a contrivance , and I felt these were people as you would have actually seen them had you been there yourself without a camera .
The level of access is amazing .
Not only are you in team meetings , all - hands meetings , and executive meetings , sitting in with Marc Andreessen calling Steve Jobs , but you ’re also there for late nights at the offices , little pow - wows , people doing soda runs .
I mean , you were there for everything .
Yeah .
How much time were you spending ?
Well , we filmed it off and on .
We were there intensely , every day and night , for the first couple of months of ’ 98 .
Then we came back in the spring and fall .
We were there for the source code ’s first release on March 31 , 1998 .
And then I came back to follow up on what happened .
I found , through the people at Netscape , this high school student who I think may still be at Netscape or AOL or whatever it is now .
Maybe he is at Mozilla .
Are you talking about Stuart Parmenter ?
Yeah .
Where is he ?
He still works at the Mozilla Corporation .
He ’s very influential .
He ended up being a very core member .
Core guy , yeah .
Well , you could see that was going to happen .
So I think we went and filmed him sometime towards the end of his school year of 1998 .
And then we did a little bit more filming in the fall .
And we cut the film , I think that summer , and then it got out , it got onto onto the air I think in the early ’ 99 .
One of the benefits of shooting something over a long period of time is that you can kind of refine it as you go .
We gave ourselves the time and the leeway to do that , and of all the things you can do to help yourself making a film , probably the best thing is to let time take its natural course .
That becomes a simple dramatic device that carries you along , as long as interesting things happen in the interim .
The source material for the film , or the inspiration for the film was a great book written about 25 years ago by Tracy Kidder called The Soul of a New Machine about the building of the Data General minicomputer back in the East Coast .
That ’s a great book , by the way .
That ’s one of the great books of all time , actually .
It ’s one of the few books that manages to relay the drama of computer programming .
Yeah , it sure does .
And then another source of inspiration was a book called Show Stopper by a guy named Gregg Zachary , who followed the creation of Windows NT back in the ’90s .
I thought his book was terrific .
And Zachary , who ’s a friend of mine now , helped guide me on the process and he helped on some of the narration writing of the Netscape film .
But I think that Show Stopper is actually a fantastic book .
I ’m not sure I still have my copy around .
But it was once upon a time I read all the literature about the tech world and his was one of the few that really stood out I thought .
You ’d think it would be hard to dramatize , especially on film , people writing code .
But I found Code Rush completely gripping .
I know , it ’s bizarre , is n’t it ?
Well , part of it is that you knew that they were always up against some impossible deadline .
You just stick with it long enough and stuff happens , you know you get the things that you need .
It ’s not as hard as it looks .
So with traveling and trying to film people in Mountain View , did you have a big crew ?
No , I think that was useful .
We had a cameraman , a soundman , and me .
That was pretty much it the whole time .
And it was back when were using then state - of - the - art video technology that allowed us to shoot in fairly low light .
We made the decision not to get carried away with lots of extraneous equipment .
I think that was one of our better calls .
Normally , there was a tradition of documentary filming back then where you ’d spend a lot of time setting up and lighting before doing any shooting .
We just decided to violate that rule completely .
So , we were able to move incredibly efficiently .
If we ’d tried to impose the normal style of that kind of filmmaking , the style that was applied back then , we would have gotten none of this stuff .
Plus , computer programmers hate light .
Yeah , that ’s for sure .
So , anyway , that ’s the background on it .
That kind of leads into another question I had .
Computer programmers are n’t very extroverted .
Personally , I hate being on camera .
Did you have trouble getting them to open up ?
No .
You pick your battles .
You pick people that you ’re going to pay attention to and generally it ’s pretty clear who ’s comfortable doing this kind of thing and who is n’t .
And as long as you ’re discreet and not in their faces , a natural sort of comfort asserts itself .
A person ’s general ability to be him or herself asserts itself , and you just have to be there and back enough that you ’re not getting in the way .
So , people who ordinarily might otherwise be very tight or shy in front of a camera , just kind of lose the sense that you ’re there .
I ’m sure there were a couple people who avoided the camera , running away when you walked in , so we never saw them .
Yeah , there were definitely a few , but not that many ; surprisingly few .
And we were around so often that they became indifferent to our presence , if not comfortable .
That helped , as well .
I do n’t know if you remember this , but there ’s this recurring theme from the engineering team that they ’re “ doomed . ”
They keep saying it over and over again , “ We ’re doomed .
We ’re doomed .
We ’re doomed . ”
When I was there , that was a constant refrain .
They were being mostly ironic on one level , but on another level I think they realized that they were in a complete mismatch …
It was a combination of the mordant humor when you ’re trying to get a job done .
It was an impossible deadline , so there was doom in that sense .
But then there was even more the sense that they were trying an experiment that had never been tried and therefore they were courting disaster on that level .
And then , finally , they were up against Microsoft and that was I think probably why it was spoken more often than normal .
And then , the AOL acquisition .
Yes … Dumb luck .
Good luck .
For them , great luck .
And yet , at the same time , the engineers seem devastated by it .
Well , financially it was a good thing , because it was everything that they had no interest in being and …
AOL was so hated back then in the geek community .
Yes , unfortunately it was AOL or somebody else like AOL that was going to be their lifeline .
And definitely , nobody thought it was a good thing but for a few incredibly well - vested executives .
But you know , many of those employees made out .
They had a financial windfall that one rarely gets in one ’s life .
So for people like Scott Collins , it was an incredible , lucky thing , even though I think he never really wanted to be part of AOL after that .
There ’s this disappointment that what you ’ve created is likely going to be lost , but at the same time , there ’s this profound sense of relief that it ’s over .
You caught virtually every key character in the documentary leaving Netscape shortly after that …
Yes , basically they did — that ’s amazing , is n’t it ?
I liked them all and I think having done these things for awhile , I had a reasonably good nose for who to focus on , and they all turned out to be fantastic .
Occasionally , I think about going back and doing a followup , but it was such of that particular moment .
Silicon Valley is a completely different place now , it seems to me .
If they were all back at the same place , it might be kind of interesting .
But it ’s all diffuse now .
It was this one moment of time , but what ’s so interesting about it is that you ’re seeing the origins of Firefox , too .
With Stuart coming in and talking to [ Mozilla CTO ] Brendan Eich …
Maybe Firefox , maybe there ’s a story back there .
Maybe there ’s a way to go back and recapture that ; see what it ’s like .
I did a lot of filming with Brendan , who did n’t get into the film particularly much at all .
He was one of the few people who just did n’t quite come across on camera .
But I thought he was great , incredibly smart .
And maybe there ’s a way to kind of rejuvenate it .
So you ’ve got the first steps of this massive movement that ’s going to come .
But at the end of the film , you get the feeling that they felt that open - sourcing Netscape was a failure .
They did it , but just felt it was n’t a spectacular success .
Yeah , it was way ahead of its time , for sure .
But you did capture this moment with Jamie Zawinski after he ’d left and had a chance to get some distance , where he gets sort of reflective .
And he starts talking about the long - term impact of open - sourcing Mozilla and how that ca n’t be taken back .
So , even if people are scared of the AOL acquisition , this code is out in the world and it can have a life of its own .
It seems like he ’s really the only person that ’s sitting there in the documentary that ’s saying , “ You know , we really did do something important that ca n’t be undone . ”
Yeah , that ’s true .
Well , I think part of the problem is that when you now think of technology companies , you really think only of one , unfortunately .
And they seem to have swamped everybody ’s boat .
Is there some new insurrection that might occur because of Mozilla and because of Firefox ?
Nothing ’s really taking down Google just yet , no .
Yeah .
And actually Google is Mozilla ’s primary source of income .
They ’re supported by Google .
Oh , that ’s interesting .
If anybody at Google who was once at Netscape , you know if there ’s a way to get inside …
I ’m sure Google will never let anybody inside their walls , but that would be the equivalent , I think .
Drawing some connection from Netscape to Google to whatever the next thing is going to be .
That has a natural dramatic progression , I think .
Then , in the very end of the film , there ’s a little bit of foreshadowing of the dot - com collapse where you talk about tech stocks trading with increasing volatility .
And then Code Rush first aired on PBS in March of 2000 , the same month the bubble started to burst .
Yeah , it started to completely fall apart .
That was also good timing .
Regrettable , though .
Well , I think it ’s fair to say that The Valley still lives on .
Maybe I should just make a couple of calls to find out what the new , new thing is .
That would be great .
Well , thank you for your interest .
I ’ve talked to Rick Prelinger whom I ’m going to see on Friday about handing over the dailies to Archive.org , but if there ’s another person who wants to jump on it , feel free to have them give me a call here .
I ’m literally across the yard from Internet Archive .
Are there any plans for a DVD release ?
Well , I ’ve made copies and given them or sold them to people .
I may try to make it available on iTunes or something like that if iTunes wants it .
It ’s easy enough to make a DVD of it .
And the last thing I wanted to ask — what browser do you use ?
Firefox 3 . [ laughs ]
Good choice .
Thank you so much !
WASHINGTON  Red Cross investigators concluded last year in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency ’s interrogation methods for high - level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes , according to a new book on counterterrorism efforts since 2001 .
The book says that the International Committee of the Red Cross declared in the report , given to the C.I.A. last year , that the methods used on Abu Zubaydah , the first major Qaeda figure the United States captured , were “ categorically ” torture , which is illegal under both American and international law .
The book says Abu Zubaydah was confined in a box “ so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position ” and was one of several prisoners to be “ slammed against the walls , ” according to the Red Cross report .
The C.I.A. has admitted that Abu Zubaydah and two other prisoners were waterboarded , a practice in which water is poured on the nose and mouth to create the sensation of suffocation and drowning .
The book , “ The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , ” by Jane Mayer , who writes about counterterrorism for The New Yorker , offers new details of the agency ’s secret detention program , as well as the bitter debates in the administration over interrogation methods and other tactics in the campaign against Al Qaeda .

When we first heard Intel was diving into the solid - state drive business , we were pretty surprised .
In retrospect , though , we probably should have seen it coming — the writing was on the wall .
Intel ’s joint venture with Micron gave them tremendous NAND flash memory capacity .
The company had also introduced tiny SSDs for handheld devices .
Packaging NAND chips into larger format drives is just a logical step .
Intel is currently shipping 80 GB MLC ( multi - level cell ) drives into the market , at $ 595 in quantities of 1,000 .
The 2.5 - inch form factor is known as the Intel X25 - M , while the 1.8 - inch drives are the X18 - M. End-user prices will probably be well north of $ 600 .
MLC NAND flash holds two bits of data per cell , and has traditionally been slower than SLC ( single level cell ) flash .
Intel is also shipping 32 GB SLC drives into the high - end server market , but those drives were n’t available for testing .
What MLC NAND flash brings to the table is capacity .
Intel ’s 80 GB drives and their upcoming 160 GB drives are MLC , but Intel is making aggressive performance claims for them .
Why is Intel interested in the SSD business ?
The primary reason is the upcoming release of Nehalem , their next generation CPU .
During qualification testing for Nehalem , Intel discovered that hard drive performance became an even bigger bottleneck than in the past .
Nehalem ’s raw CPU horsepower and its extremely robust memory make the drive bottleneck seem more glaring .
The other issue is power .
SSDs use much less power and generate much less heat than their rotating counterparts .
This is a major issue in huge server farms , which are becoming more widespread as more video content is served up over the internet .
Intel suggests that the power savings — both for running the drives and the lower HVAC requirements — make SSDs more cost effective in many large scale server environments .
Today , we take a look at the performance of a pair of Intel X25 - M 80GB SSD drives , in both single drive and RAID 0 modes .
Will Intel ’s foray into the storage market bring new performance levels to an emerging product mix ?
Let ’s find out .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of states suffering monthly job losses more than doubled in September , with Michigan losing the greatest number of jobs , according to a government report released Tuesday .
Private sector and government jobs fell in 41 states and the District of Columbia last month , the Labor Department said .
By comparison , only 18 states reported monthly job losses in August .
The widespread job losses are a sign of a recession , said Bob Brusca , an economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York .
" You expect to see job losses across the board , across the country , " Brusca said .
The numbers released Tuesday underline the grim condition of the nation 's job market .
Earlier this month , the Labor Department reported that net payrolls nationwide declined by 159,000 in September , the ninth straight month the U.S. economy has lost jobs .
The unemployment rate remained unchanged from the prior month at 6.1 % .
Eleven states reported jobless rates higher than the national average .
Rhode Island posted the highest at 8.8 % , an increase from 8.5 % in August .
Michigan had the second highest rate , 8.7 % , which fell from 8.9 % the month before .
Michigan lost 28,300 jobs in September and has lost 77,900 jobs in the past year .
Georgia lost the second greatest number of jobs - 22,300 - down 61,100 over the past year .
Louisiana shed 17,500 jobs in September , a figure not ' substantially ' affected by Hurricane Ike , according to the report .
Michigan , home to the country 's auto industry , has reported job losses as auto manufacturing plants close and automakers discuss mergers .
Just last week , General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) announced that it would close a metal stamping plant near Grand Rapids , Mich. , by the end of next year , costing about 1,340 hourly jobs .
Brusca said it's not surprising that Midwestern states have shed a high number of jobs .
" The Midwest has been having more trouble with jobs , that 's where manufacturing industries are concentrated , " Brusca said .
" With the treacherous situation with the auto industry , it'd be surprising if they did n't report job loses , " he said .
Nine states posted job gains .
Missouri , the state reporting the largest monthly increase in employment , added 3,800 jobs .
It was followed by Nebraska , Wyoming , West Virginia and Virginia .

Pakistani troops fired on two U.S. helicopters that intruded into Pakistani airspace on Sunday night , forcing them to turn back to Afghanistan , a senior Pakistani security official said on Monday .
It was the second such incident in a week , and reflects frayed relations with the United States over Pakistan ’s failure to act more forcibly against Islamist fighters in the tribal lands bordering Afghanistan .
The number of missile attacks by U.S. drone aircraft in the remote tribal areas has multiplied in recent weeks .
The helicopters violated the border in the area of Lowara Mandi , 40 km ( 25 miles ) west of Miranshah , the main town in the North Waziristan tribal region , at around 9 p.m. on Sunday , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject .
There was no official confirmation .
“ We do n’t have any information on border violation by the American helicopters , ” Major Murad Khan , a military spokesman , said .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp GM.N on Wednesday said it would delay the planned closing of a New York plant that builds four - cylinder engines in response to the surge in demand for fuel - efficient cars .
GM had planned to close its powertrain plant in Massena , New York , at the end of 2008 .
The 49 - year - old plant , which employs about 250 workers , will now stay in operation until June 2009 , GM spokeswoman Lynda Messina said .
GM , like other U.S. automakers , has been scrambling to cut production of SUVs and pickup trucks and ramp up output of more fuel - efficient passenger cars in response to a sharp shift in consumer demand that has gathered momentum in recent months .
The engine components produced at GM ’s Massena plant include engine blocks used in the popular Chevrolet Cobalt .
“ We ’ve had an increase in demand for fuel - efficient engines , ” Messina said .
GM still plans to move production of four - cylinder engine blocks to a plant in Saginaw , Michigan , by the middle of next year , the spokeswoman said .
GM ’s overall sales are down 17 percent through the first seven months of the year .
By contrast , sales of the Cobalt are up 16 percent .
The 270 - acre GM plant in Massena , New York was built in 1959 to build components for the Chevrolet Corvair .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Former “ Star Trek ” crew member George Takei married his longtime boyfriend on Sunday in a Los Angeles ceremony that paid homage to the actor ’s Japanese heritage .
Takei , 71 , tied the knot with his business manager , Brad Altman , 54 , as some of his “ Star Trek ” castmates looked on , including best man Walter Koenig ( “ Chekhov ” ) and matron of honor Nichelle Nichols ( “ Uhura ” ) .
Takei played Mr. Sulu in the 1960s sci- fi series and in subsequent movies .
Nearly 200 people attended the Buddhist ceremony at the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles .
The couple wore matching tuxedos -- white jackets and shirts , with black trousers and bow ties .
The event came three months after California followed Massachusetts ’ lead and allowed same - sex weddings .
Last month , comedian Ellen DeGeneres married Australian actress Portia de Rossi in Beverly Hills .
Takei , who was interned along with his family and 120,000 other Japanese - Americans during World War Two , is a longtime human rights activist .
After the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on same - sex marriage in May , Takei and Altman were among the first gay couples to get a marriage license .
They have been together more than 21 years .

In the seventh and most recent debate , six of the remaining Democratic primary candidates battled it out as the primary season finally ramps up to the Iowa caucus .
While not much new substance was learned during this debate , the candidates ’ use of language can illuminate insights into their psychological states .
In this post , I examine where each of the candidate ’s attention is and what implications that has by looking at seemingly unimportant words : pronouns ( specifically I and We ) .
When people use I ( or me or my ) , they are demonstrating a greater focus on themselves and their own circumstances .
On the negative side , research has shown greater use of I - words to be associated with depression and insecurity .
However , greater I - word use has also been found to be related to honesty and authenticity .
Hence , political candidates showing such self - focus through the use of I may be seen positively by voters as straightforward and personal .
At the same time , they may be also seen as lacking confidence .
When people use we ( or us or our ) , they are demonstrating a focus on others and the groups they belong to .
Additionally , greater use of we - words can signal leadership and confidence .
Political candidates who use we more may be perceived as more attuned to and concerned with the needs and attitudes of the nation ( and in the case of the primary , members of their party ) .
Like I - words , the use of we - words has potential drawbacks .
An excessive use of we may come across and inauthentic and dishonest .
So , where is the focus of the remaining 2020 Democratic primary candidates ?
The Me Candidates .
Biden and Klobuchar stand out as the most self focused candidates .
They ( especially Klobuchar ) use significantly more I - words than we - words .
In the debates , these candidates have focused more on building a case as to why they should be the candidate .
They want voters to know what they ’ve done ( e.g. ‘ I ’ve been in the U.S. Senate for over 12 years . ’ , ‘ I led that effort . ’) and what they think are the best solutions to today ’s problems ( e.g. ‘ I have a plan for that . ’ , ‘ I lay out how I ’d pay for that . ’ ) .
While their high use of I - words likely contributes to voter ’s perceiving them as authentic , it also may betray insecurity .
Biden , even though he is leading in most polls , continues to struggle to rise decisively above the other candidates , and Klobuchar seems to have little to no chance of victory .
Such uncertainties seem to bleeding through in their debate language .
The We Candidates .
Three candidates stand out for their group - focus : Warren , Sanders , and Buttigieg .
They are focused on the concerns of the group ( both the nation and the Democratic party ) and what can be done to address these concerns .
While they are making the decisions , they see themselves as part of a collective and confidently assert their leadership credentials to solve the country ’s problems .
They talk about the problems and solutions of the nation as affecting and involving everyone ( e.g .
‘ We have a problem ’ , ‘ our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement ’ , ‘ we could be using those dollars for something else ’ ) .
Though these candidates might come across as more confident leaders , they also run the risk of inauthenticity .
For example , all three of these candidates have been questioned on their ability to understand and relate to the concerns of African American voters perhaps making their use of we less than inclusive .
The Other Candidate .
One candidate does not fall neatly in either of these categories .
Tom Steyer , who has not made it into any posts so far but continues to qualify for debates , is equally self and other focused using I - and we - words at nearly identical rates .
Steyer pushes his own experiences and ideas ( e.g. ‘ I understand how America interacts with other countries ’ , ‘ I proposed a wealth tax ’ ) , but also talks about the concerns and responsibilities of the whole ( e.g. ‘ I know we can do it . ’ ) .
Steyer seems to balance the best of both worlds conveying a sense of confidence and leadership along with a connection to the collective .
While he still lags in the polls , perhaps this style will help him connect with voters as the primaries progress .
Note .
The y - axis depicts the average percentage of the words in the candidate ’s debate language that are either I - words ( e.g. me , mine , myself ) or we - words ( e.g. we , us , our ) .
Averages were computed across all seven debates since June 2019 .
LIWC2015 was used to analyze the debate language .
Summary .
The remaining Democratic frontrunners are split between the me-candidates ( Biden and Klobuchar ) , the we - candidates ( Warren , Sanders , and Buttigieg ) , and the in - between candidate ( Steyer ) .
Biden and Klobuchar ’s use of I suggest honesty but insecurity , while Warren , Sanders , and Buttigieg ’s use of we suggest confidence but inauthenticity .
Steyer ’s use of both may help him avoid the pitfalls of a focus on one or the other .
The primary contest is far from decided , and hopefully this new psychological look at the candidates helps readers gain a better understanding of these individuals as they decide who to vote for .

At a time of skyrocketing gas costs , soaring airline fares and global - warming fears , the timing would seem perfect for a statewide vote on a 200 - mph bullet train .
But five months before voters decide whether to approve bonds for the high - speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco , the $ 30 - billion project has hit a new obstacle .
An old - guard railroad is declining to share its right - of - way .
Officials at Union Pacific railroad recently told the California High Speed Rail Authority that they have safety and operational concerns about running a bullet train close to lumbering freight trains .
Advertisement
“ Just look at what happened in L.A. a few years ago , ” said Scott Moore , a Union Pacific vice president , citing the 2005 crash of a Metrolink passenger train that killed 11 and hampered rail operations .
“ Those accidents happen . ”
High - speed rail promoters say the freight hauler ’s hard - line stand may simply be a bargaining ploy , and could be overcome in any case by buying adjacent land .
“ Some are saying ‘ the sky is falling , the sky is falling , ’ but it is not , ” said Mehdi Morshed , executive director of the rail authority .
Advertisement
A prominent environmental group and several railroad advocacy organizations , however , contend that Union Pacific ’s refusal will prove a formidable challenge to the project at a key moment .
California voters will be asked in November to approve nearly $ 10 billion in bonds to help finance construction .
Stuart Flashman , an attorney representing those groups , said a shift away from running the bullet train in Union Pacific ’s right of way would require a new environmental analysis for affected sections of the route -- a process that could add time and dollars .
“ Just the fact there ’s a delay will shoot the prices up again , ” he said .
“ This makes infeasible major portions of the high - speed route . ”
The bullet train line is designed to run alongside Union Pacific tracks for many miles in Southern California , the Central Valley and the Bay Area .
Flashman said the biggest problems could be on the leg from the Central Valley across the Pacheco Pass to San Jose , and on the route from Bakersfield through Palmdale into Los Angeles .
Advertisement
“ It ’s hard to back up and simply say : ‘ You ca n’t use that , ’ ” said Flashman , who represents the Planning and Conservation League , the California Rail Foundation and the Transportation Legal Defense and Education Fund .
Flashman said the organizations he represents support the high - speed rail line but also want safety concerns more fully addressed .
Freight - car derailments occur “ fairly often , ” he said .
“ You can imagine if you have a high - speed train zooming through there and it hits one of those freight cars .
It ’s not a pretty picture . ”
Critics question why the California High Speed Rail Authority did n’t negotiate a deal long ago with Union Pacific .

Until a meeting last month , high - speed rail officials had not held formal discussions with Union Pacific in “ a couple of years , ” said Moore of Union Pacific .
“ There ’s been no circumstance where we ’ve indicated we felt this might be workable . ”
Morshed of the high - speed rail authority , however , insisted the process of planning and constructing what would be among the biggest public works projects in California history -- and the first high - speed rail line in the U.S. -- could overcome the obstacles .
He said miles of the high - speed route in some urban areas have already been purchased by the state to accommodate existing commuter trains .
Along swaths under Union Pacific control , adjacent land held by private property owners could be purchased for tracks , he said .
But it is n’t so easy , said Dan McNamara of the California Rail Foundation .
In some areas , scores of houses would have to be uprooted , and the train would zoom past existing neighborhoods , he said .
“ I think they ’re remiss to say this is n’t a problem that needs to be addressed . ”

McNamara said he believes the bond vote , already canceled by the Legislature on two previous occasions , should be delayed once again , and the planning should be put under the aegis of the Department of Transportation , “ where there ’s some checks and balances . ”
“ This is not ready for prime time , ” he said .
“ It needs to be done right . ”
Morshed , however , said the project was ready to go .
A bigger worry , he said , could be the rising cost of raw materials such as steel and concrete .
Aside from miles of new steel rails , the project would feature 650 steel and concrete highway bridges , which account for up to 40 % of the entire project cost , Morshed said .
If voters approve the November ballot measure , project backers hope to get another $ 10 billion in financing from the federal government and an equal amount from private investors .
Construction then could start in two to three years , and the first high - speed trains might be rolling within a decade , Morshed said .

In areas where the bullet train would run near freight trains , a stout barrier would separate the two sets of tracks , he said , adding that during decades of high - speed rail operations in France and Japan there have been no fatalities .
“ We do n’t want to sacrifice the safety of our passengers any more than the railroad wants to sacrifice its freight , ” Morshed said .
“ We have much more valuable cargo . ”

Rasmussen ’s latest tracking poll has some good news for the McCain campaign .
In the first tracking poll with post - Palin speech data , John McCain has begun his convention bounce , coming within two points of Barack Obama after being down as many as six this week .
And in an ironic twist , Sarah Palin has better favorability numbers than either of them .
According to the internals , Palin now has solid favorable majorities from men ( 65 % ) and women ( 52 % ) .
Palin also has majority positive favorability ratings in all age demographics and in all income brackets .
She also has majorities among conservatives and moderates , while trailing with liberals and black voters .
One embarrassing result for Obama comes from a comparison of their experience as a preparation for the Presidency .
Obama only beats her by four points overall , only by nine points among women , and trails by three among men .
She runs within the margin of error in all college - educated demographics , only trailing significantly among high - school graduates and drop - outs .
And of course , she ’s not running for President ; Obama is .
It looks like the attack on Governor Palin ’s experience backfired on Obama , and as long as he keeps running against the GOP ’s # 2 , he ’ll continue to lose .
The final question is very interesting .
Overwhelmingly , people believe that Sarah Palin has boosted McCain ’s chances to win in November with her acceptance speech on Wednesday .
Obviously , this could only get asked of the people in the final day of the rolling poll , and this should give an indication how far the bounce will get .
By 58% - 10 % , respondents felt she helped , a wide margin that appears in every single demographic of the poll .
Today , Microsoft announced Global Anti-Piracy Day , to draw attention to the ever growing piracy problem .
While Microsoft itself celebrates October 21st by launching anti-piracy enforcement actions in 49 countries , The Pirate Bay does so by linking to counterfeit Microsoft products on their frontpage - in every country in the world .
To celebrate Global Anti-Piracy Day , The Pirate Bay has decided to replace their well known logo with the mugshot of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates .
Below the mugshot it reads “ Bill Gates made me do it , ” referring to his ‘ criminal ’ history .
Although the company does send out DMCA takedown requests to BitTorrent site owners , Millions of Microsoft products are being pirated on BitTorrent and other filesharing networks every year .
Of course , Microsoft is doing all it can to prevent people from installing illegally obtained copies of their products , with their ‘ Windows Genuine Advantage ‘ system as the flagship solution .
Similar to most other anti-piracy measures , it also hurts honest customers , as it has a false positive rate of more than 20 % .
The pirates will get what they want one way or another .
What Microsoft does not do , however , is sue individual downloaders .
Unlike the RIAA they do n’t think that the people who are potential customers are the right targets in their battle against piracy .
Instead , they mostly target resellers who sell illicit copies of their products .
“ Legitimate businesses struggle to compete against these illegal resellers who undercut their prices and contribute to the 20 percent software piracy rate in the U.S. , ” the company states .
The Pirate Bay has no commercial interests , but contrary to what Microsoft would have hoped for , they are not very responsive to letters from Microsoft either .
In addition , we seriously doubt that ‘ Global Anti-Piracy Day ’ is the success they want it to be , now Bill Gates ’ is on the frontpage of the largest BitTorrent tracker on the Internet .
Guided by the belief that every life has equal value , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation aspires to help all people lead healthy , productive lives .
We are dedicated to discovering and disseminating innovative approaches to addressing extreme poverty and poor health in developing countries and improving the U.S. education system .

An MP has described how he was held at gunpoint by guards in Colombia who mistook a jar of coffee whitener he was carrying for cocaine .
Lichfield MP
Michael Fabricant was on a trekking holiday to South America last week when , he said , he was held by armed soldiers who searched his bags .
He said one pulled out the unmarked jar of Coffee Mate and accused him of smuggling raw cocaine .
The MP said all he could do was to eat " mouthfuls " of it to prove otherwise .
Conservative MP
Mr Fabricant , who was with a friend at the time , was eventually released and allowed to continue his holiday .
I started tasting some of it and the guards insisted I had more to see if I was going to trip out
Michael Fabricant
He said he ate several mouthfuls of the coffee whitener while M16 guns were pointed at him to prove it would not have any ill effects on him .
He offered some to the camouflaged guards , thinking that if it was pure cocaine it would be poisonous .
Mr Fabricant , who is now safely back home , said : " They started to speak to us in Spanish and unfortunately I do n't really speak any Spanish at all .
" They started looking through our bags , and came across this container which was unmarked which contained this mysterious creamy , white powder , and they started shouting , ' cocaine , cocaine ' or something that sounded like that in Spanish .
" I started to explain Coffee Mate and I do n't think they understood because they were going , ' no coffee , no coffee ' .
I was saying I knew it was n't coffee , but they were a bit bewildered . "
Mr Fabricant said that although Colombian coffee was " really very , very good " , he did not trust trying the local milk , which is why he had brought the coffee whitener with him .
He added : " I started tasting some of it and the guards insisted I had more to see if I was going to trip out .
" When it became obvious it was n't happening , they started giggling and one tried it on their tongue .
" Mind you , I felt pretty ill after trying some .
By the time you 've had several scoops of Coffee Mate , and of course it expands in your stomach , it 's not very nice . "

What are these ?
A lot of hot air ?
Not entirely .
By the late 1800s , the hot - air balloon was already old news , perfected in the previous century as the first successful means to enable humanity to fly – though Joseph - Michel and Jacques - Étienne Montgolfier , who took to the air in 1783 , initially thought it was the dense smoke from the fire beneath their balloon that provided its lift .
A hundred years later , as evidenced by this picture from a leading popular science weekly , what North Americans craved were airships , preferably real , but imaginary would do .
The technology required for a powered , lighter - than - air vessel that could be steered and travel against the prevailing winds , was far from being perfected .
But technical journals of the time were happy to write about such craft as if they were an established , flying fact .
And people all across America proved themselves capable of believing they 'd seen something that was n't there .
Mass hysteria , wish fulfillment or a desperate dream to counter desperate times make the " Great Airship of 1897 " the UFO ( though that term had n't yet been coined ) of its time , J.P. Chaplin wrote in his book , Rumor , Fear and the Madness of Crowds .
Hundreds of thousands of people believed they 'd seen ... something in the sky that was man-made , had engines and could fly .
To put the development of airships into context , Henri Giffard flew 27 kilometres in 1852 in an airship with a steam engine .
But he could n't steer it in the face of any kind of wind .
By 1863 , Solomon Andrews had developed an airship that could be steered but had no engine .
In 1872 , Paul Haenlein took to the skies in a ship that used coal gas both to inflate the envelope and power its engine .
But it was n't until 1897 that David Schwartz made a successful flight from Tempelhof field – which became one of Berlin's three airports – in a rigid airship that was a direct forerunner of the globetrotting dirigibles created by Ferdinand von Zeppelin .
After Schwartz 's death , von Zeppelin bought technical data from his widow .
This early incarnation of what , in the 1920s and '30s , became an icon of exotic , futuristic travel clearly was not what hundreds of thousands of people across the United States reported seeing in 1897 .
The country was in the midst of one of the worst economic depressions in its history , with some two million people out of work .
Small wonder that they should cast their eyes heavenward for signs of hope .
What they saw – or thought they saw or convinced themselves they 'd seen – was a " cigar - like object " with " great wings " several kilometres above the ground .
Sightings were reported from California to New York .
In Chicago , around 2 a.m. on April 9 , thousands of people , including what contemporary reports called " men of unquestioned veracity , " took to the streets to gape at the apparition .
It had , they agreed , a white headlight , a green light at its mid-point , and a red light at the tail .
The consensus was that it was a cylindrical gasbag with a metal frame and a gondola suspended beneath it .
Some claimed to have seen a man who appeared to be steering the ship .
A couple of photographs were quickly dismissed as fakes .
Various people claimed to have invented the airship , to have flown in it , or to know the secret – gently flapping wings was one explanation – of its propulsion .
Chaplin , writing 62 years later , reckoned many of the sightings could have been naturally occurring astronomical phenomena .
Later reports may have been the result of pranksters sending up balloons with lights attached .
There was also , he said , a great willingness to believe , which was why " the hysteria spread so rapidly ...
The main explanation would seem to lie in the widespread interest in aeronautics ...
Inventors were on the threshold of solving both the problem of controlling airships in flight and of devising heavier - than - air flying machines .
" There can be little doubt that the interest generated by these pioneer experiments provided an aura of credibility to the reports of an airship cruising over the Midwest . "
" An aura of credibility ... "
Scientific American , first published in 1845 , is America 's oldest continuously published magazine .
Though its aim has always been to bring an understanding of " popular science " to the layperson , it has also always been a well - respected journal .
The Jan. 1 , 1887 , edition published a story headlined : " A Novel Form of Aerial Vessel , " with an engraving of " the invention of Mr. Moses S. Cole , of Greytown , Nicaragua ...
It is claimed that this vessel can be raised , lowered , steered and propelled in any direction at the will of the pilot . "
The story gave comprehensive details of how the airship was built – " an inflated balloon of semi- spheroidal form , while to the floor is attached a similar balloon " – driven and steered .
The only thing not covered in detail was what exactly powered Cole 's brainchild .
Otherwise , the craft was presented as if it existed , had been tested , and was ready to go into operation .
Clearly , none of this was true .
Such a machine would have been decades ahead of its time .
But , equally clearly , this was what Scientific American 's readers were eager to hear .
As the newspaper editor in the classic western movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance said , " When the legend becomes fact , print the legend . "
If you give the people what they want , perhaps one day it might come true .

Richard Wright had been due to accompany David Gilmour on the show Pink Floyd star David Gilmour has performed one of the band 's early songs in tribute to the group 's keyboardist Richard Wright , who died last week .
Gilmour gave a poignant rendition of Remember A Day , written by Wright , who died from cancer at the age of 65 .
The song was on Pink Floyd 's 1968 second album Saucerful of Secrets .
" He created a sound that glued the whole Pink Floyd thing together , " Gilmour said on BBC Two music show Later ... With Jools Holland .
" He was just a very self - effacing but very talented , lovely chap .
We 're incredibly sad to have lost him . "
Wright had been due to accompany Gilmour on the TV show , but sent the guitarist a text message three weeks ago saying he would not be able to play .
After his death , Gilmour decided to play Remember A Day .
It is thought that the song had not been performed live for many years .
Wright sang lead vocals on the original version , which was recorded just before Gilmour joined the group .
Gilmour recalled meeting Wright in 1965 , when his first band supported Pink Floyd in " schools and big old youth clubs " .
Pink Floyd reformed for Live 8 in 2005 , with Gilmour ( left ) and Wright ( right ) Wright was " so shy and quiet " , he told host Jools Holland .
Asked about Wright 's contribution to Pink Floyd , he replied : " He brought a slightly more jazzy and ethereal element to it all .
" He had some elusive quality , let 's call it soul , that glued the whole thing together .
You notice it when it 's missing . "
One edition of Later ... was broadcast on Tuesday , with a longer version to be aired on BBC Two on Friday .
For the Friday episode , Gilmour also performed The Blue , from his 2006 solo album On An Island .
The album version of that song featured Wright on backing vocals , and Wright had also accompanied Gilmour on tour .
The keyboardist was " revelling in what he was doing " in recent years , Gilmour said .
" He had so much joy in him . "
The show also featured Mercury Prize winners Elbow , new US pop star Katy Perry and British hip - hop artist Roots Manuva .
Later ... with Jools Holland is on BBC Two at 2335 BST on Friday .

What are these ?
The idea that Americans want leaders who have none of those things  who are so blindly certain of what Ms. Palin calls “ the mission ” that they wo n’t even pause for reflection  shows a contempt for voters and raises frightening questions about how Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin plan to run this country .
One of the many bizarre moments in the questioning by ABC News ’s Charles Gibson was when Ms. Palin , the governor of Alaska , excused her lack of international experience by sneering that Americans do n’t want “ somebody ’s big fat résumé maybe that shows decades and decades in that Washington establishment where , yes , they ’ve had opportunities to meet heads of state . ”
We know we were all supposed to think of Joe Biden .
But it sure sounded like a good description of Mr. McCain .
Those decades of experience earned the Arizona senator the admiration of people in both parties .
They are why he was our preferred candidate in the Republican primaries .
The interviews made clear why Americans should worry about Ms. Palin ’s thin résumé and lack of experience .
Consider her befuddlement when Mr. Gibson referred to President Bush ’s “ doctrine ” and her remark about having insight into Russia because she can see it from her state .
But that is not what troubled us most about her remarks  and , remember , if they were scripted , that just means that they reflect Mr. McCain ’s views all the more closely .
Rather , it was the sense that thoughtfulness , knowledge and experience are handicaps for a president in a world populated by Al Qaeda terrorists , a rising China , epidemics of AIDS , poverty and fratricidal war in the developing world and deep economic distress at home .
MINNEAPOLIS -- Corporate executives , who once discounted John McCain 's campaign , have been key to the Republican presidential nominee 's rebound on the fund - raising circuit , a new analysis of campaign donations shows .
Since the 2008 presidential campaign began , Democratic candidate Barack Obama has raised more than double Sen.
McCain 's haul and beaten the Arizona Republican in just about every fund - raising category .
But ...
To his credit , Charlie Gibson actually did a pretty good job of grilling Sarah Palin in her first interview since accepting the Republican nomination .
When asked whether or not she agrees with the Bush Doctrine -- the idea that the United States should be able to reserve the right to launch unprovoked attacks on nations deemed a threat to us -- a visibly confused Palin simply does n't know how to respond coherently .
Download Download
GIBSON : Do you agree with the Bush doctrine ?
PALIN : In what respect , Charlie ?
GIBSON : The Bush -- well , what do you -- what do you interpret it to be ?
PALIN : His world view ?
GIBSON : No , the Bush doctrine , enunciated September 2002 , before the Iraq war .
PALIN : I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this world of Islamic extremism , terrorists who are hell bent on destroying our nation .
There have been blunders along the way , though .
There have been mistakes made .
And with new leadership , and that 's the beauty of American elections , of course , and democracy , is with new leadership comes opportunity to do things better .
GIBSON : The Bush doctrine , as I understand it , is that we have the right of anticipatory self - defense , that we have the right to a preemptive strike against any other country that we think is going to attack us .
Do you agree with that ?

This modified PuTTY stores the PuTTY sessions in folder instead of storing it in the registry .
If you already have sessions stored in the registry , it will display those also .
The sessions stored in registry will be marked as [ registry ] as shown below .
When you create a session using this PuTTY , this creates a sub - folder called session in the same folder where putty .
exe is located , to store all the sessions in the file .

PocketPuTTY runs on Windows Mobile 2003 / 5.0 operating system .
After I got my blackberry , I have dumped my Dell Axim that was running on Windows Mobile .
So , I have not tried PocketPuTTY myself .
If you ’ve used PocketPuTTY or other mobile version of PuTTY , please leave your feedback .

Note :
If you are using blackberry phone , refer to Blackberry PuTTY Tutorial for installing and configuring PuTTY on blackberry .
portaPuTTY is a modified version of the PuTTY that stores the session information in a file by default , instead of storing it in the windows registry .
The session files are stored under .putty / sessions folder .
The .putty folder is created under the same directory where the putty .
exe is located .
PuTTY Portable is part of PortableApps suite .
Use this to launch PuTTY from the USB drive and carry the sessions along with you .
If you are using Launchy , the open source keystroke launcher for windows , you can use Putty Launchy Plugin , to launch putty sessions from Launchy very easily .
i.e you can type “ ssh ” or “ putty ” followed by tab or space to list all of your PuTTY sessions .
Once you select a particular session , Launchy will automatically launch that particular PuTTY session .
Fig – PuTTY Launchy Plugin .
Type ssh followed by tab .
PuTTY Session Manager will let you organize the PuTTY sessions into folders and assign hotkeys .
This requires Microsoft .NET 2.0 .
Right click on the PSM icon in the system track and select “ Session Hotkeys ” to assign hot - keys for PuTTY session as shown below .

PuTTYCS is very helpful little tool that can boost your productivity by eliminating repetitive tasks performed on different servers .
Using PuTTYCS , you can send a unix command to multiple PuTTY windows at the same time .
You can use this to backup files , view log files , start and stop processes , copying file etc. , on multiple servers , just by executing the command once , as shown below .

How Lending Standard Changes Led to the Housing Boom / Bust
There is a general lack of understanding as to how the Housing boom and bust occurred , and why it led to the subsequent credit freeze .
The situation is complex , and that is why we are still explaining this 3 years into the housing bust .
Let me take another shot at clarifying this :
Underlying EVERYTHING
-- housing boom and bust , derivative explosion , credit crisis -- is the enormous change in lending standards .
I am not sure many people understand the massive change that took place during the 2002 - 07 period .
It was more than a subtle shift -- it was an abdication of the traditional lending standards that had existed for decades , if not centuries .
After the Greenspan Fed took rates down to ultra - low levels , home prices began to levitate .
More and more mortgages were being securitized -- purchased by Wall Street , and repackaged into other forms of bond - like paper .
The low rates spurred demand for this higher yielding , triple AAA rated , asset - backed paper .
In this ultra - low rate environment , where prices were appreciating , and most mortgages were being securitized , all that mattered to the mortgage originator was that a BORROWER NOT DEFAULT FOR 90 DAYS ( some contracts were 6 Months ) .
The contracts between the firms that originated mortgages and the Wall Street firms that securitized them had explicit warranties .
The mortgage seller guaranteed to the mortgage bundle buyer ( underwriter ) that payments were current , the mortgage holders were valid , and that the loan would not default for 90 or 180 days .
So long as the mortgage did not default in that period of time , it could not be " put back " to the originator .
A salesman or mortgage business would only lose their fee if the borrower defaulted within that 3 or 6 month contractually specified period .
Indeed , a default gave the buyer the right to return the mortgage and charge back the lender the full purchase price .
What do rational , profit - maximizers do ?
They put people in houses that would not default in 90 days -- and the easiest way to do that were the 2/28 ARM mortgages .
Cheap teaser rates for 24 months , then the big reset .
Once the reset occurred 24 months later , it was long off the books of the mortgage originators -- by then , it was Wall Street 's problem .
This was a monumental change in lending standards .
It created millions of new potential home buyers .
Why ?
Instead of making sure that borrowers could pay back a loan , and not default over the course of a 30 YEAR FIXED MORTGAGE , originators only had to find people who could afford the teaser rate for a few months .
This was a simply unprecedented shift in lending standards .
And , it is why 293 mortgage lenders have imploded -- all of these bad loans were put back to them .
Note that the fear of this occurring is what was supposed to keep the lenders in line .
The repercussions of this is why Greenspan believed the free market could self - regulate .
( After all , people are rational , right ? )
One of the many odd lessons of this era is that , under certain circumstances , companies and salespeople will pursue short term profits to the point where it literally destroys the firm .
If you want to point to the single most important element of the Housing boom and bust , this is it .
Ultimately , these defaulting mortgages underlie the entire credit freeze .
And , it would not have been possible without the Greenspan ultra - low rates , which made the teaser portion ( the " 2 " of the 2/28 ) of these mortgages so attractive .
Contrary to the cliche , failure is not an orphan in the current crisis -- it has 100s of fathers .
But these four are the primary movers , the key to everything else .
The perfect storm of ultra- low rates , securitization , lax lending standards and triple AAA ratings -- these are the key to how we ended up with the previous boom , followed by a bust , and ultimately , the credit freeze .

Introduction
The New York Times bestseller , “ The 4 - Hour Work Week ” , is getting a lot of press coverage .
For those that have n’t heard about the book , the author , Tim Ferriss , explains how he has designed his lifestyle around a business that takes him just four hours a week to run .
He spends the rest of his life travelling and pursuing his hobbies .
Heaven !
But is it realistic ?
The Challenge
I decided to set myself the challenge of ‘ designing ’ a business that could :
• Be run in just 4 hours a week
• Provide an income of $ 60,000 a year
This is a very tough ask .
After all if it was easy there would be thousands or even millions of people doing it .
However the web is changing fast and there are many ways of greatly reducing workload .
This challenge was a great opportunity to think about how they could be pulled together to create the perfect automated business .
The Only Way To Eat an Elephant …
….is one mouthful at a time !
To create a business that requires only 4 hours a week to run will require very careful planning .
• Automation - Every task that can be automated has to be automated
• Outsourcing – Tasks that ca n’t be automated , because they need some human input , need to be outsourced
• Systemization – Anything that needs the site owners personal attention , needs to be systemized to minimize the time it takes to deal with it
• Manual Tasks – some one - off tasks will need to be dealt with as they arise
Painting the Picture
To illustrate the example , I will use the story of Jane Peterson :
“ Jane Peterson ’s 3 - year old son got very sick when he drank some cleaning bleach he found in a cupboard at home .
This frightening incident led Jane to research all the things that could harm children in a normal home .
Her research revealed a lot of hazards from staircases to chemicals , drowning risks to electric shocks .
She tried to find a single book which both highlighted the hazards AND provided solutions for minimizing the risks .
To her surprise she could not find a good resource .
There were a lot of commercial products available to address most the problems in a typical home .
But there was no easy way to assess the risks .
Jane decided to create a “ Parents Safety Checklist ” , that would enable new parents to do a home audit , to ensure every room was as safe as possible for young children .
Once written , she put it on a website for $ 9.95 a copy .
To her great disappointment she sold only 48 copies in the first 4 months .
So she decided to give it away for free .
To her surprise the book was downloaded thousands of times … and was mentioned in many magazines and newspapers
… but she made no money .
Then one day , out of the blue , a big baby products retailer wrote to her to ask if they could sponsor the book and offer their products for sale via her website .
And this is where Jane finds herself today " .
The question she is asking herself is “ could I turn this website into a business which could earn $ 60,000 a year but take less than 4 hours per week to run ? ”
The Business Basics
To earn $ 60,000 a year , Jane would need to generate $ 5,000 a month , plus costs .
If we assume the monthly costs , including outsourcing , are :
Advertising : $ 1,000
Content creation : $ 1,500
Website : $ 500
TOTAL $ 3,000
Jane would need to generate $ 8,000 a month after costs .
Or $ 267 a day .
The children ’s product supplier has offered her a sales arrangement which would enable Jane to make 40 % profit on any sales .
At 40 % Jane would need to sell $ 667 worth of products every day .
The average order value is estimated to be $ 35 so Jane would need 19 sales per day to hit her target .
If 3 out of every 100 visitors to her website bought something she would need 627 visitors every day … or 18,800 a month .
This is challenging goal , but not impossible .
Turning a Free Book Into a Revenue Generating Website
The way that I would convert Jane ’s book into a revenue generating website , is to turn each of the room checklists into a printable webpage .
Alongside the checklist , I would recommend products that could reduce risks in the home .
For example , for the kitchen checklist page , the recommended products could include cupboard locks , a lockable storage box for dangerous liquids , electric socket covers , a fire extinguisher , a first aid kit , etc .
I would link each product to the shopping cart so they could be ordered from the checklist .
Ordered products would drop into the shopping cart and be listed on the single checkout page ready for payment .
The orders would be paid for on the site and then automatically emailed to the retailer for shipping direct to the client .
The retailer would then invoice Jane electronically .
This sounds complicated but every good shopping cart application does this stuff .
To ensure this process would not require any human input it would have to be fully automated .
Automating the Website
The first step in the process is to automate the website as much as possible .
• Use a Managed Service –
This is a website platform which is managed by a third party in exchange for a monthly fee .
It will avoid Jane having to look after hosting , bandwidth , monitoring and maintenance .
This can be a time consuming and frustrating job
• Turn Jane ’s book into the pages of the website .
Alongside each safety recommendation , I would list the products that could solve the problem
• The website would have an shopping cart , where products that a customer selects are listed prior to checkout
• The checkout process should be fully automated :
o Postage and packing and tax should be added to the order
o Payment should be taken via PayPal or credit card
o An email should be automatically sent to the customer listing what they have bought and when it will be dispatched
o At the same time , the order should be emailed to the supplier , ready for posting
o Sales figures should be automatically downloaded into an accounts package such as Quicken
• To build a relationship with clients there should be an automatically generated email newsletter which anyone can sign up to ( e.g. FeedBlitz and Nouri.sh )
Outsourcing
To drive traffic to the website , new content will need to be continually added to the website .
To get 18 k visitors to the site it needs to be updated five times a week .
To avoid Jane needing to spend a lot of time writing these articles , content creation will need to be outsourced .
A contract to India will get 20 good articles a month written for $ 1,500 .
These can be a mixture of product reviews and safety articles .
( Try eLance or oDesk ) .
These articles can both be published on the site and syndicated via SubmitYourArticle to boost their impact on traffic .
The site must have a good content management solution so that non technical people can easily add text and images .
Adding relevant comments to forums , social media sites and blogs to drive traffic to the site can be outsourced for a further $ 250 a month to a company like Submit Comfort .
If you have a customer support requirement , this can be outsourced too .
In Jane ’s case the product supplier will deal with questions , returns and product issues .
This is the ideal situation .
Systemization
To monitor the businesses performance , Jane will need to have weekly access to all the important information .
The reports she receives should include :
• Website statistics – number of visitors , pageviews , most popular pages , etc ( Use the excellent free Google Analytics - www.google.com/analytics)
• Sales figures – total sales , profit , conversion rate , what products sold , etc .
( This information should be available from the products supplier .
When setting up the deal , establish how frequently they will provide sales reports )
• Outsourcing activity – what content has been created and published .
Make sure you build reporting into the contract
Jane should put aside an hour a week to do this analysis .
Based on the results the website should be continually improved and the outsourcing company updated .
The Manual Stuff
With every business there is manual stuff which cannot be automated , outsourced or systemized .
This could include :
• Dealing with unhappy clients
• Negotiating with suppliers
• Creating partnerships
• Updating the accountant
• Website design and improvements briefs
• Etc .
Time would need to be set aside to do this stuff .
If the business owner does not do it , it wo n’t get done .
Dividing the Time
Instead of sticking to the 4 hours a week , I would suggest that Jane thinks about allocating work across 16 hours a month .
Here is a rough breakdown of tasks and times for a typical month :
1.5 hours per week on email and dealing with queries = 6 hours
1 hour per week on analyzing reports and data = 4 hours
2 hours a month on revising strategy = 2 hours
2 hours a month on admin , bill paying , accounts = 2 hours
2 hours for one off manual tasks = 2 hours
Total = 16 hours !
Every month will vary and some months will need additional time ( e.g. end of year accounts ) , but this breakdown seems like a good goal .
Starting the Business
No significant business can be built from scratch doing just 4 hours a week .
Getting the business up and running will either be a full - time job or it will take some time doing it part - time .
Some of the things that will need to be done :
• Create business - name , registration , legal forms , setup bank account , etc
• Identify suppliers
• Identify outsourcers
• Negotiate contracts
• Identify managed website platform
• Write web design brief
• Create content for the website ( about us page , contact information , product pages , etc. )
• Set up reports ( website statistics , income reports , outsource reports , etc. )
• Etc .
Running the Business
If Jane set the business up and then handed it straight over to an outsource company , asking them to grow it for her , it will fail .
Outsourcers follow instructions .
They are not creative business owners .
If they were , they would be running their own company !
In order to outsource a business in a way that maintains or increases sales , you need to get the business running smoothly first .
If you run the business yourself until it is successful , you can then turn all the daily tasks into bite sized chunks .
An outsourcer should be then able to undertake these tasks within the rules you give them .
You may have to grow and run the business for six to twelve months before it reaches the income level and stability that can be handed over to someone else .
Tim Ferriss acknowledges in his book that he spent years working 12 hours a day to get his business established .
Only once it was making good money did he outsource it .
I know this is not what a lot of entrepreneurs want to hear , but it is the unavoidable truth !
Income Potential
For Jane to reach her income target of $ 60,000 , plus costs or $ 8,000 a month , she would need to focus on building the traffic to her website .
Our traffic target is 18,800 / month with a 3 % conversion rate to give her $ 8 k income .
It is always difficult to predict traffic growth .
One article in a newspaper can suddenly generate several thousand visitors in a day .
If Jane set her target at $ 8 k a month , by month six , she would need to consistently grow traffic at the rate of 3 k people per month .
This is possible , but challenging .
Jane would need to create great content that would build a loyal audience .
She would also need to have a newsletter to ensure she encouraged this core audience to keep returning .
On top of this she would need to participate in the online community for parents and mothers to get them to the site .
Once the core audience is established these marketing activities ( content creation and community activity ) can be outsourced .
Conclusion
From doing this exercise and understanding how our most successful clients work , I believe it would be possible to reduce the time spent working on a website business down to 4 hours per week .
However , I also know that a business is unlikely to grow if left to outsource partners .
Therefore the site owner will need to take responsibility for getting the business working efficiently and profitably before getting others to do the work .
A good lesson you should take away from this analysis , is that at every stage of your online businesses development you should be asking yourself what can you automate and outsource .
You should be continually try to make the business less dependant on your input .
Only by doing this will you release time for family , friends and hobbies , which after all , is probably the reason why you want to run your own business in the first place !

I turn to her , and she lowers her voice to almost a growl and narrows her voice . )

I hate you because you work in it .

Those who practice the procedure will be punished by a jail term of three months to two years or a fine of 1,000 Egyptian pounds ( 190 U.S. dollars ) to 5,000 pounds ( 940 dollars ) , said the new legislation , which is part of the children 's rights bill .
Taking immediate effect , the new law also toughens penalties for anyone who is convicted of flouting the ban .
In June 2007 , Egyptian Minister of Health and Population Hatem el - Gabali issued a decree , banning all doctors and members of the medical profession from performing the procedure , which can cause death through haemorrhaging and sequelae during childbirth , as well as carries risks of infection , urinary tract problems and mental trauma .
Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak , the wife of President Hosni Mubarak , has campaigned against the practice , calling it " one of the most fearful attacks against women " and terming the battle to stop it a national priority .

PALIN TO DUMP McCAIN FROM GOP TICKET
Satire by R J Shulman
VINCENNES , Indiana - ( PTSD News ) - Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin announced today that she has asked top GOP officials to fire John McCain as the GOP presidential candidate .
" He has served his country well , " Palin told a cheering overflow crowd in this southwestern Indiana city , " but he is starting to drag down my numbers , so he 'll have to go .
To make sure he 's gone , " she said , " I 'll offer one hundred and fifty dollars to the first person to shoot him and bring me his cut off right hand -- just kidding .
I do n't need to see the hand , a faxed picture will do . "
" If there is anyone who can get officials to fire someone she does n't like , it 's Sarah , " said an unnamed Republican spokesperson .
" This will be a good move for the GOP , " said Charles L. Sonderheim of the Heritage Foundation , " Palin has been packing them in , while McCain can't fill a McDonalds . "
Rules state that if the front runner is removed before the election , the vice presidential nominee become the presidential candidate .
" We all know that God has anointed her to be president , " said Reverend Ed Kalnin , Palin 's former preacher , " so why delay the process , just like we should n't delay Armageddon . "
" It 'll be great opportunity to be your President , " Palin told the Indiana crowd , " because while it has been fun to see Russia from my house , I just can't wait to see Russia from the cockpit of a plane as something nuclear is being dropped . "
There has been no word on who would be tapped as Palin 's vice presidential running mate .
" We need to emphasize Sarah 's qualifications to be president by picking someone who is a little less qualified than her , but charming , of course , " said a top GOP spokesperson , " However this may take some time , although we have a lead on a pig with lipstick in Waterloo , Iowa that is dying to get off the farm .

At least 147 people have been killed in a stampede at a Hindu temple in the north - western Indian state of Rajasthan , the state government says .
Scores more were injured , many seriously , in the crush at the Chamunda Devi temple in Jodhpur .
A wall near the temple is said to have collapsed , causing panic among thousands of devotees marking the start of the Hindu Navaratra festival .
There have been a number of recent deadly stampedes at Indian temples .
Suddenly , people bunched up into one another and there was shoving and pushing ...
We fell on the ground
Survivor Daulat Singh
In pictures : India temple stampede Timeline : Most deadly stampedes
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Delhi says this is the fourth time this year that lives had been lost - probably needlessly - during a stampede at a religious festival in India .
He says crowd control at such events is usually rudimentary and the police simply not trained in effective crowd management .
Last month 140 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at a mountain temple in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh .
' Still buried '
The Chamunda Devi temple is inside the huge 15th Century Mehrangarh Fort , high above Jodhpur 's " blue city " .
It is popular with tourists and local people - particularly at this time , the start of the nine - day festival of Navaratra .
Before dawn , thousands of people had made their way to the hill - top temple overlooking the city .
It is not entirely clear why the stampede happened , but something triggered panic among men queuing in the narrow lane leading to the temple .
Hundreds rushed down the hill crushing those waiting at the bottom .
" I was at the temple in a queue of people when , suddenly , people bunched up into one another and there was shoving and pushing , " one survivor , Daulat Singh , told the BBC Hindi service .
" We fell on the ground , and on top of us , some 30 or 40 men fell .
It was difficult to get people out . "
Another man , Naresh Kumar Meena , said : " In front of the temple , there was some bamboo railing which collapsed .
As soon as that happened , everyone near to it fell .
There were also people pushing from behind . "
Police and volunteers spent hours ferrying the injured for treatment
One official in Jodhpur said the collapse of a wall on the narrow path leading to the temple caused people to flee .
There were also false rumours of a bomb , reports said .
Rajasthan 's Home Secretary SN
Thanvi said : " The stampede began when people lost their footing and set off a chain reaction . "
Television footage showed dozens of injured littering the streets .
With no first aid available at the scene , people tried desperately to resuscitate the unconscious as others scooped up bodies and took them to hospital .
" When I arrived , I saw chaos , people running around the place .
I was looking for my friend and after a while found him , " local student Manish said .
" He was unconscious but without serious injuries . "
The authorities have ordered an investigation into the incident .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
New theory work at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has shown that more than half of the spin of the proton is the result of the movement of its building blocks : quarks .
The result , published in the Sept. 5 issue of Physical Review Letters , agrees with recent experiments and supercomputer calculations .
It was thought that the spin of the proton would come from its quarks , but experiments beginning with the European Muon Collaboration in the 1980s have established that the quarks ' spin accounts for only one third of the proton 's spin .
Researchers thus began investigating other sources of the proton ’s spin .
This research concerns one theoretical model , proposed by Jefferson Lab Chief Scientist Tony Thomas and University of South Carolina Professor Fred Myhrer , that suggests that some of the proton ’s spin is actually generated as orbital angular momentum by its quarks .
“ Rather than the way the quarks are spinning , it 's the way they 're moving in orbital motion .
In fact , more than half of the spin of the proton is orbital motion of the quarks .
That 's a really fascinating thing , ” Thomas said .
In this paper , Thomas explored the model ’s predictions further by extracting more detailed information , including how the orbital angular momentum is generated by the different quarks inside the proton , which has two up quarks and one down quark .
He found that the model seemed to contradict experimental results and the results from highly sophisticated supercomputer calculations of quark behavior , called lattice QCD .
The model showed that up quarks carried most of the proton ’s spin , whereas experiment and lattice QCD point to down quarks .
Thomas said it turns out that the disagreement is only a matter of resolution .
The only way to relate such models to the underlying theory of quark interactions is to assume the model ’s predictions are made at low resolution .
However , experiment and supercomputer calculations are made at high resolution .
“ In the past , there 's been tremendous success starting with the quark model at some very low scale , and then evolving to a higher scale , where you can compare with experiment , ” Thomas explained .
“ If you make that generally accepted assumption , then the resulting high - resolution values are in surprisingly good agreement with state - of - the - art lattice QCD calculations , as well as with recent experiments conducted at Hermes and Jefferson Lab .
There is a remarkable degree of consistency . ”
The next step is to compare the model with results from upcoming , more detailed measurements of the orbital angular momentum of the quarks in the proton .

Under the fold the latest from the industry on the LOOP , Port Fourchon , and other infrastructural concerns .
Meanwhile , about 47 percent of more than 700 stationary offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico remained evacuated Friday , according to the Minerals Management Service in New Orleans .
The agency also said that 34 of 121 oil rigs remained unmanned .
It has been five days since Hurricane Gustav blew through town , and industry is still working to restore the flow of oil and gas from offshore production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico :
Likewise , the LOOP ( Louisiana Offshore Oil Port ) has reopened .
However , it is running on backup power such that only one tanker at a time can be drained of oil .
Commercial power might not be restored to the offshore terminal for another week or two .
With Hurricane
Ike possibly headed for the same area in about five days , one might consider whether it is worth the effort to go back out there and restart things until the latest storm passes .
What is the process for shutting down production and evacuating prior to the storm ?
What ( and how long ) does it take to do the reverse ?
This document ( 1 MB pdf ) from the National Ocean Industries Association provides some answers to these questions and well as information on regulations for platform design and operations with hurricanes in mind .
For example , here is the shut - down procedure in brief :
Evacuation Phase 1 - Receive Storm Notification Review operations forecast .
Communicate with air and marine transportation
providers .
Perform safety system checks .
Evacuation Phase 2 - Complete Preparations Secure all equipment .
Test communications systems that enable monitoring
from shore .
Evacuate non-essential personnel .
Evacuation Phase 3 - Shut Down and Evacuation Shut - in wells and subsurface safety valves Close incoming and exit pipelines
Shut down operating systems Transport remaining personnel to shore
And here is the start - up :

Once shut down , the biggest problem is with damaged pipelines on the sea floor .
These can often be repaired or bypassed without too much delay , but damage to the platform itself is a much bigger headache .
The poster child for a platform suffering from a bad air day is the Thunder Horse platform , which was left atilt by Hurricane Dennis in 2005 .
Shell 's Mars Platform stayed upright during Hurricane Katrina , but it took nine months to restore the oil flow -- no small feat given the photo below :
At the time that the above - linked NOIA pdf was written , 343,000 BPD of production was still shut in from platforms damaged by hurricanes the previous summer ( 2005 ) .
A more politically - sensitive issue is environmental risks from hurricane damage , and the NOIA document highlights the various technologies -- mandated by regulations -- which prevent the spillage of oil from ruptured pipelines .
All offshore platforms are equipped with safety valves that shut -in
oil and natural gas in the event of storm damage .
These valves lock
closed at regular intervals so that oil or gas cannot flow if equipment
is broken or separated .
Every single safety valve held during the
2005 hurricane season .
Most of the damage to platforms has occurred on structures built prior to the 1988 regulations .
I do n't know , however , to what extent that older infrastructure has been retrofitted with equipment designed to prevent spills .
Given the current volume level of the offshore drilling issue during the 2008 US Presidential election , an incident of any consequence due to Ike ( or perhaps Kyle ) will easily ratchet the noise up to a level of eleven .
Well there ’s another McCain talking point out the window , about how speeches do not a president make .
I guess now they do .
And , if reading speeches off a teleprompter were the only requirement for being commander in chief of the US armed forces , then yes Sarah Palin reading a series of speeches written for her would be enough .
But it ’s not enough , and it suggests that McCain thinks Palin is an idiot who ca n’t even answer a simple question from the media , or the American public ( or worse , she she ’s so tainted by scandal , they refuse to put her out there at all ) .
It ’s downright disturbing how the McCain campaign is handling Palin and her growing list of scandals / controversies .
They seem to be hoping that they can trick the American people into liking her , without giving them any real substance .
Possibly because she has no real substance .
Then again , they ’re refusing to put John McCain out there for any questions either .
Kind of makes you wonder if he ’s still healthy enough to be commander in chief , or if the campaign is hiding something about John McCain ’s health and that ’s why they wo n’t let him do any more press conferences ( remember , McCain is 72 years old and has had at least 4 bouts of cancer ) .
Jake Carney of TIME gets into this more in depth :
The pioneering Massachusetts program to provide health insurance for all citizens looks more and more successful with each passing month .
The number of uninsured has dropped 
Massachusetts now has the lowest rate in the nation  and so have the number of those who turn to costly emergency rooms for routine care .
And while the state has had to seek additional sources of revenue  mainly because of the program ’s popularity  the gains in the first 21 months suggest that the plan could become a model for universal health coverage for other states or the nation .
Massachusetts enacted its ambitious health insurance reform two years ago under bipartisan leadership from then - Gov. Mitt Romney and a Democratic Legislature .
Although Mr. Romney distanced himself from the plan during the Republican primaries , he was back to extolling its virtues in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month .
The plan requires everyone to take out health insurance or suffer a tax penalty and requires employers to offer coverage or pay a small assessment if they do n’t .
Low - income residents can enroll in an expanded state - federal Medicaid program or receive subsidies to pay all or part of the premiums for private insurance .
Those who earn more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level ( about $ 63,000 for a family of four ) receive no subsidy but can buy private policies through a new insurance exchange at much lower rates than before .
As far as Dynasty Warriors rip - offs went , Capcom 's Sengoku BASARA ( aka Devil Kings ) looked the most promising , but turned out to be the most disappointing .
With balance issues and a ridiculous overhaul between the Japan and Western releases that saw half the characters removed and the plot rewritten , it was a big wobbly let - down .
Still , Capcom is not deterred , and is instead using the BASARA franchise to continue its PSP support with Battle Heroes .
Unlike the DW - style hack n' slash of the PS2 original , this new game is being described as a 2 vs. 2 3D fighting game using the original engine .
It is due for a Japanese release in Spring 2009 .
I am interested , but the first game really was not up to Capcom standards .
It was as if Jeff Lynne had written The Fast Food Song .

Click to view Google 's new Chrome web browser beta is getting a lot of attention for its slick looks , helpful features , and performance , but how does it rank against the early releases of more established browsers ?
We 've previously put the major browser releases to the speed test , but today we 're measuring Chrome against the second beta of Internet Explorer 8 , as well as the beta of Firefox 3's next iteration , 3.1 .
We tested tomorrow 's browsers on startup and page - loading times , JavaScript and CSS performance , and , perhaps most importantly to the average user , memory use on launch and with lots of content loaded .
Read on to get the scoop on which bleeding - edge beta has the edge in the browser time trials .

The Tests
As with my previous browser tests , I installed completely fresh copies of the three browsers on my Windows Vista laptop , with all settings left to defaults .
With the second beta of Internet Explorer 8 , I reset the browser to factory settings and chose whatever Microsoft suggested during the click - through setup .
Advertisement
My test system has the same specs as before : A 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor , 2GB of memory , and running Windows Vista Home Premium .
For the time - based tests , I again used Rob Keir 's ultra - lightweight timer app , simultaneously tapping the " \ " key with " Enter " to launch a browser shortcut or folder full of bookmarks .
I performed each test on each browser three times and averaged out the results , while eliminating obvious oddities .
( With Vista 's often empirical hard drive usage , there were definitely artificially long start - ups ) .
It 's the same system I used to test Internet Explorer 7 , Firefox 3 RC3 , Safari for Windows , and Opera 9.5 , so you can make fair comparisons between all the browsers .
It 's not scientific in the strict sense , but it 's meant to measure browser performance as real humans experience it — load , click , and wait .

Test 1 : Startup Time — Winner : Chrome !
Drawing inspiration again from Mark Wilton - Jones trend - setting tests , I timed each browser loading up " cold " load ( straight off a system restart ) and " warm " ( having run twice already ) .
I used a locally - saved copy of Google 's minimalist home page to negate net connection variations , and , to compensate for Vista 's start - up fickleness , timed each browser exactly two minutes after boot - up .
Here are the first results :
Advertisement
Note the small scale of the time on the X - axis : Even though Chrome was ( quite surprisingly ) slower at startup than Firefox or even IE 8 , it 's less than a second of difference between them all .
That 's a bit more than an error from my twitchy fingers , but probably not enough to rate any one browser on .
Let 's check out the warm boots :
Advertisement
As you can see , Chrome 's noticeably fast on reload , although all the results are so close it's hard to confidently crown a winner .
Just like last time , IE 8 slightly edges out Firefox on warm boots , but lags just a bit behind when starting up .
Advertisement
You do n't start your browser to look at clean , white , locally - saved pages , do you ?
No , you speed around your must - visit sites , and often keep a bushel of them open at once .
For the next test , I led each browser page - by - page through the assortment of web sites pictured at right — some heavy with interactive elements , some just text and pictures — before jumping back to a blank page ( entering about : blank does this in any browser ) and loading all the links at once .
Each browser keeps a spinning icon on tabs as they load , so I measured from first click to the last tab settling in .
Advertisement
IE 8 and Chrome clock in too close to call , but Firefox fell behind .
Based on the minuscule difference in cold - boot time and the two warm tests , I 'd call Chrome the fastest , but definitely hand IE 8 a Most Improved Player trophy at the awards banquet .
Advertisement
Test 2 : JavaScript & CSS — Tie : Firefox & Chrome !
JavaScript continues to grow in importance as a browser benchmark , because it's the backbone of no-reload interfaces like Gmail , Facebook , and lots of other webapps .
Once again I used Sean Patrick Kane 's revised JavaScript speed tests and averaged out three results to measure the browsers :
Advertisement
Firefox bests
Chrome in this test by a handy lead , while IE 8 takes nearly twice as long ( in milliseconds , of course ) to perform all the actions Sean runs it through .
It 's anybody 's guess who 's got the most objective test — CNET 's testers show Chrome wrecking all comers , while Mozilla 's own tests declare their orange scrapper the winner in tight races .
I can only take away that IE 8 is definitely an improvement from IE 7's fall - behind pace , while Chrome and Firefox are pretty evenly matched ... ... until I ran the CSS tests , that is .
CSS determines the layout and appearance of a page , and nontropp 's downloadable form makes a browser work like a page designer on an all - guarana - and - coffee diet .
Advertisement
In the CSS test , as you can see , Chrome takes a commanding lead , Firefox does n't lag too far behind , and IE 8 actually stalled and froze on just about one of every two loads I ran .
When it came out of memory freeze , it did report consistent times , though — consistently behind .
One could hand the Dynamic Web Performance title to Firefox for the probably weightier JavaScript test , but Chrome also shows a notable grace in running down the type frequently found on blogs .
Let 's call this a tie .
Advertisement
Test 3 : Memory Use — Winner : Firefox !
How far the great - great - nephew of Netscape has come in its respect for your system 's resources .
Measured by Vista's Task Manager from cold boots and then with eight tabs loaded , Firefox shows some serious savvy with megabytes :
Advertisement
Do note , however , that Chrome handles tabs differently than others — each tab loads as its own process , so that if it crashes or stalls , the rest of your reading does n't go down with it .
So if you 've got solid - state chips to spare , it 's not that much more of a hit to run Chrome in a busy session .
As with our last test , we 'll note that browsing is much more than speed and bit usage — many of us can't imagine web life without our favorite extensions , or Windows integration , or , soon enough , Chrome 's unique features .

The Wikimedia Foundation , the organization behind the user - driven Wikipedia project , is in the process of migrating its servers to the Ubuntu Linux distribution .
Wikimedia 's move to Ubuntu is part of an effort to simplify administration of the organization 's 400 servers , which previously ran a mix of various versions of Red Hat and Fedora .
Ubuntu has achieved an unprecedented level of success in the desktop Linux market , but the distribution has been slow to gain acceptance on servers .
Wikimedia 's adoption of Ubuntu could help increase the distribution 's visibility in the Linux server market and demonstrate its viability in large - scale deployments .
Although the Wikimedia Foundation is a nonprofit organization that is primarily funded by donations , the organization 's technical requirements are significant .
Wikimedia CTO
Brion Vibber published some statistics in the slides ( PDF ) from his presentation at the Wikimania conference which took place in July at the new Library of Alexandria .
Wikimedia 's entire collection of web sites — which includes Wikipedia , Wikisource , Wikiquote , Wikinews , and several others — serves up roughly 10 billion page views per month .
At its peak , traffic can sometimes reach 50,000 HTTP requests per second .
The organization 's hardware budget to date is roughly $ 1.5 million , and it spends $ 35,000 per month on bandwidth and physical hosting .
All of its technical infrastructure is managed by a small IT staff consisting of only four paid employees and three volunteers .
In an interview with Computerworld , Vibber provided some insight into some of Wikimedia 's technical challenges and discussed the benefit of migrating the entire set of servers to a single distribution .
He says that the original Wikipedia site grew from 15 servers to 200 servers within the first 18 months .
Replacing their previous mix of distributions with a consistent and uniform Ubuntu solution has simplified administration considerably for the organization .
" We can run the same combination everywhere , and it does the same thing , " Vibber told Computerworld .
" Everything is a million times easier . "
Canonical initially announced the availability of Ubuntu for servers in 2005 and has taken several major steps since then to boost its popularity , including a partnership with Sun and several certification initiatives for major enterprise software packages .
At the Ubuntu Live conference last year , Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth said that the company will increasingly fund server improvements and also announced Landscape , a server management tool .
Despite these efforts to push Ubuntu in the server market , Canonical has had difficulty competing with Red Hat and Novell for enterprise server marketshare .
Some changing trends could , however , soon give Ubuntu an advantage .
Organizations are increasingly turning toward free , community - driven Linux distributions as in - house Linux expertise becomes more accessible .
During a presentation at the LinuxWorld conference earlier this year , 451 Group analyst Jay Lyman said that Ubuntu and CentOS will both gain enterprise acceptance as a result of this trend .
Wikimedia 's adoption of Ubuntu is a reflection of the distribution 's growing strength and popularity as a server solution , but it does n't appear that it will translate into revenue for Canonical because Wikimedia will be maintaining its systems largely without commercial support .
Now that Ubuntu is gaining traction with large - scale free deployments , the next challenge for Canonical will be getting some mindshare with enterprise adopters who are willing to sign up for support contracts .

Sony has just released its third generation internal Blu-ray disc writer for the masses without costing too much , ensuring you get to make an affordable upgrade for a cost - effective backup solution .
This new model is known as the BWU - 300S , and unless you have tons of data to burn and make backup copies at home or at the office , I still think regular DVDs will suffice .
After all , not every home has a Blu-ray player at this point in time , but sure as heck nearly every home with a computer is able to read DVDs , right ?
More on the Sony BWU - 300S right after the jump .
The new BWU - 300S model burns single and dual layer BD - R media at up to 8X speed , recording a full 25 GB disc in about 15 minutes and a full 50 GB disc in about 30 minutes .
The 8X recording speed is achieved using 6X compatible BD - R media .
The drive also records DVDs at up to 16X , CDs up to 48X , and supports DVD - RAM recording , with an eye towards data backup , making it an excellent replacement burner for a standard DVD drive while offering all the benefits of Blu-ray Disc technology .
The BWU - 300S drive can record up to 50 GB of data for random access storage and backup on BD - R ( write once ) or BD - RE ( rewritable ) discs , or up to 230 minutes of high - definition HDV 1080i video on a BD - R / RE 50 GB disc .
It also supports recording on standard single layer 4.7GB DVD +-R/+-RW/-RAM discs , 8.5GB DVD +- R double / dual layer discs , and CDs .
The internal drive features a Serial ATA ( SATA ) interface and standard 5.25 - inch form - factor for easy installation inside a desktop PC with Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista operating systems .
Also included with the drive is CyberLink ’s software suite for capturing , authoring , editing , burning and viewing high - definition personal content .
This $ 400 drive is not all about work though , since you get to have some fun by sampling a Blu-ray movie if you have n’t yet got the high definition bug .
Each purchase comes with a Blu-ray version of Men in Black - an old film ( by today ’s standards ) that is still as entertaining as it was when released many years ago .
Compared to the regular DVD version , this Blu-ray version features advanced BD - Live enabled bonus features such as a multiplayer trivia game , an interactive Frank the Pug advice generator and an alien subtitle track among others .

In liveblogging Sarah Palin 's acceptance speech , I noted that the ideal Republican candidate is someone who has the ability to lie without shame .
Sarah Palin proved within minutes of her speech that she was well - qualified in that regard .
The latest McCain - Palin ad reaffirms that the modern Republican Party , barren of ideas and solutions , will effortlessly and shamelessly resort to depraved lies to win .
The latest barrel - scrapping effort from John McCain is an ad which states that Barack Obama wants to teach kindergartners about sex before they can read ( see details and discussion here ) .
Barack Obama 's response :
" It is shameful and downright perverse for the McCain campaign to use a bill that was written to protect young children from sexual predators as a recycled and discredited political attack against a father of two young girls – a position that his friend Mitt Romney also holds .
Last week , John McCain told
Time magazine he could n’t define what honor was .
Now we know why , " says Obama spokesman Bill Burton in an emailed statement .
It is indeed a remarkably dishonorable act for John McCain to " approve this message . "
There is no Vietnam scar deep enough and no POW flag large enough to mask the brazen ugliness of this unprincipled and deliberate lie .
John McCain has used his five and half years in a cell three decades ago to shield off criticism of years ' worth of typical Republican politics .
No mantle of honor , though , can hide the hideousness of McCain 's latest attack .
It is not so much that the ad is a lie .
Lies , after all , are the campaign currency of Pinocchio Palin and Mendacious MccCain , used to buy a news cycle there or low - information vote there .
It is the type of lie that is presented that speaks more to John McCain 's character than five years in a prison cell ever did .
The ad accuses Barack Obama , a father of two young girls , of voting to teach kindergartners about sex .
In shorthand , it paints Obama as a sexual deviant , one who thinks it is entirely appropriate to teach your doe - eyed toddler about condoms and contraceptives .
The legislation was aimed at teaching children how to avoid sexual predators , but as this campaign season has proven time and time again , a well - sourced fact will wither in the face of an oft - repeated lie that is coddled by the media and echoed on the airwaves as truth .
So , welcome to today 's Republican Party , where facts are treated like an Rorschach inkblot test .
Where the benign is viewed as perverse and the perverse is viewed as benign .
Through the prism of this inverted ethical philosophy , it 's completely acceptable to laud a presidential candidate who thinks rape is just hilarious and to cheer on a vice - presidential candidate who was mayor of a town that charged victims for rape kits .
It 's a party where a congressman can state that naked prisoners stacked in a pyramid and tortured is nothing more than " hazing " , where Senators on a D.C. madam 's list still are welcomed into the GOP with open arms , and where Representatives soliciting 16 year old boys are allowed to resign rather than be kicked out of the party altogether .
What turns the stomach of normal society is not merely tolerated here in the confines of Pervert Central , but it is fully accepted in this circus .
Here , above all , the abnormal is normal in the caucus of freaks .
But oh , the indignation !
When a Democrat tries to protect children from a world of Mark Foleys , he is painted as a sex - obsessed deviant .
When a party seeks to preserve choice , it 's portrayed as wanting a society of one - night stands .
When rational science supports a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer , the GOP sees a potion for whores .
Yes , folks , it is Democrats who are obsessed with sex and who are insisting on reaching into your bedrooms and your bodies .
The Republicans ?
This Grand Old Party of pervert - protectors and sex monitors ?
This cadre of prudes who would rather have uninformed toddlers be molested , clueless teens knocked up , and uneducated Americans spreading STDs like fleas ?
Clearly , they are the honorable ones -- the moral compass of our nation .
They are nothing more than a parade of faux - Puritans marching back in time , waving banners of lies and singing smear chants along the way , twisting facts in the hot air that billows from their mouths , grinning stupidly from ear to ear , and reveling in their singular ability to beat the low drums of deceit without shame , day after day , until Election Day dawns .

Advertisement A Russian airliner that crashed near a city in the Urals , killing all 88 people on board , caught fire in mid-air , reports say .
The Boeing - 737-500 , belonging to a branch of the national airline Aeroflot , was on a flight from Moscow to Perm , near the Ural mountains .
Twenty - one foreign passengers were on board the Aeroflot Nord flight .
Radio contact with the plane was lost as it was landing .
One witness said it looked like a comet as it came down .
" It looked like a ... burning comet .
It hit the ground opposite the next house , there was a blaze , like fireworks , it lit the whole sky , the blaze , " the witness told Russian TV .
One witness said the blaze lit up the whole sky The Boeing - 737 had 82 passengers on board , including seven children , and six crew , Aeroflot said .
Those killed include Gen Gennady Troshev , a former commander of Russian forces in Chechnya and military advisor to former Russian President Vladimir Putin .
A spokesman for Russian federal prosecutors , Vladimir Markin , said a criminal inquiry had been launched to examine whether safety procedures had been violated .
Earlier , Mr Markin said the most likely cause of the crash was technical failure but Aeroflot says the plane had " a full technical inspection " early this year and was judged to be in a " proper condition " .
Aeroflot conducted its own investigation into the causes of the crash and , without giving details , announced it was stripping Aeroflot Nord of the right to use its name from Monday onwards .
' Completely destroyed '
Contact with the plane was lost at 0521 Perm time on Sunday ( 2321 GMT Saturday ) as the plane was coming in for landing at a height of 1,100 metres , Aeroflot said .
The minister for security in the region said the plane had caught fire in the air at an altitude of 1,000 metres .
It crashed on the outskirts of Perm , just a few hundred metres from residential buildings , but no one was hurt on the ground .
Part of the Trans - Siberian railway was shut down as a result of damage to the main east - west train track and the blaze took two hours to extinguish .
The 21 foreigners killed were listed as nine people from Azerbaijan , five from Ukraine and one person each from France , Switzerland , Latvia , the United States , Germany , Turkey and Italy , Aeroflot said .
Investigators have recovered two black box recorders from the crash site .
There was no immediate suggestion of an attack or sabotage .
Aeroflot 's managing director , Valery Okulov , told reporters in Moscow that his company had already conducted its own , private investigation into the crash and decided to sever ties with Aeroflot Nord .
" We have paid too high a price for lending out our flag , " he added .
Scorched earth Correspondents say the tragedy will be a setback for Russian aviation , which has been trying to shake off a chequered safety record .
A woman in Perm told Vesti-24 TV how she was thrown out of bed by the force of the blast when the plane crashed .
She said : " My daughter ran in from the next room crying : ' What happened ?
Has a war begun or what ? '
" My neighbours , other witnesses , told me that it was burning in the air . "
Sunday 's accident was the deadliest involving a Russian airliner since 170 people died in August 2006 when a Tupolev - 154 bound for St Petersburg crashed in Ukraine .

Lawsuit to Ask That Cheney ’s Papers Be Made Public
By Christopher Lee
Washington Post Staff Writer
Months before the Bush administration ends , historians and open - government advocates are concerned that Vice President Cheney , who has long bristled at requirements to disclose his records , will destroy or withhold key documents that illustrate his role in forming U.S. policy for the past 7 1/2 years .
In a preemptive move , several of them have agreed to join the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in asking a federal judge to declare that Cheney ’s records are covered by the Presidential Records
Act of 1978 and cannot be destroyed , taken or withheld without proper review .
The group expects to file the lawsuit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
It will name Cheney , the executive offices of the president and vice president , and the National Archives and chief archivist Allen Weinstein as defendants .
The goal , proponents say , is to protect a treasure trove of information about national security , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , domestic wiretapping , energy policy , and other major issues that could be hidden from the public if Cheney adheres to his view that he is not part of the executive branch .
Extending the argument , scholars say , Cheney could assert that he is not required to make his papers public after leaving office .
Access to the documents is crucial because he is widely considered to be the most influential vice president in U.S. history , they note .
“ I ’m concerned that they may not be preserved .
Whether they ’ve been zapped already , we do n’t know , ” said Stanley I. Kutler , an emeritus professor and constitutional scholar at the University of Wisconsin Law School .
Former vice president Walter F. Mondale , whose papers are being declassified and shipped to the Minnesota Historical Society , said the fate of Cheney ’s records bears watching .
“ I think you ’d have to be very worried about it , ” said Mondale , who is not a party to the lawsuit .
“ Under Bush and Cheney , they ’ve used every opportunity to assert executive privilege . ”
Cheney has not disclosed his plans for his papers , nor has he argued publicly that any are exempt from the 1978 law .
Congress passed the law after the Watergate scandal to ensure that the country ’s highest elected officials preserve their papers for public review .
“ The Office of the Vice President currently follows the Presidential Records Act and will continue to follow the requirements of the law , which includes turning over vice presidential records to the National Archives at the end of the term , ” Cheney spokesman Jamie Hennigan said in an e-mail .
Kutler and others , including the American Historical Association and the Society of American Archivists , are not reassured .
Their lawsuit contends that President Bush sought to improperly narrow the scope of the records law in a 2001 executive order that declares , in part , that the statute “ applies to the executive records of the Vice President . ”
Scholars say “ executive records ” is a term that is not found in the original act , and that seemingly opens the door to withholding some documents on the grounds that they are “ non-executive ” records — legislative records , for instance .
It raised red flags because Cheney has frequently argued that his office is not part of the executive branch but rather is “ attached ” to the legislative branch by virtue of the vice president ’s role as president of the Senate .
“ I think this has been in the works since then , but nobody really focused on it , ” said Anne Weismann , chief counsel for the ethics group .
The group wants the Archives to abandon its interpretation that legislative records of vice presidents are personal property and not covered by the presidential records law .
Gary M. Stern , general counsel for the Archives , said he has shared the group ’s concerns with the White House .
“ We have no reason to think that anything will happen differently with this vice president than has happened with any other , ” Stern said , “ which is , the records that they create in their White House office and with their White House staff will come to us as vice presidential records under PRA . ”
Former vice president Al Gore ’s papers , for instance , are maintained at an Archives facility in Washington , he said .
Martin J. Sherwin , a history professor at George Mason University and a plaintiff in the case , said it will be impossible to measure Cheney ’s influence without access to the records .
“ It horrifies me as a citizen to think our government can operate in total secrecy during the administration and then , after the administration , remain in secrecy , ” he said .
For years , Cheney has resisted revealing any aspect of the inner workings of his office ; he has shielded information such as the names of industry executives who advised his energy task force , his travel costs and details , and Secret Service logs of visitors to his office and residence .
Since 2003 , his office has refused to comply with an executive order requiring entities in the executive branch to file annual reports on their possession of classified data , at one point blocking an inspection by officials from the Archives .
The Presidential Records Act , inspired by Nixon ’s attempt to withhold from Congress and perhaps destroy some of his records and tapes after Watergate , first applied to the Reagan administration .
For the first time , it provided for the preservation of vice presidential records .
The law established a process for providing public access to presidential and vice presidential records through the Freedom of Information Act , beginning five years after an administration ends .
Presidents and vice presidents can restrict access to certain records , notably those involving national security , for up to 12 years .
Archives officials say they have met with White House staff members to discuss the records transfer .
The agency has leased a 60,000 - square - foot building near Dallas to archive records temporarily until Bush ’s presidential library is completed at Southern Methodist University .
“ There have been no red flags that have gone up for us about records - management procedures and getting ready to turn records over to us , ” said Susan Cooper , an Archives spokeswoman .
Joel K. Goldstein , a constitutional scholar and expert on the vice presidency at the St. Louis University School of Law , said Cheney faces a tough sell if he argues that many of his documents are not “ executive records . ”
“ When a vice president is sitting there in the West Wing and participating at the highest levels in the work of the executive branch , and when the main reason somebody like Vice President Cheney wants to be vice president is to help drive the car , it ’s a little bit anomalous to say you ’re not part of the executive branch , ” said Goldstein , who is not part of the lawsuit .
Staff writer Lyndsey Layton contributed to this report .

Suda51 ( also known as Goichi Suda ) , the man behind such feats of quirky awesomeness as Killer 7 and No More Heroes , has revealed that Grasshopper Manufacture will be re-releasing its first Playstation game on the PS Store in Japan .
The game , The Silver Case , features the type of strange and unsettling story we 've all come to expect from Grasshopper : a series of less - than - pleasant murders are being committed by an assassin who ( it 's believed ) was killed a few years beforehand , and players explore the storyline from two different perspectives .
The game is already being remade for the DS , and there 's a sequel in development , but the only official plans for an English version of the title is in a handheld format .
Players hoping
The Silver Case will be released for the PS Store here in the States are going to have to hold their breath , as nothing official has been announced yet .
Given the cult status of Grasshopper Manufacture 's recent titles , though , it does n't seem too unreasonable to hope for a localized version to hit our PS3s .
The drive was discovered to be missing during an audit An investigation is under way into the disappearance of a computer hard drive which could contain the details of about 100,000 Armed Forces personnel .
The hard drive was being held by EDS , which is the Ministry of Defence 's main IT contractor .
The MoD said it was told the drive was missing on Wednesday following a priority audit carried out by EDS .
It is thought to contain more than 1.5 m pieces of information , including the details of 600,000 potential recruits .
There may also be some personal information including bank and driving licence details , passport numbers , addresses , dates of birth and telephone numbers .
Investigation MoD police are investigating the drive 's whereabouts , but it is not yet known whether or not it was stolen .
For very obvious personal and national security reasons the MoD must ensure that it handles the records of our Armed Forces personnel with the highest care
Liam Fox
Shadow defence secretary A ministry spokesperson described it as a " potential " loss of data .
It is understood the drive was not encrypted .
EDS said in a statement that it was " unable to account for a removable hard drive that was held in a secure location at our facility in Hook " - a reference to the company 's premises near Basingstoke , Hants .
The company added : " There is no evidence that security at the site has been breached . "
Shadow defence secretary Liam
Fox said the latest loss showed the government 's attitude to military personnel data was " reckless " .

" The MoD has a very poor record on keeping sensitive and classified data secure .
This latest scandal is yet another example of poor operational security within the department .
" For very obvious personal and national security reasons the MoD must ensure that it handles the records of our Armed Forces personnel with the highest care .
" Once again , the loss of so much confidential information shows the reckless approach this government takes with our personal information . "
Fraudster alert
The missing drive is the latest information security breach to hit the MoD .
In July officials revealed 658 MoD laptops had been stolen over the past four years and 26 portable memory sticks containing classified information had been either stolen or misplaced since January .
MP Nigel Evans , chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Identity Fraud , said : " This is yet another example of the serious implications the loss of personal data can have for the general public .
" The fact that it has been revealed during National Identity Fraud Prevention Week is ironic .
The loss of such important information including bank details , passport numbers and dates of birth will be music to the ears of fraudsters everywhere .
" It is vital that there is a cultural change across the public sector with all professionals aware of their responsibility to protect and manage personal data . "
Audit tests A spokesman for the MoD said : " On 8 October we were informed by our contractor EDS that they were unable to account for a portable hard drive used in connection with the administration of Armed Forces personnel data .
" This came to light during a priority audit EDS are conducting to comply with the Cabinet Office data handling review .
The MoD Police are investigating with EDS . "
The hard drive was being used as part of a test and was attached to TAFMIS , the Armed Forces training and financial management information system .
The MoD are carrying out further tests to see if it can determine whether any data was transferred onto the missing hard drive .

What are these ?
Materials such as milk , paper , white paint and tissue are opaque because they scatter light , not because they absorb it , but no matter how great the scattering , light was always able to get through the material in question , went the theory .
Researchers Ivo Vellekoop and Allard Mosk of the University of Twente have now shaped the waveform of light and confirmed this with experiments .
By doing so they have found the predicted ‘ open channels ’ in material along which the light is able to move .
In materials that have a disordered structure , incident light is scattered in every direction possible .
In an opaque layer , so much scattering takes place that barely any light comes out ‘ at the back . ’
However , even a material that causes a great deal of light scattering has channels along which light can propagate .
This is only possible if the light meets strict preconditions so that the scattered light waves can reinforce one another on the way to the exit .
Left : the light falls on the opaque paint layer as a plane wave and little is transmitted .
Right : the waveform has been shaped and clear light is transmitted : the open channels have been found .
By manipulating the waveform of light , Vellekoop and Mosk have succeeded in finding these open channels .
They used an opaque layer of the white pigment , zinc oxide , which was in use by painters such as Van Gogh .
Only a small part of the original laser light that falls on the zinc oxide , as a plane wave , is allowed through .
As every painter knows , the thicker the paint coating , the less light it will let through .
By using information about the light transmitted to program the laser , the researchers shaped the waveform to the optimum form to get it to pass through the open channels .
To this end , parts of the incident wave were slowed down to allow the scattered light to interfere in precisely the right manner with other parts of the same wave .
In this way , Vellekoop and Mosk increased the amount of light allowed through by no less than 44 percent .
As theoreticians had predicted , open channels can always be found and transmission through them is , furthermore , independent of the thickness of the material concerned .
The results are remarkable : although the theoretical existence of open channels was acknowledged , so far manipulating the light such that the channels in materials could actually be found has been too complex .
As a result of better light conductivity in opaque materials , it may in the future be easier to look into materials that have so far not divulged their secrets : for example in medical imaging technology .
There is a significant parallel with the conductivity of electrons in extremely thin wires , such as those on semi-conductor chips .
Electrons , which according to quantum mechanics behave as waves , move through these same open channels .
It is also conceivable that this research will yield more information about waveforms other than light , such as radio waves for mobile communication : can the range be improved by adjusting the waveform .
This research was carried out in the Complex Photonic Systems group of the University of Twente ’s MESA +
Institute for Nanotechnology .
It is financed by the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter ( FOM ) and by a Vidi grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research ( NWO ) .
The results will soon be published in Physical Review Letters
Mississippi ’s governor , Haley Barbour , and its secretary of state have come up with a particularly cynical dirty trick for the November election .
Let ’s call it : “ Where ’s the Senate race ? ”
Defying state law , they have decided to hide a hard - fought race for the United States Senate at the bottom of the ballot , where they clearly are hoping some voters will overlook it .
Their proposed design is not only illegal .
It shows a deep contempt for Mississippi ’s voters .
Republicans have long had a lock on the state ’s two Senate seats .
But this year , former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove , a Democrat , has been running close to Senator Roger Wicker , a Republican , in the polls .
Mr. Wicker was appointed to the seat by Governor Barbour in late December after Trent Lott stepped down .
Mississippi election law clearly states that federal elections must go at the top of ballots .
And the secretary of state , Delbert Hosemann , plans to list the state ’s other Senate race  incumbent Thad Cochran is running far ahead of his Democratic challenger , Erik Fleming  where it belongs , right below the presidential contest .
Runners avoided premature death Running on a regular basis can slow the effects of ageing , a study by US researchers shows .
Elderly joggers were half as likely to die prematurely from conditions like cancer than non-runners .
They also enjoyed a healthier life with fewer disabilities , the Stanford University Medical Center team found .
Experts said the findings in Archives of Internal Medicine reinforced the importance that older people exercise regularly .
Survival of the fittest
The work tracked 500 older runners for more than 20 years , comparing them to a similar group of non-runners .
All were in their 50s at the start of the study .
Nineteen years into the study , 34 % of the non-runners had died compared to only 15 % of the runners .
Both groups became more disabled with age , but for the runners the onset of disability started later - an average of 16 years later .
The health gap between the runners and non-runners continued to widen even as the subjects entered their ninth decade of life .
If you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age , it would be aerobic exercise
Lead author Professor James Fries Running not only appeared to slow the rate of heart and artery related deaths , but was also associated with fewer early deaths from cancer , neurological disease , infections and other causes .
And there was no evidence that runners were more likely to suffer osteoarthritis or need total knee replacements than non-runners - something scientists have feared .
At the beginning of the study , the runners ran for about four hours a week on average .
After 21 years , their weekly running time had reduced to around 76 minutes , but they were still seeing health benefits from taking regular exercise .
Lead author Professor James Fries , emeritus professor of medicine at Stanford , said : " The study has a very pro-exercise message .
If you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age , it would be aerobic exercise .
" The health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought . "
Age Concern says many older people do not exercise enough .
Figures show more than 90 % of people in the UK over 75 fail to meet international guidelines of half - an - hour moderate intensity exercise at least five times a week .
Gordon Lishman , director general , said : " This research re-confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people .
" Exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent , ensure a healthy heart , keep weight and stress levels under control , and promote better sleep .
" While younger people are barraged with encouragement to lead healthier lifestyles , the health needs of older people are often overlooked . "

What are these ?
Supplemental table : State job losses by Industry [ PDF ]
The growth of U.S. trade with China since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 has had a devastating effect on U.S. workers and the domestic economy .
Between 2001 and 2007 2.3 million jobs were lost or displaced , including 366,000 in 2007 alone .
New demographic research shows that , even when re-employed in non-traded industries , the 2.3 million workers displaced by the increase in China trade deficits in this period have lost an average $ 8,146 per worker / year .
In 2007 , these losses totalled $ 19.4 billion .
1
The impacts of the China trade deficit are not limited to its direct effects on the jobs and wages of those displaced .
It is also critical to recognize that the indirect impact of trade on other workers is significant as well .
Trade with less - developed countries has reduced the bargaining power of all workers in the U.S. economy who resemble the import - displaced in terms of education , credentials , and skills .
Annual earnings for all workers without a four - year college degree are roughly $ 1,400 lower today because of this competition , and this group constitutes a large majority of the entire U.S. workforce ( roughly 100 million workers or about 70 % of all workers , Bivens ( 2008a ) ) .
China , with nearly 40 % of our non-oil imports from less - developed countries , is a chief contributor to this wage pressure .
In addition to its finding of 2.3 million U.S. jobs lost and workers displaced between 2001 and 2007 , this study finds :
Because U.S. exports to China are much more commodity intensive ( i.e. , comprising products such as grains , steel scrap , and paper scrap ) than Chinese imports ( 99 % of which are manufactured products ) , average wages earned in jobs producing U.S. exports to China paid 4.4 % less than the jobs displaced by imports from China .
More than one - fourth of U.S. exports to China on a value basis were commodities .
The 2.3 million jobs lost / workers displaced nationwide since 2001 are distributed among all 50 states and the District of Columbia , with the biggest losers , in numeric terms : California ( 325,800 jobs lost ) , Texas ( 202,900 ) , New York ( 127,000 ) , Illinois ( 102,800 ) , Ohio ( 102,700 ) , Florida ( 100,900 ) , Pennsylvania ( 85,100 ) , North Carolina ( 79,800 ) , Michigan ( 79,500 ) , and Georgia ( 73,600 ) .
In the past year alone , each of these states has also lost more than 10,000 jobs due to growing China trade deficits , including California ( 55,400 jobs ) , Texas ( 34,100 ) , New York ( 21,300 ) , Illinois ( 17,300 ) , Ohio ( 17,000 ) , Florida ( 17,000 ) , Pennsylvania ( 12,400 ) , North Carolina ( 12,400 ) , Michigan ( 12,300 ) , and Georgia ( 11,500 ) .
Many of these are among the hardest - hit states in the current labor market downturn .
The hardest - hit states , as a share of total state employment , are Idaho ( 14,700 , 2.59 % ) , New Hampshire ( 15,700 , 2.5o % ) , South Carolina ( 42,600 , 2.34 % ) , Oregon ( 36,800 , 2.29 % ) , California ( 325,800 , 2.23 % ) , Minnesota ( 58,700 , 2.18 % ) , Vermont ( 6,500 , 2.15 % ) , Texas ( 202,900 , 2.13 % ) , and Wisconsin ( 59,100 , 2.10 % ) .
Rapidly growing imports of computers and electronic parts accounted for almost half of the $ 178 billion increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2007 .
The $ 68 billion deficit in advanced technology products with China in 2007 was responsible for more than 25 % of the total U.S. - China trade deficit .
The growth of this deficit eliminated 561,000 U.S. jobs in computer and electronic products in this period .
Other hard - hit industrial sectors include apparel and accessories ( 153,000 jobs ) , miscellaneous manufactured goods ( 134,000 ) , and fabricated metal products ( 102,000 ) ; several service sectors were also hard hit by indirect job losses , including administrative support services ( 139,000 ) and professional , scientific , and technical services ( 128,000 ) .
More than two - thirds of the jobs displaced by China trade deficits were in manufacturing , which tends to employ a higher - than - average share of workers with a high school degree or less ( 43.7 % of workers displaced ) and to provide those workers with good wages and benefits .
More than half ( 55.6 % ) of the jobs displaced came from the top half of the U.S. wage distribution , and among this group a disproportionate share came from the top 10th of all U.S. wage earners .
African Americans ( 230,000 jobs lost ) , Hispanics ( 339,000 ) , and other ethnic groups ( 219,000 ) all suffered from the loss of jobs such as these that pay substantially more and offer better benefits than jobs in other industries .
A major cause of the rapidly growing U.S. trade deficit with China is currency manipulation .
China has tightly pegged its currency to the dollar at a rate that encourages a large bilateral surplus with the United States .
Maintaining this peg required the purchase of about $ 460 billion in U.S. treasury bills and other securities in 2007 alone .
2
This intervention makes the yuan artificially cheap and provides an effective subsidy on Chinese exports .
The best estimates place this effective subsidy at roughly 30 % , even after recent appreciation in the yuan ( Cline and Williamson 2008 ) .3
China also engages in extensive suppression of labor rights .
An AFL - CIO study estimated that repression of labor rights by the Chinese government has lowered manufacturing wages by 47 % to 86 % ( AFL - CIO 2006 , 138 ) .
China has also been accused of massive direct subsidization of export production in many key industries ( see , e.g. , Haley 2007 ) .
Finally , it maintains strict , non-tariff barriers to imports .
As a result , China ’s exports to the United States of $ 323 billion in 2007 were more than five times greater than U.S. exports to China , which totaled only $ 61 billion ( Table 1 ) .
China ’s trade surplus was responsible for 52.3 % of the U.S. total non-oil trade deficit in 2007 , making the China trade relationship this country ’s most imbalanced by far .
Unless China raises the real value of the yuan by an additional 30 % and eliminates these other trade distortions , the U.S. trade deficit and job losses will continue to grow rapidly in the future .
While the overall U.S. trade deficit improved significantly in 2007 , largely as a result of the 30 % decline of the dollar against major currencies since 2002 ( including a 44 % fall against the euro ) , the U.S. deficit with China increased $ 26.6 billion , in large part because China allowed the dollar to fall only 12 % against the yuan between 2002 and 2007 .
The annual increase in the U.S. - China trade deficit slowed from $ 31.6 billion in 2006 to $ 26.7 billion in 2007 , reflecting both a decline in U.S. GDP growth ( reducing import demand ) and the initial effects of the stronger yuan .
However , yuan appreciation was largely delayed until late 2007 and 2008 — too little and too late to be of any help in slowing the current U.S. - China trade gap to date .
4
Furthermore , the appreciation of the yuan has had little effect on the prices of U.S. imports from China , which rose only 2.5 % between July 2005 ( when the yuan was first adjusted ) and May 2008 , much less than the 19 % appreciation of the yuan in that period ( Congressional Budget Office 2008 , 2 ) .
C
hina ’s entry into the WTO was supposed to bring it into compliance with an enforceable , rules - based regime which would require that it open its markets to imports from the United States and other nations .
The United States also negotiated a series of special safeguard measures designed to limit the disruptive effects of surging Chinese imports on domestic producers .
However , the core of the agreement failed to include any protections to maintain or improve labor or environmental standards and , prior to 2007 , the administration rejected all requests for special safeguards protection .
As a result , China ’s entry into the WTO has further tilted the international economic playing field against domestic workers and firms and in favor of multinational companies from the United States and other countries as well as state - and privately owned exporters in China .
This shift has increased the global “ race to the bottom ” in wages and environmental quality and closed thousands of U.S. factories , decimating employment in a wide range of communities , states , and entire regions of the United States .
U.S. national interests have suffered while U.S. multinationals have enjoyed record profits on their foreign direct investments ( Scott 2008 ) .
False promises
Proponents of China ’s entry into the WTO frequently claimed that it would create jobs in the United States , increase U.S. exports , and improve the trade deficit with China .
President Clinton claimed that the agreement allowing China into the WTO , which was negotiated during his administration , “ creates a win - win result for both countries ” ( Clinton 2000 , 9 ) .
He argued that exports to China “ now support hundreds of thousands of American jobs ” and that “ these figures can grow substantially with the new access to the Chinese market the WTO agreement creates ” ( Clinton 2000 , 10 ) .
Others in the White House , such as Kenneth Liberthal , the special advisor to the president and senior director for Asia affairs at the National Security Council , echoed Clinton ’s assessment :
Let ’s be clear as to why a trade deficit might decrease in the short term .
China exports far more to the U.S. than it imports [ from ] the U.S… .
It will not grow as much as it would have grown without this agreement and over time clearly it will shrink with this agreement .
5
Promises about jobs and exports misrepresented the real effects of trade on the U.S. economy : trade both creates and destroys jobs .
Increases in U.S. exports tend to create jobs in the United States , but increases in imports will lead to job loss — by destroying existing jobs and preventing new job creation — as imports displace goods that otherwise would have been made in the United States by domestic workers .
The impact of changes in trade on employment is estimated here by calculating the labor content of changes in the trade balance — the difference between exports and imports .
Each $ 1 billion in computer exports to China from the United States supports American jobs .
However , each $ 1 billion in computer imports from China displaces the American workers who would have been employed making them in the United States .
On balance , the net employment effect of trade flows depends on the growth in the trade deficit , not just exports .
Another critically important promise made by the promoters of liberalized U.S. - China trade was that the United States would benefit because of increased exports to a large and growing consumer market in China .
However , despite widespread reports of the rapid growth of the Chinese middle class , this growth has not resulted in a significant increase in U.S. consumer exports to China .
The most rapidly growing exports to China are bulk commodities such as grains , scrap , and chemicals ; intermediate products such as semiconductors ; and producer durables such as aircraft ( see Table 3 below ) .
Furthermore , the increase in U.S. exports to China since 2001 has been overwhelmed by the growth of U.S. imports , as shown below .
Growing trade deficits and job losses
The U.S. trade deficit with China has risen from $ 84 billion in 2001 to $ 262 billion in 2007 , an increase of $ 178 billion , as shown in Table 1 .
Since China entered the WTO in 2001 , this deficit has increased by $ 30 billion per year on average , or 21 % per year .
While it is true that exports support jobs in the United States , it is equally true that imports displace them .
The net effect of trade flows on employment is determined by changes in the trade balance .
6
The employment impacts of growing trade deficits are estimated in this paper using an input - output model that estimates the direct and indirect labor requirements of producing output in a given domestic industry .
The model includes 201 U.S. industries , 84 of which are in the manufacturing sector .
7
The model estimates the amount of labor ( number of jobs ) required to produce a given volume of exports and the labor displaced when a given volume of imports is substituted for domestic output .
8
The net of these two numbers is essentially the jobs lost due to growing trade deficits , holding all else equal .
Jobs displaced by the growing China trade deficit are a net drain on employment in trade - related industries , especially those in the manufacturing sector .
Even if increases in demand in other sectors absorb all the workers displaced by trade ( an unlikely event ) , it is likely that job - quality will suffer , as many non-traded industries such as retail trade and home health care pay lower wages and have less comprehensive benefits than traded goods industries .
U.S. exports to China in 2001 supported 166,700 jobs , but U.S. imports displaced production that would have supported 1,188,200 jobs , as shown in the bottom half of Table 1 .
Therefore , the $ 84 billion trade deficit in 2001 displaced 1,021,500 jobs in that year .
Job displacement rose to 2,951,100 jobs in 2006 and 3,316,800 in 2007 .
Since China ’s entry into the WTO in 2001 through 2007 , the increase in U.S. - China trade deficits eliminated or displaced 2,295,300 U.S. jobs , as shown in the bottom half of Table 1 .
In the past year alone 365,700 jobs were lost , either through the destruction of existing jobs or by the prevention of new job creation .
On average , 382,500 jobs per year have been lost / displaced since China ’s entry into the WTO .
Growth in trade deficits with China has reduced demand for goods produced in every region of the United States and has led to job displacement in all 50 states and the District of Columbia , as shown in Table 2A .
More than 200,000 jobs were lost in each of California and Texas and more than 100,000 each in New York , Illinois , Ohio , and Florida .
Jobs displaced due to growing deficits with China exceeded 2.0 % of total employment in 12 states including Idaho , New Hampshire , South Carolina , Oregon , California , Minnesota , Vermont , Texas , and Wisconsin , as shown in Table 2B and Figure A . An alphabetical list of job losses by state is shown in Table 2C .
The state job loss map shows that the effects of growing trade deficits with China have been felt widely across the United States and that no area has been exempt from impact .
While traditional manufacturing states such as Wisconsin , Tennessee , and the Carolinas were certainly hard hit , so too were states in the tech sector such California , Texas , Oregon , and Minnesota .
Idaho , which lost an estimated 9,000 jobs in computer and electronic products alone , was the hardest - hit s
tate in the country in terms of share of total state employment , as shown in Table 2B .
Growing trade deficits with China have clearly reduced domestic employment in traded goods industries , especially in the manufacturing sector , which has been hard hit by plant closings and job losses .
Workers displaced by trade from the manufacturing sector have had particular difficulty in securing comparable employment elsewhere in the economy .
More than one - third of workers displaced from manufacturing dropped out of the labor force ( Kletzer 2001 , 101 , Table D2 ) , and average wages of those who secured re-employment fell 11 % to 13 % .
Some economists have argued that job loss numbers extrapolated from trade flows are uninformative because aggregate employment levels in the United States are set by a broad range of macroeconomic influences , not just by trade flows .
However , while the trade balance is but one of many variables affecting aggregate job creation , the employment impacts of trade identified in this paper can be interpreted as the “ all else equal ” effect of trade on domestic employment .
The Federal Reserve , for example , may decide to cut interest rates to make up for job loss stemming from deteriorating trade balances ( or any other economic influence ) , leaving net employment unchanged .
This , however , does not change the fact that trade deficits by themselves are a net drain on employment .
Further , even in the best - case scenario in which other jobs rise up one - for - one to replace those displaced by trade flows , the job numbers in this paper are a ( conservative ) measure of the involuntary job displacement caused by growing trade deficits and a potent indicator of imbalance in the U.S. labor market and wider economy .
Economists may label it a wash when the loss of a hundred manufacturing jobs in Ohio or Pennsylvania is offset by the hiring of a hundred construction workers in Phoenix , but in the real world these displacements often result in large income losses and even permanent damage to workers ’ earning power ( Bivens 2008 b ) .
Trade and jobs , industry details
The composition of imports from China is changing in fundamental ways , with serious implications for certain kinds of high - skill , high - wage jobs once thought to be the hallmark of the U.S. economy .
China is moving rapidly “ upscale , ” from low - tech , low - skilled labor - intensive industries such as apparel , footwear , and basic electronics to more capital - and skills - intensive sectors such as computers , electrical machinery , and motor vehicles ; it has also developed a rapidly growing trade surplus in high technology products .
U.S. trade with China in 2001 and 2007 is summarized in Table 3 .
Trade flows increased dramatically in this period , especially imports , which rose from $ 102 billion in 2001 to $ 323 billion in 2007.9 Manufactured goods were 99 % of total imports and included a wide array of commodities .
Computer and electronic products were responsible for more than one - third of total imports in 2007 , including computer equipment ( $ 45 billion , or 13.8 % ) , communications equipment ( $ 25 billion , 7.9 % ) and audio - video gear ( $ 19 billion , 5.9 % ) .
Other major importing sectors included apparel ( $ 26 billion , 8.2 % ) , and miscellaneous manufactured products ( $ 42 billion , 13.0 % ) .
U.S. exports rose rapidly in this period , but from a much smaller base , from $ 18 billion in 2001 to $ 61 billion in 2007 .
Manufacturing was the top industry exporting to China — 76 % of exports to China in 2007 were manufactured goods .
Scrap and second - hand goods industries ( that support no jobs in the BLS models ) made up 11.9 % of the total .
Within manufacturing , key export sectors included chemicals ( $ 7.8 billion , or 12.8 % of total exports ) , aerospace products and parts ( $ 7.4 billion , 12.1 % ) , machinery ( $ 6.7 billion , 11.0 % ) , and semiconductors and components ( $ 5.7 billion , 9.3 % ) .
However , the scale of U.S. exports is dwarfed by imports , which exceeded the value of exports by more than 5 - to - 1 .
The data in Table 3 show that China is rapidly diversifying its export base and expanding into higher value - added commodities such as computer and electronic products , aircraft , and auto parts and machinery .
This point is highlighted in Table 4 , which reports U.S. trade in advanced technology products ( ATP ) in 2002 ( the earliest date for which country - by - ATP data are available ) and 2007 .
The United S has had a trade deficit with China in ATP products throughout this period , but it increased nearly six - fold , from $ 11.8 billion to $ 67.7 billion , by 2007 .
The United States had a deficit in its ATP trade with the rest of the world in 2002 .
However , rapid growth of U.S. ATP exports to the rest of the world , which increased 8.3 % per year over the past five years , generated a $ 15 billion surplus in 2007 .
This sector is enjoying some trade success at the moment .
However , this small surplus was completely overwhelmed by the U.S. ATP deficit with China in 2007 .
As a result , the United States ran an overall deficit in ATP products in 2007 , as is has in every year since 2002 .
Trade deficits are highly correlated with job losses by industry , as shown in Table 5 .
Growing trade deficits with China eliminated 1,550,000 manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2007 , more than two - thirds ( 67.5 % ) of the total .
By far the largest job losses occurred in the computer and electronic products sectors , which lost more than 560,000 jobs ( 24.4 % of the 2.3 million jobs lost overall ) .
This sector included computer and peripheral equipment ( 274,800 jobs , 12.0 % ) and semiconductors and components ( 130,900 jobs , 5.7 % ) .
Other hard - hit sectors included apparel and accessories ( 153,000 jobs , 6.7 % ) , fabricated metal products ( 102,400 jobs , 4.5 % ) and miscellaneous manufacturing ( 133,600 jobs , 5.8 % ) .
Several service industries , which provide key inputs to traded goods production , experienced large job losses , including administrative and support services ( 138,700 jobs , 6.0 % ) and professional , scientific , and technical services ( 127,700 jobs , 5.6 % ) .
( Additional detail on trade - related displacement by state and major industry is available online at www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp219supp.)
California lost 135,929 jobs in computer and electronic parts alone due to growing trade deficits with China between 2001 and 2007 .
Other examples of large impacts include apparel in California ( 44,072 jobs ) , New York ( 22,785 ) , and North Carolina ( 11,372 ) ; textiles and textile mill products in Georgia ( 19,671 ) and South Carolina ( 10,055 ) ; and computer and electronic products in Idaho ( 8,969 ) , Minnesota ( 22,882 ) , New Jersey ( 15,034 ) , New York ( 23,018 ) , Ohio ( 13,988 ) , Oregon ( 15,427 ) , and Texas ( 90,414 ) .
Trade , wages , and labor force demographics
The growth of trade deficits with China shifts jobs from better - paid traded goods industries into jobs in non-traded sectors where wages are significantly lower on average .
Moreover , average wages in import - competing industries were higher than those in export industries .
Thus , the growth in the overall volume of trade ( imports plus exports ) with China substituted lower - paying export jobs for higher - paying jobs in import - competing industries .
This somewhat surprising finding stands economic logic on its head .
Economic theory would suggest that the United States should specialize in producing goods that intensively use high - skilled , highly educated ( and highly paid ) workers and import labor - intensive goods that use more low - skilled labor .
In fact , low - wage commodity sectors were some of the largest exporters of goods fr
om the United States to China .
This section analyzes the effects of changing trade flows with China on wages and the worker characteristics of those affected by growing trade deficits .
This analysis is based on a pooled sample of data from the BLS Current Population Statistics Outgoing Rotation Group ( CPS ORG ) , a subset of the March CPS monthly survey ( U.S. Census Bureau 2008 ) .
The data were pooled for the three - year 2005 - 07 period to achieve adequate sample size for this analysis .
The data covered approximately 126 million full - time , public and private sector workers age 16 and above in a set of CPS industries that were matched to the BLS industries used in the trade and job displacement analysis described above .
10 Average wages by sector were used to estimate average import and export wages , and trade - related jobs lost by industry were used as weights .
The results of the wage analysis are summarized in Table 6A .
The first column shows average wages for import and export industries in 2007,11 and the second column compares the percent difference between import and export wages for U.S. trade with China .
One of the most important findings in this study is that , for trade with China , average wages in exporting industries , at $ 839.32 per week , were lower than in import - competing industries , where they were $ 877.76 per week — a 4.4 % premium .12
Wages in industries producing goods traded with China are also significantly higher than those in the rest of the economy .
Wages in export and import - competing industries were 16.4 % to 21.7 % higher than average wages in other non-traded industries , as shown in the last 2 rows of Table 6A .
Average wages in all non-traded goods industries were $ 721.11 in the pooled 2005 - 07 period .
The growth of trade deficits with China implies that , even with near - full employment in 2007 , more workers were employed in other , non-traded sectors of the economy than would have been if U.S. trade with China were balanced , and that total payments to affected workers were lower than they would otherwise have been for two reasons .
First , as trade expanded , jobs displaced by imports paid more than export jobs paid , so U.S. workers lost wages on every job gained through increased exports .
Second , the growth in the trade deficit reduced the demand for labor in trade - goods industries , and , at full employment , those workers were employed in other sectors where , on average , they earned much lower wages .
Total wage gains and losses for all trade - affected jobs are estimated in Table 6B .
The jobs gained due to growing exports , jobs lost due to growing imports , and net job loss between 2001 and 2007 are shown in the top section of the table .
The growth of exports to China generated total wage premiums of $ 1.9 billion in this period ( i.e. , $ 118.21 per job per week times 315,600 export jobs gained times 52 weeks ) , while the growth of imports eliminated wage premiums of $ 21.3 billion in this period .
Thus , there was a nationwide loss of $ 19.4 billion in wage premiums that would have been earned had trade been balanced .
Each full - time worker of the 2.3 million displaced by the increase in “ net ” imports from China , even when re-employed in non-traded industries , lost an average $ 8,146 per worker / year ( $ 156.65 per week times 52 weeks ) .
Net losses associated with the pure substitution of export jobs for import job opportunities for trade with China equaled $ 0.6 billion , as shown in the last line of Table 6B .
These losses offset some of the gains from trade with China ( from specialization in products for which the United States has a comparative advantage ) that are found in most economic models of the benefits of trade .
But lost jobs and lower wages for displaced workers are just the tip of the iceberg .
Competition with low - wage workers from less - developed countries has also driven down wages for workers in manufacturing and reduced the wages and bargaining power of similar workers throughout the economy — essentially all production workers with less than a four - year college degree , or 70 % of the private sector workforce ( roughly 100 million workers ) .
For a typical full - time median - wage earner in 2006 these indirect losses totaled approximately $ 1,400 ( Bivens 2008a ) .
China is the most important source of downward pressure from trade with less - developed countries , because its workers receive very low wages , and because it was responsible for nearly 40 % of U.S. non-oil imports from less - developed countries in 2007 .
Demographic impact of growing trade deficits
The models used in this study also allow an examination of the effects of growing China trade deficits on different demographic groups in terms of education , wage distribution , and race .
13
Education
Workers with a high school degree or less have been particularly hard hit by rising China trade deficits .
The manufacturing sector , which produces most traded goods , employs a much higher - than - average share of such workers , as shown in Table 7 , which details educational status and wage levels for all industries ( i.e. , all 125 million workers in the sample ) , manufacturing , and computers / electronic equipment .
Workers with a high school degree or less made up 41.1 % of the population overall , but they made up 50.8 % of the manufacturing labor force .
Manufacturing and trade - related jobs also pay well .
Table 7 breaks down wages into five broad categories : the first group represents roughly the bottom two deciles ( 20 % ) of the labor force , and the second includes the next three deciles ( totaling about 30 % ) .
The next three groups represent the top half of all jobs , or the best - paying jobs in the U.S. labor market , including the 50 - 75th percentile ( $ 12.00 to $ 17.80 ) , the 75 - 90th ( $ 17.81 to $ 30.84 per hour ) and the top decile , where wages exceed $ 30.84 per hour .
Note that substantially more than half of the jobs in manufacturing ( 56.2 % ) were in this top half of the wage distribution , and the manufacturing share in each of the top three categories exceeded the national average .
Thus , manufacturing provided more good jobs for more workers with a high school degree or less than did the other sectors of the economy as a whole .
The computer and electronics sectors stand out for other reasons , and we return to these below .
The number and shares of workers at different levels of education who were displaced by growing trade deficits with China between 2001 and 2007 are shown in columns 2 and 3 of Table 8 ; column 4 compares these shares to the breakdown of the labor force overall ( column 1 ) .
For example , growing trade deficits displaced 1.3 % more workers with less than a high school degree and 1.3 % more workers with a high school degree ( but no more ) compared with their share of the labor force .
Workers with some college or more took a proportionately smaller hit , as those workers tend to be less intensively employed in traded goods than employed in the rest of the economy .
Workers with a college degree were also hard hit : they absorbed 31.0 % of the jobs lost due to growing trade deficits with China while making up only 29.8 % of the labor force .
This result may seem surprising at first glance , since college - educated workers make up a much smaller share of the labor force in manufacturing ( 23.4 % ) than in the economy as a whole ( 29.8 % ) , as shown in Table 7 .
However , the numbers in Table 8 also reflect the extremely uneven patterns of trade and job displacement by industry , discussed above .
The computer and electronic products sector lost 561,000 jobs , 24.4 % of all jobs displaced due to growing trade deficits ( Table 5 ) , and this high - tech
sector employs a much larger share ( 49.0 % ) of college graduates than does manufacturing ( 23.4 % ) or the economy as a whole ( 29.8 % ) , as shown in Table 7 .
As a result , this sector has many more workers in the top wage half ( 73.5 % ) and top wage decile ( 28.4 % ) compared to the economy overall .
It is important to note that the results in Table 8 are purely the result of between - industry shifts in trade - related employment .
Trade is also changing the composition of employment within industries .
Though such within - industry shifts cannot be assessed in this report , they may mitigate some of the job losses among highly educated workers in computer and electronic products that are implied in these estimates .
Bivens ( 2008a ) presents evidence and analysis and reviews literature showing that trade has increased the demand for college - educated labor within certain industries .
This analysis suggests that trade within sectors such as computer and electronic products likely involves substantial “ vertical specialization ” in production , with labor - intensive activities such as computer assembly being shifted abroad while more skill and capital - intensive activities such as semiconductor design and production of advanced integrated circuits are taking place in the United States .
Such within - industry shifts can increase the demand for college - educated labor at home , relative to demand for workers with less education .
Workers who perform labor - intensive activities in industries like computer equipment used to benefit from their association with a high - wage industry .
While non-college - educated workers in labor - intensive industries like apparel were heavily exposed to foreign competition , non-college workers in computer assembly held on for a while and were sheltered from the most intense forms of international competition .
Now that globalization has allowed for vertical integration and slicing up even intra-firm value chains , this benefit no longer holds , and the non-college part of the value chain in every industry has been sent abroad ( including China ) .
This has given the global economy ( and China ) a much longer lever with which to impact the U.S. labor market .
( If China ’s influence had , say , been capped by the share of apparel expenditures in the U.S. economy , it would have had a much smaller impact on U.S. jobs and wages . )
Data on occupational employment trends shed further light on within- and between - industry employment shifts .
For U.S. manufacturing as a whole , total employment of scientists and engineers ( S&E ) fell sharply between 2001 and 2007 , though not quite as fast as total manufacturing employment .
Total S&E employment in manufacturing fell from 1.9 million to 1.7 million workers in this period , a decline of 10.7 %.14 Employment of all manufacturing workers fell from 17.3 to 15.0 million workers , a decline of 13.2 % .
Thus , the S&E employment share within manufacturing rose from 10.9 % to 11.2 % .
These data suggest that rapidly growing trade deficits with China and other countries caused a fall in demand for S&E workers that overwhelmed any gains from within - industry shifts or gains from vertical specialization .
15
However , the fact that workers with less education suffered greater employment losses means that growing trade deficits did put relatively greater downward pressure on their wages .
The education results in Table 8 are markedly different from those for trade with Mexico and Canada after NAFTA took effect .
Scott ( 2006 , Table 1 - 5 , 16 ) performed a similar demographic analysis of the effects of NAFTA trade between 1993 and 2004 .
Workers with a high school degree were especially hard hit by growing trade deficits after NAFTA , and this grouped absorbed 51.5 % of job losses while making up only 42.9 % of the labor force .
Workers with a college degree absorbed only 22.0 % of the job losses due to growing NAFTA deficits , 5.5 % less than their share in the total labor force .
16 Thus , China trade displaced significantly more workers with a college degree than NAFTA trade .
This is particularly remarkable since more than half of NAFTA trade was with Canada , which has an advanced industrial economy ( Scott 2006 , Table 1 - 1a , 5 ) .
Overall , wages in traded - goods industries were significantly higher than in non-traded industries , as shown in Table 6A .
Workers with a high school degree and below are particularly hard hit by growing trade deficits with China , because larger - than - average shares of these workers are pushed out of high - wage jobs in traded - goods industries .
Within manufacturing in particular , 50.8 % of workers have a high school degree or less , while such workers made up only 41.1 % of the labor force as a whole ( Table 7 ) .
Hence , the manufacturing sector employs about a quarter more of these workers than other sectors of the economy .
As noted above , more than two - thirds of the jobs displaced by growing trade deficits with China were in manufacturing , which is one of the best sources of good jobs with good benefits for workers with a high school degree or less .
Wages
Table 8 compares the impact of China trade by wage category in the same way as it did for education level , that is , by contrasting the share of displaced jobs at each wage level to share of all workers earning this particular wage .
Growing China trade deficits displaced fewer jobs on a proportional basis in the two lowest - paying wage groups ( those earning $ 11.99 per hour or less ) and more jobs at higher wage levels .
The largest losses , on a proportional basis , were absorbed by workers in the top wage group , who earned more than $ 30.84 per hour ; their share of net job displacement was 14.9 % , 5.0 percentage points more than their share of the labor force ( 9.9 % ) .
These results re-enforce the findings in Table 6 , which showed that jobs displaced by growing trade deficits pay more than other jobs .
Manufacturing has higher productivity than other sectors of the economy ( U.S. Department of Labor 2008 ) and higher unionization rates ( U.S. Department of Labor 2006 b ) , allowing workers to earn a higher share of the higher marginal product of their labor in this sector .
More than two - thirds of the jobs displaced by China - trade were in manufacturing ( Table 5 , above ) , many of them high - wage , unionized jobs that are in increasingly scarce supply .
Many of those workers were displaced into lower - paying jobs outside of manufacturing .
One reason that productivity growth is so high in manufacturing is that it is a relatively large employer of scientists and engineers .
Even though fewer college graduates are employed in manufacturing overall , it employs a much higher share of scientists and engineers than other sectors .
In 2007 , 1.7 million scientists and engineers were employed in manufacturing , or 11.2 % of total manufacturing employment .
17
This share is one - and - a- quarter times the 5.0 % share of such workers in non-manufacturing industries .
It is likely that many of these workers are employed in computer and electronic products , and that many more science and engineering jobs would be created if U.S. trade with China in these products were more balanced .
Race
The share of black workers displaced by China trade ( 10.0 % , Table 8 , column 3 ) was slightly less than their average share in the labor force ( 11.2 % ) , and for Hispanic workers the share was only slightly more .
At first glance , then , the racial impact may appear relatively benign , but this observation changes when one compares it to the lesser displacement among ( non-Hispanic ) whites .
Moreover , the real losses for black workers and Hispanics can be assessed only through an examination of the absolute number of jobs lost and a closer look at what they mean for these workers .
Growing trade deficits displaced 230,065 black workers and 339,342 Hispanics .
These jobs are even more important to African Americans and Hispanics than to other workers , for reasons illustrated in Table 9 , which reports additional population statistics on education and wages by race for all workers .
These data reflect the fai
lure of the U.S. educational system to serve black and Hispanic minorities .
Among black workers , 46.0 % have a high school degree or less , 10 percentage points or 27.5 % more than for white workers .
For Hispanics , the situation is even worse , 65 % having no more than a high school education , 29 percentage points or nearly double the rate of white workers .
The consequences of discrimination and lack of educational attainment for workers ’ wages are illustrated in the bottom half of Table 9 .
Only 38.1 % of black workers earn wages in the top 50 % , as compared to 54.8 % of white workers , and only 31.7 % of Hispanics are in the top half of wage earners .
The contrast is even starker in the top decile .
Only 4.8 % of all blacks earned more than $ 30.84 per hour in 2005 - 07 , and only 3.9 % of Hispanics .
However , 11.5 % of white workers were in this top - decile group , shares 140 % larger than blacks and 192 % larger than Hispanics .
The full implications of job losses for blacks and Hispanics can only be appreciated by comparing Tables 7 and 9 .
Table 7 showed that manufacturing ( which absorbed more than two - thirds of job losses caused by growing trade deficits with China ) provided nearly 25 % more jobs for high - school - educated workers than did other sectors of the economy , and 13 % more of those jobs were in the top half of the wage distribution .
Thus , the manufacturing sector provides some of the best jobs available for black and Hispanic workers , who suffer from much lower levels of education and have much lower wages than white workers .
Growing China trade deficits are a special tragedy for these workers , who lost more than half a million trade - related jobs between 2001 and 2007 alone .
What is not well understood is that even a job lost in apparel production can be a huge loss for a minority or immigrant worker .
Such jobs are more likely to be unionized and to have benefits than alternative jobs outside of manufacturing .
A job paying $ 9 or $ 10 per hour with benefits , and providing industrial experience , can be a lifeline and provide a ladder out of poverty for such workers .
When this worker loses his or her job and the alternative is a near - minimum wage , non-union job , an important pathway out of poverty is washed away .
18
The “ other ” workers shown in Tables 8 and 9 are largely Asians .
They outperformed all other groups of workers in terms of education and wages , as shown in Table 9 .
However , they also lost a relatively large number of jobs ( 219,235 or 9.6 % of all jobs lost ) , a share 53 % greater than their share in the total labor force .
These findings likely reflect the confluence of two factors : the very high share of Asian and other minorities with more than a college degree ( 42.1 % of “ other ” workers , much higher than any other demographic group , as shown in Table 9 ) and the very large number of jobs lost in the high - tech computer and electronic products sector .
Asian Americans and other minorities have been especially hard hit by growing China trade deficits .
Conclusion
The growing U.S. trade deficit with China has displaced huge numbers of jobs in the United States and has been a prime contributor to the crisis in manufacturing employment over the past six years .
Moreover , the United States is piling up foreign debt , losing export capacity , and facing a more fragile macroeconomic environment .
Is America ’s loss China ’s gain ?
The answer is most certainly no .
China has become dependent on the U.S. consumer market for employment generation , has suppressed the purchasing power of its own middle class with a weak currency , and , most importantly , has held hundreds of billions of hard currency reserves in low - yielding , risky assets instead of investing them in public goods that could benefit Chinese households .
Its vast purchases of foreign exchange reserves have stimulated the overheating of its domestic economy , and inflation in China has accelerated rapidly in the past year .
Its repression of labor rights has suppressed wages , thereby artificially subsidizing exports .
The U.S - China trade relationship needs a fundamental change .
Addressing the exchange rate policies and labor standards issues in the Chinese economy are important first steps .

1 . The $ 19.4 billion includes losses experienced by workers displaced by growing imports and net losses experienced by the movement of jobs from import - competing sectors to industries producing exports to China ( see Table 6B ) .
2 . These purchases financed more than one - half of the U.S. $ 731 billion current account deficit ( the broadest measure of all U.S. trade and income flows ) in 2007 .
But for these purchases , the reduced demand would have put significant downward pressure on the U.S. dollar .
A substantial depreciation in the dollar would begin to improve the U.S. trade deficit within a few years .
3 . The official name of the Chinese currency is the renminbi ( RMB ) .
The RMB is convertible for current account transactions but not for capital account flows .
“ Unlike the United States and many other countries , China uses a different word — yuan — for the unit in which product prices , exchange rates , and other such values are denominated from the word used for its currency ” ( Congressional Budget Office 2008 , note 3 ) .
Hereinafter the word yuan will be used when referring to the Chinese exchange rate .
4 . The trade balance usually responds to a fall in the dollar with a substantial lag of at least one to two years , due to “ J - curve ” effects .
The major initial impact of a depreciation is usually to raise the price and total value of imports , and hence the trade deficit .
In the medium - and long - term , the trade flows usually respond to the increase in the relative competitiveness of domestic products as the rate of growth of imports slows or imports decrease , and the rate of growth of exports accelerates , ultimately leading to an improvement in the trade balance for large currency adjustments .
Most of the dollar adjustment against major currencies occurred between February 2002 and December 2004 .
For example , the dollar fell 36.4 % against the euro in this period , and then fell only 4.0 % between December 2004 and December 2007 .

6. Output ( gross domestic product or GDP ) is the sum of consumption , investment , government spending , and the trade balance .
The trade balance is the sum of exports less imports .
A declining trade balance lowers GDP .
The growth of the U.S. trade deficit with China has therefore reduced U.S. GDP and the demand for labor .
Holding all other sources of demand constant , growing trade deficits therefore reduce the demand for labor in the U.S .
7. See Scott ( 2006 ) for further details on the model and Ratner ( 2006 ) for a technical presentation and details on data sources used .
This model has been completely updated for this study using new employment requirements tables for 2001 and related economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( 2008 ) .
Trade data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau was downloaded from the U.S. International Trade Commission ( 2008 ) .
8 . For the purposes of this report it is necessary to distinguish between exports produced domestically and re-exports — which are goods produced in other countries , imported into the United States , and then re-exported to other countries , in this case to China .
Since re-exports are not produced domestically , their production does not support domestic employment and they are excluded from the model used here .
See Table 1 for information about the levels of U.S. re-exports to China in this period .
9 . Table 3 reports U.S. imports for consumption and domestic exports to China .
These flows were chosen to emphasize goods produced and consumed in the United States .
News reports from the Census Bureau and Commerce Department usually emphasize general imports and total exports .
Total exports as reported by the Census Bureau include re-exports , i.e. , goods produced in other countries and shipped through the United States .
For 2007 , the Census Bureau reported general imports from China of $ 321.4 billion , total exports of $ 65.2 billion , and a trade balance of - $ 256.2 billion .
10 . Further details on the matching system used are available on request .
Identical matches were not available for some BLS industries , in part because the CPS survey aggregates a number of closely related four - digit NAICS sectors that are included separately in the BLS model .
For example , motor vehicle assembly ( NAICS 3361 and BLS sector 88 ) , motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing ( NAICS 3362 and BLS 89 ) , and motor vehicle parts ( NAICS 3363 and BLS 90 ) were all combined in the CPS survey .
These pooled demographic data were used to approximate demographic characteristics for each of these NAICS / BLS industries .
11 . Estimates reflect weighting by the total number of jobs displaced in each sector .
12 . Note that for manufacturing only , average export wages marginally exceed import wages .
The overall result is largely a consequence of the very low level of average wages in the agricultural sector and the large share of agricultural products in U.S. exports to China .
13 .
The demographic data used for this analysis are derived from the CPS ORG files ( U.S. Census Bureau 2008 ) and are a sample representing 126 million full - time workers age 16 and above .
The demographic characteristics of this group are shown in Tables 7 and 9 .
Total U.S. employment includes workers such as those under age 16 and the self - employed .
Total U.S. employment in 2006 was 148.8 million .
The demographic characteristics in the CPS ORG data do not accurately reflect the demographic characteristics of this larger group .
Thus , for example , applying the education shares for each of the 201 industries in the model used here to total BLS employment for each of the 201 industries in the model yields smaller college - educated shares and larger shares for groups with less education than those shown for the total population in Table 7 ( column 1 ) .
Reconciliation of these conflicting datasets is an important topic for future research .
14 . The source for these data is the CPS ORG ( U.S. Census Bureau 2008 ) .
Sample includes all computer and mathematical , architecture and engineering , and life , physical , and social science occupations ( occupational classifications 15 , 17 and 21 ) .
15 . The overall U.S. goods trade deficit increased from $ 429.5 billion in 2001 to $ 819.4 billion in 2007 ( U.S. International Trade Commission 2008 ) .
16 . The NAFTA study was based on demographic data for the year 2000 .
Table 8 in this paper is based on data for workers in a pooled sample for 2005 - 07 , and that group includes a slightly higher overall share of college - educated workers ( 29.8 % vs. 27.5 % in the NAFTA study ) .
17 .
These totals include all employees in computer and mathematical ; architecture and engineering ; and life , physical , and social science occupations .
18 . Workers in nondurable manufacturing industries were more than twice as likely as workers in retail trade to be represented by a union in 2004 ( 13.2 % vs. 6.1 % ) .
Only 1.6 % of workers in food services and drinking places were represented by unions ( U.S. Department of Labor 2006 , Table 3 ) .
Just like the children in Lake Wobegon , all of us are " above average " drivers .
I 'm reading the book Traffic : Why We Drive the Way We Do by Tom Vanderbilt .
Vanderbilt quotes former New York City traffic commissioner Henry Barnes , who says , " As times goes on the technical problems become more automatic , while the people problems become more surrealistic . " discusses the " surrealistic " people issues of driving -- the psychology and sociology of traffic .
Chapter 2 discusses the " Lake Wobegon effect " -- that we all think we 're better than the idiot drivers around us .
Vanderbilt talks with Rusty Weiss of DriveCam in San Diego .
To improve safety for commercial fleet vehicles , DriveCam installs video cameras that record the 10 seconds before and after an " event " -- a collision , sudden braking , hard steering and so forth .
They capture the 99 % of near hits that all of us take for granted and forget about in our daily driving , and use that video to coach drivers how they can drive more safely .
Research shows that driving with the DriveCam improve safety dramatically , even with teen drivers .
They also capture some dramatic crash footage , like this one of a cab driver who falls asleep at the wheel and ends up with his head in a rear window .
Higher quality and more videos are available at the DriveCam website .
The middle video on this page shows a tow truck driver falling asleep at the wheel and driving several hundred feet in a bike lane before he 's jolted awake when he hits the curb .
The scary thing is that he 's unaware of what happened even after the curb hit -- without the video , there 's no way for him to learn how to improve his driving .
If a cyclist was rear - ended at that point , no doubt the driver would have claimed he was correctly in his lane and the cyclist , naturally , must have veered in front of him because he 's a good driver with a good driving record .
If you 're involved in any kind of transportation or cycling advisory committee , Irecommend the book Traffic :

( CNN ) --
A new study that surveyed racial attitudes suggests that racial prejudices could tip the balance in the upcoming presidential election .
A poll finds a small percentage of voters said they may turn away from Sen. Barack Obama because of his race .
If there were no racial prejudice among voters , Sen. Barack Obama would receive about 6 percentage points more support , according to an AP - Yahoo News poll , designed in partnership with Stanford University .
The results suggest that 40 percent of white Americans hold at least a partly negative view toward blacks , including more than a third of white Democrats and independents .
A small percentage of voters -- 2.5 percent of those surveyed -- said they may turn away from Obama because of his race .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey also indicates that race could play a big role in November .
Asked if race would be a factor in their vote , 37 percent of respondents said yes .
But of that group , many are Republicans who are not likely to vote for any Democrat , and some are Democrats who may vote for Obama because of his race .
Of the 8 percent of Democrats who told CNN they plan to vote for Obama 's GOP rival , Sen. John McCain , half said race was a factor .
The survey , conducted August 29 - 31 , questioned 1,031 people and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
Experts point out that it's hard to quantify racial prejudice because many people who hold prejudices are not going to admit to it .
Watch how race could affect the election »
" The hardest thing in the world for pollsters to poll for , with the exception of sexual behavior , is racial attitudes and how it affects behavior , " said Walter Shapiro , Washington bureau chief for Salon.com .
Shapiro said while people might say things differently off the record , racial issues cannot easily be quantified .
The pollsters for the AP / Yahoo survey used techniques that they thought would be more likely to lead to honest results -- such as conducting the poll online and using subtle methods and formulas to calculate racial attitudes .
That study also suggests that the number of people who may turn away from Obama because of his race could be larger than what the margin of victory was in the 2004 election .
Jeff Johnson , host of BET 's " The Truth With Jeff Johnson , " said , " I think there is a concern clearly about the number of people who will vote based on race .
" But I agree -- how you quantify that number , I think , is very difficult . "
According to CNN 's average of recent national polls , Obama holds a lead of 5 percentage points over McCain .
Johnson said one misconception is that racial prejudices are unique to conservatives or people in " Middle America . "
" There are liberals also in many cases that are racist .
I do n't think we know yet how it 's going to play out , " he said .
In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS ' " 60 Minutes , " Obama said while some people might not vote for him because he is black , others might vote for him just because he is .
" Are there going to be some people who do n't vote for me because I 'm black ?
Of course .
There are probably some African - Americans who are voting for me because I 'm black or maybe others just inspired by the idea of breaking new ground , and so I think all that 's a wash , " he said .
Democrats , however , typically get close to 90 percent of the African - American vote anyway .
Salon.com 's Shapiro said Democrats can work on increasing turnout among black voters but that it will be hard to make gains on the percentages they already see .
Johnson said he thinks race will matter , and the best way for Obama to balance out any negative effect is to just stay on message .
" I do n't know if I believe it 's going to be a wash .
I think it 's going to matter .
This race is extremely close , and so every single demographic and every single point is going to count , " he said .
" I think he has to speak to the issues of people in Middle America , and by that , it can counterbalance some of these racial issues . "
The AP - Yahoo News poll surveyed 2,227 adults .
It was conducted August 27 - September 5 , and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points .

While it 's customary to treat any Star Wars related game with a healthy dose of cautious optimism , the recently released demo for Star Wars :
The Force Unleashed has us more than a little excited to get our hands on the full game .
And it looks like we 're not the only ones , as LucasArts has announced that the demo has broken the download record for Xbox Live .
During the first eight days of its release , The Force Unleashed saw more than a million downloads , and combined with the PlayStation Network version that launched at the same time , more then 2.3 million people have had a chance to see what it feels like to be Darth Vader 's secret apprentice .
The previous record holder on XBL was another recent release , Too Human .
That demo saw approximately 900,000 downloads during the same amount of time .
While the demo was fun , as a massive Star Wars geek I 'm still unsure as to whether or not the the game will live up to the hype .
At least I finally know what it feels like to drop a TIE fighter onto a bunch of Stormtroopers .
Star Wars : The Force Unleashed will be released on September 16 for the PlayStation 2 & 3 , Wii , and Xbox 360 .

BRAD I JUST RECEIVED THIS EMAIL FROM A FAMILY MEMBER PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS : Avoiding the Tricks ... VOTER CAGING
The story is all over Progressive Talk Radio today about the McCain campaign
sending absentee ballot applications to registered democrats or people that
have donated to Obama 's campaign ( This information is public , and on the internet ) .
These
ballots are deliberately misleading and have postage paid return addresses
that are for an election clerk that is outside of your city or town .
What this will end up doing is either having your vote not counted , or if
you return one of these , they will cite you for election fraud , saying that
you already voted absentee .
These ballots are only being sent out in
' purple states ' and this is a big deal ..
This is called voter caging , and
is a huge problem .
The McCain campaign is stealing this election as we speak .
Please get this
information out to as many people as you can , and tell anyone you know who
has received one of these ballots that they need to contact their city
election clerk or the supervisor of elections immediately .
Also call the
local media and let them know what is going on .
The main stream media is never going to cover this so we have to depend on
our ground campaign to get the word out to our voters .
We have already seen them turn in thousands of phoney voter registrations and
pretend they were from Acorn .

Misspelling a candidate name for office of president of the United States on an official ballot released so close to an election is pure insolence that must be punished !
This is EXACTLY why I have been suggesting election cops with full legal authority yet controlled by the public , that SERVE the public and not the interests of the election officials .
The Commissioners for the Rensselaer County Board of Elections must be raided immediately , computer 's , papers , records , receipts , and logs and if it was outsourced , that place raided as well , and if there was an outsourced QC ( Quality Control ) that must be raided as well .
This needs to be a crack team with tools to fast - track warrants , force doors down , pick locks , crack encryption and other communication devices , and this team must be completely controlled by public oversight , in other words a swat team controlled by members of all major parties approved by the public as being genuine members representing those parties .
( Maybe someone can take this idea and make legal language , and tighten this idea up some . )
Misspelling a candidate name for office of president of the United States on an official ballot released so close to an election is pure insolence that must be punished !
Expedite it now !

Brad ,
Judith is right , why is McCain listed three times and Obama twice ?
By the way , the second time he is listed , his name is spelled correctly .
Seems like a very confusing ballot .
Maybe McCain supporters get to vote three times for him , and Obama supporters only get to vote twice .
( I 'm kidding , I hope )

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
As the news broke of the Lehman Brothers meltdown and the rest of the latest financial crisis , John McCain , speaking at a campaign rally in Florida on Monday , angrily declared ,
We will never put America in this position again .
We will clean up Wall Street .
This is a failure .
And in a statement released by his campaign , McCain called for greater “ transparency and accountability ” on Wall Street .
If McCain wants to hold someone accountable for the failure in transparency and accountability that led to the current calamity , he should turn to his good friend and adviser , Phil Gramm .
As Mother Jones reported in June , eight years ago , Gramm , then a Republican senator chairing the Senate banking committee , slipped a 262 - page bill into a gargantuan , must - pass spending measure .
Gramm ’s legislation , written with the help of financial industry lobbyists , essentially removed newfangled financial products called swaps from any regulation .
Credit default swaps are basically insurance policies that cover the losses on investments , and they have been at the heart of the subprime meltdown because they have enabled large financial institutions to turn risky loans into risky securities that could be packaged and sold to other institutions .
Lehman ’s collapse threatens the financial markets because of swaps .
From Bloomberg :
Bond - default risk soared worldwide as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sparked concern than the $ 62 trillion credit - derivatives market will unravel … .
Lehman , the fourth - largest securities firm until last week , has been one of the 10 largest counterparties in the market for credit - default swaps , according to a 2007 report by Fitch Ratings .
The market , which is unregulated and has no central exchange where prices are disclosed , has been the fastest - growing type of so - called over - the - counter derivative , according to the Bank for International Settlements .
“ The immediate problem is the derivative default swaps market , in which a plethora of institutional accounts and dealer accounts are at risk , ” Bill Gross , manager of the world ’s largest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach , California , said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio yesterday .
“ It induces a tremendous amount of volatility and uncertainty . ”
Barclays Capital analysts have estimated that if a financial institution with $ 2 trillion in credit - default swap trades were to fail , it might trigger between $ 36 billion and $ 47 billion in losses for institutions that traded with the firm .
So the Lehman fiasco–caused in part by the use of unregulated swaps–could lead to ruin elsewhere in the economy .
Gramm is responsible for the rise of the wild and woolly $ 62 trillion swaps market .
And he was chairman of the McCain campaign and a top economic adviser for McCain–until he dismissed Americans worried about the economy as “ whiners . ”
After that comment , McCain dumped Gramm .
But was Gramm truly excommunicated from McCain land ?
Last month , he attended a meeting of McCain ’s top supporters in Aspen , Colorado .
And at a dinner that day , McCain singled out Gramm for praise .
Last week , failed Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul revealed that Gramm , now an exec for Swiss banking giant UBS ( which also lost billions of dollars due to subprime loans and swaps ) , had recently called him as part of a McCain effort to win Paul ’s endorsement .
Paul turned Gramm down .
( Both Gramm and Paul are Texas Republicans . )
Gramm ’s Paul - courting effort seems to indicate that the fellow who has done much to cause the current financial troubles ( and who was once considered a possible Treasury secretary should McCain win the White House ) is back in the good graces of the McCain campaign .
Shortly after McCain promised he would “ clean up ” Wall Street , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , his running mate , appeared at a Colorado rally on Monday morning and proclaimed that “ John McCain and I will put an end to the abuses in Washington and Wall Street that have resulted in this financial crisis . ”
She promised a McCain administration would “ reform the way Wall Street does business . ”
( She was short on details and spent more time discussing Colorado sports stars from Alaska . )
What neither she nor McCain has explained is how they plan to be able to reform Wall Street when they are being assisted by 177 lobbyists and the guy who greased the way to the current crisis with a backroom legislative maneuver .
If McCain and Palin are serious about never putting America “ in this position again , ” they ought to consider seriously writing down any economic advice they get from Phil Gramm .
******
By the way , both McCain and Palin decried golden parachutes for CEOs .
What might Carly Fiorina , a top McCain adviser and surrogate , think of that ?
She received a $ 21 million severance package when she was forced out as CEO of Hewlett - Packard , after her not - so - successful stint there –and the value of her golden parachute eventually reached $ 42 million .
A fear of falling limits most people to Earth 's gentler slopes .
Yet there are those among us who venture onto cliff faces and stone spires , armed with ropes , harnesses , and anchoring devices , to challenge the unforgiving force of gravity .
As soggy - shoed graduate students studying insect behavior in the streams that drain Colorado 's Rocky Mountains , we occasionally looked up to marvel at the rock climbers ascending the crags and cliffs of this rugged area .
Curiously , the insects we study brave an equally unforgiving force — flowing water — and have found a similar solution to their own " falling " problem .
Nearly 12,000 caddisfly species ( order Trichoptera ) pass their early life stages in freshwater lakes , streams , and wetlands around the world .
The insects typically spend one or two years in these environments , completing their larval and pupal stages .
Then they emerge from the water to briefly live and mate as winged adults .
Before growing wings that offer total freedom from falling , caddisflies rely on glands near their mouths to produce an ultra-useful silk — nature 's duct tape .
Silk is best known as an adaptive tool in silkworms and spiders , but caddisflies use it in ways that are crucial to life underwater .
They create all sorts of aquatic gear with silk , from nets that filter food particles , to wearable protective shelters , to pupal cases in which they metamorphose .
Larvae of one family of caddisflies , the Glossosomatidae , use silk to bind together tiny rock fragments in a mobile home of sorts .
The portable case resembles a tortoise shell and features two small openings on the underside through which a larva can stick its front legs and its rear claws .
The case protects the soft - bodied larva , just as a suit of armor might protect a rock climber from giant predators , but consider the energetic cost of lugging it around !
The drag exerted by the current and the friction between the case and the rocks , appears to slow larvae down substantially .
The glossosomatids ' movement is clunky , with top speeds of only a few inches per hour , but they can crawl freely in slow currents without threat of being washed away .
Remarkably , though , the larvae are also found in swift , turbulent currents .
How is that possible ?
To find out , we recently observed a particular glossosomatid , Agapetus boulderensis , in the swift - flowing headwaters of the Colorado River .
The species appears to have combined its gymnastic flexibility with a clever way of belaying using silken anchors .
Facing upstream , an A. boulderensis larva will affix a small silk " line " to a rock .
Once anchored , the larva turns completely around inside its case .
It then sticks its front legs out the back opening and crawls around , pivoting its case 90 to 180 degrees on the silk anchor until it is facing upstream again .
Then the larva places another anchor , turns around inside its case , and severs the old anchor .
With a succession of pivots , A. boulderensis thus moves slowly but safely against hazardous currents — as a mountaineer would maneuver up a rock face .
Interestingly , much as mountaineers are wary of downclimbing , we have yet to see a larva make pivoting movements in the downstream direction .
Spinning silk anchors takes energy , though , and pivoting is even slower than the usual forward scrabble in calm currents .
So why risk the swift ones ?
For food , most likely .
Faster - flowing environments often host algal mats that are nutritious and rapidly replenished .
And indeed , pivoting movements are often punctuated by bouts of eating , in which larvae graze in arcs around anchor points .
The motives of pivoting caddisflies may differ from those of mountaineers , yet we wonder whether to chalk their convergent strategies up to simple coincidence .
Perhaps some early climbers were closet entomologists ?
Either way , we have learned this : gravity 's a downer , current 's a drag , and wise climbers anchor their rope to the crag !

Julian D. Olden is an aquatic ecologist and assistant professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington .
They were graduate students together at Colorado State University in Fort Collins .
In his first full day on the job , Washington Mutual Inc. Chief Executive Alan Fishman pledged to return the Seattle savings - and - loan to profitability even as investors grew more doubtful about its prospects .
" I need to sit down and do a real dive into this thing , " said Mr. Fishman , who was hired to succeed Kerry Killinger after WaMu 's board concluded that an outsider was needed to help restore confidence .
Underscoring the magnitude of problems facing the Brooklyn - born Mr. Fishman is a memorandum of understanding with the Office of Thrift Supervision that was approved by WaMu 's board in a Sunday board meeting .
The confidential document forces WaMu to provide the federal agency with what the company called " an updated , multi - year business plan and forecast for its earnings , asset quality , capital and business segment performance . "
WaMu said it is n't being required to raise additional capital or change any products or services .
Mr. Fishman promised to build " a winning model for the future " based on WaMu's 2,300 - branch franchise , but he offered few details on how he would limit the company 's credit exposure .
He played down the need for additional capital and told analysts that it was too early to comment about possible asset sales .
If the U.S. returns to a " more normalized credit environment , " he said , the bank could free up an additional $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion a year .
GREENSPAN REJECTS MCCAIN ’S TAX PLAN ….
I guess McCain should n’t count on a Greenspan endorsement .
Alan Greenspan says the country can’t afford tax cuts of the magnitude proposed by Republican presidential contender John McCain — at least not without a corresponding reduction in government spending .
“ Unless we cut spending , no , ” the former Federal Reserve chairman said Friday when asked McCain ’s proposed tax cuts , pegged in some estimates at $ 3.3 trillion .
“ I ’m not in favor of financing tax cuts with borrowed money , ” Greenspan said during an interview with Bloomberg Television .
“ I always have tied tax cuts to spending . ”
Well , Republicans might argue , McCain has talked about cutting spending .
Do n’t believe it — McCain has vowed to curtail earmarks , but his tax - cut package dwarfs the combined total of pork - barrel projects in the federal budget .
McCain has raised the notion of saving money on entitlements , but according to Sarah Palin , the goal is to find “ efficiencies ” in the “ agencies , ” whatever that means .
I should note that I do n’t much care what Greenspan thinks ; he ’s not a credible voice on economics to me at all .
But he ’s a very credible voice to McCain .
During the Republican primaries , McCain conceded that he does n’t understand economics , but boasted , “ I ’ve got Greenspan ’s book . ”
Around the same time , McCain said he ’d rely so heavily on the former Fed chairman , he told a New Hampshire audience , “ Get ol ’ Alan Greenspan — whether he ’s alive or dead .
And um if he ’s dead , we ’ll put dark glasses on him and prop him up like they did at ‘ Weekend at Bernie’s . ' ”
And now , the “ maestro ” is publicly trashing McCain ’s tax plan .
Good to know .
A reader points out what is left implicit in the Palins ' statement :
I 'm not sure how to say this politely , but if Bristol Palin is more than three and a half months ' pregnant , it is physically impossible for her to have given birth on the 18th of April to Trig .
I know with " about five months " it 's difficult to be certain what they mean , which is why most doctors talk in weeks .
But basically a pregnancy is calculated as 40 weeks , and is dated from the previous period so for the first two weeks of the ' pregnancy ' one is not actually pregnant .
Women tend to take at least six weeks to start ovulating again , and often several months .
Say Bristol is very young and made a medically exceptional recovery - the very very earliest she could have become pregnant ' again ' would be from mid May , which would put her at three and a half months pregnant .
Also , and for me this is the clincher :
Schwarzenegger could soon face recall Prison guards union said to have lawyers drawing up initiative
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger answers a question concerning the state 's response to a magnitude - 5.4 earthquake that struck the area earlier in the day , during a news conference in Sacramento , Calif. , Tuesday , July 29 , 2008 .
Schwarzenegger said the state was assessing levees , bridges , power lines , roads and hospitals but that no major damage had been reported .

As if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did n't have enough troubles with the state 's $ 17.2 billion budget mess , now comes word that there may be a move afoot to recall him .
Well - placed Sacramento sources tell us the state 's politically powerful and well - financed prison guards union has lawyers drawing up language for a recall initiative .
Word is , the union will decide within the next couple of weeks whether to hit the streets with petitions .
Recalling Schwarzenegger - who himself rode into office with the 2003 recall of then - Gov. Gray Davis - is probably a long shot at best .
Still , Schwarzenegger has angered fellow Republicans with his call for a three - year , 1 - cent sales - tax hike to help balance the 2008 - 09 budget , now more than two months overdue .
His popularity among voters overall is down in the 30 percent range - that 's the neighborhood where PresidentBush 's numbers are living among voters nationally - and it stands to drop even more the longer the budget mess drags on .
The guards union , the California Correctional Peace Officers Association , has been battling the governor over the group 's contract for years .
It has more than enough money to finance a statewide petition drive if it wants to pull the trigger .
Asked about the recall rumor , union spokesman Lance Corcoran said , " I can't comment other than to say we are taking a very hard look at it . "
Schwarzenegger 's office was quick to respond , saying that although the guards are mad about not getting their raises , " the governor will not be intimidated by scare tactics and will always do what is best for Californians . "
A brother 's tale : Mark " Papa " Guardado , the president of the San Francisco chapter of the Hells Angels who was gunned down Tuesday night on a Mission District street , may have been a much bigger player for the Angels on the West Coast than police initially thought .
" He was the guy - very , very well known , " said one police source in the know , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case .
And in a twist you usually find only in the movies , it turns out that biker chief Guardado was also the older brother of Jose Guardado , a highly decorated San Francisco police officer .
" Jose 's really a great guy , " said homicide Inspector Karen Lynch , who is investigating Mark Guardado 's slaying .
Officer Guardado was awarded a gold medal by the department after a December 2006 incident in which he shot and killed a fugitive from a state prison camp , who moments earlier had mortally wounded his partner , Officer Bryan Tuvera , in a Sunset District home 's garage .
The two brothers were born and raised in San Francisco , but chose decidedly different paths .
Mark Guardado had an assault conviction on his record and was facing battery charges in a Petaluma case , and two years ago his San Francisco clubhouse was raided by the feds as part of a probe into cocaine and methamphetamine trafficking .
" We all have relatives that make bad choices , and his brother did , " Lynch said .
Police believe biker Guardado was shot dead by a rival motorcycle club member , and they are pursuing some leads .
At this point , however , they are n't giving a possible motive .
Whatever the case , the cops are now bracing for Mark Guardado 's funeral this week , and the possibility that hundreds of motorcycle gang members from all over the West Coat might show up for what could prove to be a very tense gathering .
" There have been calls coming in from law enforcement from every jurisdiction in the state , " said one cop .
Palin play :
When it comes to the Bay Area , Republican VP pick Sarah Palin 's debut was pretty much a split decision .
Of the 510 voters questioned in a CBS 5 - TV / Survey USA poll last week , 39 percent said the Alaska governor was an asset to John McCain 's run for the presidency , while 37 percent called her a liability .
On the other hand , only 40 percent said the pick " reflects well on McCain , " compared with 47 percent who said it reflected poorly on his judgment .
Of the 364 voters surveyed who actually heard Palin 's speech to the GOP convention Wednesday night , 42 percent gave her an " A , " 15 percent gave her a " B , " 20 percent a " C , " 12 percent a " D " and 11 percent an " F . "
You are what you eat : " Last year it was bottled water , Al Gore and global warming .
This year it 's Michael Pollan and ' Slow Food Nation . ' "
That 's how one higher - up on San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 's staff described the latest craze sweeping Room 200 at City Hall , and referring to the author of " The Omnivore 's Dilemma . "
The recent Slow Food fest highlighting the connection between eating well and eating local produce was a big hit , and Newsom was one of its biggest cheerleaders .
He even got an instant " Victory Garden " planted at Civic Center Plaza for the cameras .
The movement is a blend of environmental consciousness , dieting and a dash of Oprah , with Alice Waters leading the charge .
" It plays very well in Pacific Heights , Santa Barbara and other places that have money , " our mayoral insider said .
Translation :
The movement is big with the young and the moneyed , two cogs Gavin needs to keep greased for his 2010 gubernatorial bid .
The food focus is not without risks to the mayor , however .
As one law enforcement official told us Friday , " We may have had four shootings in the Mission last night , but at least we have strawberries growing on top of the bus shelter at Larkin and McAllister . "
Leave a tip :
The big break in the Oakland restaurant robbery spree came a week before three suspects were arrested Tuesday , when an anonymous call to the cops fingered Leon Luster as the leader .
The cops then shadowed Luster , found out whom he was hanging with and what kind of car he was driving .
When the call came in on a nail salon holdup Tuesday night in East Oakland , police knew whom to look for and what they were driving - and made the arrest within a half - mile of the crime .

But we can talk about the impact race might be having right now on the presidential election , and how it could all play out in November .
The dirty little secret no one will talk about ( well , almost no one — Mickey Kaus is unafraid to go there ) is the Bradley Effect .
Put simply , people lie to pollsters when the candidate in question is black .
How many of them are actually racist ?
Probably not too many — but no one these days wants to even be thought of as a racist .
So they lie .
In the weird world of American race relations , that ’s progress .
How big is the Bradley Effect ?
Nobody knows .
But Kaus theorizes that it — along with McCain sucking up a bunch of the independent voters — might have been enough to give New Hampshire to Hillary Clinton back in January .
Heck , as soon as Obama looked like a lock on the nomination , even people who really did intend to vote for him seemed to switch back to Clinton , giving her lots of wins at the end .
Too little , too late for Hill — but maybe enough to give us a feel for the size of the Effect .
Call it … two points ?
Three ?
I ’ve seen estimates as high as five percent , but let ’s be conservative here .
The next question is :
Is the Bradley Effect evenly distributed , or does it vary by state or region ?
My guess — again , just a guess — is that it varies , and maybe pretty widely .
Counterintuitively , perhaps , I ’d say there ’s less of an effect in the South .
People there deal with race ( not — ahem — always very successfully ) almost every day , and in ways the rest of the country never had to .
And frankly I ’d expect a southerner to be more willing on average to tell a pollster exactly what he or she really thinks .
In liberal bastions like California and New York , the Bradley Effect might be greater than in other places .
There ’s more pressure to conform to the prevailing liberal orthodoxy , and fewer conservatives to lean on , too .
Midwestern voters sure are nice , even to poll takers .
I ’d expect a pretty solid BE from Ohio through Kansas .
Of course , the Effect will be partly counterbalanced by black Obama voters who might not want to be seen as voting solely on his race — but who will do just that , anyway .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that .
I ’ll be pretty excited my own self when we finally get our first Jewish president since Roosevelt .
( That ’s a joke , people . )
So if we ’re being honest here , and I ’ve certainly tried to be as dispassionate as possible , here ’s how to read the state polls .
For southern states , subtract 1 % or less from Obama ’s support .
It ’s in the South where I ’d expect the weakest Bradleys , and Obama ’s strongest over - performance with black voters .
In the northeast and the west coast , Obama could lose as much as five percent — but interestingly enough , that ’s not enough to cost him any of those states except perhaps New Hampshire and Pennsylvania .
The entire west coast is a lock — but savvy betters might want to put some money on McCain in Oregon .
Yes , Oregon .
The midwest and mountain states ?
Subtract two or three points .
In the more urban - industrial midwestern states ( and Colorado ) , black over - voting will again help compensate , limiting the damage Obama suffers from the Bradley Effect .
But will it be enough ?
In Wisconsin it might be , in Missouri not so much .
To put it more bluntly , if on election day Obama leads in any given state by “ only ” 1 - 5 % , then there ’s still a very good chance McCain will win that state .
Is the Bradley Effect real ?
Yes , it is .
We ’ve seen it before , as recently as the Democratic primaries .
How will it play out ?
Obviously , the polls are of no help to us here , so we have to go on guts .
And my gut tells me that the Bradley Effect could cost Obama Michigan and Pennsylvania — and thus the election .
We ca n’t see a candidate ’s internal polls , of course , but we can get an idea of what they say , by watching what the candidate does and listening to what he says .
And in the last month , Obama has one - upped everyone on getting federal dollars to the Detroit automakers , and spent nearly all his time since the Republican National Convention campaigning in Pennsylvania .
This , from a candidate who once threatened to force his opponent on the defensive in Republican strongholds .
Those days seem to be over — and the Bradley Effect is to blame .
PETAH TIKVA , Israel ( Reuters ) - An Israeli city is using DNA analysis of dog droppings to reward and punish pet owners .

Under a six - month trial programme launched this week , the city of Petah Tikva , a suburb of Tel Aviv , is asking dog owners to take their animal to a municipal veterinarian , who then swabs its mouth and collects DNA .
The city will use the DNA database it is building to match faeces to a registered dog and identify its owner .
Owners who scoop up their dogs ’ droppings and place them in specially marked bins on Petah Tikva ’s streets will be eligible for rewards of pet food coupons and dog toys .
But droppings found underfoot in the street and matched through the DNA database to a registered pet could earn its owner a municipal fine .
“ My goal is to get the residents involved , and tell them that together , we can make our environment clean , ” said Tika Bar - On , the city ’s chief veterinarian who came up with the idea for the DNA experiment .
Bar - On said the DNA database could also help veterinarians research genetic diseases in dogs , investigate canine pedigree and identify stray animals , replacing the need for electronic chip identification .
“ The sky is the limit on how far we can take this , ” she said .
So far , Bar - On said , residents have “ reacted positively to the programme and are cooperating because they want their neighbourhood to be clean ” .
She said Petah Tikva would consider making it mandatory for pet owners to provide DNA samples from their dogs if the trial programme is successful .
November 10 , 2006 Mount Potosi , Las Vegas , Nevada
We thank you for your patience over the last few weeks while we 've been out on the road , enjoying ( and catching up from ) Big Trip 2006 , which you 'll see in great detail here on Tower Site of the Week beginning later this winter .
This month , we kick off a brand - new season of sites that have never before been seen on Tower Site of the Week - and we 'll start with another one of the sites featured in Tower Site Calendar 2007 .
This week , it 's our April photo - Mount Potosi , 8500 feet above sea level and 25 miles southwest of downtown Las Vegas .
That 's airline miles , mind you .
Actually getting from the bright lights of the Strip to the towers atop Mount Potosi , in the event you do n't have a helicopter at your disposal , is one of the more grueling ordeals in the world of broadcast engineering .
( My Radio World colleague Sharon Rae Pettigrew shared some colorful stories from local engineers in an article published just before the NAB show this year . )
My own introduction to the experience that is Mount Potosi also came at NAB 2006 , when CBS Radio's Las Vegas chief engineer , Tracy Teagarden , invited me up the mountain to see his station there , KXTE ( 107.5 Pahrump NV ) .
The day before my Potosi trip , I took part in a group excursion to the other major FM / TV mountaintop site in Las Vegas , Black Mountain .
After bumping and shuddering up that dirt road , I mentioned to another Vegas engineer that I was heading to Potosi the next day .
" Potosi ? " he asked .
" This road 's a four - lane paved highway compared to Potosi ! "
That , as it happened , may have been an understatement .
Just getting to the base of the Potosi tower road is a haul from Las Vegas , involving half an hour 's drive south on I - 15 , a turnoff at the Jean / Goodsprings exit , and then a series of gravel roads leading to the gate .
From there , the road 's deceptively easy for a little while - until it really starts heading up , by way of a steep climb up a sheer stretch of rock that only the most hardy four - wheel - drive vehicles can manage , and then only in the hands of guys like Tracy who drive the road regularly and know it by heart .
Past that stretch , the road gets marginally easier , but there are still plenty of hairpin turns and sheer dropoffs on the way up to the summit .
See that narrow dirt path at the lower left of the photo just above ?
That 's the road - and a pretty decent stretch of it , at that .
All told , it takes about an hour , in the experienced hands of a veteran driver , to get to the low - slung green building and the cluster of towers at the summit .
There 's a phenomenal view from up at the summit , which goes a long way to explaining what this site is doing out here in the first place .
It was developed in the late 80s , when what was then KUDA hit the airwaves on 107.5 , licensed to Pahrump , 60 miles from Las Vegas on the other side of the Spring Mountains ( the range that runs from Mount Charleston , northwest of Las Vegas , to Mount Potosi ) .
There was only one reasonable spot that could put a city - grade signal over both Pahrump and Las Vegas , and this was it - and so the road was carved into the mountain and the first of these towers went up .
Building the road and the tower and the transmitter building was one thing , but keeping the transmitter supplied with power is an even bigger challenge .
There 's a fairly conventional power line that runs partway up the mountain , but it stops well short of the summit .
The rest of the way , power comes through a single skinny aluminum conductor that 's buried under the road .
The photo above at left shows the power cable lashed to a tree just before it heads under the road to the summit - and the photo at right shows some of the array of rotary phase converters that take the incoming power and convert it to the three - phase supply that the transmitters need .
Would you trust your major - market FM signal to that one skinny cable ?
The engineers up here sure do n't - there 's a massive , continuous - duty generator sharing the room with the Phasemasters , and it 's kept these stations on the air for many months at a time when the " shore power " has been out .
And yes , that 's stations , plural .
What began with a single station in 1988 has evolved into a site that 's home to seven FM stations .
The former KUDA on 107.5 is now KXTE , with modern rock .
( It boasts the distinction of having been the first FM station to broadcast HD Radio , for a demonstration during the 1999 NAB show , back before the term " HD Radio " had even been coined . )
The rest of the Potosi stations are all licensed to Las Vegas , and most of them started out at other mountaintop sites before moving up to Potosi .
Clear Channel 's rhythmic AC KPLV ( 93.1 ) was up here pretty early on , though it was KEYV then , and was still doing oldies as KQOL when we were on the mountaintop in April .
In one corner of the building , the 93.1 transmitter sits next to what 's now Beasley country station KCYE ( 104.3 ) , which had just flipped from its longtime identity as standards KJUL .
( I 'm pretty sure it debuted from Potosi in 1989 . )
KXTE 's transmitters sit in the opposite corner , at right in the photo above .
Directly across from the KCYE transmitter are the racks belonging to Nevada Public Radio , which came up here as a single station , KNPR on 89.5 , and then found a clever way to split into two services a couple of years ago .
The former KNPR license moved from 89.5 , where it was a full class C , to 89.7 as a C2 .
That cleared the way for a new full class C license on 88.9 , which took the KNPR calls and NPR news / talk format that had been on 89.5 , while 89.7 became all - classical KCNV .
( The big Nautel is the 88.9 transmitter ; 89.7 runs off that little Nautel exciter and power amps on the left . )
Tucked into a corner next to KXTE are the two Lotus FMs that moved up here from other sites : rocker KOMP ( 92.3 ) , with the only Harris on Potosi , and classic hits KXPT ( 97.1 ) , which uses a Continental like the other commercial FMs up here .
( With the exception of KCNV and its mighty 550 - watt ERP , all the FMs up here enjoy nearly identical Class C technical facilities , roughly 25 kW at 3700 ' AAT .
That kind of height gives these stations remarkable coverage reach , making them audible for close to 200 miles along I - 15 from Arizona almost to Barstow , California .
The tradeoff is somewhat less raw signal strength and some multipath issues in Las Vegas itself , an issue KXPT addresses with a translator on closer - in Black Mountain .
In any case , KXPT and KNPR are our usual presets for the first part of the long drive from Vegas to LA . )
One more bit of Mount Potosi trivia , which I did n't even learn until long after my visit to the mountaintop : while researching this week 's Site of the Week , I found out that the mountain is also known as the site of the 1942 plane crash that killed actress Carole Lombard .
The wreckage of the DC - 3 is apparently still visible not far from the towers .
( And Lombard , we should add , is one of the most famous natives of Fort Wayne , Indiana , a community that should be familiar to Site of the Week readers as the home of the in - laws and starting point for our frequent midwestern excursions . )
From the summit , it 's a long , bumpy ride back down the road to the gate , and then another hour or so back to Las Vegas , which seems even louder and more garish than usual after our excursion to this most remote of transmitter sites .

What purchasers are not told is that , included in the purchase , installation , and operation of Spore is a second , undisclosed program .
The name of the second program is SecuROM , which is a form of Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) for computer games .
Although consumers are told that the game uses access control and copy protection technology , consumers are not told that this technology is actually an entirely separate , stand - alone program which will download , install , and operate on their computers , along with the Spore download .
Consumers are given no control , rights , or options over SecuROM .
The program is uninstallable .
Once installed , it become ( sic ) a permanent part of the consumer 's software portfolio .
Even if the consumer uninstalls Spore , and entirely deletes it from their computer , SecuROM remains a fixture in their computer unless and until the consumer completely wipes their hard drive through reformatting or replacement of the drive .
Nowhere in any of EA 's discussions , responses or explanations of its DRM did EA disclose that the Spore disk contained a separately install , stand alone , uninstallable DRM program which would install itself to the command and control center of the computer and oversee function and operation on the computer , preventing certain user actions , preventing certain user programs from operating or disrupting hardware operations .
Spore is a critically - acclaimed game , but ( at least by users ) its DRM has been universally panned .
Many of those who know anything about the SecuROM copy protection used in the game do n't want it near their computers , unless they absolutely have to .
And while Electronic Arts ( EA ) has " loosened things up " slightly , the DRM has spawned thousands of negative reviews at Amazon.com and protest creatures .
And now , it has birthed a class action lawsuit ( . PDF ) .
The lawsuit was filed on Sept. 22nd by Melissa Thomas , represented by Alan Himmelfarb and Scott Kamber with KamberEdelson LLC .
The lawsuit makes a number of statements , including : and later :
Definitely , Spore used to be extremely hard to get rid of .
Now , the company provides an uninstaller that can be downloaded from their website .
So that part of the lawsuit is invalid , although it should be noted that well - behaved programs should uninstall everything when they are removed .
Granted , if SecuROM was needed for another game on the system , it should remain , but if not , the need to run a separate ( and not included ! ) uninstaller is a pain , to say the least .
As far as not being told about SecuROM , that 's true .
Some sort of DRM is mentioned in the EULA , but not the exact type .
And honestly , consumers have been asking for the type of DRM to be displayed on the box for a long time ( which is why we always do a web search for the type of DRM a game has before buying it ) .
As far as " preventing programs from operating or disrupting hardware operations , " We do remember some past DRM that upchucked if virtual drives were used on a system , but we thought that was Starforce , though admittedly , we could be wrong .
We did n't think it was SecuROM , but hey : we refuse to use either Starforce or SecuROM because they do so much to a system , we 'd rather not play the game than deal with the risk .
At any rate , a lot of this lawsuit seems questionable , at best .
While we would definitely agree that the DRM is a pain and that , in reality , it does n't stop anyone who really , really wants to pirate the game ( take a look at BitTorrent sites for torrents for this game ) , we 're not sure this lawsuit will fly .
It does , however , do one good thing : casts attention on PC game DRM .
As we said , those who really want to pirate the game will do so .
The only ones being hurt by this and other forms of DRM are honest consumers .
@amazinglarry :
It 's an MMO that simulates epic battles , so the graphics being a bit under par is understandable .
Would n't want the game to lag to 20 fps in mid-battle due to all the explosions , debris , and spacecrafts .
;P
But at least the graphics looks a lot better than other classic space fighter sims like , say , Freespace and X - Wing / Tie Fighter / X - Wing vs. Tie Fighter .
Ever since , as wandering_nomad did , discovering that EVE was a menu - based space MMO , I 've been much more interested in this game .
And from the looks of the trailer , it 's not disappointing me a bit .
;D
The Anarchist Cookbook
Back when I was a kid , every boy in school wanted to get a copy of - an outdated manuscript from the early 1970s that provided instructions on blowing things up , using weapons , scamming free calls from pay phones , and basically every other thing that a teenage boy is interested in .
We always wondered how such a book could be sold legally .
The answer was that it was protected under free speech .
The reason for this trip down memory lane is that today Wired posted detailed instructions for how to copy DVDs .
This is an irresistible analogy .
We all know that piracy is illegal , yet Wired ( and a million other websites ) are free to tell the world exactly how to do it .
The never - spoken secret that every website author understands is that whenever you talk about piracy , make sure to say that your instructions are only for making backups of things you already bought .
That covers your rear - end in case of any lawsuit .
But it 's a total joke .
Call it what it is : instructions for how to commit piracy and make copies of a CD or DVD for free .
The same holds true for downloading music and movies .
Millions of websites provide instructions on how to download songs from peer - to - peer networks , and they cover themselves by arguing that such networks are n't only used for piracy ; there are also many legal , non-copyrighted works out there that justify all of the published " How - to " tutorials .
They try to frame the issue not in terms of " piracy " , but in terms of " file sharing " .
But anyone who 's been on the internet for more than five minutes knows that this is a total joke as well .
But so what ?
If we took a reality check and created policies that actually conformed to people 's existing behaviors , we'd let authors come right out and openly admit that their instructions are meant to help people copy DVDs that they rent from Blockbuster and to download a bunch of Beatles albums without paying for them .
The perpetual 13 - year - old inside of me is forced to wonder how it 's OK for a book to be published that tells you how to make Molotov Cocktails to blow up buildings , but how it 's not OK to make a free copy of " The Lion King " for my niece .
Many reports of near - death experiences sound the same : a welcoming white light and a replay of memories .
But now scientists aim to study what really happens to the brain and consciousness when someone is on the verge of dying .
In a new study called AWARE ( AWAreness during REsuscitation ) , doctors will examine patients in hospitals in Europe and North America who reach a state called cardiac arrest .
" Contrary to popular perception , death is not a specific moment , " said leader of the study Dr. Sam Parnia of the University of Southampton in the U.K .
" It is a process that begins when the heart stops beating , the lungs stop working and the brain ceases functioning — a medical condition termed cardiac arrest , which from a biological viewpoint is synonymous with clinical death . "
Science has long struggled to define death , and to determine when the precise moment of death occurs .
Now though , most doctors consider death more of a process than an event .
A person is thought to have died when he stops breathing , his heart stops beating , and his brain activity ceases .
" During a cardiac arrest , all three criteria of death are present , " Parnia said .
" There then follows a period of time , which may last from a few seconds to an hour or more , in which emergency medical efforts may succeed in restarting the heart and reversing the dying process .
What people experience during this period of cardiac arrest provides a unique window of understanding into what we are all likely to experience during the dying process . "
Previous research suggests about 10 to 20 percent of people who live through cardiac arrest report lucid , well - structured thought processes , reasoning , memories and sometimes detailed recall of events during their encounter with death .
One study found that people who reported peaceful feelings , bright light and out - of - body experiences during a brush with death are more likely to have had difficulty separating sleep from wakefulness in their everyday lives .
Both before and after their near - death experiences , these people often have symptoms of the rapid - eye movement ( REM ) state of sleep while awake .
The AWARE researchers want to find out what happens to the brain when a person 's body has started to shut down , whether it is possible for people see and hear during cardiac arrest , and what 's going on during out of body experiences .
The launch of the AWARE study was announced at an international symposium at the United Nations Sept. 11 .

The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Education publishes and disseminates teachings that Muslims are to hate and treat as " enemies " other religious believers , including other , non-Wahhabi Muslims .
Those were our findings in a 2006 study of Saudi government textbooks .
And despite the media outcry that followed , our most recent investigation shows that Saudi textbooks , now available on the Saudi Ministry of Education website , have not been cleaned up .
The same violent and intolerant lessons remain .
These textbooks assert that it is permissible for a Muslim to kill an " apostate , " an " adulterer , " those practicing " major polytheism , " and homosexuals .
They promote global jihad as an " effort to wage war against the unbelievers , " including for the purpose of " calling [ infidels ] to the faith . "
They continue to teach that " the hour [ of judgment ] will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them , " that Shiite practices amount to " polytheism " ( see above ) , that the Christian Crusades never ended , and that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are historical fact .
In these lessons , the Saudi government discounts or ignores passages in the Qur'an and in the accounts of the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad that support tolerance .
After the 9/11 attacks at the hands of largely Saudi terrorists , the King convened a panel of Saudi professionals who concluded that the religious textbooks " legitimiz[e ] the violent repression of the ' other ' and even his physical elimination because of his views on disputed issues .... "
Now noxious Saudi texts are being spread to Muslim communities on every continent .
Saudi Arabia has long sought to be the leading Islamic power and the protector of the faith , a claim asserted in the Saudi Basic Law .
With its vast oil wealth and the religious legitimacy derived from its custodianship of the two Islamic holy shrines and control of the pilgrimage , Saudi Arabia 's long - term ambitions are now within reach .
Even as its official doctrine and school books remain rooted in Wahhabism , the blend of the harsh desert traditions and severe Islamic interpretations of its past , Saudi Arabia is positioning itself to be the authoritative voice of world Islam , with the King as a type of Islamic pope .
Since 1979 , the year when Islamic terrorists laid siege to Mecca and threatened Saudi rule , and when a Shi'a regime seized control of Iran , Saudi Arabia has poured enormous sums into foreign evangelism , funding mosques , schools , libraries , and academic centers in the United States and many other countries .
Some analysts estimate that over the past quarter century , Saudi Arabia has expended over $ 75 billion for spreading Wahhabism , roughly three times more a year than what the Soviet Union spent annually in exporting its ruling ideology during the height of the Cold War .
The Congressional Research Service states that Wahhabism is now " arguably the most pervasive revivalist movement in the Islamic world . "
According to Lawrence Wright in his book Looming Tower , the Saudis , constituting one per cent of the world 's Muslims , support through the Wahhabis " 90 per cent of the expenses of the entire faith , overriding other traditions of Islam . "
The Saudi ideological export is having an effect .
Saudi Wahhabi extremism threatens to become a mainstream or even the dominant expression of Islam among the world 's 1.3 billion Muslims .
Wahhabi thought and customs are taking root in Muslim communities from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , to Afghanistan , Algeria , Egypt , Sudan , Nigeria , Pakistan , India and elsewhere .
As Abdurrahman Wahid , the former President of Indonesia and ex-director of the world 's largest Muslim organization lamented , it is making " inroads " even in his famously tolerant part of the world .
The beginning of the school year marks the deadline for Saudi Arabia to demonstrate it has removed intolerant teachings from all Saudi textbooks .
This Saudi commitment resulted from extensive bilateral negotiations with the U.S. , concluded and hailed by the United States State Department in July 2006 .
Under the International Religious Freedom
Act of 1998 , the State Department has annually designated Saudi Arabia as one of the world 's most intolerant states but it has forestalled imposing the sanctions specified in the Act .
It resists Congressional and other appeals even to translate for review the textbooks used at Islamic Saudi Academy , a Washington metropolitan area academy run by the Saudi Embassy .
It is time to hold Riyadh to its promises to reform its educational materials .
Western security depends on it .

The United States of America ’s double standards
The United States of America ’s double standards
After two terms of the Bush regime , what was once a respected member of the international community today conjures up two gut reactions in the hearts and minds of the international community : sullen hatred due to Washington ’s shock and awe tactics or sheer disrespect due to the two - faced and utterly hypocritical nature of its foreign policies .
Having a man ( and regime ) such as George W. Bush ( and his lobby ) in charge was always going to be a risk , for here is a figure ( and a big - business pressure group ) who belongs to the rich clique of corporate elitists who basically do what they want and if they make a mistake , daddy and his cronies handle it .
Such is the notion of the law they grow up with .
Law , for these people , is something to be manipulated , to be broken if necessary because they know that in the hands of well - paid professionals , the law can be turned on its head , whatever the crime , from a misdemeanour such as misbehaving at a baseball match or killing someone while drunk behind the wheel of a car .
Daddy handles it .
Therefore it comes as no surprise to see George W. Bush flouting the international law one minute , by recognising the Serbian province of Kosovo as an independent state and then lecturing Russia on how to handle two cases which do have a claim to statehood , namely Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Take about double standards , talk about one two - faced confused son of his mother .
How much longer does Washington have to humiliate itself with this sort of charade ?
How can anyone in Washington be taken seriously if its President can look the camera in the eye and say with apparent conviction that Kosovo can be independent and Abkhazia and South Ossetia cannot ?
The problem is , as we have seen , the manipulation campaign in the western corporate media backs up such absurd notions and packages them as fact .
How many western European and north American readers belive that Iraq was all about 9/11 for instance ?
We even had Jeremy Thompson of Sky News asking the US troops while crawling up their backsides with a mock American accent ( “ Hi , you guys ! ” ) if they were looking for revenge for September 11th when they entered Iraq .
We had Sky News ( again ) and other media outlets recently failing to report the Georgian Armed Forces ’ act of slaughter of 2,000 Russians in South Ossetia , or even manipulating photos , trying to make the Georgian atrocities look like they were perpetrated by Russia .
Setting the record straight
Therefore at the moment , journalists in the free press ( such as PRAVDA .
Ru ) have to work overtime setting right the barefaced lies presented as the truth by people like George Bush and the sycoiphantic minions which dare to call themselves an independent Press .
As regards Kosovo , it was the birthplace of the Serbian nation back in 1389 .
It was not the Serbs ’ fault that every Albanian woman ’s dream was to go there and breed like rabbits so that over time the population balance swung in favour of Albanians .
It was not Serbia ’s fault that the USA armed , aided and abetted the KLA terrorists to perpetrate atrocities against the Serb civilians to force Milosevic to put a stop to the international terrorism .
( The USA then complains about Al Qaeda when it was doing exactly the same thing itself in the Balkans ) .
So Kosovo is not an independent state and it never will be unless Serbia decides so .
Serbia is the only country that can pass judgement on the matter under international law , which respects the inviolability of frontiers .
As the Russian Federation stated at the time , any new vector in international law which went against this principle would entail a new legal order , and this would have repercussions in places such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
A New Legal Order
International law cannot have double standards , or else it cannot be called law and the civilised world cannot be ruled by the law of the jungle , which is what Washington advocates .
What Moscow advocates , and always has defended , is a multipolar world which respects the rule of international law , basing all crisis management situations on the UNO and its Security Council .
What Washington did in Iraq was to flout international law by attacking a sovereign nation based on barefaced lies , without the necessary second resolution needed under the UN Charter .
What Washington did with regard to Kosovo was to draw a line on a map and to declare that a part of a sovereign nation was henceforth an independent ( satellite ) state .
What Washington does in the case of Georgia is to ignore the 2.000 Russians murdered by Saakashvili ’s forces ( which are trained by the USA ) and then to apply double standards , saying that Georgia ’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct .
What about Serbia’s ?
How can Washington think it can have it both ways ?
And besides , what about Georgia ’s obligation under the Soviet Constitution to hold referendums in Abkhazia and South Ossetia when Tblissi left the Union ?
Therefore it would appear that at the very least , these two Republics have more of a claim to independence than Kosovo , which under international law has none .
Unless of course the rest of the world recognises Alaska ’s claim to independence , Texas as the Lone Ranger State , Aztlan in the southern states , Montana or the Dakota territories in the northern USA .
And that would be the end of internationally recognised frontiers .
Chaos .
An Armageddon of micro-states and the end of the rule of law as we know it .
Is this what Washington wants ?
Therefore there cannot be two weights and measures as Washington advocates .
It is time for a regime change in Washington , and the sooner , the better .
It is time for someone in Washington to show some common sense , some respect for the law and due process and show the rest of the world that Washington can be a valuable and valued member of the community of nations .
Frankly there are many of us who yearn for the return of the prodigal son to the international fold .

The Scottish Crofting Foundation said some crofts , small farms producing mainly lamb or beef , had seen lamb numbers fall over the past five years because of the sea eagles ’ diet .
“ It ’s come to the stage now that we have lost , in the whole peninsula , around 200 lambs and we believe this is solely due to the sea eagles , ” William Fraser , chairman of the Gairloch and Poolewe branch of the Crofting Foundation , told Reuters .
“ In a few years time there ’ll be no sheep left on the hills , ” said Fraser , who owns a 4 - acre croft with 150 sheep .
Conservation groups began gradually reintroducing sea eagles to parts of Scotland from 1975 .
Britain ’s largest bird of prey had become extinct there in the early 20th century .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) says the programme is an outstanding conservation success story .
Three breeding pairs live in Gairloch , where Fraser has his farm .
Fraser said the sea eagles -- which have a wing span of eight feet and can weigh eight kgs ( 18 lbs ) when fully grown -- will snatch even year - old sheep .
The crofters will meet next week to discuss the problem but Fraser suggested the young eagle chicks could be taken out of their nests and taken elsewhere .
It was up to the conservation groups to solve the problem , he said .
Scottish Natural Heritage , the Forestry Commission of Scotland and the RSPB , which jointly run the sea eagle reintroduction programme , were unconvinced by Fraser ’s estimate .
“ The number ( of lambs ) that they are suggesting is extremely surprising to us , ” said RSPB spokesman James Reynolds .
Reynolds said that last week an RSPB team in Scotland examined a sea eagle nest on Gairloch and found their diet consisted largely of Fulmars , a sea bird , and quite large lamb bones , suggesting they were scavenged .
“ We ’re working with the Scottish Crofting Foundation very closely on this issue , ” Reynolds said , adding that sea eagles generated about 1.5 million pounds ( $ 2.8 million ) a year in wildlife tourism for the island of Mull , where eight pairs live .
Let 's face it : everything is a lot more horrifying than you thought when you were a kid .
Pick even the most childlike , innocent thing you can think of , and the odds are that there 's a deeply disturbing story behind it .
For instance , nursery rhymes .
We grew up memorizing these seemingly nonsense lines of verse from Mother Goose , which seem to exist for no other reason than to keep toddlers entertained .
There could n't possibly be some kind of weird , twisted history to them , could there ?
Well , guess what ...

Three blind mice , three blind mice , See how they run , see how they run , They all ran after the farmer 's wife , Who cut off their tails with a carving knife , Did you ever see such a thing in your life , As three blind mice ?
We Thought it Meant ...
A trio of unfortunate rodents on a mission to find out where the hell they are , eventually run into an old woman who just happens to be skilled in chopping small defenseless animals to pieces .
So this one 's actually already kind of disturbing on its own .
But Some Experts Say ...
The farmer 's wife in the poem is an allusion to the 16th Century Queen " Bloody " Mary I , and her enthusiasm for everything involving torture , death , and basically finding new ways to go down in textbooks as history 's biggest bitch .
The three mice supposedly represent three noblemen who got together and said , " Gee guys , maybe this Mary lady is n't all there . " and were consequently prosecuted for conspiring against the queen .

Not afraid to cut a motherfucker .
If you 're cringing at the thought of what the cutting off of their three " tails " symbolizes , do n't worry .
She did n't cut off their dongs .
No , she proved she had some form of human empathy , and simply burning those suckers at the stake instead .
Conservatives fear a last - minute Obama veep switch RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 14 , 2008
Print This Email This " Prominent conservative leaders , " said Town Hall 's Matt Lewis , expressed worries at the recent Values Voters Summit that Senator Obama would trade Delaware Senator Joseph Biden for former opponent , New York Senator Hillary Clinton , as his vice presidential running mate to counter the popularity of McCain running mate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .
Gov. Palin herself took a shot at the Obama campaign in an interview that aired Friday , telling ABC's Charlie Gibson " I think he 's regretting not picking her now . "
" This entire notion , of course , sounds like a conspiracy theory , " Lewis wrote , " primarily because it is a conspiracy theory . "
A certain amount of paranoia does exist , Lewis noted , since New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002 in a last - minute move by his predecessor , Robert Torricelli , to drop his reelection bid .
" But while the notion of a last - minute veep substitution sounds absurd , " he continued , " is it any more absurd than the last - minute replacement of Torrecelli ( sic ) with Lautenberg ? "
Senator Biden himself elevated Senator Clinton while defending her against an audience member at a rally last Wednesday .
" Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be Vice President of the United States of America , " Biden said .
" She 's easily qualified to be Vice President of the United States of America , and quite frankly , it might have been a better pick than me . "
" Chuck , stand up and let the people see you , " Biden told paraplegic State Senator Chuck Graham before quickly correcting himself at a recent stop in Columbia , Missouri .
" [ Biden is ] a great guy with a big heart and a tremendous grasp of the issues , " a Democratic aide told the Daily Mail .
" He does n't take himself too seriously and that is why he is so genuine and sincere ...
But he is known to make the occasional stupid mistake and that 's simply not a luxury he or Obama can afford right now with Palin having such a big impact . "
On of my chapters begins with the story of Lewis Strauss , the head of the Atomic Energy Commission , who in 1954 famously said " It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter . "
He was wrong .
But what if he'd been right ?
How different would the world be ?
Today we have three technologies -- processing power , digital storage capacity and bandwidth -- that touch nearly as much of the economy as electricity , and they really are becoming too cheap to meter , and this chapter is about the implications of that .
In the course of writing this , I did a little research on the origins of the phrase , and like all famous quotes , it 's wildly misunderstood .
So here are five things you may not have known about " too cheap to meter " , some taken from this great history page :
Despite the fact that a plurality ( less than half ) of Americans favor a pro-nuclear - energy candidate , more say they would rebuff a candidate who wants to build nuclear power plants than say this about any of nine other possible energy reforms , according to a new Gallup Poll .
The poll , conducted over July 25 - 27 found that Americans seem more prepared to support candidates who focus on demand - side management ( consumer conservation of energy ) , raising fuel efficiency standards , increasing government spending on alternative fuels , establishing price controls on gasoline , imposing a windfall profits tax on oil companies , and easing restrictions on offshore drilling .
The two positions receiving the strongest “ Less Likely to Vote For ” percentages – “ Building more nuclear power plants ” and “ Suspending the federal gas tax for several months ” – are both positions Senator McCain has strongly endorsed throughout the summer .

The initial Treasury stance on the bailout was one of sheer demand for authority : give us total discretion and a blank check , and we ’ll fix things .
There was no explanation of the theory of the case — of why we should believe the proposed intervention would work .
So many of us turned to our own analyses , and concluded that it probably would n’t work — unless it amounted to a huge giveaway to the financial industry .
Now , under duress , Ben Bernanke ( not Paulson ! ) has offered an explanation of sorts about the missing theory .
And it is , in effect , a metastasized version of the “ slap - in - the - face ” theory that has failed to resolve the crisis so far .
Before I explain the apparent logic here , let ’s talk about how governments normally respond to financial crisis : namely , they rescue the failing financial institutions , taking temporary ownership while keeping them running .
If they do n’t want to keep the institutions public , they eventually dispose of bad assets and pay off enough debt to make the institutions viable again , then sell them back to the private sector .
But the first step is rescue with ownership .
That ’s what we did in the S&L crisis ; that ’s what Sweden did in the early 90s ; that ’s what was just done with Fannie and Freddie ; it ’s even what was done just last week with AIG .
It ’s more or less what would happen with the Dodd plan , which would buy bad debt but get equity warrants that depend on the later losses on that debt .
But now Paulson and Bernanke are proposing , very nearly , to do the opposite : they want to buy bad paper from everyone , not just institutions in trouble , while taking no ownership .
In fact , they ’ve said that they do n’t want equity warrants precisely because they would lead financial institutions that are n’t in trouble to stay away .
So we ’re talking about a bailout specifically designed to funnel money to those who do n’t need it .
It took four days before P&B offered any explanation whatsoever of their logic .
But as of now , it seems that the argument runs like this : mortgage - related assets are currently being sold at “ fire - sale ” prices , which do n’t reflect their true , “ hold to maturity ” value ; we ’re going to pay true value — and that will make everyone ’s balance sheet look better and restore confidence to the markets .
As I said , this is really a giant version of the slap - in - the - face theory : markets are getting hysterical , and the feds can calm them down by buying when everyone else is selling .
So , three points :
1 . They ’re still offering something for nothing .
In major financial crises , the beginning of the end comes when the government accepts that it will have to pay some cost to recapitalize the banks .
But in this case they ’re still insisting that it ’s basically a confidence problem , and it we can wave our magic wand — a $ 700 billion magic wand , but that ’s just to impress people — the whole thing will go away .
2 . They ’re asserting that Treasury and the Fed know true values better than the market .
Just to be fair , it ’s possible , maybe even probable , that mortgage - related paper is being sold too cheaply .
But how sure are we of that ?
There are plenty of cash - rich private investors out there ; how many of them are buying MBS ?
And is n’t it bizarre to have officials who miscalled so much —
“ All the signs I look at , ” declared Paulson in April 2007 , show “ the housing market is at or near a bottom ” — confidently declaring that they know better than the market what a broad class of securities is worth ?
3 . Even if it works , the system will remain badly undercapitalized .
Realistic estimates say that there will be $ 800 billion or more of real , medium - term — not fire - sale — losses on home mortgages .
Only around $ 480 billion have been acknowledged by financial institutions so far .
So even if the fire - sale discount is removed , we ’ll still have a crippled system .
And Paulson is offering nothing to fix that — unless he ends up paying much more than the paper is worth , by any standard .
Meanwhile , Paulson and Bernanke seem to be digging in their heels against equity warrants or anything else that would make this a more standard financial rescue .
I say no deal on those terms — and if the lack of a deal puts the financial world under strain , blame Paulson and Bernanke , who have wasted most of a week demanding authority without explanation .

This post is the first in a series about memory and protection in Intel - compatible ( x86 ) computers , going further down the path of how kernels work .
As in the boot series , I 'll link to Linux kernel sources but give Windows examples as well ( sorry , I 'm ignorant about the BSDs and the Mac , but most of the discussion applies ) .
Let me know what I screw up .
In the chipsets that power Intel motherboards , memory is accessed by the CPU via the front side bus , which connects it to the northbridge chip .
The memory addresses exchanged in the front side bus are physical memory addresses , raw numbers from zero to the top of the available physical memory .
These numbers are mapped to physical RAM sticks by the northbridge .
Physical addresses are concrete and final - no translation , no paging , no privilege checks - you put them on the bus and that 's that .
Within the CPU , however , programs use logical memory addresses , which must be translated into physical addresses before memory access can take place .
Conceptually address translation looks like this :
Memory address translation in x86 CPUs with paging enabled
This is not a physical diagram , only a depiction of the address translation process , specifically for when the CPU has paging enabled .
If you turn off paging , the output from the segmentation unit is already a physical address ; in 16 - bit real mode that is always the case .
Translation starts when the CPU executes an instruction that refers to a memory address .
The first step is translating that logic address into a linear address .
But why go through this step instead of having software use linear ( or physical ) addresses directly ?
For roughly the same reason humans have an appendix whose primary function is getting infected .
It 's a wrinkle of evolution .
To really make sense of x86 segmentation we need to go back to 1978 .
The original 8086 had 16 - bit registers and its instructions used mostly 8 - bit or 16 - bit operands .
This allowed code to work with 216 bytes , or 64 K of memory , yet Intel engineers were keen on letting the CPU use more memory without expanding the size of registers and instructions .
So they introduced segment registers as a means to tell the CPU which 64 K chunk of memory a program 's instructions were going to work on .
It was a reasonable solution : first you load a segment register , effectively saying " here , I want to work on the memory chunk starting at X " ; afterwards , 16 - bit memory addresses used by your code are interpreted as offsets into your chunk , or segment .
There were four segment registers : one for the stack ( ss ) , one for program code ( cs ) , and two for data ( ds , es ) .
Most programs were small enough back then to fit their whole stack , code , and data each in a 64 K segment , so segmentation was often transparent .
Nowadays segmentation is still present and is always enabled in x86 processors .
Each instruction that touches memory implicitly uses a segment register .
For example , a jump instruction uses the code segment register ( cs ) whereas a stack push instruction uses the stack segment register ( ss ) .
In most cases you can explicitly override the segment register used by an instruction .
Segment registers store 16 - bit segment selectors ; they can be loaded directly with instructions like MOV .
The sole exception is cs , which can only be changed by instructions that affect the flow of execution , like CALL or JMP .
Though segmentation is always on , it works differently in real mode versus protected mode .
In real mode , such as during early boot , the segment selector is a 16 - bit number specifying the physical memory address for the start of a segment .
This number must somehow be scaled , otherwise it would also be limited to 64 K , defeating the purpose of segmentation .
For example , the CPU could use the segment selector as the 16 most significant bits of the physical memory address ( by shifting it 16 bits to the left , which is equivalent to multiplying by 216 ) .
This simple rule would enable segments to address 4 gigs of memory in 64 K chunks , but it would increase chip packaging costs by requiring more physical address pins in the processor .
So Intel made the decision to multiply the segment selector by only 24 ( or 16 ) , which in a single stroke confined memory to about 1MB and unduly complicated translation .
Here 's an example showing a jump instruction where cs contains 0x1000 :
Real mode segmentation
Real mode segment starts range from 0 all the way to 0xFFFF0 ( 16 bytes short of 1 MB ) in 16 - byte increments .
To these values you add a 16 - bit offset ( the logical address ) between 0 and 0xFFFF .
It follows that there are multiple segment / offset combinations pointing to the same memory location , and physical addresses fall above 1MB if your segment is high enough ( see the infamous A20 line ) .
Also , when writing C code in real mode a far pointer is a pointer that contains both the segment selector and the logical address , which allows it to address 1 MB of memory .
Far indeed .
As programs started getting bigger and outgrowing 64 K segments , segmentation and its strange ways complicated development for the x86 platform .
This may all sound quaintly odd now but it has driven programmers into the wretched depths of madness .
In 32 - bit protected mode , a segment selector is no longer a raw number , but instead it contains an index into a table of segment descriptors .
The table is simply an array containing 8 - byte records , where each record describes one segment and looks thus :
Segment descriptor
There are three types of segments : code , data , and system .
For brevity , only the common features in the descriptor are shown here .
The base address is a 32 - bit linear address pointing to the beginning of the segment , while the limit specifies how big the segment is .
Adding the base address to a logical memory address yields a linear address .
DPL is the descriptor privilege level ; it is a number from 0 ( most privileged , kernel mode ) to 3 ( least privileged , user mode ) that controls access to the segment .
These segment descriptors are stored in two tables : the Global Descriptor Table ( GDT ) and the Local Descriptor Table ( LDT ) .
Each CPU ( or core ) in a computer contains a register called gdtr which stores the linear memory address of the first byte in the GDT .
To choose a segment , you must load a segment register with a segment selector in the following format :
Segment Selector
The TI bit is 0 for the GDT and 1 for the LDT , while the index specifies the desired segment selector within the table .
We 'll deal with RPL , Requested Privilege Level , later on .
Now , come to think of it , when the CPU is in 32 - bit mode registers and instructions can address the entire linear address space anyway , so there 's really no need to give them a push with a base address or other shenanigan .
So why not set the base address to zero and let logical addresses coincide with linear addresses ?
Intel docs call this " flat model " and it's exactly what modern x86 kernels do ( they use the basic flat model , specifically ) .
Basic flat model is equivalent to disabling segmentation when it comes to translating memory addresses .
So in all its glory , here 's the jump example running in 32 - bit protected mode , with real - world values for a Linux user - mode app :
Protected Mode Segmentation
The contents of a segment descriptor are cached once they are accessed , so there 's no need to actually read the GDT in subsequent accesses , which would kill performance .
Each segment register has a hidden part to store the cached descriptor that corresponds to its segment selector .
For more details , including more info on the LDT , see chapter 3 of the Intel System Programming Guide Volume 3a .
Volumes 2a and 2b , which cover every x86 instruction , also shed light on the various types of x86 addressing operands - 16 - bit , 16 - bit with segment selector ( which can be used by far pointers ) , 32 - bit , etc .
In Linux , only 3 segment descriptors are used during boot .
They are defined with the GDT_ENTRY macro and stored in the boot_gdt array .
Two of the segments are flat , addressing the entire 32 - bit space : a code segment loaded into cs and a data segment loaded into the other segment registers .
The third segment is a system segment called the Task State Segment .
After boot , each CPU has its own copy of the GDT .
They are all nearly identical , but a few entries change depending on the running process .
You can see the layout of the Linux GDT in segment.h and its instantiation is here .
There are four primary GDT entries : two flat ones for code and data in kernel mode , and another two for user mode .
When looking at the Linux GDT , notice the holes inserted on purpose to align data with CPU cache lines - an artifact of the von Neumann bottleneck that has become a plague .
Finally , the classic " Segmentation fault "
Unix error message is not due to x86 - style segments , but rather invalid memory addresses normally detected by the paging unit - alas , topic for an upcoming post .
Intel deftly worked around their original segmentation kludge , offering a flexible way for us to choose whether to segment or go flat .
Since coinciding logical and linear addresses are simpler to handle , they became standard , such that 64 - bit mode now enforces a flat linear address space .
But even in flat mode segments are still crucial for x86 protection , the mechanism that defends the kernel from user - mode processes and every process from each other .
It 's a dog eat dog world out there !
In the next post , we 'll take a peek at protection levels and how segments implement them .

As the search continued here for people killed or stranded by Hurricane Ike , the authorities said Monday that they were faced with much larger challenges than simply clearing roadways and restoring electricity before they could let residents back onto this debris - strewn island .
The sludge left in homes and on roads as floodwaters recede represents a “ toxic soup ” of mud , human waste , asbestos , lead and gasoline that poses serious health risks and must be removed before people return , they said .
Homes must be inspected for structural damage and for leaks before natural gas service can be restored .
And before debris can be hauled away , hazardous material has to be separated from what can be sent to recycling centers , burned or chipped into mulch .
ANNAPOLIS ( Aug. 17 , 2008 )  Maryland Energy Administration ( MEA ) officials say they have awarded $ 591,000 , a record level , to Maryland residents for the solar and geothermal program — a residential grant program that helps offset the cost of installing residential and small commercial renewable energy systems .
Governor Martin OMalley said the grant money was awarded just weeks after becoming available .
 The residential solar and geothermal grant program has helped hundreds of Maryland families contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable economy , while also helping to reduce household energy costs ,  said Governor OMalley .
Malcolm Woolf , Director of the Maryland Energy Administration , says the level of interest in MEAs solar and geothermal grant program continues to grow .
 Marylanders are clearly ready to move to greener and more sustainable energy sources to offset their electricity bills ,  said Woolf .
The record level of funding was made possible by new legislation championed by Governor OMalley to update the solar and geothermal grant program .
Under the revised legislation , signed in April , Maryland residents are eligible for grants of up to $ 10,000 ( $ 2,500 per kilowatt ) for photovoltaic solar arrays , up to $ 3,000 for solar water heaters , and up to $ 3,000 ( $ 1,000 per ton of cooling ) for geothermal systems .
As a result of the new legislation , the Maryland Energy Administration Due has fully spent its budget for the solar and geothermal program .
MEA officials say they are actively pursuing additional avenues of funding to enable more Marylanders to contribute to a cleaner , more renewable Maryland , while reducing their energy bills .
As funding becomes available , MEA officials say they will offer additional grants to Marylanders currently on the wait list .
Funding is still available for the MEAs Windswept program , which provides grants of up to $ 10,000 ( $ 2,500 per kilowatt ) to offset the cost of small - scale wind turbines for Maryland residents in appropriate locales .

Updated The Republican nominee , Senator John McCain , whose campaign has attempted to cast him as “ the original maverick , ” is apparently extending that title to his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska .
The pair are out with a new television ad today highlighting , according to the campaign , their “ record of bringing reform to government . ”
Here ’s a portion of the script :
“ He fights pork barrel spending .
She stopped the Bridge to Nowhere .
He took on the drug industry .
She took on big oil , ” an announcer says .
“ He battled Republicans and reformed Washington .
She battled Republicans and reformed Alaska .
They ’ll make history .
They ’ll change Washington . ”
The 30 - second spot titled “ Original Mavericks ” will be broadcast on national cable TV and in key states , and its assertions are sure to be parsed by fact - checkers on the Democratic side .
And Obama spokesman Bill Burton provided this response :
“ Despite being discredited over and over again by numerous news organizations , the McCain campaign continues to repeat the lie that Sarah Palin stopped the Bridge to Nowhere , ” Mr. Burton said in a statement .
“ John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 % of the time and he and Sarah Palin will continue Bush ’s economic policies , his health care policy , his education policy , his energy policy , and his foreign policy .
McCain and Palin will say or do anything to make people believe that they will change something besides the person sitting in the Oval Office . ”
Senator McCain and Gov. Palin travel to Lee ’s Summit , Missouri for a rally on Monday .
The Palin Factor Gov. Palin , who has so far been reticent to speak to the national press corps , has agreed to give her first major television interview since becoming her party ’s vice presidential nominee to ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson .
He plans to sit down witt Ms. Palin in Alaska later this week .
The Washington Post ’s Howard Kurtz has more on Gov. Palin ’s “ testy start ” with the media : “ From the moment Sarah Palin stepped onto the national stage , she was mauled , minimized and manhandled by an openly skeptical media establishment , ” Mr. Kurtz writes .
Nevertheless ,
The Los Angeles Times ’s Maeve Reston reports that Mr. McCain is looking like a different candidate with Ms. Palin by his side :
With his blue shirt sleeves rolled up , he punches out his lines with gusto , railing against the “ old , big - spending , do - nothing , me - first , country - second Washington crowd , ” stabbing the air with his Sharpie marker and thumping the lectern with his fist .
Aides acknowledge that Palin ’s presence has turned McCain into a sharper campaigner , and that is perhaps why she abandoned her plans to return to Alaska this weekend .
Instead , she will accompany him for two more days than planned this week .
Tod Hamburger and Kim Murphy of The Los Angeles Times also take a closer look at the style of leadership Ms. Palin has developed during her years in Alaska politics .
Over the next two months Ms. Palin will be combining “ presidential politics and motherhood ” in a way that no one else has ever done , report The Times ’s Jodi Kantor , Kate Zernike and Catrin Einhorn .
A focus will be her infant son Trig , who was born premature and diagnosed with Down Syndrome :
Before her son was born , Ms. Palin went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that his arrival would not compromise her work .
She hid the pregnancy .
She traveled to Texas a month before her due date to give an important speech , delivering it even though her amniotic fluid was leaking .
Three days after giving birth , she returned to work .
But with Trig in her arms , Ms. Palin has risen higher than ever .
Senator John McCain , the Republican nominee for president , says he selected her as his running mate because of her image as a reformer , but she is also making motherhood an explicit part of her appeal , running as a self - proclaimed hockey mom .
In just a few months , she has gone from hiding her pregnancy from those closest to her to toting her infant on stage at the Republican National Convention .
On the Trail Senators Obama and Biden travel on separate schedules – Mr. Obama talks to Michigan residents about the economy , while Mr. Biden travels to both Wisconsin and Iowa .
Senator Obama will also appear on MSNBC ’s “ Countdown with Keith Olbermann ” this evening .
In a interview on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” Senator Biden departed Sunday from party doctrine on abortion rights , and said that human life begins at conception – a position that he said was based on his Catholic religious beliefs but one he said he would not impose on others .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton will campaign in Florida on behalf of Mr. Obama .
She ’ll hold a rally for voters in Tampa and a community event on the economy in Kissimmee .
But take it from her former top strategist Howard Wolfson , who is now blogging as “ The Flack ” at The New Republic , Senator Clinton will not be taking on Governor Palin one - on - one .
Mr. Wolfson wrote today that while “ cat fights ” might be fodder for entertainment news , they just do n’t comport with Senator Clinton ’s style or practice .
The Times ’s John M. Broder reports that former President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama will break bread together on Thursday in New York : “ The terms of the Clinton - Obama meeting have been negotiated warily for weeks through a veil of mutual suspicion .
Mr. Clinton has felt for months that Mr. Obama has not paid him the proper respect as a former president and many close to Mr. Obama believe that Mr. Clinton dealt dismissively with him during the campaign . ”
Campaign Finance
The Wall Street Journal ’s Brody Mullins reports that Mr. McCain has been raising more from top industry donors that his rival , Senator Obama : “ Sen. McCain ’s fund - raising advantage among corporate America is a stark reversal from earlier this year , when he struggled to secure donations from executives . ”
Downballot The Times ’s David M. Herszenhorn reports on the hotly contested New Hampshire Senate race between Republican Senator John Sununu ( “ one of the most vulnerable incumbents up for re-election this year ” ) and the state ’s former Gov. Jeanne Shaeen , a Democrat :
With the fall campaign season now officially under way , Mr. Sununu and Mrs. Shaheen have come out slinging daggers .
And like the presidential candidates , who are grappling for the mantle of change , the candidates down - ballot are doing so by clashing over practical kitchen - table issues — the price of gasoline and home heating oil , health care costs , job security — that make this race emblematic of Senate contests across the country .
The New Hampshire race reflects the national political climate that has many Republicans battling to keep their jobs as their opponents seek to tie them to President Bush and blame them for the ailing economy .
It is an atmosphere so tough that several candidates , including Mr. Sununu , skipped the Republican convention in Minnesota last week to stay home and campaign .

Telomere ( Image : Wikimedia Commons )
At the heart of almost all human cancers is a rogue enzyme , telomerase .
Now the structure of a key catalytic component of the enzyme has been discovered , paving the way to more effective anti-cancer and , perhaps , anti-ageing drugs .
Telomerase is responsible for adding unique repetitive sequences of DNA , called telomeres , at one end of chromosomes .
These telomere caps ensure the chromosomes do n’t fall apart , but because telomerase is dormant in most adult cells each time a cell divides , its telomere loses a chunk of DNA .
Eventually , when cells can no longer divide , they die – this protects against cancer .
When telomerase is more active than it should be , telomeres do n’t get shorter .
Instead , cells continue dividing beyond their normal limits , and become cancerous .

This has made telomerase a prime target for anti-cancer and anti-ageing therapies , but a lack of information on the structure of its catalytic subunit , TERT , has hindered progress .
Beetle bonanza
Emmanuel Skordalakes and his team from The Wistar Institute , Philadelphia , finally cracked the structure when they discovered that a gene in an insect – the flour beetle – could be harnessed to produce the enzyme in massive quantities .
This enabled the team to analyse TERT using X - ray crystallography .
“ Structural studies of telomerase have been extremely difficult due to the size and complexity of the enzyme , which in turn made it difficult to isolate the protein component of telomerase in sufficient , stable quantities for the proposed studies , ” says Skordalakes .
The structural analysis reveals that TERT ( telomerase reverse transcriptase protein ) consists of three domains , and forms a ring - like doughnut structure that creates a central hole .
When the telomere is being built , this hole allows a nucleic acid template molecule about eight nucleotide bases long to fit inside .
Anti-ageing drug ?
Previously scientists had thought that the structure of the enzyme is similar to HIV transcriptase and developed anti-telomerase drugs accordingly .
The structural analysis confirms there is a similarity , but it also reveals that one of the domains in the TERT protein – called the carboxy - terminal extension or CTE – has a unique type of protein fold , never been seen before .
This feature could help develop anti-telomerase drugs that specifically target the fold .
“ Now that they know what the structure of the catalytic subunit is , they can design drugs that can bind to the protein subunit and either inhibit its activity for anti-cancer treatment , or promote its activity as anti-ageing therapy , ” says Stephen Neidle , from The School of Pharmacy , University of London , UK .
Neidle says developing drugs to target the enzyme could be used in combination with existing anti-telomerase anti-cancer therapies currently in clinical trials , such as a class of telomerase vaccines .
Aubrey de Grey of the Methuselah Foundation says : “ If we had a really cast - iron therapy against all cancers , it might well be a good idea to stimulate telomerase , with a drug , for example , that might have widespread anti-ageing effects . ”

Incidents of pilots being blinded by lasers while attempting to land in the GTA are on the rise .
Back in March , Transport Canada had got five complaints since 2005 from pilots attempting to land at Toronto area airports about someone shining a laser at their plane and trying to target their eyes from the ground .
Since then , 15 pilots have filed local complaints about laser pointers aimed at incoming or outgoing aircraft .
The most recent reports were from Oct. 10 and 13 , by pilots flying into Toronto Island and Pearson International airports respectively .
" We can no longer say that it 's rare , " said Robert Palmer , spokesperson for WestJet Airlines .
In total , Transport Canada has received 73 reports of lasers aimed into cockpits across the country , including 46 so far in 2008 .
The aviation industry is labelling these incidents " security concerns , " a category reserved for bomb threats , sabotage and hijackings in Transport Canada 's civilian aviation reporting system .
The types of high - powered lasers able to reach a cockpit from several kilometres away can be found in most boardrooms .
Earlier this month , a WestJet first officer was hit in the eyes during takeoff from Calgary when someone shone a green light into the cockpit of the 130 - seat aircraft .
Upon landing in Kelowna , he was taken to hospital and released without injury .
" I wonder if the people doing this truly appreciate how dangerous it is , " said WestJet 's Palmer .
" I think in their minds it 's a prank , ( but ) it 's far more serious . "
While the level of industry concern may be high , police tend to find the practice a random one that they 're at pains to prevent .
Pilots have reported a green laser coming from near Canada 's Wonderland and white lasers from the area of Yonge St. and Eglinton Ave .
A Porter Airline pilot reported a green laser aimed from two kilometres north of Bluffers Park .
No laser - related arrests have been made in the GTA .
Under the Aeronautic
Act , someone caught attempting to blind a pilot with a laser risks a $ 100,000 fine and five years in prison .
Only one conviction has occurred in Canada .
A Calgary man , David Mackow , was caught beaming a green laser from his downtown apartment at an Air Canada Jazz flight a year ago .
The pilot alerted police , who dispatched a helicopter .

When Mackow aimed the laser at the helicopter , police isolated his position and arrested him .
He told police he was " just having some fun . "
He was fined $ 1,000 .
Air Canada pilot Stephen Guetta says the threat to a cockpit is probably greatest when the plane is about 10 seconds from landing .

News : Q&A
American climate scientist James Hansen explains why he 's testifying against coal .
James Hansen : no friend of coal .
AP
James Hansen , the director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City , is well known for rattling his nation 's political establishment .
This week , the climate scientist was in London , UK , to testify on behalf of activists who defaced a coal - fired power station in Kent .
Geoff Brumfiel caught up with Hansen at a London hotel to find out what has got him all hot and bothered .
Why did you come to testify ?
Nothing could be more central to the problem we face with global climate change .
If you look at the size of the oil , gas and coal reservoirs you 'll see that the oil and gas have enough CO 2 to bring us up to a dangerous level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
There 's a potential to solve that problem if we phase out coal .
If we were to have a moratorium on coal - fired power plants within the next few years , and then phase out the existing ones between 2010 and 2030 , then CO 2 would peak at something between 400 and 425 parts per million .
That leaves a difficult problem , but one that you can solve .
Do you think that leaders like UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown have lived up to their promises on climate change ?
It depends on whether they will have a moratorium on coal - fired power .
I think that the greenest leaders , like German chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Brown , are saying the right words .
But if you look at their actions , emissions are continuing to increase .
All of these countries and the United States are planning to build more coal - fired power plants .
And if you build more coal - fired power plants , then it is not possible to achieve the goals that they say they are committed to .
It 's a really simple argument and yet they wo n't face up to it .
So do you think that these activists were justified in doing what they did ?
The activists drawing attention to the issue seems to me as justified .
You should try to do things through the democratic process , but we really are getting to an emergency situation .
We can't continue to build more coal - fired power plants that do not capture CO 2 if we hope to solve the problem .
We need to get energy from somewhere .
So if we 're not getting it from coal , then where ?
The first thing we should do is focus on energy efficiency .
The fact that utilities make more money by selling more energy is a big problem .
We have to change those rules .
Then there is renewable energy — in order to be able to fully exploit renewable energy , we need better electric grids .
So those should be the first things , but I think that we also need to look at next - generation nuclear power .
Some have said you are hypocritical for flying all the way from the US to the UK just to testify .
How do you respond ?
I like to travel as little as possible , not only because it uses less CO 2 but because I prefer to do science .
But sometimes there are things which are sufficiently important that I think it makes sense .
What do you think the roll of the scientist should be in the broader societal debate on climate change ?
I think it would be irresponsible not to speak out .
There is a clear gap between what is understood by the relevant scientific community and what is known by the public , and we have to try and close that gap .
If we do n't do something in the very near future , we 're going to create a situation for our children and grandchildren that is out of control .
Leeton , Missouri -
In this small town south of Warrensburg , directions usually begin with , " From Casey 's , you go ... "
That would be Casey 's General Store , the only gas station in town .
It 's where folks fill up while talking about goings - on , politics , weather and who 's got the best - looking tomatoes .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
These days , they 're also cussing and shaking their heads about the price of that gasoline .
People are doing that everywhere , but in small towns such as Leeton , population 619 , it 's even more of a gut punch because nearly every working adult commutes to jobs elsewhere .
These days , there had better be a really good job on the other end of that trip .
Don Campbell 's daily commute to Kansas City - about 100 miles each way - costs him roughly $ 866 a month at $ 3.90 per gallon .
But he 's a union iron worker and says he can make the math work .
Most of his neighbors can't .
For them and thousands of other small - town residents across the country who drive long distances to jobs that pay little more than minimum wage , the high cost of gas is making that daily commute cost - prohibitive .
So much so that economists predict that over the next few years , the country could see a migration that would greatly reduce the population of Small Town America - resulting in a painful shift away from lifestyle , family roots , traditions and school ties .
" This town 's the only place I know , " said Louie Rector , who drives 35 miles to his job at a window factory from his home in tiny Dixon , Mo. , about 20 miles west of Rolla .
" I grew up here ... raised my kids here .
I got my family and friends all here .
I do n't want to pack up and leave .
But it 's getting to the point where a fella can't afford to drive to work , and that do n't seem right to me . "

I am extremely disappointed in the choice of Sarah Palin as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Republican Party .
I will still vote for Senator McCain , because I am very concerned about having a fundamental leftist , especially one who is a marvelous orator , as President .
At first , I thought it amusing that McCain picked a pretty , smart , and tough female to counter the racist / sexist accusations going back and forth between parties .
I remember how Oprah Winfrey got caught in the cross - fire as she stepped up to the political table to support Obama with pride that a black man could rise to such heights in the USA , only to get slammed by feminists who told her it was gender , not race , that she should back .
Understandably , Ms. Winfrey pulled back from it all .
Forget gender and race .
I ’m frankly and sadly caught in the dilemma of having to balance policy versus example in touting a candidate for the office of the First Family .
I was ferociously attacked ( what ’s new ? ) when I spoke out strongly against Bill Clinton ’s dalliances in the Oval Office .
That situation quickly turned into a debate whether “ private has anything to do with public . ”
Nonsense .
Role models are very important .
Children and young adults look to those who are visible and successful as a road map of what is acceptable behavior and emulate those actions over the morals and values their parents and churches have taught and tried to reinforce .
It ’s a tough go these days , when the “ bad that men or women do ” is used for entertainment purposes without judgment , or is excused because of political or financial considerations .
I ’m stunned – could n’t the Republican Party find one competent female with adult children to run for Vice President with McCain ?
I realize his advisors probably did n’t want a “ mature ” woman , as the Democrats keep harping on his age .
But really , what kind of role model is a woman whose fifth child was recently born with a serious issue , Down Syndrome , and then goes back to the job of Governor within days of the birth ?
I am haunted by the family pictures of the Palins during political photo - ops , showing the eldest daughter , now pregnant with her own child , cuddling the family ’s newborn .
When Mom and Dad both work full - time ( no matter how many folks get involved with the children ) , it becomes a somewhat chaotic situation .
Certainly , if a child becomes ill and is rushed to the hospital , and you ’re on the hotline with both Israel and Iran as nuclear tempers are flaring , where ’s your attention going to be ?
Where should your attention be ?
Well , once you put your hand on the Bible and make that oath , your attention has to be with the government of the United States of America .
I am positively moved that neither Sarah nor her daughter were willing to terminate the lives of their unborn children .
This is in sharp contrast to Obama ’s statement that “ When it comes specifically to HIV / AIDS , the most important prevention is education , which should include … which should include abstinence education and teaching children … teaching children , you know , that sex is not something casual .
But it should also include – it should also include other , you know , information about contraception , because , look , I ’ve got two daughters , 9 years old and 6 years old .
I am going to teach them first of all about values and morals .
But if they make a mistake , I do n’t want them punished with a baby . ” ( March , 2008 )
So , one Vice Presidential candidate and her daughter demonstrate , under conditions of great stress , that babies are valued human beings , not punishment .
However , that same VP candidate came forth in April of 2008 with a proclamation for “ Family Child Care Week , ” in which she wrote : “ These professionals are positive role models for the children they care for and the communities they serve . ”
Clearly , Palin sees the need for positive role models .
I suggest that they be Mommy and Daddy , and not the hired help .
Child - care facilities are a necessity when mothers and fathers ( when they exist at all ) are unwilling or incapable of caring for their offspring .
Unfortunately , they have become a mainstay of the feminista mentality that nothing should stand in the way of a woman ’s ambition – nothing , including her family .
Any full - time working wife and mother knows that the family takes the short end of the stick .
Marriages and the welfare of children suffer when a stressed - out mother does n’t have time to be a woman , a wife , and a hands - on Mommy .
Despite early reports that brain surgery would not be an option for Senator Edward Kennedy , the lawmaker is recovering after a successful operation , which was carried out at Duke University Medical Center today .
The delicate procedure was performed by Allan Friedman , a highly - respected neurosurgeon , and will be followed by focused radiation and chemotherapy .
Since none of those treatments can cure brain cancer , the senator may want to try some promising new medications .
According to The Boston Globe , Dr. Lawrence C. Horowitz and other former Kennedy staff members are scouring the medical literature in search of experimental treatments that may keep their friend alive .
Last week , we suggested that he try a dose of radioactive scorpion venom , which can selectively destroy glioblastoma cells while leaving healthy brain tissue unharmed .
In a similar move , yesterday , Forbes pointed out that Kennedy may benefit from an experimental cancer vaccine .
Several sources , including National Public Radio , have indicated that he may use Avastin – an antibody , which starves tumors by intercepting a molecule that causes blood vessel growth .
Although that drug is widely used to treat colon cancer , it has not been formally accepted as a therapy for brain tumors .
So far , the public does not know what kind of tumor Kennedy has , except that it is a glioma .
If you have any technical details about his biopsy results , or his chemotherapy and radiation regimen , please send us a note or leave a comment .

Palin press may boycott UN conference
NEW YORK – Journalists , displeased with Sarah Palin ’s efforts to restrict their access to her , are threatening not to cover her events surrounding the United Nations conference here unless they 're allowed more access .
The unfolding boycott is the latest development in a rocky relationship between Palin ’s handlers and the press , in which the campaign has sought to tightly control her interactions with the media .
Advertisement
The campaign had originally indicated that the print reporters following her campaign would be among the small group of journalists allowed to attend the so - called “ pool sprays ” before Palin ’s meetings with dignitaries on the sidelines of the U.N. meetings .
The sprays are basically glorified photo opportunities during which journalists can snap photos and film footage and – if they ’re lucky – shout a question or two at Palin and her company before she adjourns for private meetings .
On Tuesday , those meetings were to include Afghan President Karzai and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger .
But the imbroglio began developing Tuesday morning when Palin ’s handlers informed the small print press contingent covering her campaign that the print reporter designated to cover the events , Elizabeth Holmes of the Wall Street Journal , would not be allowed to cover the sprays .
The campaign ’s reasoning was that there were not going to be questions or statements at the sprays , so they were only appropriate for photographers and cameramen .
The campaign also at first moved to bar CNN , the television network designated for pool duty , from sending its editorial producer – basically a hybrid print / video journalist – though the campaign budged when the network threatened to withhold its cameras as well .
With Palin ’s first meeting set to begin at noon , that leaves the print reporters on the outs .
UPDATE : After shutting the print pooler , Holmes , out of the spray before Palin ’s meeting with Afghan President Karzai — “ rudely , ” according to Holmes — the campaign relented and agreed to let her cover the sprays before Palin ’s next two meetings , with Colombian President Uribe and Kissinger .
Updated story forthcoming .
The failed CEO ’s of Citi , Countrywide , Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch all walked away from sinking ships with tens and hundreds of dollars .
It was all built upon bad business that eventually humbled or completely ruined their respective companies .
The US taxpayers have been forced to cover their billions in corporate losses but besides a few embarrassing sessions in front of Congress , they ’re all just fine .
As Nouriel Roubini has said , it ’s a system of “ privatized profits and socialized losses . ”
None of those former CEOs feel an ounce of pain for the economic ruin that is taking down the US economy and eventually the world economy .
They are sitting on a gold mine that never should have happened .
Even without the gamble , they all could have lived a comfortable retirement but now they are living beyond our wildest dreams .
When is Congress going to step in and re-visit this situation ?
Forget about blowing hot air for the TV , legal action is necessary .
Why should they be able to walk away so easily and pain free ?
Do n’t even give me the old “ they had a contract ” nonsense because lots of contracts exist and plenty of them are revisited in court .
The extraordinary acts of nationalizations , bailouts , debt purchases , etc have put us into new ground .
Failing to take action will be a failure on behalf of the American public .
Surely Congress will bring some accountability to this once in a lifetime event , no ?
Much like 9/11 when nobody was ever held responsible , I get the feeling we ’re looking at the same here .
What does this say about us as a country that we so easily dismiss such obvious failures ?
It ’s been a great week in Denver .
I ’ve been working hard for the campaign while completing “ So Help Me ” for the show in November .
Hope I can get another handcheck on my film at the airport .
Those x-ray machines make me nervous .

AP : Obama ’s Speech Seen by 38 Million
From September 6th to September 17th , Beijing is once again hosting athletes from around the world .
Over 4,200 athletes - from six different disability groups - from 148 countries are taking part in the 2008 Summer Paralympic Games .
Not only are the sports divided into events , but the events are divided into different disability categories , to even out the playing field as much as possible .
The slogan for this years Paralympic Games is the same as the one for the Olympics held just last month : " One World , One Dream " .

Swarovski crystals have been showing up everywhere lately , particularly in consumer gadgets such as high - end cell phones and televisions .
Now , thanks to this strange design , not even your peepers are safe from Swarovski-adornment .
Indian designer Anthony Mallier has come up with ‘ Sparkle ’ , a design that incorporates those aforementioned diamond - like crystals into contact lenses for yet another , albeit original , blinged - up fashion accessory .
The design was conceived for Swarovski ’s recent design competition called Crystal Vision which attracted 4074 entrants from 92 countries .
You can have a snoop at all of the entrants over at DesignBoom .
Sparkle took second place .
It makes me wonder if this design could ever come to fruition .
Is it possible , not only to cut a crystal into such a miniscule size , but to also embed it into a highly flexible lens about a millimeter thin .
Am I over thinking this ?
Just a design you say ?
Okay then …innit purdy !

Car share lanes have not taken off in the UK
Enforcing the more - than - one - occupant rule of car - sharing lanes has been a problem ever since Leeds opened the first in 1998 on the A647 .
Using council officers and police is labour - intensive and ordinary CCTV can be fooled by dogs or inflatable humans .
But a solution could be provided by a new camera that counts humans by detecting the unique " signature " provided by the blood - water content of human skin .
THE ANSWER
It detects human skin
Then it counts heads
It 's at least 90 % reliable , says its creator , and not fooled by animals , dummies or cosmetics
Experts at Loughborough University believe this system , called the " dtect " camera , is the most effective .
Loughborough 's Dr John Tyrer - director of the firm Vehicle Occupancy and who has been working on this project for six years - says the experience in Leeds suggests that without enforcement , offending is very high .
HOW 'DTECT ' CAR - SHARING CAMERA COULD WORK 1 : When triggered by approaching car , camera illuminates the windscreen area with two different wavelengths of infrared light 2 : Two digital infra-red pictures of the windscreen are taken and instantly processed 3 : System detects human skin from its blood and water content 4 : Then it counts faces , eliminating hands and dummies
Using police officers is very costly and accuracy is only 55 - 60 % , due to visibility issues partly from tinted windows or differing skin tones , he says .
And CCTV cameras can mistake a dog for an individual or miss a small person entirely .
" We wanted to be able to spot humans , as opposed to inflatable dolls and mannequins .
We thought ' What is humanness ? '
" We could n't go on skin pigment , but infra-red rays see all skin in the same colour . "
Blood and water is one of the things that determines we are human , he says , so he developed a system that detects human skin .
When a vehicle comes into view the camera installed at the side of the road is triggered by a built - in vehicle detection system .
Green splodge
The camera instantly illuminates the windscreen area with two different wavelengths of infrared light .
Two specialised digital infrared pictures are taken of the windscreen .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Within a fraction of a second , the vehicle occupancy count is determined using on - board electronics .
If the car has more than one occupant , then it does nothing .
" But if it can only find one person in the car , it says ' whoops ' and records the number plates and other information saying ' Here is the driver . ' "
However at this stage the driver retains a right to privacy , so his face is " splodged " in green .
But the time , date and speed are recorded .
The cameras are being tested in Leeds
There are " extraordinary circumstances " that prevent it being 100 % accurate , says Dr Tyrer , but he believes his technology has the potential to eventually enable variable road charging based on occupancy numbers .
And it could spark a significant increase in the number of car - share lanes .
Mistakes
But Paul Watters of the AA says there are doubts about its reliability .
" If approved by the Home Office it needs to be 100 % reliable .
People could be at the receiving end of a hefty penalty so to be falsely prosecuted would be abhorrent .
" At the moment this is new technology being used on moving traffic .
Vehicles are different types and sizes , with different windows and different heat systems .
" This is very radical .
Other countries use manual enforcement . "
Other motoring organisations have raised doubts about the principle of the lanes , saying there is not enough road space .
Sept. 9 , 2008 -- Researchers looking into lung cancers in nonsmokers have found that men seem to die from the disease more than women .
The reasons for this are not clear from the study results .
Researchers led by the American Cancer Society 's Michael Thun , MD , looked at data to try to better understand how lung cancer affects men and women in different cultures and from different time periods .
They pooled information on lung cancer rates and deaths from 13 large groups representing about 2 million people around the world .
Researchers also abstracted data for women from 22 cancer registries and 10 countries in places where few women smoked .
All the participants were self - described nonsmokers .
Here are the main findings :
Men died more from lung cancer than did women in all age and racial groups studied .
Women and men 40 years old and older had similar rates of lung cancer , when the figures were standardized .
African - Americans -- and Asians living in Korea and Japan -- had higher death rates from lung cancer than did people of European extraction .
There were no time trends seen when researchers compared lung cancer rates and death rates among U.S. women ages 40 to 69 during the 1930s to nonsmoking women of today 's population .
Women in East Asia had higher and more variable lung cancer rates than did women in other areas of the world where women do n't smoke very much .
According to the American Cancer Society , in the U.S. 10 % to 15 % of all lung cancer deaths are caused by something other than smoking cigarettes .
The organization also finds that nearly 1.5 million people die from lung cancer every year around the world due to tobacco smoking .
In background information published with the study results , researchers write that tumors in the lungs of people who are not smokers have " different molecular profiles and respond better to targeted therapies " than do tumors in smokers ' lungs .
Researchers call for more study , noting that these findings contradict with earlier research suggesting that the risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women and men has increased and that nonsmoking women get lung cancer more than men do .
The findings appear in September 's issue of PLoS Medicine .
Somehow , a 22 - year - old University of Alaska student named Richard Millay got his hands on a videotape that ’s eluded the media since John McCain asked Sarah Palin to be his running - mate — original footage of her 1984 Miss Alaska Pageant .
Of course , this is all very frivolous and has nothing to do with the current campaign .
But like Barack Obama ’s high school basketball footage , it ’s a little glimpse into the early life of a highly - visible national figure .
In the first part added to YouTube , he posted the portion from the swimsuit competition , prefaced by a brief introduction mentioning the demand for the “ 88 minutes of Alaska Gold . ”
Update :
The original video was removed , but I managed to save a copy of the relevant footage without Richard ’s original intro .
YouTube ’s removing every copy of this video , so I ’m streaming the clip below from my own server .
It wo n’t be removed .
As the future vice - presidential candidate parades on stage , an off - screen announcer reads her early biography : “ Contestant # 8 , Sarah Heath .
Sarah says that she wants to prepare for a career in television broadcasting by majoring in Telecommunications and Political Science .
It ’s no wonder that she has also been recognized by Who ’s Who , since she has displayed her leadership in all areas , from academics to student politics to athletics , having led her basketball team to the championship at the state tournament .
Ladies and gentleman , contestant # 8 , Sarah Heath . ”
I ’ve emailed Richard asking for a brief interview , and will update here if he gets in touch .
( Thanks to Jeff Milner for the original tip this morning . )
October 13 : I spoke to Richard by email , and he told me the tape belongs to his mother , who entered the pageant as Miss Juneau , with Sarah as Miss Wasilla .
He ’s in the process of locating the Q&A segment on another videotape , and will post it if he does .
October 1 : Richard released his second video of the talent portion of the competition .
He wrote , “ I must apologize for the delay of this footage being released , for I have been unnecessarily mired in some copyright issues .
More to come on that later . ”
In the clip , the announcer says , “ Sarah ’s an accomplished flautist who has been performing for ten years .
She will be playing ‘ The Homecoming ’ as written by Hagood Hardy and arranged by Sarah ’s favorite artist , James Galway . ”
October 6 : Richard released the third video , the evening gown competition .
Palin says , “ God has made us this promise — if we will commit our works to Him , we will succeed .
Our lives can be enhanced by applying this and by thinking optimistically .
In Alaska , we have mosquitoes …
We also have the most beautiful mountains in the world .
The choice is ours as to which we ’ll focus on . ”
Claim : Article relates the plight of suffragists who were arrested for picketing the White House in 1917 .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , August 2008 ]
WHY WOMEN SHOULD VOTE WHY WOMEN SHOULD VOTE
This is the story of our Grandmothers and Great - grandmothers ; they lived only 90 years ago .
Remember , it was not until 1920 that women were granted the right to go to the polls and vote .
The women were innocent and defenseless , but they were jailed nonetheless for picketing the White House , carrying signs asking for the vote .
And by the end of the night , they were barely alive .
Forty prison guards wielding clubs and their warden ’s blessing went on a rampage against the 33 women wrongly convicted of ‘ obstructing sidewalk traffic . ’
They beat Lucy Burns , chained her hands to the cell bars above her head and left her hanging for the night , bleeding and gasping for air .
They hurled Dora Lewis into a dark cell , smashed her head against an iron bed and knocked her out cold .
Her cellmate , Alice Cosu , thought Lewis was dead and suffered a heart attack .
Additional affidavits describe the guards grabbing , dragging , beating , choking , slamming , pinching , twisting and kicking the women .
Thus unfolded the ‘ Night of Terror ’ on Nov. 15 , 1917 , when the warden at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia ordered his guards to teach a lesson to the suffragists imprisoned there because they dared to picket Woodrow Wilson ’s White House for the right to vote .
For weeks , the women ’s only water came from an open pail .
Their food — all of it colorless slop — was infested with worms .
When one of the leaders , Alice Paul , embarked on a hunger strike , they tied her to a chair , forced a tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited .
She was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled out to the press .
So , refresh my memory .
Some women wo n’t vote this year because — why , exactly ?
We have carpool duties ?
We have to get to work ?
Our vote does n’t matter ?
It ’s raining ?
Last week , I went to a sparsely attended screening of HBO ’s new movie ‘ Iron Jawed Angels . ’
It is a graphic depiction of the battle these women waged so that I could pull the curtain at the polling booth and have my say .
I am ashamed to say I needed the reminder .
All these years later , voter registration is still my passion .
But the actual act of voting had become less personal for me , more rote .
Frankly , voting often felt more like an obligation than a privilege .
Sometimes it was inconvenient .
My friend Wendy , who is my age and studied women ’s history , saw the HBO movie , too .
When she stopped by my desk to talk about it , she looked angry .
She was **** with herself .
‘ One thought kept coming back to me as I watched that movie , ’ she said .
‘ What would those women think of the way I use , or do n’t use , my right to vote ?
All of us take it for granted now , not just younger women , but those of us who did seek to learn . ’
The right to vote , she said , had become valuable to her ‘ all over again . ’
HBO released the movie on video and DVD .
I wish all history , social studies and government teachers would include the movie in their curriculum I want it shown on Bunco night , too , and anywhere else women gather .
I realize this is n’t our usual idea of socializing , but we are not voting in the numbers that we should be , and I think a little shock therapy is in order .
It is jarring to watch Woodrow Wilson and his cronies try to persuade a psychiatrist to declare Alice Paul insane so that she could be permanently institutionalized .
And it is inspiring to watch the doctor refuse .
Alice Paul was strong , he said , and brave .
That did n’t make her crazy .
The doctor admonished the men : ‘ Courage in women is often mistaken for insanity . ’
Please , if you are so inclined , pass this on to all the women you know .
We need to get out and vote and use this right that was fought so hard for by these very courageous women .
Whether you vote democratic , republican or independent party – remember to vote .
History is being made .
Origins :
The history of women ’s suffrage in the United States is a complex subject that cannot be done justice in a few paragraphs , so for the purposes of validating this item we ’ll merely note that the activists in the forefront of the universal suffrage movement in the early 20th century were — like many of those involved in various civil and labor rights movements over the years — subject to harassment , threats , intimidation , abuse , arrest , and imprisonment ( on minor or trumped - up charges , if necessary ) by those opposed to their cause and / or tactics .
In the spring of 1917 , shortly after Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated for his second term as president and the United States declared war on Germany ( thus officially bringing the U.S. into World War I ) , members of the newly - formed National Woman ’s Party ( NWP ) began picketing outside the White House and the Capitol as part of a campaign to obtain a federal constitutional amendment guaranteeing universal suffrage .
By mid-June , NWP leader Alice Paul had been warned by the chief of police that further demonstrations would lead to arrests :
The threat of arrest added a new element to the picketing campaign .
It was one thing to stand outside for a few hours holding a banner .
It was quite another thing to go to jail for it .
Paul , mindful of her own experiences in English prisons , advised her followers of the possible consequences .
While she hoped that the response would be positive , she knew that each woman had to make up her own mind on the matter …
The threat of arrest added a new element to the picketing campaign .
It was one thing to stand outside for a few hours holding a banner .
It was quite another thing to go to jail for it .
Paul , mindful of her own experiences in English prisons , advised her followers of the possible consequences .
While she hoped that the response would be positive , she knew that each woman had to make up her own mind on the Between June 22 and June 26 , police made twenty - seven arrests .
In all instances , the picketers were charged with obstruction of traffic and released without penalty .
On June 26 , however , the women arrested were bound over for trial the following day .
As the process of arrest , transportation to police headquarters , and release was not enough to deter the determined women , the authorities had no choice but to raise the ante .
On June 27 , six women were tried for obstructing traffic in a public place .
The suffragists were found guilty and fined $ 25.00 .
The judge noted that had they kept moving rather than standing still in front of the White House , they would not have been arrested .
All six women on trial refused to pay the $ 25.00 fine and were sentenced to three days in jail .
They were confined to the District Jail “ in six of the best cells with running water and bath facilities . ”
The sentences , according to the New York Times , were intentionally light because the authorities had heard rumors that the women planned to go on hunger strikes if imprisoned .
“ No one can starve to death in three days , ” observed the Times .
The newspaper also noted , ominously , that police authorities intended to ask for heavier penalties if more arrests were made .
The next series of arrests produced the same penalties .
On July 14 , however , sixteen women were arrested , tried , and sentenced to sixty days in Occoquan Workhouse in suburban Virginia .
Although it ’s difficult to determine at this remove exactly what treatment was afforded to the arrested suffragists during their confinements ( because one side had a vested interest in minimizing such reports and the other in exaggerating them ) , the ordinary conditions at jails , prisons , and workhouses of the era were typically grim :
[ T ]he conditions under which the suffragists were imprisoned were not very different from the conditions that prisoners had to endure as a matter of course … Prison conditions in the District Jail were only bearable , despite reports that the suffragists occupied “ the best cells , each fitted with running water and bath facilities . ”
At Occoquan , conditions were abysmal .
Prison cells were small and dark , with fetid air , and the food was infested [ with mealworms ] .
Moreover , [ the cells ] were infested with a variety of animal life .
Alice Paul recalled that among the women imprisoned with her “ was one whose shrieks nightly filled the jail as the rats entered her cell . ”
The “ Night of Terror ” referenced above took place at Occoquan on 14 November 1917 :
Newly arrested and convicted suffragists had arrived at Occoquan and were in a holding room awaiting further processing .
Without warning , Superintendent Whittaker burst into the room , followed by anywhere from fifteen to forty guards .
Pandemonium broke out .
Whittaker shouted orders to guards to take this prisoner or that prisoner — often identified by name — to the cells .
The scene was one of bedlam , intentionally disorienting .
Suffragists feared for their lives and the lives of their compatriots .
May Nolan , a seventy - three - year - old Floridian with a lame leg that she had to take pains to treat gingerly , was literally dragged off between burly guards , each of whom held an arm , despite her assertions that she would go willingly and despite the pleas of other suffragists to refrain from injuring her leg .
Dorothy Day had her arm twisted behind her back and was purposefully slammed down twice over the back of an iron bench .
Dora Lewis was thrown into a cell with such force that she was knocked unconscious .
For several frantic minutes her companions believed that she was dead .
Alice M. Cosu of New Orleans was also thrown forcefully into her cell .
Cosu suffered a heart attack and repeated and persistent requests for medical attention for the obviously stricken woman went unanswered by the authorities throughout the long night .
Lucy Burns , who had been arrested once again on November 10 , , shortly after completing her previous sixty - day sentence , was identified by Whittaker as the ringleader for the group .
She was manacled to her cell bars , hands above her head , and remained that way until morning .
Later , her clothing was removed and she was left with only a blanket .
Eleanor Brannon later testified : I firmly believe that …
Whittaker had determined to attack us as part of the government ’s plan to suppress picketing …
[ The attack ’s ] perfectly unexpected ferocity stunned us …
Whittaker , in the center of the room , directed the whole attack , inciting the guards to every brutality .

Eleanor Brannon later testified :
By 1918 the NWP ’s emphasis had shifted to lobbying for the remaining votes needed for passage of a federal suffrage amendment to the Constitution .
That amendment was finally approved by Congress on 4 June 1919 and was ratified on 18 August 1920 .

Barack Obama 's support of a government surveillance bill that offers retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies — a bill that he vowed last year to filibuster — has ended his honeymoon with the progressive Netroots .
Netroots jilted by Obama FISA stand
When former Sen. John Edwards dropped out of the presidential race , the progressive Netroots took their affections to Barack Obama , defending him against attack from Hillary Rodham Clinton and others .
But with his support of a government surveillance bill that offers retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies — a bill that he vowed last year to filibuster — the honeymoon has ended .
Advertisement
Disappointed over his position on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the online activists feel jilted and betrayed and have taken to questioning his progressive credentials .
One prominent blogger , Atrios , has even given him the moniker “ Wanker of the Day . ”
“ He broke faith , ” said Matt Stoller , a political consultant and blogger at OpenLeft.com .
“ Obama pledged to filibuster , and he is part of that old politics , in this case , that he said he was n’t .
It will spur us to challenge him . ”
The FISA debate marks the presumptive Democratic nominee ’s first serious break from the liberal Netroots in the general election .
He is still their candidate , but the FISA issue has reignited skepticism among major bloggers , who had largely pushed aside doubts about Obama when Edwards , their favored candidate , ended his bid in February .
Obama ’s post - partisan persona has n’t always meshed so well with the noisy and contentious Netroots , and his rise to prominence has come without their full - throated support .
He told reporters in February that he does n’t read blogs and has long been viewed as cool to the Netroots — a notion that the candidate ’s new media director , Joe Rospars , disputed this week at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York , saying Obama was a favorite of the readers of the major bloggers .
Either way , the Netroots eventually took Obama ’s side against Clinton , and some came to view him as a champion of progressive causes .
His stance on the FISA bill , however , has brought Obama back down to earth , in part because the liberal blogosphere cares more about civil liberties than many of the other traditional issues that have long dominated the Democratic agenda .
While the mainstream media fixated on Obama ’s decision to opt out of the public financing system — and newspaper editorial boards eviscerated him — the Netroots commended Obama for showing political savvy .
After all , the readers of liberal blogs are many of the small donors who gave Obama reason to reject public financing .
FISA , however , was different .
Many of the most popular progressive blogs built their following by mining anger toward President Bush , the Iraq war and what bloggers view as his disregard of the Constitution and the civil liberties guaranteed by it .
By granting immunity to telecom companies , civil courts will likely dismiss lawsuits that might unearth details about the administration ’s activities , eliminating an opportunity to hold Bush accountable .
“ It angers the blogosphere to its core , ” said Jane Hamsher , founder of the popular blog Firedoglake.com .
“ We want to be able to know : What did you do ?
If we can get that information , we can make sure they do n’t do that again .
We can get the public engaged . ”
Obama ’s decision to support the bill with the immunity provision was not surprising , she said .
Republicans frame critics of such security measures as soft on terrorism , and the presumptive Democratic nominee probably does not want it used against him .
“ [ A ] lot of people tried to convince themselves that he was a progressive hero , and I think they were disappointed , ” Hamsher said .
“ You can feel a real shift in the zeitgeist online . ”
Still , the disillusionment goes only so far .
The liberal blogosphere ’s most recognizable name , Markos Moulitsas Zuniga , founder of Daily Kos , said Monday on MSNBC ’s “ Countdown With Keith Olbermann ” : “ Let ’s be honest , it is either Obama or John McCain .
So we really do n’t have much of a choice . ”
At stake for Obama in the FISA vote is the intensity of support for Obama , Moulitsas said .
“ I do n’t want to hear him talk about leadership .
I do n’t want to hear him talk about defending the Constitution .
I want to see him do it , ” he said .
“ If he does , it will increase the intensity and level of support he gets from base Democrats .
If he does n’t , we may worry he is just another one of these spineless Democrats who are more afraid of controversy in doing the right thing than they are in actually doing the right thing . ”
Already , Blue America PAC , a liberal online fundraising group , says it has raised more than $ 320,000 to fund activities “ holding our elected representatives responsible for rubber - stamping the most grievous aspects of the Bush Regime ’s agenda . ”
MoveOn.org has called upon its members to pressure Obama to “ keep his word ” and block the bill .
Obama gave no indication that he would support a filibuster , and a press aide did not respond to requests for clarification on this point .
The Senate overwhelmingly rejected the filibuster attempt Wednesday , voting 80 - 15 to end debate and move to final passage Thursday .
Obama , who was not present for Wednesday 's test vote , is expected to vote for an amendment stripping out the immunity provision .
But even if the effort fails , as it has in the past , Obama would likely back the underlying bill .
By taking this position , Obama is threading the needle between Republican charges that he is weak on security and the desires of the Democratic base .
To allay critics ’ claims that he is giving a pass to the Bush administration , Obama aides pointed to a provision in the bill that requires an inspector general ’s review of the surveillance program .
“ It is not all that I would want , ” Obama said of the legislation , which was negotiated by congressional leaders of both parties .
“ But given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence - collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay .
So I support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that , as president , I will carefully monitor the program , review the report by the inspectors general and work with the Congress to take any additional steps I deem necessary to protect the lives — and the liberty — of the American people . ”
Obama ’s statement was viewed as a reversal from a pledge last year to oppose any bill with retroactive immunity for telecom companies .
But Obama told reporters Wednesday that the bill has changed from when that pledge was made , saying the latest version satisfied several of his concerns .
Dan Gerstein , a New York political consultant who supports Obama and former longtime aide to Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , said Obama now needs to stand by his support of the bill , given Republican efforts to brand Obama as a “ reflexive , partisan liberal . ”
“ This is really an important initial test for Obama , ” he said .
“ People will be looking at this to see whether he has the strength and independence to stand up to his friends and a significant support base and say , ‘ I think this is right , and I am going to hold firm in my position . ’ ”
The Netroots will be watching Thursday as the Senate considers the bill — and whether Obama simply casts his vote or whether he takes a strong stand in a floor speech .
“ The fear out there is that Obama is going to fail to live up to expectations on key issues , and that reinforces the notion that ‘ uh - oh , we picked the wrong candidate , ’ when the focus should really be on the fact that the Bush administration broke the law with the help of private companies , ” said Warren Street , a blogger at the Blue Girl , Red State blog .

off - topic , but seems fitting nonetheless .
day one of early voting in my neck of the woods : JACKSONVILLE , Fla . --- Supervisor of Elections , Jerry Holland , says early voting got off to a frustrating start .
The Optical Scan Readers at some early polling sites were not working correctly .
They were bouncing back ballots , showing an error message .
The ballots that were bounced back were then placed in a locked , emergency ballot box .
Congresswoman Corrine Brown was one of the dozens of voters who had problems Monday .
She said , " I am very concerned the first ballot was n't taken .
And it took them 25 minutes to fix it . "
She worries that some votes will not be counted .
Holland says voters can rest assured .
Ballots placed in the emergency box were re-scanned after the polls closed at 6 pm .
And that scan was open to the public .
The faulty machines will be replaced .
Holland said , " We 're trying to get everything resolved so the next 13 days of early voting goes a lot smoother . "
The Optical Scan Readers are only being used at early voting sites .
They will not be used on election day .

If you visit the site I linked to above , then vote , when you cast your vote scroll down to view all the countries listed .
Obama is currently showing 83 % out of well over 100,000 votes cast from America ( based on IP address ) and you can only vote once ( based on IP address ) .
Now that 's a poll number with a low " margin of error " .
Spread it around , email the link to your friends and family , Dems and Repub the more the better .

Thanks for the link , Mick .
I voted and at this point the poll shows : Barack Obama 87.4 %
John McCain 12.6 % ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Too bad things are getting so ugly .
I think , if the repub leadership has any decency at all , they should repudiate the tone of McCain / Palin 's campaign and make it a priority to stop the hate before these rightwing ignoramuses orchestrate some serious domestic terrorism .

If Cindy Sheehan wears an anti war t shirt she is dragged out of congress .
If Mc cain supporters call for the assasination of a presidential candidate nothing is done to them .
It is time for the Democrats and the Obama campaign to get tough and hire their own security force .... this latest development in Ohio makes it clear : the brownshirts must be stopped .
Those who try to tie up voting lines and prevent legitimate voters from voting should be physically removed from polling places .
we must not settle for casting provisional ballots which will never be counted .

I 've been expecting a Kristalnacht against muslims at any time now .
More news from FL ( Tampa Bay ) area .
As SugarMage reported above , early voting began today .
In Hillsborough County ( the county containing Tampa ) lines were very long at early voting polling places .
They tried to blame this on a much larger than anticipated turnout because of the Obama and H. Clinton rally held at Steinbrenner ( formerly Legend ) Field in Tampa , but later admitted that they had many machine problems .
Hillsborough County uses Premier ( Diebold ) optical scan machines .
These are used now for everything .
They may still use some sort of DRE for persons with disabilities to comply with HAVA , but I am not certain and the Supervisor of Elections has n't updated the website to say what equipment is being used .
He barely got the optical scan machines deployed in time .
His website still describes the equipment they used to use , which was DREs , Sequoia , I think .
According to the the Tampa ABC station , 40,000 people attended the rally .
I do n't know what the seating capacity of Legend Field actually is , but I suspect that it was full .

Well now that it is becoming increasingly obvious that this * election *
IS GOING TO BE STOLEN for the 3rd time in a row .
Again I just want to get some consensus on just WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT ?
We all know there is only ONE thing that can be done that will make any difference .
The question is are 100 Million plus Americans angry enough to do it ?
This is an idea that is better than nothing here .
http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0810/S00190.htm
But IMO it does n't go nearly far enough .
We need to take heed of exactly what Naomi Wolf is saying and TAKE IMMEDIATE AND DEFINITIVE ACTION .
If not then enjoy living in a Fascist Police State until the country completely collapses .
The only way Obama can win is if 100 % of all democrats and a decent percentage of Rethugs and Independents come out an vote for Obama by an overwhelming margin , he would have to be ahead by a solid 15 - 20 % +.

The ONLY reason to sow the seeds of doubt as to the accuracy of exit polls is that when you steal the election , the exit polls provide the irrefutable proof that you have done so .

WOW !!!
REAL
Exit poll results by an avid McCain supporter .
Save this and make it famous : http://americannonsense.com/?p=15898
The Neocon Express just spent a depressing 3 hours conducting an exit poll at a Las Vegas early voting station .
The Location was in a more affluent Western suburb of Las Vegas , on the edge of Summerlin ; More specifically , at the Vons shopping center on Rampart , between Charleston and Sahara .
It was a glorious day in Las Vegas so what better way to spend a few hours than by hanging outside a polling station and randomly sampling voters , right ?
Nevada is a swing state , and the middle to upper middle class suburbs of Las Vegas , like this location , are a crucial indicator of how the state might go .
Early voting started at this location yesterday and the lines have been long and non -stop all day , with people waiting in line an average of 45 minutes to cast their votes .
I randomly interviewed over 150 voters after they cast their ballots .
I stood outside with a clipboard and certainly looked the part of a pollster .
My question went like this : “ Hi , I am conducting a quick , random exit poll ; of course all participants are anonymous .
Was it John McCain or Barack Obama for you ? ”
I could not possibly have talked to everyone who voted during the three hour time frame but I got a very good random sample .
The results were devastating to me .
Let ’s get to the results : Obama : 70 %
McCain : 26 %
Other 4 % If I calculate the number of people who declined to give an answer , than the breakdown went like this : Obama 53 %
McCain 20 %
Other 3 %
Declined to participate : 24 % .
My gut instinct tells me that the vast majority of those who “ declined to participate ” were McCain supporters , but of course , I have no way of knowing that for sure .
snip Anyway , that ’s how I spent three hours of my weekend and as a McCain supporter , it was deeply depressing .
McCain will need to carry rural and Northern Nevada by a wide margin to overcome what will certainly be a devastating lose in Clark County .

That points to one of two possibilities .
Either there is some dynamic content that they really do n't want to update or their web programmer / webmaster / database administrator is woefully incompetent .
I 'm guessing the later .
Unless they are being hit by some really good black hats not just script kiddies , there should be no reason to go static .
And if they are getting hit by pros , it points to either organized crime or a very dangerous individual .
See observation # 2 . # 2 ) And , as one of the first posters mentioned , why is the DHS not getting involved ?
Is attacking a Government website not considered " terrorism " depending on the politics involved ?

HBOS is being taken over cheaply , even compared to what a mortgage bank is worth in this rotten market .
Allegedly , " spivs " conducted a whispering campaign , and used short selling to make money out of misery .
It is nearly true .
If you had known in advance that Northern Rock was doomed , you could have made real money .
But insider dealing would n't have helped you since the " insiders " did n't seem to know what was going on until it was too late .
The Lehman collapse seems to have been partly caused by executives refusing to take a catastrophic write - down in their personal wealth , betting that they were too big to fail .
So inside information here would have been hard to use .
Of course , if you cause the bank to go down , then you have the most perfect of insider information - so how would you do that ?
Short selling is just a bet that the price will decline ; you sell stock you do n't yet own , and hope that when the time comes to deliver , the price will be lower .
Outside the markets it has few friends , although it is a critical component in getting better returns on money for lower risk .
A traditional bet on a horse does not make it run faster , at least in an honest race , but every part of a company 's financial profile interacts with the others .
Hedge funds have made respectable money shorting financial stocks and using the proceeds to go long on energy shares , at lower risk than simply buying shares in oil companies .
The greater risk efficiency of HFs is the reason that on average they have grossly outperformed " long only " traditional fund managers - and as any student of finance will tell you , the only consistent performance is under- performance .
And yes , before you ask , that is where a large chunk pension of funds are invested .
As banks do n't sell beer ...
Every company has a set of credit ratings ; how likely it is to default on its debts in a given range of time .
The longer you lend money , the more exposed you are to a default , and so there is often an extra premium for lending for the longer term than for shorter periods .
The core job of any bank is to do just this .
Banks borrow in the shorter term , sometimes literally overnight , and lend over years .
Without this we could not have mortgages , or finance infrastructure projects where there is no revenue from the investment for as much as ten years .
The greater the difference in time between how long you lend for and borrow , the more money you make , on average .
However , with this greater return comes greater risk , which Northern Rock simply ignored .
When an individual lends money to a bank in a deposit account , they enjoy government guarantees , which commercial lending usually did not , so the NR debacle started when became clear that if you lent money to NR , the chances of getting it back were dropping sharply .
NR was exploiting the short term money markets , and although even the FSA spotted the high risks involved early , it did n't want to annoy them - so the banks ignored it until this hit them in the face .
Short - term markets are of course a bad place to be when you suddenly find yourself without enough cash to pay what you owe in the longer term .
If you happened to have a short position in NR early enough , you did pretty well - but few did .
Still , the idea was clear enough - if a bank is perceived to be on the slide , the next dip in the stock can actually be caused by the most recent downtick .
The next villains in this mess are the ratings agencies .
Their job is guessing the odds of a debtor not paying back debts , whether that is bonds , or payments to suppliers .
This is an eclectic mix of accountancy and PhD - level mathematics , though of course it is mostly done by MSc - level people at ratings agencies , trying to vet the maths of PhDs .
Guess how well that ends ?
The MScs are not only cheaper than PhD Quants , they ask fewer awkward questions .
The agencies are paid by the issuers of debt instruments to give them a rating which is critical to the value when they are sold .
Yes , you read that correctly .
McCaskill : Russia war would mean draft
From the AP :
Sen. Claire McCaskill , D - Mo. , said Palin 's suggestion of war with Russia " sent chills down my spine . "
" I 'm not sure that Gov. Palin understands that right now , if that were to occur , we would have to institute a massive draft , " McCaskill said .
To be fair to Palin , all she was doing was stating the consequence of the NATO treaty , should Georgia be admitted .
But one of the rules of talking about NATO enlargement -- followed by McCain and Obama -- has generally been not explicitly discussing war with Russia , and indeed sometimes insisting to the Russians ( a bit implausibly , perhaps ) that it 's not about them .
UPDATE : RNC communications director Danny Diaz responds , ad feminam : " Claire McCaskill ’s penchant to say absurd and ridiculous things has now reached Bidenesque levels . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Following the passage of the economic bailout bill Friday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said congressional hearings are planned to find the causes of the crisis and to determine " where we go from here . "
" We were dealt a bad hand ; we made the most of it , " Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Friday .
She said Congress will shine a new " light of scrutiny and accountability " on the nation 's financial system to try to prevent a replay of the problems that plunged the nation into an financial crisis .
Reps .
Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , and Henry Waxman , D - California , plan to hold hearings to increase scrutiny of the financial system , Pelosi added .
" We want to take our country in a new direction for the middle class , " Pelosi said .
Frank told reporters Friday that starting in January , Congress will " have a major role . "
" We have to rewrite housing in America . ...
It would be highly irresponsible if we were to stop here , " he said .
" Now we have to perform more serious reform . "
On Friday , the House passed the $ 700 billion measure by 92 votes -- 263 to 171 -- with the plan picking up support on both sides of the aisle after going down to defeat in the House on Monday .

Last Friday , the bill passed the Senate 74 to 25 .
Because tax bills must originate in the House , the Senate attached the rescue plan to a bill that deals with renewable energy tax incentives .
This allowed the Senate to vote before the House to approve a bailout bill .
President Bush later signed the bill Friday afternoon .
Follow the plan with the Bailout Tracker »
" These steps represent decisive action to ease the credit crunch that is now threatening our economy , " Bush said of the provisions of the bill .
Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , reacted to the bill 's passage , saying in a statement : " The legislation is a critical step toward stabilizing our financial markets and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of credit to households and businesses . "
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the bill would meet the varied needs of financial institutions of all sizes .
" Each institution has its own unique benefits , and their collective strength makes our financial system more resilient , and more innovative .
The challenges our institutions face are just as varied -- from holding illiquid mortgage - backed securities , to illiquid whole loans , to raising needed capital , to simply facing a crisis of confidence , " Paulson said in a statement Friday .
Rep . Joe Knollenberg , R- Michigan , said he changed his vote to " yes " Friday when calls to his office changed after Monday 's rejection of the plan in the House .
" A lot of people change their minds [ about the bill ] after seeing heartbreak in the streets , " he said .
At least 21 House members said Friday they had switched positions .
Among the 21 converts was Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. , D - Illinois , said his chief of staff , Kenneth Edmonds .
Senate bailout bill The Senate bill passed Wednesday night included measures that : Allow Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to buy up to $ 700 billion in bad mortgage - related securities and other bad assets .
Allow the Treasury Department to modify mortgage terms to help homeowners avoid foreclosure .
Permit the government to receive equity in companies it helps so taxpayers get a share of any future profits .
Restrict executive pay for companies aided by the program .
Create an independent oversight board to oversee the Treasury Department program .

Edmonds said Jackson was changing his vote because " he received assurances from [ Sen. Barack Obama ] that , if elected , his administration will aggressively use authority in the bill to prevent foreclosures and stabilize the housing market . "
Rep. Howard Coble , R - North Carolina , said he planned to switch his vote because constituents began urging him to do so .
He said the people he represents initially urged him to oppose the plan .
" By having waited , I think we did improve the bill , " he said .
" Inaction is not an option . '
Other Republicans who said they planned to change their votes to support the bill included Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida , Rep. John Sullivan of Oklahoma , Rep. Jim Ramstad of Minnesota , Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona and Rep. Sue Myrick of North Carolina .
Rep. Zach Wamp , R - Tennessee , said he planned to change his vote because " we 're out of choices .
Our backs are up against the wall . "
Besides Jackson , at least 12 Democrats who opposed the bill announced plans to change their vote : Rep. Shelly Berkley of Nevada , Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri , Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland , Rep. Betty Sutton of Ohio , Rep. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii , Rep. Bruce Braley of Iowa , Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky , Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey , Rep. Donna Edwards of Maryland , Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California and Rep. Hilda Solis of California .
Senior House Republicans said Friday they were optimistic .
Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , the House Republican leader , said the Senate improved the bill by adding " sweeteners " and passing it by a wide bipartisan margin Wednesday .

" Is it perfect ?
No .
But it 's clearly better than it was a week ago , " he said .
Rep . Roy Blunt of Missouri , the House minority whip , cited three developments that have affected the bill 's prospects among House Republicans .
First , he said , constituent calls to House Republicans have evened out among those urging their representatives to support the bill and those urging them to oppose it .
In addition , the Securities and Exchange Commission has unveiled plans for new accounting standards .
And the Senate added provisions that please many House Republicans , such as increasing the cap for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
" We 're optimistic as we go to the floor today , " Blunt said .
" We feel good about the direction we 're headed . "
Another factor influencing Republicans , House GOP leaders said , was news that the state governments of California and Florida have reported having trouble accessing credit .
" I am hopeful that there will be bipartisan , majority support for this bill that is critical to stabilizing our nation 's economy for all working Americans , " House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , said in a statement late Thursday .
On Wednesday , Hoyer said he would only bring the bill to the floor if , after talking with Republican leaders , he found " bipartisan majority support " for it .

The modified bailout package included the core measures the House rejected -- a plan that would allow the treasury secretary to buy up to $ 700 billion in bad mortgage - related securities and other bad assets that are undermining credit markets worldwide -- as well as a mix of other measures that previously passed in the Senate .

The bailout plan's new provisions made $ 250 billion immediately available to purchase bank assets , leaving $ 100 billion at the president 's discretion and $ 350 billion subject to congressional review .
The bill also includes a " mental - health parity " provision , which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness at parity with physical illness .

Why we need this
The legislation being hammered out in our imperial capital to bail out financial institutions contains a decidedly dictatorial twist .
Section 8 relates to review of the Secretary of the Treasury 's decisions .
It reads as follows :
“ Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . ”
( See http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/09/20/treasurys-financial-bailout-proposal-to-congress/ for the full text )
Bottom line , there is no review of the Secretary 's decisions .
This essentially makes him the USA 's financial dictator .
Read the whole proposal .
The Secretary may issue regulations , enter into contracts , disperse funds , and designate financial agents of the government at his discretion , not subject to review !
This delegation of legislative power to the executive branch is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution , and violates the principle of the separation of powers .
This kind of rule by decree may fly in Chavez 's Venezuela , but it is n't acceptable here .
One is reminded of the warnings of the Founders .
James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 47 :
‘‘ The accumulation of all powers , legislative , executive ,
and judiciary , in the same hands , whether of one , a few , or many , and
whether hereditary , self - appointed , or elective , may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny . ''
Thomas Paine 's observation about government :
“ … against this species of despotism , proceeding on through an endless labyrinth of office till the source of it is scarcely perceptible , there is no mode of redress .
It strengthens itself by assuming the appearance of duty , and tyrannizes under the pretence of obeying . ”
The process of turning the USA into a neo - fascist country is nearly complete .
The only thing that separates us from out and out fascism is fact that we elect our dictator .
The office of the Presidency may have a parade of different occupants , but this does n't keep us free if they wield dictatorial powers .
This is the culmination of a process begun in the Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
It was then that the idea of federal regulation of the economy began to be implemented .
From that era also came the Federal Reserve System , creating a banking cartel .
Despite the so - called deregulation of recent years the financial industry remains highly regulated .
The mess we 're in is a direct result of this intervention .
Thank you , progressives , for giving us the regulatory state .
Not quite working out the way you thought it would , is it ?
The only way out is to implement a system of free banking and private money .
We should begin with abolishing the Federal Reserve and repealing the legal tender laws .
Then we can repeal the income tax and abolish the IRS .
This is an oversimplification that would have to be thoughtfully implemented , but this truly free market approach is the only way to put the economy back on a sound footing .
While it will hurt , we must let the correction run its course .
Then we 'll have our fundamentals in place ( hear that Sen. McCain ? ) and the economy will recover .
So , no more fascist bail outs !
If Judah ’s letter in the Gateway did n’t expose the intolerance of non-theistic beliefs at the University of Alberta , perhaps this will :
This is not a joke , this is a serious hate crime .
I have contacted Campus Security and have sent a press release to the local media outlets .
The University of Alberta Atheists and Agnostics were targeted by hate - fuelled vandalism over the weekend of September 19 - 22 when their large banner was defaced .
The banner has been hanging in the Central Academic Building of the University of Alberta since the start of the school year and was meant to encourage non-religious students to be willing to come out and join the freethinking group on campus .
The banner featured a large , scarlet A , symbolic of the Out Campaign , which encourages atheists to come out of hiding .
It also features the phrase “ Speak Out ” , emboldening students to know that atheism is an acceptable worldview .
The vandals wrote “ Jesus Christ is coming back ” in large bold letters , as well as a large cross in the middle of the A .
They also added a heart to the top of the A .
The banner was hand - made by several of the exec members of the club last year , and is made from canvas to make it reusable .
It is unknown yet what the damage was done with , and whether it is removable the or not .
If the damage can be undone the banner will continue to fly .
The materials for the banner cost around $ 70 .
Campus security has been made aware of the crime .
President Ian Bushfield will continue to advocate for the non-religious and remains firm that the intolerance shown by some delinquents will not dissuade him from continuing his group .
Way to show your respect , tolerance and intelligence students .

by One Pissed Off Liberal
I find myself , on some level , torn between my highly strained faith in American democracy and a perception that it no longer exists .
I applaud and encourage political activism and cherish the activists that I know , but for all their heroism , commitment and hard work , I see us sliding steadily backwards .
This has been my observation for the past 40 years .
We progressives have faced unremitting defeat at the hands of the ultra - conservative “ ˜system ’ , which clearly serves our super - wealthy overlords “ “ not us .
One Pissed Off Liberal ’s diary :: ::
Only over the past 8 years has it become so shockingly obvious just how blatant is the case against the existence of American democracy .
It came to a head , in my view , with “ Impeachment is off the table . ”
That betrayal was the ultimate selling out of the American people “ “ and this at the hands of the democratic leadership .
That has to shake one ’s faith .
Pelosi has made it clear , the American people and the values they hold ( such as justice and government of , by and for the people ) no longer matter .
It is a mistake to underestimate the damage that has been done over the past 8 years .
I ’ve heard many people state that our long national nightmare is approaching an end .
I believe it unwise to think so .
The Bush years have left us in a weakened condition and facing a monstrous confluence of catastrophes that will not go away when Bush does .
Chief among these is an intractable and corrupted government intent on the repression and exploitation of American citizens “ “ which does not lend itself to real solutions to our very real problems .
We are headed in exactly the wrong direction .
China ’s All - Seeing Eye
With the help of U.S. defense contractors , China is building the prototype for a high - tech police state .
It is ready for export .
The end goal is to use the latest people - tracking technology — thoughtfully supplied by American giants like IBM , Honeywell and General Electric — to create an airtight consumer cocoon : a place where Visa cards , Adidas sneakers , China Mobile cellphones , McDonald ’s Happy Meals , Tsingtao beer and UPS delivery ( to name just a few of the official sponsors of the Beijing Olympics ) can be enjoyed under the unblinking eye of the state , without the threat of democracy breaking out .
Remember how we ’ve always been told that free markets and free people go hand in hand ?
That was a lie .
It turns out that the most efficient delivery system for capitalism is actually a communist - style police state , fortressed with American “ homeland security ” technologies , pumped up with “ war on terror ” rhetoric .
And the global corporations currently earning superprofits from this social experiment are unlikely to be content if the lucrative new market remains confined to cities such as Shenzhen .
Like everything else assembled in China with American parts , Police State 2.0 is ready for export to a neighborhood near you .
Will a President Obama and a solid democratic majority make a difference ?
Yes “ “ but do n’t be surprised if it is far less difference that you may be expecting .
The “ ˜system ’ that they will be in charge of will remain essentially unchanged .
My guess is that they will treat us pretty much just as Pelosi has ( and just as Obama has with FISA ) “ “ with a velvet “ ˜fuck you ’ delivered with a huge disingenuous smile , just like she did at Netroots Nation .
It was sad to see all the lemmings lapping it up .
Too sad for words .
It ’s enough to make you wonder if another world is even possible .
Naomi Klein : From Think Tanks to Battle Tanks , “ The Quest to Impose a Single World Market Has Casualties Now in the Millions ”
“ ˜Is Another World Possible ? ’
That was the theme of this year ’s annual meeting of the American Sociological Association that was held in New York City this past weekend .
“ We did not lose the battles of ideas .
We were not outsmarted and we were not out - argued , ” journalist and author Naomi Klein said .
“ We lost because we were crushed .
Sometimes we were crushed by army tanks , and sometimes we were crushed by think tanks .
And by think tanks I mean the people who are paid to think by the makers of tanks . ”
As we think about reaching this other possible world , I want to be very clear that I do n’t believe the problem is a lack of ideas .
I think we ’re swimming in ideas : universal healthcare ; living wages ; cooperatives ; participatory democracy ; public services that are accountable to the people who use them ; food , medicine and shelter as a human right .
These are n’t new ideas .
They ’re enshrined in the UN Charter .
And I think most of us still believe in them .
I do n’t think our problem is money , lack of resources to act on these basic ideas .
Now , at the risk of being accused of economic populism , I would just point out that in this city , the employees of Goldman Sachs received more than $ 16 billion in Christmas bonuses last year , and ExxonMobil earned $ 40 billion in annual profits , a world record .
It seems to me that there ’s clearly enough money sloshing around to pay for our modest dreams .
And unlike Jeffrey Sachs , I actually do n’t believe that what is lacking is political will at the highest levels , cooperation between world leaders .
I do n’t think that if we could just present our elites with the right graphs and PowerPoint presentations ” ” no offense ” ” that we would finally convince them to make poverty history .
I do n’t believe that .
That ’s because elites do n’t make justice because we ask them to nicely and appealingly .
They do it when the alternative to justice is worse .
And that is what happened all those years ago when the income gap began to close .
That was the motivation behind the New Deal and the Marshall Plan .
[ emphasis my own ]
The real problem , I want to argue today , is confidence , our confidence , the confidence of people who gather at events like this under the banner of building another world , a kinder more sustainable world .
I think we lack the strength of our convictions , the guts to back up our ideas with enough muscle to scare our elites .
We are missing movement power .
That ’s what we ’re missing .
“ The best lacked all convictions , ” Yeats wrote , “ while the worst are full of passionate intensity . ”
Think about it .
Do you want to tackle climate change as much as Dick Cheney wants Kazakhstan ’s oil ?
Do you ?
Do you want universal healthcare as much as Paris Hilton wants to be the next new face of Estee Lauder ?
If not , why not ?
What is wrong with us ?
Where is our passionate intensity ?
“ What is wrong with us ?
Where is our passionate intensity ? ” ~ Naomi Klein
“ The best lacked all convictions , while the worst are full of passionate intensity . ” ~ Yeats
Where and when will we ever find the courage to resist repression ?
What will it take to make the American people stand up for themselves ?
Or is it living in the past to hold out hope for liberty and justice for all “ “ right here in the birthplace of American democracy ?
“ We are missing movement power . ” ~ Naomi Klein
How is it that we have failed to coalesce our collective outrage into an effective movement ?
I think that we have failed not by a lot but only by a little “ “ and I think the consolidation / corruption of the MSM has accounted for the margin of failure .
When a free press honestly covers marches and protests , it grows a movement “ “ just as we saw during the war in Vietnam .
Conversely , minimizing or withholding coverage of same can stunt a movement ’s growth “ “ and that ’s what we have seen in the Bush years .
Disappearing Antiwar Protests
Media shrug off mass movement against war
9/27/05
Hundreds of thousands of Americans around the country protested the Iraq War on the weekend of September 24 - 25 , with the largest demonstration bringing between 100,000 and 300,000 to Washington , D.C. on Saturday .
But if you relied on television for your news , you ’d hardly know the protests happened at all .
According to the Nexis news database , the only mention on the network newscasts that Saturday came on the NBC Nightly News , where the massive march received all of 87 words .
( ABC World News Tonight transcripts were not available for September 24 , possibly due to pre-emption by college football . )
Cable coverage was n’t much better .
CNN , for example , made only passing references to the weekend protests .
FAIR “ “ Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting
The MSM tactics were the same for our 9/15/07 protest in DC “ “ and every other protest that has occurred during the Bush regime .
We must make the extra effort required to overcome the dampening effects of a dishonest mass media intent on quashing our righteous dissent .
We need everyone to be prepared to hit the streets “ “ or stand up in public for the American dream of liberty and justice for all .
If it were only about liberty and justice , that would be one thing , but this is about the fate of humankind .
‘ Shocking ’ Truths
The star of the anti-globalization movement [ Naomi Klein ] returns with a new book that explains Bush ’s real agenda
What are the most profound changes the U.S. faces in the next twenty years ?
If we just draw all these lines into the future , we can see more disasters , more inequality .
We could have a fully privatized response to climate change , with a small group of people buying their way out for a couple of generations .
Our world could look more like Baghdad — a green zone guarded by Blackwater and everything provided by Halliburton and then just a raging red zone outside .
What will be the lasting effect of the Bush administration ?
People have n’t fully grasped the revolutionary nature of the Bush years .
They are leaving a hollow shell to their successors .
It ’s like what happens in Third World governments , where the reformers take over the presidential palace , only to realize that the power lies elsewhere .
That ’s what ’s going to happen to whoever comes in after the Bush administration .
They will find out how much power resides in this parallel contractor economy .
The state wo n’t have the ability to just cancel those contracts
The state does n’t even have the ability to oversee those contracts .
This is one of their clever tricks — they privatize the war on terror and then say everything about this war is classified , so we do n’t even know what we have contracted out .
Maybe you catch glimpses of it — the Abu Ghraib scandal breaks , and we find that some of the key people are contractors .
We caught another glimpse of it when it became clear that the State Department ca n’t function without Blackwater .
NAOMI KLEIN interview in Rolling Stone
America has been stolen from us “ “ and this is NOT a figure of speech .
If we do n’t take it back , our “ ˜leadership ’ will continue to ignore the very real catastrophes that we face “ “ and we will all lose .
Everything .
We will all lose .
Everything .
How Do We Go from Empire to Earth Community ?
The day of reckoning for our reckless human ways that many of us have for decades warned would be coming is here .
We are all well aware of the crisis unfolding around us .
The day of reckoning for our reckless human ways that many of us have for decades warned would be coming is here .
The future is now .
Peak oil , climate chaos , financial collapse , and spreading social disintegration are all consequences of deep cultural and institutional dysfunction .
The imperative to address them presents us with an epic test of our human intelligence and creativity .
[ emphasis my own ]
When I was a student in business school my professors always told us .
Go for the Big Picture .
If you find a problem , do n’t just treat the symptoms .
Look up stream to find and deal with the cause .
Although we face a daunting variety of problems , the big picture of the human confrontation with the reality of our Mother Earth becomes crystal clear once we step back and take a look upstream .
This big picture has three critical elements .
The first element is environmental collapse driven by our relentless growth in consumption and population .
From the perspective of our Earth Mother our human excesses have for millennia been little more than the normal nuisance one expects from children .
Somewhere around 1970 we passed a threshold .
Our human consumption became more than a nuisance , it began to exceed what our Mother could bear and began to threaten her very life .
We see the results in climate chaos , depletion of fresh water and fertile soils , the collapse of fisheries , the erosion of denuded forest lands and melting ice caps .
We are building up toxics in the water , soil , and air .
We are killing our mother and thereby ourselves .
We must grow up fast and accept our adult responsibilities .
The implications are pretty straight forward .
Alternet
“ The implications are pretty straight forward . ”
Yes they are .
We must get our priorities straight and we must do so in a mighty hurry .
We must stand up every time we have the chance , for everything that is right and against oppression and injustice .
Speak out , rise up – do not sit silently as injustices bloom all around you .
“ There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice , but there must never be a time when we fail to protest . ”
Elie Wiesel
We need every citizen to stand up like Ray McGovern did .
Ray McGovern Owns Rumsfeld
But confrontation can be so rude .
Yes “ “ but some things ( like liberty and the fate of our species ) are more important than good manners .
It ’s not the people who sat politely that history will remember ( your manners were impeccable ) .
Good manners are for those capable of reciprocating , not for those who wipe their feet on you .
There is finally a place for rudeness .
I ’ve heard many a good progressive put down Code Pink because they offend their sense of decorum .
But people , this is serious .
This is no time to be quiet and respectful .
This is the time to sound the alarm .
Code Pink are noisy , rude and clownish “ “ but they get peoples ’ attention .
And Code Pink will be remembered in history far kinder than will be all those who sat quietly and politely ” “ or those who disapproved of protest , as democracy was displaced by authoritarianism .
Make no mistake , this comes down to the citizens .
We have no leaders .
We are alone .
And if we do n’t stand up and turn it around , we ’ll lose it all .
Our avenues for recourse have become extremely limited , but we can always choose to stand up .
Am I suggesting violence ?
No , not at all – I am advocating peaceful civil disobedience .
Even less than that , I am asking that we stop taking no for an answer and stop accepting lies for truth “ “ and to stop kissing ass when we should be kicking it ( metaphorically speaking ) .
It ’s time we all stand up for what we believe and take every opportunity to speak truth to power “ “ unlike the shameful debacle we witnessed at Netroots Nation .
The disgraceful Pelosi ass - kissing festival I witnessed at Netroots Nation alarmed me “ “ and alarms me still .
If kissing the ass of power is what the netroots have come to “ “ it has come to naught .
It is time to stand up for America “ “ not sit down or rollover .
It is time to demand justice and a return to representative democracy that honors the will of the American people .
It ’s time to demand transparency and sanity in our government and leaders who wo n’t lead us into war .
It is time to wise up and rise up “ “ or kiss it all goodbye .

When we were just 3 people trying to get Wufoo launched on a limited budget and timeframe , we felt that it was necessary for us to work 7 days a week and expect 80 + hours out of each member on the team .
Obviously , a grueling schedule like that can’t last forever and now that we ’re a 6 man operation that ’s expanded outside of the passion of the founders , it ’s been necessary for us to find a balance between productivity and happiness .
The following is what we ’ve learned after spending some time experimenting with your typical 5 day workweeks and the much hyped 4 day workweeks .
The Problems with 5 Day Workweeks
A 5 day workweek is pretty standard in corporate America and it ’s what we started with first .
Each day basically consisted of 8 hours of non-structured programming and product development .
One thing we noticed right away was just how many highly counterproductive interruptions occur at seemingly random times throughout the day .
Interruptions ranged from important topics like company strategy and budget allocation to “ inefficient ” topics like interesting blog posts , hypothetical questions about potential products , and talking about politics or fantasy football .
We were always able to accomplish a satisfactory amount of work during a 5 day workweek , but we definitely did n’t feel like we got the most bang for our buck .
This is because while we were happy with our output , the 2 day weekends did n’t seem to recharge our batteries .
After stretching ourselves to crank out code around those interruptions for 5 days straight , we ended up feeling like a weekend just was n’t enough of a respite to keep the work from feeling like your typical grind .
The Problems with 4 Day Workweeks
Because we were excited about the prospects of longer weekends and more efficiency , we thought that the much hyped 4 day workweek would be our saving grace .
The 4 day workweek that we tried out operates under the assumption that you can accomplish just as much in an efficient 4 day workweek as you would in a typically inefficient 5 day workweek .
Basically , because you know there ’s only 4 days to get things done , you optimize your time to make those 4 days count .
The extra buffer of a 3 day weekend also helps you to hit the ground running on the next cycle .
Unfortunately , there were two major problems we ran into when we tried it .
The first was that a 4 day workweek just was n’t as productive as a 5 day workweek .
It was n’t because of efficiency .
We did become more efficient with our time , but 3.5 days of productivity during a 4 day workweek is still less than 4 days of productivity in an inefficient 5 day workweek .
The reason it ’s 3.5 instead of 4 is because you can never really eliminate every distraction , meeting and task that comes up in your typical business setting .
The other problem was that a 4 day workweek consisting of only programming and the critical meetings needed to get things done left something missing from our company ’s culture .
Even though discussions about the newest programming toys , the hypothetical strategies , and the fantasy football smack talk may not be efficient , we operate a lot like a think tank .
Some of our best ideas have spawned from shooting the shit , and even if our wandering thoughts did n’t always lead to something measurably productive , they have been crucial to us innovating and bonding as a group , which we think ultimately leads to increased morale and even productivity .
Our Solution - The 4 1/2 Day Workweek
While the 4 and 5 day workweeks were n’t perfect for us , they did give us some important clues as to what we wanted in our ideal workweek .
Our recipe for the optimal workweek called for 4 solid days of product development , 3 days of mental rest , and plenty of time to discuss whatever may be on our wandering minds , whether it be work related or completely random .
And what we came up with is the following schedule :
Monday - Thursday
Mondays through Thursdays are dedicated to product development and only product development .
There are no exceptions .
We aim to accomplish as much in these four days as we would have in the traditional 5 day week , and since every one of us has to work hard to meet our goals , what ends up happening is that if something comes up that is n’t on our weekly list of items to accomplish or is controversial in nature , it must wait .
If you want to argue about why X feature is absolutely necessary , or debate whether or not Safari or Firefox is the better browser , or kick around ideas for the company trip , it has to wait till Friday .
Sometimes a person can accomplish their goals by working 6 hours a day , and sometimes it can take 10 or more hours a day .
That ’s up to them .
And while it can get pretty intense around here and easily leave you wiped out come Thursday night , it ’s all good because you know there are 3 days of mental rest right around the corner .
1/2 of Friday
Fridays are for resting the analytical parts of our brains , discussing business topics , and engaging in the activities that we find are crucial to the overall health of our company — like bonding and customer appreciation .
Our typical Fridays start at about 2:00 PM , which gives everyone time to sleep in , relax a bit and if they want , get some additional work done .
Then we ’ll meet up at a team member ’s home ( we rotate every week ) to accomplish most , if not all of the following activities :
Bonding -
We ’re passionate about what we do , and since we ’re 6 people with 6 different personalities , that passion can easily lead to arguments .
We ’ve never shied away from a heated debate and have always encouraged lively discussions , but we ’ve always kept it from getting personal .
At the end of the day , we all have to get along and work together and so any lingering tensions must be addressed and ironed out during this period .
In order to make sure nobody takes things too seriously , we use Fridays to bring us closer together by watching movies , going out to dinner , talking about our personal goals , discussing the newest technologies , and just having a good time .
Discussing Company Business Face to Face - Since 93 % of communication may not be verbal , we find meeting face to face a worthwhile exercise when dealing with business matters and decisions .
This will include what we ’ve accomplished for the week , budgeting , overall health of the company , new features , and other specifics to the company that need to be discussed on a regular basis .
Thanking our Customers -
There are only two immovable rules we have for every employee in our company .
Everyone does customer support and everyone must take time to thank the people that pays their paycheck .
After discussing business , we ’ll pop in a classic movie like Point Break and take a couple hours to write our customers hand - written thank you cards to show them how much we appreciate them .
We ’re able to accomplish about 10 cards per person , and even though this small gesture may not make a measurable impact on the bottom line , we believe it definitely adds value to our corporate culture by reminding everyone of our place and purpose in the long run .
Meeting People -
As a business begins to grow , it ’s only natural that people from other businesses are going to want to meet you .
Sometimes they just want to meet other local entrepreneurs , and other times they want to talk about business development related items like product integration .
Driving , eating , and talking require a good chunk of time , and since this time would interfere with our 4 day productivity goals , we ’ve designated Fridays as the day we meet with people and representatives from other companies .
Give Back -
We actually just started kicking around this idea , but we ’re hoping to also use our Fridays to give back to the community that hosts our startup .
Whether it be Habitat for Humanity or a local food drive , we think good corporate citizenship is an important part of running a happy business .
We also think that it ’ll be great at boosting morale and fostering additional bonding .
Conclusion
Now that our work is broken up into the two distinct areas : product development and “ other stuff ” , we think we have a pretty good framework that helps us decide when to focus on what .
We ’ve been able to meet our productivity goals , enjoy the benefits of a 3 day weekend , and still make time for the tedious and inefficient parts of our business .
Of course , this structure works well for us because we love what we do and also who we work with .
It ’s natural for us .
I do n’t think you can force every company into this schedule because it ’ll end up being a lame “ Fun Friday . ”
You probably wo n’t end up with an open dialogue and sometimes people would rather just work than spend time pretending to get along with their co-workers .
I ’m not entirely sure how this will play out as we continue to grow and scale our company , but it ’s definitely clear that a company works best when it ’s employees are genuinely focused , well rested , and enjoying life .
The creation of safe and legible road signs is an art , but the 10 traffic guideposts below demonstrate not all sign makers are Michelangelo .
Whether because of confusing symbols , contradictory instructions or an excess of information , these signs obfuscate more than help the driver .
Most of these signs are the creation of local and state governments that seem to lack the time or sophistication to make clear ones .
Although these are the 10 most confusing traffic signs we could find , feel free to add photos and descriptions of awful signs you 've found in your own travels .

Editor ’s note :
The following is adapted from Understanding the U.S. - Iran Crisis : A Primer .
With George W. Bush ’s administration in its last year in office , the danger of a U.S. military attack on Iran still looms as a dangerous possibility .
Widespread official government , military , and analytical sources , including the collective assessment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies , have debunked the various pretexts being asserted to justify such an attack .
But the continuing , ideologically driven extremism in the White House means that the danger of a reckless , unilateral military attack remains , and such an attack could happen despite the consequences .
This book is designed to address some of those fears , answer some of those questions , and propose some ideas to prevent those looming disaster .
Is Iran a threat to the United States ?
The Bush administration has claimed , almost since coming into office , that Iran is a “ threat ” to the U.S. Even U.S. intelligence agencies agree that Iran does n’t possess nuclear weapons or a nuclear weapons program , and that it is very unclear whether Iran even wants to build such a weapon .
Iran has never threatened the United States .
( And unlike many countries in its neighborhood , Iran has not invaded another country in over a century . )
In 2007 , according to the CIA , Iran spent about $ 5.1 billion on its military  about 2.5 percent of its GDP .
The U.S. , on the other hand , spent $ 626 billion on the military that same year , amounting to 4.5 percent of its GDP of $ 13.7 trillion .
More relevant , perhaps , the U.S. spent almost half of the total of global arms spending  about 46 percent .
So Iran does not represent a strategic military threat to the United States or to Americans .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s political opposition to Israel has never been in doubt , but still his statements were distorted .
Outrage erupted across the U.S. and Europe in October 2005 following the claim that Ahmadinejad had threatened to “ wipe Israel off the map . ”
But as it turned out , Ahmadinejad had not said those words at all .
“ Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to wipe Israel off the map , because no such idiom exists , ” Juan Cole , a Middle East expert at the University of Michigan , told the New York Times .
“ He did say he hoped its regime , i.e. , a Jewish - Zionist state occupying Jerusalem , would collapse . ”
Cole went on to note that since Iran has not “ attacked another country aggressively for over a century , I smell the whiff of war propaganda . ”
In April 2006 Bush repeated “ we ’ve agreed on the goal , and that is the Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon , the capacity to make a nuclear weapon , or the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon . ”
The significance of that language lay in the uncontested reality that Iran already had , indeed has had for many years , “ the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon . ”
Not only because much of that knowledge is available on the Internet , but because the basic technology needed to enrich uranium for nuclear power is the same as that required for nuclear weapons .
Of course it is easier to carry out the 3 - 5 percent enrichment needed for nuclear power than the 90 - plus percent enrichment necessary to produce weapons - grade uranium .
But the technology is the same .
Once you have the knowledge to build and run the centrifuges to enrich uranium , you just need time and money and practice to enrich enough for a bomb .
You also do need missile technology , but like many countries around the world , Iran already had that , too .
Bush ’s bar for bombing Iran could hardly get any lower .
Does Iran have nuclear weapons or a nuclear weapons program ?
No .
Iran does not and has never had a nuclear weapon  and no one , not even the Bush administration , claims it has .
Despite claims by the Bush administration and others , there is also no evidence Iran has a military program to build nuclear weapons .
And even the Bush administration ’s own intelligence agencies acknowledged in the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate that the weapons program they claim once existed had been ended by 2003 .
What about Iran ’s support for terrorism ?
Since the 1979 over throw of the U.S. - backed shah of Iran , the accusation of Iran being a “ state supporter of terrorism ” has been a hallmark of U.S. policy .
The State Department ’s 2007 Country Reports on Terrorism states that “ Iran remains a threat to regional stability and U.S. interests in the Middle East because of its continued support for violent groups , such as Hamas and Hezbollah , and its efforts to undercut the democratic process in Lebanon , where it seeks to build Iran ’s and Hezbollah ’s influence to the detriment of other Lebanese communities . ”
There is no evidence and little detail provided , beyond the broad claim that Iran is providing “ extensive funding , training , and weapons ” to those groups .
The report does not acknowledge that both the most important “ Palestinian group with leadership in Syria , ” Hamas , and Hezbollah in Lebanon are important political parties that have been democratically elected to majority and near - majority positions in their respective parliaments .
Both , while certainly maintaining military wings , also provide important networks of social services , from clinics and hospitals to schools , daycare centers , food assistance , and financial aid to the impoverished , disempowered , and ( in the case of Hamas in Gaza ) imprisoned populations of Lebanese and Palestinians .
Some of the actions carried out by the military wings of Hamas and Hezbollah have in fact targeted civilians in violation of international law , and thus might qualify as “ terrorist ” actions .
But the majority of their actions have been aimed at illegal Israeli military occupations : of south Lebanon in the case of Hezbollah , and of Gaza and the West Bank in the case of Hamas .
The notion that Iran ’s support for these elected organizations , if it exists , somehow puts Iran at the top of the list of states supporting terrorism , let alone gives the U.S. the right to attack , has no legitimacy .
The State Department report goes on to condemn Iran for remaining “ unwilling to bring to justice senior al - Qaeda ( AQ ) members it has detained , and has refused to publicly identify those senior members in its custody .
Iran has repeatedly resisted numerous calls to transfer custody of its AQ detainees to their countries of origin or third countries for interrogation or trial . ”
Given more than six years of the Bush administration ’s own “ unwillingness to bring to justice senior al - Qaeda members it detained in 2003 ” and even earlier in Guantánamo , and the U.S. ’ “ refusal to identify publicly these senior members in its custody ” and its continued resistance to “ numerous calls to transfer custody of its al - Qaeda detainees to their countries of origin or to third countries for interrogation and / or trial , ” the hypocrisy of claiming this as evidence of support for terrorism is astonishing .
What false claims has the Bush administration made about Iran ?
On the nuclear weapons issue , it is false to claim that Iran is violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty by enriching uranium for its nuclear power plants .
The NPT ( Article IV ) allows every country that signs on as a non-nuclear weapons state , including Iran , the inalienable right “ to develop research , production , and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination . ”
Further , the treaty actually encourages its signatories to spread the development of nuclear power , and states explicitly that all its signatories “ have the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment , materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ” ( emphasis added ) .
So much for Iran breaking the law through knowledge .
The NPT ’s enforcement agency , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , has consistently reported that it has no evidence of Iran diverting nuclear materials or programs to military purposes .
While the IAEA has been concerned about insufficient transparency in some of Iran ’s reports , that does not constitute a violation of the NPT .
( Iran has rejected the Security Council ’s demand that it halt all nuclear enrichment activities ; those resolutions themselves stand in contradiction to the guaranteed right to produce nuclear power that is central to the Non-Proliferation Treaty . )
It is false to claim that Iran is responsible for the deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq .
There is no question that Iranians  businesspeople , diplomats , aid workers , others  are operating in Iraq ; they share a long border and a longer history .
But there has been no direct evidence  only assertions  presented to back up the claim that the Iranian government has provided Iraqi militias with “ explosively formed penetrators ” ( EFPs ) or any other weapons .
Another set of false claims concern President Ahmadinejad .
Certainly much of his rhetoric , clearly designed to bolster his populist domestic base , has been inflammatory and offensive  particularly his questioning of the reality of the Nazi Holocaust .
( He has also become well known for his remark at Columbia University denying that there are homosexuals in Iran  although this appeared to be a one - off reference , not part of his ordinary discourse , it is still horrifyingly homophobic , as well as preposterous . )
But instead of criticizing the real outrages , U.S. political and media figures have made exaggerated and false claims to rebut and created straw men to knock down .
What could Iran do in response to a U.S. military strike ?
A wide range of possibilities would be open to Iran .
While U.S. officials might call a military attack “ only a surgical strike , ” Iran would certainly call it an act of war  which would indeed be an accurate term .
Iran could send troops across its borders to attack U.S. troops in Iraq or shoot missiles into occupied Baghdad ’s U.S. - controlled Green Zone .
Iranian troops could invade and occupy southern Iraq .
Iran could attack U.S. troop concentrations in Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , or elsewhere in the region , or go after U.S. ships in Bahrain , home of the Navy ’s Fifth Fleet .
It could attack Israel .
It could retaliate against U.S. or allied oil tankers in nearby shipping lanes , and even sink a tanker .
It could close the Strait of Hormuz , through which 45 percent of the world ’s oil passes .
The impact on the world economic system would be swift and devastating .
In conventional terms , Iran ’s military is no match for the U.S. Iran has faced years of military sanctions , and its military strategy is focused primarily on training troops to defend the homeland against invasion and foreign military occupation .
Where does oil fit into the U.S. policy toward Iran ?
Oil has always been central to U.S. relations with Iran , despite the U.S. ban on purchasing Iranian oil since 1979 .
For a global power such as the U.S. , the issue is not so much direct access to Iran ’s oil  the U.S. does n’t need to import that much Iranian or indeed Middle Eastern oil in general for its own use .
Far more important is maintaining control of Iran ’s and other countries ’ oil supplies : the ability to determine price and to guarantee access to oil to favored friends and deny it to competitors .
The crusade to gain control of strategic resources , especially oil , remains a hallmark of the so - called global war on terror , the Bush administration ’s banner covering its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , attacks on Somalia , and expansion of military bases across the Middle East .
Do U.S. sanctions against Iran work ?
What are the costs ?
Sanctions and isolation of Iran were Washington ’s strategy throughout the 1990s .
Although the U.S. sanctions against Iran were not nearly as extreme as those the U.S. imposed on Iraq in the name of the United Nations , the Iranian people still have paid a steep price .
Much of Iran ’s infrastructure  particularly its oil infrastructure and civilian airlines  was created during the shah ’s regime , so most spare parts required are of U.S. make and thus unavailable under the sanctions .
In June 2005 , a report prepared for the International Civil Air Aviation Organization “ warmed that U.S. sanctions against Iran were placing civilian lives in danger by denying Iranian aviation necessary spare parts and aircraft repair . ”
Six months later , a U.S. - made military transport plane crashed , killing 108 people .
When imposed by the biggest economy in the world , “ unilateral ” sanctions invariably take a multilateral toll , since other countries and financial institutions are eager to stay on Washington ’s good side .
Even so - called smart sanctions , designed only to target those tied directly to Iran ’s nuclear industry , end up affecting large numbers of people .
Designating Iran ’s entire Revolutionary Guard Crops as a “ terrorist entity , ” as the Bush administration did in late 2007 , imposes sanctions on tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of Iranians whose family members have ties to that huge bureaucracy within Iran ’s official military .
Oil sanctions diminish Iran ’s ability to rebuild and improve its seriously eroded oil - refining capacity , thus reducing the amount of gasoline and other oil - based products available for domestic use .
And , ironically , the sanctions themselves cause more Iranians to believe that their country needs nuclear power , despite its massive oil reserves , because of the sanctions - drive shortages of refined oil - based fuels .
What could  and should  U.S. relations with Iran look like ?
Any serious effort to minimize tensions and normalize relations between the United States and Iran must recognize that negotiations and diplomacy , not sanctions , military threats , or military attacks , must be the basis of the U.S. posture toward Iran .
The United States should also recognize that the United Nations , through the International Atomic Energy Agency ( not the Security Council ) , should be the central actor in orchestrating international negotiations with Iran .
The United States should agree to be bound by international legal prohibitions as well as the global consensus against any military strike against Iran .
Any negotiations between the United States and Iran must recognize what Iran actually wants : a security guarantee ( guaranteeing no invasion , no attack on nuclear facilities , and no efforts at “ regime change ” ) , recognition of Iran ’s role as an indigenous regional power , and reaffirmation of Iran ’s rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Once those rights are internationally affirmed , it will be up to Iran itself to determine whether and with whom they will negotiate on how those rights are to be implemented .
The consequences of the United States having severed all diplomatic ties with Iran since 1979 should be recognized , and Washington should move urgently to reestablish full diplomatic relations with Tehran .
What can we , the people , do to prevent a U.S. war on Iran ?
We must increase the political cost for any politician or policy - maker even considering or threatening the use of a military strike against Iran .
Active mobilization against an attack on Iran is crucial .
Certainly such mobilization will be challenging , but we must confront and overcome the skepticism about the value of antiwar protest that has been created by years of Washington ’s rejection of the demands of the even larger and longer - standing movement opposing the Iraq war .
The strong majority agreement across the United States , and the near unanimity in the rest of the world , that the Iraq war has been a disaster for Iraq , for the U.S. , for the region , and for the world means that there is even less support for launching another , equally or even more disastrous war in Iran .
There is still time .
We have a powerful movement experienced in mobilizing , and we have seven years of success in changing public opinion .
We can do it again .
We must .

UNITED NATIONS , Sept 23 ( Reuters ) -
The global financial crisis endangers efforts to reduce world poverty and demands a new approach with less “ uncritical faith in the ‘ magic ’ of markets , ” U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Tuesday .
The financial turmoil roiling world markets put at risk the achievement of the U.N. - agreed Millennium Development Goals set in 2000 to halve global poverty by 2015 , Ban said in his opening address at the United Nations General Assembly .
“ The global financial crisis endangers all our work -- financing for development , social spending in rich nations and poor , the Millennium Development Goals , ” he told world leaders gathered in New York for the annual meeting .
Speaking shortly before U.S. President George W. Bush was due to address the assembly , Ban said it was time for global leadership and collaboration rather than confrontation .
“ We need a new understanding on business ethics and governance , with more compassion and less uncritical faith in the ‘ magic ’ of markets , ” Ban said , calling for collective action and global leadership .
A deepening credit crisis , the collapse of major financial institutions , mergers of others and a U.S. government bailout of three financial giants , led the Bush administration last week to propose an unprecedented $ 700 billion bailout plan .
Initial exuberance about the plan to buy up toxic mortgage debt has given way to concerns about how the U.S. government would fund it and whether the package would be enough to boost the world ’s biggest economy , which is at risk of recession .
Worries about delays as the Bush administration and Congress haggle over details of the package reversed initial market gains last week when the bailout was announced .
“ We need to restore order to the international financial markets , ” Ban said .
“ We must think about how the world economic system should evolve to more fully reflect the changing realities of our time . ”
“ We face a global financial crisis .
A global energy crisis .
A global food crisis , ” Ban said .

0:36 Intro .
Volt is a plug - in electric car .
Have to charge $ 100,000 for an enormous battery or have to compromise severely on the range .
General Motors ( GM ) aims for sweet spot : car drives 40 miles , plugs in at night ; after 40 miles it has an onboard generator that charges while it's on the road .
Gasoline used to charge the battery .
Most days drivers drive under 40 miles .
Talking about 50 miles per gallon .
Tough to do or someone would have done it already .
Big problem with electric cars has always been the battery .
Originally 1/3 of cars were electric , 1/3 steam , 1/3 internal combustion .
Now lithium ion batteries .
GM want to get this car into showrooms by late 2010 .
Ambitious to try to do it 2 years from now .
All started in 2005 , GM hemorrhaging money , terrible reputation on environment , fiasco EV1 .
5:06 Common idea : that car producers could create an electric car but because it would hurt their gas powered cars they have destroyed their creativity and ideas .
Back in 1988 GM 's engineers entered an international electrical car challenge and won with Sun Racer .
Decided to build an electric car ; regulators in California mandated that carmakers had to make electric cars .
GM produced the EV1 but its range was 70 - 80 miles , never more than 110 ; takes 8 - 10 hours to charge .
GM loses their shirt every time they make one .
Practically a hand - made car , but no market for them .
Leased the cars , experimental program , 5000 - 6000 of them .
Killed the program .
At that point gasoline was pretty inexpensive , as well .
Public relations fiasco .
Spokesman said we 're not destroying the car only to have the car being destroyed , making them look like liars .
Within GM they are very proud of the EV1 ; told by lawyers they had to destroy them if they did n't have an ongoing program .
Technological marvel .
No good deed goes unpunished .
Killed their hybrid program .
In 1998 Toyota launches inside Japan without fanfare a little internal combustion car that recaptures energy and recharges its battery , used to extend its gas mileage .
In 2000 they quietly bring it to the U.S. , and starts become viable .
Third generation it starts becoming a hit -- the Prius .
Toyota lost money on it at first , but has deeper pockets than GM .
GM looks at it but can't see a way to make money and kills their hybrid program , walking away from the program just as it becomes viable .
Their technology could have kept pace with Toyota .
People in the company are kind of desperate .
Do focus groups , people like their cars better if you take the name - tag off .
Decide they have to do something bold .
Churchill : Americans always do the right thing once they 've exhausted every other option .
14:12 Early 2006 they put a team together .
Bob Lutz , famous marketing executive , worked at all the big three , spent time in Europe , retired from auto business a few years ago , became chairman of Exide , a car battery maker .
Golf carts are electric cars ; cart - like cars .
When you turn an electric car on you get full torque right away , smooth , clean , quiet .
Dependence on gasoline is seen as the bottleneck in making the car industry grow .
Lutz goes back to GM after Exide , decides he wants an electric car .
Company keeps saying no ; invested in fuel cell program .
Takes hydrogen , catalyst to power the car .
A fuel cell car is just an electric car .
In 2005 , small startup company called Tesla announces its going into production with an all electric roadster , two - person car , superfast , lithium ion battery .
Old batteries were too big and too heavy .
Lutz lost it in meeting .
Calls in his guys and says " I want an electric car . "
EV1 had too small range , 60 - 70 miles .
Engineers hook up Kawasaki motorcycle engine , put in trailer , hook up to generator and hook that up to the EV1 , which can be driven around the test track all day .
Zero-emission car ; even an electric car has emissions ; mandate distorted the market .
In 2006 , remember experiment , idea for onboard recharger , hybrid .
Call it the I - Car , like I - pod .
Repackaging .
Plug - in with 10 mile range , decide that 's not enough ; have to do a car that will go so far on the battery that a lot of drivers wo n't even perceive it as a gasoline car .
Decide to go for a 40 mile range .
Very complicated software , 20 - mile battery would have been much easier to do .
Detroit Auto Show : Announced the Chevy Volt at convention , expect it to succeed as a public relations venture .
Few concept cars ever get to the showroom , science projects .
Volt looked like that ; reaction astonishing .
GM wins both North American car and truck of the year ; attention on the Volt .
Now they have to build the car by 2010 .
Say they are still on time .
25:26 Apparent transparency of GM .
How honest were they with you ?
In article , very honest .
Series of discussions over time , iconic company , in 2005 in such deep trouble .
Technological challenge is the least of what they are doing .
In order to make this car , GM has had to shred the rule book .
Did this with the Saturn .
From the beginning they have liked to take big gambles , only rarely pulled on off .
Using the Volt as a way to increase their risk - taking metabolism .
Risks are enormous .
Have to train dealers across the country to service this car , etc. , what do you do about people who do n't have a garage to park in ?
Keep it quiet is the usual strategy .
First make battery , full of software , if one cell does n't work you compromise the whole thing ; normally start with the battery , but with the Volt they are building the whole car .
Also , throwing the doors open , going public ; this time going to show the world what we are doing so world will at least understand they are doing everything they can .
Usually battery lab is top secret , this time gangs of reporters .
Production version does n't look like a sports car , inappropriate for every day driving car .
Pulled the sheet off the car without having to ask .
In commercials have revealed the front corner , grill .
Got to be extremely aerodynamic to squeeze everything out of the battery .
A lot of people think they will fail ; if so they will fail in full public view .
Talked with engineers , who were honest about the challenges .
In their interest to explain the challenges .
Price point is very ambitious , could do car if you sell it for $ 50,000 ; initially were going to sell it for $ 30,000 , now maybe $ 40,000 ; will lose money .
Financial gamble : if the car is a hit , financially it is a strain .
Car for one - car family .
Branded it Chevy , brand for the masses .
Worldwide .
If they sell a lot they lose a lot of money ; betting that cost curve on production and the battery will come down fast enough and that gas prices stay high .
35:52 Size of resource commitment : how many engineers , is project growing ?
Yes , could n't get precise numbers , ropes in resources from all over GM including pre-Volt research .
Half a billion to a billion dollars .
Miracle of capitalism that a single automobile ever gets built .
Mind - boggling to get everything to the end of the assembly line .
Moved to the execution phase , drive something around on a track .
Development vehicle :
Take shell of existing car , Chevy Malibu , and put the new systems in it .
Prototypes , tooling up factories ; will be built in same plant from Michael Moore 's movie , " Roger & Me . "
38:50 Saturn , similar amount of hoopla .
Attempt to change the corporate structure at GM .
Did not affect GM the way it was intended to .
Story is really about the organizational hurdle of changing a corporate culture and commercial hurdle of breaking through with a new product in a market that may not be ready when you may be financially weak .
More a business risk than a technology risk .
GM does have a pattern of getting behind and trying these Hail Mary technology passes .
Roger Smith : massive plant modernization program , robots , money went down the drain .
Toyota was slogging ahead of incremental improvements , no big gambles .
Saturn : in 1970s when gas prices spiked , GM discovered it could n't build a good small car .
Went into a joint venture with Toyota and launched the Saturn .
Whole new car to be designed in record time , 3 years ; whole new dealer network , no more haggling ; they were going to take what they learned from that and spread it around GM .
When the cars came out they succeeded , waiting lists by 1992 , 1993 , good ads , good cars .
Then GM dropped the ball .
Follow - through lacking .
Cars were successful in terms of numbers sold but struggled to break even .
Let program languish , let the cars get boring and mediocre , let it die on its feet .
Only now getting its act together again .
You can make the Volt , but you have to stick with it past the first few years when it 's losing money .
Took Toyota almost a decade with the Prius .
Have to be patient , hard for GM .
GM knows it .
By doing it openly , GM is making the price of failure too high .
Cheladafest 2008
Mindful of the warning shown at the left , a group of elite beer - lovers decided to challenge themselves to try something a little different .
From all around Europe they came , gathering to ' Drink a Red One ' - Bud Light Chelada .
The beer itself was conveyed by courier at great personal expense from its birthplace in the wilds of the United States to Finland , whence it made its way to Copenhagen in time for the 14 September 2008 fest .
So , what is this pinkish beverage ?
Bud Light Chelada , at 4.2 % ABV , and its slightly heftier cousin Budweiser Chelada , weighing in at 5 % alcohol , are the twisted brainwrong brainchild of Anheuser - Busch and Cadbury Schweppes .
The drink is best served after gently being rolled in the hand to ensure mixing of the ingredients : clam juice , tomato juice , Bud Light , and a touch of salt and lime juice .
Further description is available on the Ratebeer Web site .
If you wish to see higher - quality images of the chelada - drinking experience as chronicled on this page , simply click on the image desired .
A photo of you enjoying Bud Light Chelada could be a useful accompaniment to your letter of thanks to the creators of the drink , or your local pub might want a copy to hang on their beer fridge .
The culprits enjoy their first sip of many ...
' To your good health ...'
Contemplation ' Among the best 10,000 beers I 've ever had !'
-- Papsoe ' One look at the can and you know that this beer is the real thing --
Budweiser and Bud Light mixed with authentic Clamato . '
-- Ana Vitrano , product manager , Anheuser - Busch , Inc .
When sampling a new brew , one should always stop to appreciate the look and aroma .
All beers are different .
There 's De Molen Cuvée , and then there 's Bud Light Chelada ...
As these beer connoisseurs know , ' this is a savory beer that will appeal to adult beer drinkers , particularly those who enjoy beer mixed with Clamato , ' in Ana Vitrano 's words .
Some people 's sips were tentative at first ...
but pretty soon almost everyone was gulping the beer down .
At the end of Cheladafest 2008 , some in attendance smiled wistfully .
They knew that it might be a long time before they get to have this beer again .
An example is shown on the left .
In this publicity shot , one visitor hopes to conclude his chelada experience by listening to the fading sounds of the beer .
Perhaps the receding sounds of frolicking on a beach near Mexico - the land that gave birth to the chelada - when , several decades ago , people began mixing beer with hot sauce or salsa ?
Or just the sound of a satisfied sigh after a tasty drink ?
At the same time , however , there are those ( see right ) who might claim that Bud Light Chelada actually sounds more like the screams of all of the souls that have become trapped inside the can of death .
Some of these killjoys have weighed in on the Ratebeer page linked to above and are even immortalised in the form of my anagram on this page .
Indeed , the conclusion of those without true vision can best be summarised thus :

UCLA study finds that searching the Internet increases brain function
UCLA scientists have found that for computer - savvy middle - aged and older adults , searching the Internet triggers key centers in the brain that control decision - making and complex reasoning .
The findings demonstrate that Web search activity may help stimulate and possibly improve brain function .
The study , the first of its kind to assess the impact of Internet searching on brain performance , is currently in press at the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and will appear in an upcoming issue .
" The study results are encouraging , that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle - aged and older adults , " said principal investigator Dr. Gary Small , a professor at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA who holds UCLA 's Parlow - Solomon Chair on Aging .
" Internet searching engages complicated brain activity , which may help exercise and improve brain function . "
As the brain ages , a number of structural and functional changes occur , including atrophy , reductions in cell activity , and increases in deposits of amyloid plaques and tau tangles , which can impact cognitive function .
Small noted that pursuing activities that keep the mind engaged may help preserve brain health and cognitive ability .
Traditionally , these include games such as crossword puzzles , but with the advent of technology , scientists are beginning to assess the influence of computer use — including the Internet .
Additional details on the study and further research on the impact of computer technologies on the aging brain are highlighted in Small 's new book , " iBrain : Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind , " published today .
For the study , the UCLA team worked with 24 neurologically normal research volunteers between the ages of 55 and 76 .
Half of the study participants had experience searching the Internet , while the other half had no experience .
Age , educational level and gender were similar between the two groups .
Study participants performed Web searches and book - reading tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scans , which recorded the subtle brain - circuitry changes experienced during these activities .
This type of scan tracks the intensity of cell responses in the brain by measuring the level of cerebral blood flow during cognitive tasks .
All study participants showed significant brain activity during the book - reading task , demonstrating use of the regions controlling language , reading , memory and visual abilities , which are located in the temporal , parietal , occipital and other areas of the brain .
Internet searches revealed a major difference between the two groups .
While all participants demonstrated the same brain activity that was seen during the book - reading task , the Web - savvy group also registered activity in the frontal , temporal and cingulate areas of the brain , which control decision - making and complex reasoning .
" Our most striking finding was that Internet searching appears to engage a greater extent of neural circuitry that is not activated during reading — but only in those with prior Internet experience , " said Small , who is also the director of UCLA 's Memory and Aging Research Center .
In fact , researchers found that during Web searching , volunteers with prior experience registered a twofold increase in brain activation when compared with those with little Internet experience .
The tiniest measurable unit of brain activity registered by the fMRI is called a voxel .
Scientists discovered that during Internet searching , those with prior experience sparked 21,782 voxels , compared with only 8,646 voxels for those with less experience .
Compared with simple reading , the Internet 's wealth of choices requires that people make decisions about what to click on in order to pursue more information , an activity that engages important cognitive circuits in the brain .
" A simple , everyday task like searching the Web appears to enhance brain circuitry in older adults , demonstrating that our brains are sensitive and can continue to learn as we grow older , " Small said .
Small added that the minimal brain activation found in the less experienced Internet group may be due to participants not quite grasping the strategies needed to successfully engage in an Internet search , which is common while learning a new activity .
" With more time on the Internet , they may demonstrate the same brain activation patterns as the more experienced group , " he said .
Researchers noted that additional studies will address both the positive and negative influences of these emerging technologies on the aging brain .
Richard Garriott , the world 's first American second - generation astronaut , performs a fit check in a Russian Soyuz TMA - 13 spacecraft for his planned Oct. 12 , 2008 launch to the International Space Station .
Former NASAastronaut Owen Garriott is proud of his son Richard and with good reason .
Afterall , it ’s not every day a child follows his father ’s footsteps allthe way to space .
Richard Garriott , a computer game developer from Austin , Texas , is just days away from rocketinginto space aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to become the world ’ ssixth space tourist .
He will be the first American second - generationastronaut to reach space once he blasts off from the Central Asian spaceport of Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Oct. 12 .
“ I ’mjust very pleased that he has made , for himself , this opportunity , ” said Owen Garriott , 77 , of his son in an interview .
“ He ’s been sopersonally interested in the opportunities of spaceflight , that I ’m justextremely pleased that he has managed to find this channel . ”
RichardGarriott , 47 , is paying about $ 30 million , which he ’s said is the bulk ofhis wealth , to launch into orbit under a deal between Russia ’s FederalSpace Agency and the U.S. firm Space Adventures .
The Vienna , Va. - based SpaceAdventures has brokered orbital spaceflights for five space tourists since2001 .
For theyounger Garriott , reaching space has been a lifelong dream though he admitsthat it does feel more real now that he has his custom - built Russian Sokolspacesuit for launch .
“ Anyday that you get to put on your own spacesuit is a great day , ” theyounger Garriott told SPACE.com .
“ It definitely has that new carsmell … or that new spacesuit one . ”
Set tolaunch spaceward with Garriott on Sunday are twoprofessional astronauts : Expedition 18 commander Michael Fincke of NASA andflight engineer Yury Lonchakov of Russia ’s Federal Space Agency .
Theywill replace the station ’s current core crew - Expedition 17 commanderSergei Volkov and flight engineer Oleg Kononenko - who are due to return homewith Garriott on Oct. 23 after six months in space .
Bycoincidence , Volkov is also a second - generation cosmonaut .
His father is famed Russiancosmonaut Alexander Volkov , a veteran of long - duration spaceflights to the Salyut 7 and Mir space stations .
“ I ’mlooking forward to getting a little more time to talk with Sergei , ” Garriott said .
“ Obviously , I ’ll have plenty more time to talk tohim on orbit . ”
Likefather , like son … in space
Spaceflightwas an everyday phenomenon for the younger Garriott , who remembers his fatherbringing tools and equipment to their Houston home from NASA ’s JohnsonSpace Center while training for his two spaceflights .
OwenGarriott joined NASA ’s spaceflyer ranks as one of the agency ’ sfirst scientist - astronauts in 1965 .
He spent 59 in space during NASA’sSkylab 3 mission to the American space station in 1973 , then another 10 days aspart of the shuttle Columbia ’s STS - 9 crew in 1983 .
“ Whenyou ’re growing up in the middle of it , it seems quite normal , ” saidthe younger Garriott , adding that all of his Houston neighbors where eitherastronauts or NASA engineers and scientists .
“ Everyone I knew was eithergoing to space or getting involved in getting those others into space . ”
But theyounger Garriott ’s own dream of reaching space was dashed by an eye examthat found his eyesight too poor to qualify for NASA ’s astronaut corps .
“ Ithought everyone was going to space and so being told I was n’t going tobe a part of this great group of people and just have this opportunitywas n’t something I was going to take lightly , ” he said , adding thatit spurred him to invest in Space Adventures and other private space companies .
“ Literally , throughout my entire career I ’ve been investing in theprivatization of space . ”
Garriottdeveloped the popular Ultima online computer game and co-founded the Origins Systemscomputer game company with his brother Robert , as well as the North Americanbranch of the online game developer NCsoft .
" Tabula Rasa , " hislatest release , is an online science fiction game chronicling humanity 's exodusfrom Earth after a major catastrophe .
He ’staking medallions made from the remains of Skylab , which fell to Earth in 1979 , artwork and a so - called “ immortality drive ” - a flash drive archiveof mankind 's greatest achievements , copies of the avatars in one of his gamesand digital versions of the DNA from some computer gamers , including that of comedianStephen Colbert , host of " The Colbert Report . ”
Heavy onscience
While Garriott expects to enjoy his orbital flight , he also expects to work .
The privatespaceflyer has packed his 10 - day mission to the brim with science experiments , Earth observations and education events to make the most of his time in space .
He has a series of experiments on tap for commercial partners Seiko and DHL , NASA , the European Space Agency , as well as protein growth experiments for thefirm ExtremoZyme , a company founded by his father .
Oneexperiment is aimed at measuring visual acuity to see the effects of hiscorrective Photorefractive Keratectomy eye surgery in microgravity , which NASArecently approved for use by astronauts , though none have had the procedure todate .
Garriottalso plans to record weightless exercises as part of a so - called SpaceSportalization effort with former NFL player Ken Harvey to promote fitness inyouth .
Other educational efforts include events with the space education - themedChallenger Center in the U.S. and a student experiment competition with by the British National Space Center .
His Earthobservation schedule includes snapping photos of areas previous observed by hisfather from Skylab in 1973 to measure environmental and climate change usingthe “ Windows on Earth ” software to find his targets .
“ Idefinitely do n’t need anymore ! ” Garriott said with a laugh .
“ Ifanything , I ’m overbooked . ”
If all goesas planned , he ’ll even hold off on sending letters or photos home duringthe trip to squeeze in more science .
“ Whenyou only have 10 days in space , taking an hour or two to organize data and sendit down when its going to come down with you anyway does n’t make muchsense , ” Garriott said , adding that he ’ll record his feelings on adigital voice recorder instead .
He ’ll also talk to students on Earth viaham radio much like how his father called him from Skylab when he was young .
Meanwhile , the Russian - built Soyuz rocket that will launch Garriott and his Expedition 18 crewmates into space is due to roll out today to the historic same launch padthat lofted cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on the first - ever human spaceflight fromBaikonur Cosmodrome in 1961 .
SpaceAdventures ’ next space touristCharles Simonyi - who is paying $ 35 million for his second privatespaceflight - has said he plans to be on hand to see Garriott off .
OwenGarriott is also at the Baikonur Cosmodrome to watch his son launch into space , and will follow the mission from the Federal Space Agency ’s MissionControl Center outside Moscow as the flight ’s chief scientist .
“ Ifyou ’ve asked anyone who ’s flown what was the most enjoyable part , they ’ll tell you to a person it was looking out the window , ” theolder Garriott said , adding that seeing the Earth from space with one ’sown eyes is indescribable .
“ That ’s one of Richard ’s mainexperiments in flight , Earth photography … I envy him the opportunity ofspending some hours looking out the window . ”
TheExpedition 18 crew is set to launch into space on Sunday , Oct. 12 at 3:01 a.m.EDT ( 0701 GMT ) .
NASA will broadcast the launch live via NASA TV .

( CNN ) -- Barack Obama and John McCain had planned on spending Thursday sequestered from the campaign trail preparing for the first presidential debate Friday night , but uncertainty surrounding the economic bailout plan has cut short both men's study sessions .
After proposing a possible postponement of Friday 's debate , John McCain decided he would appear .
Instead of preparing for the debate , both candidates returned to Washington to participate in talks over a $ 700 billion rescue plan for the nation 's financial system .
Before returning to Washington , Obama had been hunkered down in Florida earlier this week for a " debate camp , " the traditional preparation that includes a sparring partner playing the role of his opponent .
Aides to Obama tell CNN that man is Greg Craig , a former State Department official in the Clinton administration who has long advised the Illinois senator on foreign policy issues .
A senior Obama aide tells CNN the Illinois senator is still preparing for the debate as planned , albeit in a shortened time frame and from a different location .
Sequestered at Clearwater 's Belleview Biltmore , a resort opened in 1897 that 's flanked by tennis courts and a golf course , Obama and his senior aides were feverishly reviewing years of debate footage featuring McCain .
Some of the footage goes back decades to the Arizona Republican 's earlier campaigns and speeches on the Senate floor .
A senior Obama aide said it 's been part of an extensive effort to get a fuller picture of which issues McCain is comfortable addressing and which have shown a tendency to trip him up .
Aides have also looked for general tendencies : what direction McCain 's answers to questions take and what subjects he sometimes ties together .
The ultimate objective , aides to Obama said , has been to walk through every answer and eliminate any potential surprises Friday night , when tens of millions of Americans are expected to watch the two candidates square off for the first time .
" More debates are lost than won , so candidates usually want to play debates very conservatively , hoping to avoid the ' big mistake , ' " says Alex Castellanos , a senior adviser to the 2004 Bush - Cheney re-election campaign .
What to expect from upcoming debates »
McCain 's debate prep appeared to be much more off - the - cuff .
McCain advisers tell CNN he spent several hours Sunday at his campaign headquarters working with aides , and did the same in a Pennsylvania hotel Monday afternoon .
McCain had planned on clearing his entire Friday schedule for final preparations , though the Arizona senator spent the majority of the morning on Capitol Hill and did n't head back to his Arlington , Virginia , home until closer to midday .
Soon after , he formally confirmed he would attend the debate and departed for Mississippi early in the afternoon .
Top McCain aide Mark Salter said Friday the Arizona senator had spent two hours prepping in his home Thursday night .
Podiums were set up , and aides playing the debate moderator asked several different questions .
Kiki McLean , a Democratic strategist and the national spokeswoman for then - vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman in 2000 , says a break from day - to - day campaigning is essential to preparing for a debate .
" The most important thing about debate prep is giving a candidate time off the road , so they can have time to think , " she says .
" When you are literally on all day , often 18 hours straight , there is no time for intellectual engagement which is necessary to prepare . "
Contrary to traditional practice , no particular person was slotted to play the role of Obama during mock debate sessions , McCain aides tell CNN .
Currently , senior advisers Mark Salter and Charlie Black are peppering the Arizona senator with questions they think the moderator could possibly ask , without an " Obama " figure in the mix -- although aides say that scenario may change by week 's end .
Aides to McCain and Obama also say both men were actively working to shore up their weaknesses during this week 's debate preparations -- such as the tendency both candidates have to give meandering answers that grow too verbose for a debate format that enforces strict two - minute time limits .
" Both of these candidates have to streamline their thoughts , " CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger says .
" They both serve in the United States Senate , which is not known for brevity . "
All About John McCain • Barack Obama
You do n’t hear their hearts actually start to break until he says , “ Troopergate is going to come out in her favor . ”
Although the most traumatic part , surely , must have been the exchange about how the mayor of Wasilla ’s experience compares favorably to Barack Obama’s .
Hey , that ’s not in the script .
Pessimism meter reading : 9.85 6.1 and dropping like a stone .
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
The genetics of " jungle rot " may hold the key to more economical biofuel in the near future .
Ethanol , the most common biofuel , is primarily made from grains , sugarcane and other crops .
But it can also be made from cellulose — a chain - like molecule found in stems , bark and other plant parts .
To break down cellulose into fermentable sugars , however , requires special enzymes , called cellulases , which are expensive to produce .
The biofuel industry has primarily obtained cellulase from the fungi Trichoderma reesei , which became infamous during World War II as jungle rot .
The green mold ( molds are a type of fungus ) devoured military tents and uniforms in the South Pacific .
" T. reesei is currently the champion microorganism for commercial cellulase production , " said Michael Himmel of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo .
To help reduce the cost of cellulase , an international group of scientists organized by the Department of Energy 's Joint Genome Institute ( JGI ) in Walnut Creek , Calif. , has now sequenced the DNA of one strain of T. reesei from the Solomon Islands .
The hope is that this genetic information could allow the engineering of fungi or bacteria that can produce enzymes more efficiently than the current approach .
Break it down
Although biofuel has lately taken a bad rap due to links to rising food prices and possible environmental damage , this largely concerns ethanol derived from corn grain and other non-cellulosic sources , which have readily fermentable sugars .
Cellulosic ethanol has less of an impact on food prices because it is made from non -food crops , such as switch grass , or waste products , such as cornstalks .
Moreover , studies have shown that ethanol from these inedible plant materials has a lower carbon footprint than corn - based ethanol .
Despite these facts , most ethanol in the United States continues to be made from corn grain , partly because cellulose is very hard to break down .
A better biofuel
Only certain organisms , such as bacteria in termite guts and fungi such as T. reesei , are able to degrade cellulose for energy , and extracting enzymes from these organisms has been expensive .
In 2001 , the enzymes for making one gallon of ethanol cost more than $ 5 , regardless of how they were derived .
Since then , biotechnology research has reduced this to less than 20 cents , but even greater price reductions are needed to make biofuels more economical for consumers .
" The overall conversion process must be made less costly , " said Himmel , who was not part of the current study .
" Research aimed at improving the performance of fungal and bacterial cellulases is critical if these processes are to be robust . "
To this end , the JGI researchers sequenced the 34 million base pairs in the T. reesei genome .
The group was surprised to find that the fungus had a smaller number of enzyme - producing genes than other related fungi .
" We were aware of T. reesei ’s reputation as a producer of massive quantities of degrading enzymes ; however , we were surprised by how few enzyme types it produces , which suggested to us that its protein secretion system is exceptionally efficient , " said lead author Diego Martinez from JGI .
The way its enzyme - producing genes were clustered together may also explain why T. reesei is able to degrade plant material so quickly , the authors wrote in a recent issue of Nature Biotechnology .
This new gene map will presumably give biotech companies the means for " tinkering with the genetics to make T. reesei produce more — or a better profile of — enzymes , " Martinez told LiveScience .
George Will sums up McCain :
Under the pressure of the financial crisis , one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high .
It is not Barack Obama .
Channeling his inner Queen of Hearts , John McCain furiously , and apparently without even looking around at facts , said Chris Cox , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , should be decapitated .
Satan worshippers kill and eat four Russian teenagers after stabbing each of them 666 times
Vile :
An upside - down cross marks the spot where the four Russian teenagers were ritualistically slaughtered
A gang of Satan worshippers murdered four teenagers by stabbing each of them 666 times , police believe .
The number of wounds is the same as that revered by followers of the devil .
The three girls and one boy , all described as Goths and aged 16 and 17 , were allegedly forced to drink alcohol by the gang before they were attacked .
The killers then allegedly lit a bonfire under a tree near their cottage in Russia 's Yaroslavl region , 300 miles north - east of Moscow , where they cooked and ate their victims ' body parts .
The remains of Anya Gorokhova , Olga Pukhova , Varya Kuzmina and Andrei Sorokin , who went missing from their homes in June , were discovered last month .
The body of a small rodent crucified on an upside - down cross was also found .
After arresting eight people in connection with the murders , police realised all four victims had made phone calls to the flat of alleged gang leader Nikolai Ogolobyak , a former church choir boy .
Officers discovered the victims ' body parts in a pit 250 m from Ogolobyak 's apartment block .
Arrested : Alleged leader Nikolai Ogolobyak ( l ) and Satanist Alexander Voronovic ( c ) ; Anya Gorokhova ( r ) , one of the gang 's four victims
One of those arrested is alleged to have told police : ' Satan will help me to avoid responsibility , I made lots of sacrifices to him . '
Another , Alexander Voronovic , claimed the gang had previously dug up a grave and eaten the heart of the girl buried there .
One of the gang , when asked what made him do it , is claimed to have said : ' I tried to turn to God , but it did n't bring me any money .
' I prayed to Satan , and things improved . '
Victims : Olga Pukhova ( l ) , Varya Kuzmina ( c ) and Andrei Sorokin ( r )
Teachers of the accused told detectives that most had been moody at school and were of lower than average intelligence .
All the dead knew Ogolobyak and other members of the gang .
Andrei's father said last night : ' My son said he had Goths and Satanists among his friends .
' I was n't scared .
I thought , " Well , let him spend his time sitting around in a cemetery , there 's not much harm in that is there ? " '
Oil drilling bills are hot in Congress but passage unlikely Drilling takes center stage on Capitol Hill
Ideas galore , but an energy bill seems unlikely to make it out alive

Oil drilling bills are hot in Congress but passage unlikely 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
WASHINGTON — Drill , drill , drill .
Suddenly , oil and gas exploration is all the rage on Capitol Hill .
With energy prices a red - hot political issue , the Democratic - controlled Congress , in the midst of its final , three - week legislative sprint before the presidential elections , can't get enough of drilling bills .
Not that most Capitol Hill watchers seriously believe that — in the absence of a major supply disruption — any substantive energy legislation will actually emerge from this frenzy and become law .
" You do n't pass energy bills in the heat of the campaign season , " noted Frank Maisano , an energy specialist with Bracewell & Giuliani .
Still , there should be plenty of action .
Today , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , is expected to unveil an energy package that would open new areas offshore to oil and gas drilling , with plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote as early as this week .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , has declared next week " Energy Week " in the Senate , with votes on a series of drilling amendments possible .
Drilling gains traction
Republicans are widely viewed in this town as having gained some real political traction with their calls for expanded drilling .
GOP presidential nominee John McCain has been crisscrossing the country calling on the U.S. to " drill here ... drill now . "
Delegates to the Republican convention were chanting " Drill , baby , drill , " while President Bush , during his Saturday radio address , all but goaded Democratic leaders for having " ignored the public 's demand for relief from high energy prices .
" This is their final chance to take action before the November elections , " Bush said .
" If members of Congress do not support the American people at the gas pump , then they should not expect the American people to support them at the ballot box . "
House Republicans were out on the Capitol west front steps Monday , touting what they call an " All of the Above " energy strategy , which would open the federal waters offshore and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling , while encouraging development of oil shale and pushing for construction of new refineries .
The GOP news conference , however , was all but drowned out by environmental activists chanting , " Spill , baby , spill . "
Hoping to snatch back some of the political ground lost to Republicans , House Democrats — in a significant policy shift — are expected to unveil a bill that would allow coastal states to decide whether to allow drilling in the federal waters off their shores .
That potentially could pave the way for drilling off Virginia , Georgia and the Carolinas — all areas that have expressed at least some interest in drilling .
Gulf proposal
Next week , Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman , D - N.M. , and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , will push a proposal to open portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico — an area oil and gas producers are most intent on exploring — as well as other offshore areas to drilling , Bingaman said .
Last month , a bipartisan group of senators calling itself the Gang of 10 proposed its own plan to open new areas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and southeast Atlantic to oil and gas drilling .
That group , which has expanded to become the Gang of 16 and could swell to the Gang of 22 , will be championing its own package .
And Reid has promised to allow Republicans to bring their own drilling measure up for a vote .
But passage of a drilling bill remains highly uncertain .
Energy legislation , by necessity , must be written in a collaborative fashion , Maisano argued .
" And we 're not in a collaborative time right now . "
The House Democratic package , for instance , is expected to hit the oil companies up with higher taxes , but Bush has threatened to veto previous bills that included similar language .
The plan also is likely to require electric utilities to generate a portion of their power using renewable sources like wind and solar .
That provision faces opposition from Southern lawmakers .
House Republicans already are complaining about Democrats crafting an energy bill without their input .
" My guess is we 're going to vote against everything they throw up until we get a process that 's open and fair , " said Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis , the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Natural Resources Committee .
Time for showdown ?
The whole energy debate may be headed toward a high - stakes showdown at month 's end , when lawmakers will have to vote on a resolution to continue funding the federal government during the next fiscal year , which begins Oct.
1 .
Republicans are threatening to oppose that resolution — and possibly shut down the federal government — unless Democrats agree to drop a congressional moratorium that bars oil and gas producers from drilling in most of the federal waters offshore .
Bush lifted a similar presidential ban back in July .
Two variables , however , could upset the calculus of the debate — Hurricane Ike and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , noted Kevin Book , an energy policy analyst with FBR Capital Markets .
If Ike were to inflict the kind of damage on the nation 's energy infrastructure Katrina and Rita did three years ago and send gasoline prices soaring , the political support for expanded offshore drilling could change quickly .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , meanwhile , has been examining why oil prices spiked so high this year .
And an agency official is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill Thursday .
If the agency were to uncover real evidence of market manipulation , that could spark its own congressional stampede , Book noted .

Like many others around the world , I owe a great deal of my political awareness and social consciousness to Noam Chomsky , John Zerzan and Howard Zinn .
From reading Chomsky I was made aware of the ongoing effects of bureaucratic policies sanctioning war and death squads .
Zerzan made clear the depths of alienation from sustainable pathways and the need for truly radical change .
Zinn not only impressed upon me the honest brutality of American history , but his his promotion of Gandhian non-violence ( which I do n't wholly agree with ) is so much more promising than the useless finger - wagging and petition - passing undertaken by so many in the name of activism .
I have personally spoken with Zerzan and Zinn and have exchanged written correspondence with Zerzan and Chomsky in the form of letters and email .
And , as much as I respect and admire these three , I have tried to challenge them rather than simply flatter and defer .
Often it may have come across as youthful arrogance or hubris , but great people need intellectual challenges from those who esteem them and regard them as allies .
Simple deference and toadyism is best left to crumbling aristocracies .
To Chomsky I once wrote :
" I do believe that violence is an ever - present reality that has brought ( and can bring ) some degree of liberation .
For example , when the British pulled out of Gandhi's India it was n't just because of Gandhian satyagraha -- it was also because many Indians were starting to get up - in - arms and menacing to the empire .
Similarly , here in the US , it was n't just the freedom riders and the MLK's that brought some degree of justice to African - Americans .
The black militants of that era proved that people of color were not going to be pushed around any more .
They set an example and the riots may have sealed much of the equal rights deal .
" How many people do you think it would have take chained to the gates of Auschwitz to shut that camp down ? "
Caught off guard , he flippantly replied , " About a million , " and then went on to explain that WW2 was not about freeing the Jews .
And while he was right about the latter point , I could n't disagree more with his initial response -- and I think it reveals a literally fatal flaw in Gandhian non-violence when dealing with a truly despotic regime .

The Infoshop News version of my RNC Protest article has been bumped down their conventions protest page but other versions are still ranking quite high ( and one is still on the first results page for a google query of " RNC Protest " ) .
