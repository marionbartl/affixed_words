I was quoted in Saturday 's New York Times story criticizing Barack Obama 's long association with someone he should shun : former Weather Underground bomber William Ayers .
John McCain and Sarah Palin have good reason to fault Obama for overlooking Ayers ' indefensible past .
But while they 're at it , they should also explain to the American people why McCain has been friends with another violent political extremist : Gordon Liddy .
Liddy , who worked for President Nixon 's campaign , was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for multiple crimes in burglarizing the Democratic National Committee office in the Watergate building -- part of a broader plot to steal the 1972 election through sabotage , illegal spying and other dirty tricks .
He even planned the murder of a journalist , though that idea was overruled .
Bombings ?
He proposed the firebombing of a liberal think tank .
Liddy , now a conservative radio host , has never expressed regret for this attempt to subvert the Constitution .
Nor has he developed any respect for the law .
After the 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , he endorsed the shooting of federal agents : " Kill the sons of bitches . "
Yet none of this bothers McCain .
Liddy has contributed thousands of dollars to his campaigns , held a fundraiser for McCain at his home and hosted the senator on his radio show , where McCain said , " I 'm proud of you . "
Exactly which part of Liddy 's record is McCain proud of ?
While Obama has gotten lots of scrutiny for his connection to Ayers , McCain has never had to explain his association with Liddy .
If he can't defend it , he should admit as much .
And if he thinks he can defend it , let him .
COMMENTARY
This story caught my eye because of the 'ew ' factor , so naturally I wanted to share my newfound fear of catheters ( which already took up a healthy amount of time during my daily phobia - pondering ) with you all .
Misery loves company , so I assume that stands true for other negatively connotated emotions like disgust , fear of microbes , etc .
After the Government Accountability Office suggested at an April hearing that more work and leadership is needed to protect patients against central line - associated bloodstream infections , the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , surveyed state hospital associations to assess the incidence of CLABSIs .
( CLABSIs result when large catheters inserted into veins in hospitalized patients become infected . )
How big of a problem is this ?
Well , CDC says that hospital - associated infections are one of the top ten causes of death in this country .
Ouch .
CDC estimated that in 2002 , there were " approximately 1.7 million hospital - associated infections that resulted in approximately 99,000 deaths , caused substantial morbidity and suffering , and cost our nation billions of dollars . "
What 's even worse , in my mind , is that these infections are preventable .
We 're not talking rocket science , people - washing your hands seems to be pretty effective , and is something health care practitioners should be doing anyway .
14 out of 51 = major ' ick ' factor
The report summarizing the survey results , released Sept. 22 , found that " despite strong evidence of effectiveness , only 14 state hospital associations reported adopting or planning to adopt the program to reduce CLABSIs used by the Michigan Hospital Association and Johns Hopkins University . "
Those of you residing in or planning a vacation to the following states can breathe a little easier : California , Michigan , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , Vermont , Virginia , and West Virginia .
( Those not on the list , do n't despair quite yet - I 'll get to you in a few minutes . )
And yes , the committee did try to survey D.C. , where I currently reside and by coincidence just had the ( mis ) fortune to visit one of the capital 's fine hospitals , but D.C. did not respond .
Anyway , the report says that " if all state hospital associations were to implement the MHA / JHU program and achieve the same results , as many as 15,680 additional lives and as much as $ 1.3 billion could be saved each year . "
That 's a lot of lives , and a lot of money .
That money would give us anywhere from a few days to a week more in Iraq , depending on which monthly spending figure you believe .
But I digress .
The report continues , " CLABSIs are almost entirely preventable if hospitals follow certain procedures .
The current CDC guidelines for preventing catheter - related infections include 111 practice recommendations , of which 39 are ' strongly recommended . ' "
Five simple and inexpensive practices that reduce catheter infections , listed in the report , include : handwashing ( again - should n't this be happening anyway ? ) ; full draping of the patient ( yes , privacy , please ) ; cleaning the skin with proven cleansers ( so just a quick rinse in the atrium fountain ai n't gonna do it ? ) ; avoiding catheters in the groin if possible ( yes , please ) ; and removing catheters as soon as possible ( why in the **** would you keep them in longer than necessary ??? ) .
There is evidence , of course , that the MHA / JHU program works : in 2003 , Michigan adopted the JHU program state - wide , including participating in conferences and receiving data support .
Within 18 months , according to Waxman 's report , " the rate of CLABSIs in Michigan intensive care units dropped by 66 percent .
The typical hospital ( the median performers ) virtually eliminated these infections and outperformed more than 90 percent of hospitals nationwide .
The MHA estimates that during this 18 - month project , they saved more than 1,729 lives and over $ 246 million , before taking into account the costs of administering the program . "
How did some of the other states stack up ?
The average rate - how many patients are experiencing CLABSIs - and / or the median rate - success of the typical hopsital in the state - are listed below , for central line infections per 1,000 central line days :
• Iowa : average rate of 2.1 • Maine : average rate of 2.3 • Michigan : average rate of 1.4 , median rate of 0.0 • Missouri : average rate of 2.3 , median rate of 1.4 • Nebraska : average rate of 1.5 , median rate of 0.0 • New Hampshire : average rate of 2.4 , median rate of 0.0 • Rhode Island : average rate of 1.8 • South Carolina : average rate of 2.6 , median rate of 1.5 • Tennessee : average rate of 1.7 , median rate of 0.0 • Vermont : average rate of 2.4 for hospitals with a medical ICU , average rate of 2.0 for hospitals with a surgical ICU , average rate of 0.0 for hospitals with combined medical / surgical ICUs , median rate for all hospitals of 0.0 • Virginia : average rate of 2.1 , median rate of 1.4
The report notes that it is possible for a state with a median of zero to still have a relatively high average rate if a few hospitals have a significant number of infections .
Such a situation , they say , would suggest the need to focus resources on a few problem locations only .
Surge in biohazard suit sales seen in 34 states
All right , non-CLABSI participating states - the good news is that every state hospital association reported that it was " engaged in some activities to reduce hospital - associated infections , such as efforts to reduce ventilator - associated pneumonias and surgical site skin infections . "
Good to know .
I was surprised that my home state of Minnesota , which consistently ranks at the top of the pile in health care , was n't on the list .
I read MN 's response , and was happy to see that indeed the hearty Midwesterners are engaged in a number of activities to reduce and prevent infections , just not the MHA / JHU program specifically .
If this program works so well , why does n't everyone adopt it ?
The report says that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality provided the MHA / JHU program with a cool million bucks over a period of two years .
As such , many hospitals apparently expressed interest in operating a similar program but cited lack of funding ( federal or private ) as a barrier .
So , should you require a catheter in the future , take a copy of the five simple practices listed above and do n't let anyone touch you until they 've committed the list to memory .

If I Ran the Zoo : Neck and Neck :
This has to be neck and neck for the worst two commercials of McCain 's campaign .
This one is n't definitively anti-Obama at all , since the " Senator " to whom the protagonist speaks is n't named and the act of which he speaks is n't exactly clear .
And as for this one ?
I dare you to watch it without falling into an epileptic fit , rolling around on the floor with your head and your heels touching like a hoop , and having the family shut off the TV to rush you to the hospital .

Republican public relations strategist Marty Youssefiani has worked on numerous House and national races , and when I saw a CNN analysis by his old mentor Ed Rollins the other day on how Palin changed the game , I asked Youssefiani for his take .
By way of background , when I spoke with Youssefiani in the late spring , he was fairly convinced that Obama would win the election , on the strength of inspiring the registration of so many new , first time voters .
Ed is right in that [ Palin ] changed the short term dynamics of the game .
But I ’m increasingly skeptical about McCain ’s ability to sustain the energy — through three debates and this volcanic economy !
( I have a hunch McCain may have peaked too early . )
On the other side , Obama can ill - afford to ( personally ) engage in the nasty game ; instead he needs to figure out — very quickly — how to close the sale and convince the margins that he is not surface thin .
On that note , Biden ’s ( unfathomable pick over Hillary ) problem is : unlike Palin , his personal likability factor ranks with that of Ashcroft !
He has always come across as mean , bitter and personally angry .
He is probably the truly smartest one of the bunch , but time is running out on him and he ’s got to be careful with Palin .
On the “ Bradley Factor ” : I do think it is very , very real vis -a - vis the polls ; however , in my opinion , come Nov 5 , the biggest story will be how the genius pollsters missed / under factored the massive new registered voters , which will counter balance the Bradley factor — in favor of Obama , and , at the end , make the difference .
There you have it .
I asked Youssefiani about the conventional wisdom in the past being that young people say they ’re going to vote , but do n’t .
Questions about the Great Depression may be usefully framed as pertaining to three distinct issues : the Great Contraction , the extraordinarily severe economic decline from 1929 to 1933 ; the Great Duration , the persistence of sub par economic performance for more than a decade ; and the Great Escape , the ultimate recovery from this uniquely deep and long depression .
Although economists continue to debate the causes of the Great Contraction and the Great Duration , a rough consensus has emerged that major policy blunders of various sorts deserve most of the blame for these calamities .
With regard to the Great Escape , economists have also reached substantial agreement , but unfortunately they have come to agree on an interpretation that is almost completely wrong .
It is wrong factually because it places the Great Escape in the early 1940s , around the time the United States became a declared belligerent in World War II , where as the economy did not return to what we may properly describe as prosperity until after the war .
Economists have misconstrued the specious wartime prosperity  as the real thing , but diverting nearly 40 percent of the total labor force into military - related employment and producing mountains of guns and ammunition do not create genuine , sustainable prosperity , as people would discover if they tried to operate an economy on this basis for more than a brief period .
The true Great Escape did not occur until 1946 .
Economists generally recognize , of course , that normal , civilian - oriented prosperity resumed after the war , but their explanations of this resumption generally rest on factual and theoretical mistakes , and they fail to take into account certain factors that were critical to a successful transition from the wartime command - and - control economy to a peacetime market - oriented economy .
Perhaps the main reason why economists have misunderstood the remarkably smooth transition is that they have first misunderstood the war economy itself .
They have viewed the war boom in simple Keynesian terms : Government spending , financed by huge budget deficits and accommodated by rapid increases in the money stock , propelled the economy from the lingering depression to unprecedented heights indeed , during the peak years of war production the economy appeared to be operating far beyond its capacity to produce ,  even though by 1945 more than 16 million prime - age men had been pulled from the labor force at some point and replaced by teenagers , women with little or no experience in the paid labor force , and elderly men .
In truth , however , this apparent Keynesian miracle of production ,  during which the unemployment rate had been pushed to an all - time low of less than 2 percent , rested not on shrewd fiscal and monetary policy , but on massive military conscription , which had directly pulled more than 10 million men out of the labor force and indirectly induced millions of others to enlist in hopes of avoiding service in the dreaded infantry .
After the war most of the wartime economic controls were discontinued , more than 10 million men were mustered out of the armed forces , and the released warriors and civilian war workers quickly found private employment or left the labor force for home or school .
The unemployment rate in 1947 , when the transition was nearly complete , was less than 4 percent .
The standard interpretation of the transition after 1945 emphasizes that during the war people had accumulated enormous amounts of bonds and bank deposits , and afterward these financial holdings were released  to finance consumer spending , especially for durable goods whose production had been prohibited or greatly diminished during the war .
This interpretation , however , makes no sense : the bonds one man sold another bought , leaving the economys overall holdings unchanged .
Similarly , the money one man spent by drawing down his bank account reappeared in the sellers  bank accounts , leaving the economys overall bank deposits unchanged .
In fact , holdings of liquid assets did not decline at all after the war .
People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate .
Nor did people attempt to reduce their holdings of liquid assets by decreasing their demand for cash balances equivalently , by increasing the average dollars velocity of expenditure . 
Velocity actually fell slightly during the immediate postwar years ( because , some economists have conjectured , people still expected postwar deflation ) .
Nor did consumers reduce their holdings of government bonds .
Although the amount of outstanding government debt declined between 1945 and 1948 , this occurred almost entirely because of reductions in the holdings of commercial banks and corporations other than banks and insurance companies .
Postwar Business Expansion
While consumers were financing their postwar spending binge simply by reducing their saving rate , which had risen to extraordinary heights during the war , businesses financed their postwar investment surge by selling government securities acquired during the war ; by retaining more of their current earnings , in part because business taxes were reduced substantially after 1945 ; and by entering the capital markets , where stocks and bonds could be sold on very attractive terms .
Even greater business expansion was prevented mainly by lack of materials , rather than by lack of desire to invest or lack of financial resources to the great astonishment of the elite Keynesian economists , who had forecast that a severe postwar depression would occur when the government reduced its purchases of war - related goods and services .
The Keynesians had failed completely to understand that the prewar depression had persisted in large part because during the Second New Deal ( 193538 ) the Roosevelt administration had created extreme apprehension in the minds of investors and businessmen about the security of private property rights , and hence had discouraged these parties from making the large volume of long - term investments necessary for the economys full recovery and for its sustained long - run growth .
During the war , investor - friendly businessmen in temporary government service had administered the command economy for the most part , but concentration on winning the war had kept the civilian economy starved for resources .
By the wars end , however , Franklin D. Roosevelt was dead , the Second New Deals most zealous advisers and administrators had left the government or had been pushed into less influential positions , and therefore the future security of private property rights looked considerably more auspicious than it had looked before the war a change in outlook sufficient to induce a great deal of long - term private investment for the first time since 1929 .
Because regime uncertainty , which had dominated the later 1930s , no longer cast such a dark shadow over business and investment , the economy finally recovered from the Great Depression and the economic hardships of the war years , even as it simultaneously reallocated about 40 percent of the labor force from war - related uses to civilian uses .
The year 1946 , when civilian output increased by about 30 percent , was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy .
By 1948 , real output was back on its long - run growth trend , and during the decades that followed , the economy was spared the sort of deep and long debacle that a congeries of wrongheaded government policies had caused during the 1930s .

The devoted husband , 86 , driven to kill his sick wife after social services ' abandoned him to care for her alone '
Arriving at court : Eric Norton has admitted the manslaughter of his wife Betty
A pensioner killed his wife of almost 60 years in an act of mercy after social services abandoned him to care for her alone , a court heard yesterday .
Retired civil servant Eric Norton , 86 , was struggling to cope with Betty , 84 , who had Alzheimer 's disease .
He finally snapped and suffocated her with a plastic bag as she lay in agony in Lewisham Hospital , South - East London , suffering from a suspected stomach tumour .
Despite numerous phone calls by his son
Alan to social services pleading for them to help his father , they had merely provided assistance with the shopping .
The Old Bailey heard yesterday that Mr Norton was under extreme pressure after acting as his wife 's sole carer for four years since she was diagnosed with dementia .
He washed , dressed and fed her and was effectively housebound as he could not leave her on her own for long .
In the final year of her life she deteriorated to the point that she sometimes did not recognise her family .
At the onset of her illness , Mr Norton had promised his wife that he would not allow her to suffer at the end of her days .
When she was first admitted to hospital for tests last year after suffering stomach pain , he tried to suffocate her with a pillow - but did n't have the strength .
He later told his wife 's GP what had happened , according to Alan Norton who has read a witness statement by the doctor .
Caring : Betty and Eric Norton in 1982
But despite this admission he was allowed to care for her and given no extra support .
In November , after she was admitted to hospital for the second time after coughing up blood , he ended her life .
The grandfather then went back to their home in New Cross , South - East London , and tried to take his own life .
He was stopped by police .
Mr Norton was originally charged with murder but yesterday the Crown Prosecution Service accepted a plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
The frail pensioner , who was allowed to sit in the well of the court , had to be helped to his feet by his solicitor and groaned with the effort as he stood to enter his plea .
Sarah Whiteside , prosecuting , said that on the day Mr Norton killed his wife he had been under an enormous amount of stress .
' They had been a devoted couple for 57 years .
He was her sole carer .
On the day she died he was greatly disturbed and preoccupied at the notion that he might not be able to care for her one day , ' she added .
Wedding day :
The couple start their married life in 1950
Alan Norton , 53 , a metallurgist in the mining industry , works in South Africa near Johannesburg .
He said : ' Social services really should have been of more support for my father , who was clearly at breaking point .
I feel this could have been averted .
It is a terribly sad end to a long and loving relationship . '
Although Mr Norton lives abroad he travelled back to the UK as often as he could to see his parents .
He visited them just weeks before the terrible incident .
' I was not really aware of how bad the situation with my father was until the month it happened , ' he said .
The Daily Mail 's Dignity For The Elderly Campaign has highlighted the difficulties faced by dementia patients and their families .
Cybil Bland , 85 , who played bowls with Mr and Mrs Norton at Blackheath Bowls Club in South London said the situation was a tragedy .
' They were the perfect couple and absolutely devoted to one another , ' she said .
' My generation was brought up with dignity and we should be able to die with dignity . '
Mr Norton was sent back to the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham , Kent , where he is being cared for .
He will be sentenced on October 10 .
Kathleen Parker , a right - leaning syndicated columnist , dispenses some tough love to Sarah Palin in a column today sure to drive the conversation among conservatives :
It was fun while it lasted .
Palin ’s recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity , and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League .
No one hates saying that more than I do .
Like so many women , I ’ve been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
I ’ve also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does .
My cringe reflex is exhausted .
Palin filibusters .
She repeats words , filling space with deadwood .
Cut the verbiage and there ’s not much content there .
Here ’s but one example of many from her interview with Hannity : “ Well , there is a danger in allowing some obsessive partisanship to get into the issue that we ’re talking about today .
And that ’s something that John McCain , too , his track record , proving that he can work both sides of the aisle , he can surpass the partisanship that must be surpassed to deal with an issue like this . ”
When Couric pointed to polls showing that the financial crisis had boosted Obama ’s numbers , Palin blustered wordily : “ I ’m not looking at poll numbers .
What I think Americans at the end of the day are going to be able to go back and look at track records and see who ’s more apt to be talking about solutions and wishing for and hoping for solutions for some opportunity to change , and who ’s actually done it ? ”
If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself .
If Palin were a man , we ’d all be guffawing , just as we do every time Joe Biden tickles the back of his throat with his toes .
But because she ’s a woman — and the first ever on a Republican presidential ticket — we are reluctant to say what is painfully true .
What to do ?
McCain can’t repudiate his choice for running mate .
He not only risks the wrath of the GOP ’s unforgiving base , but he invites others to second - guess his executive decision - making ability .
Barack Obama faces the same problem with Biden .
Only Palin can save McCain , her party , and the country she loves .
She can bow out for personal reasons , perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn .
No one would criticize a mother who puts her family first .
Do it for your country .

The best scorer on the Miami Heat might be a baby - faced rookie .
The starting center was n't good enough to make a USA Basketball World Cup team that went to China last year and managed to only finish seventh .
For the 25 years that Pat Riley has been in Miami and running the Heat , the franchise has lived by a code that he came up with .
Miss Teen Louisiana Lindsey Evans Arrested
If you are going to be stupid enough to commit a crime then do n't forget your purse at the scene .
Miss Teen Louisianahas disgraced her title after doing a ' dine and dash ' with her friends , dissing a bill of $ 46.07 , but as it turns out , that 's definitely the least of her worries .
Evans , who might not be so bright , discovered that she had left her purse behind and decided to go back and get it .
Problem for her was that the police arrested her for theft when she appeared back on the scene .
To make matters worse , they did a search of her bag and found marijuana so they added a charge of drug possession .
Bossier City police booked Evans and her three friends on theft charges , three on drug charges and two on drug paraphernalia charges .
UPDATE : Lindsey Evans lost her crown 11 days before the end of her official reign .
RPM Productions , Inc. , the sponsor , took back her title according to president Paula M. Miles .
She will have to return her sash and crown but wo n't have to forfeit prizes or cash equivalent .
Check out that mugshot above .
We ask you - does that look like an 18 year who is feeling remorseful ?
It 's more like she 's posing for Miss Congeniality .
We 're just saying ....

What same - sex " marriage " has done to Massachusetts
It 's far worse than most people realize
October 20 , 2008
Special announcement ( 7-9-12 ) :
We have just completed a new UPDATED and EXPANDED version of this document .
Look for it here soon !

Anyone who thinks that same - sex “ marriage ” is a benign eccentricity which wo n’t affect the average person should consider what it has done in Massachusetts .
It ’s become a hammer to force the acceptance and normalization of homosexuality on everyone .
And this train is moving fast .
What has happened so far is only the beginning .
On November 18 , 2003 , the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court announced its Goodridge opinion , ruling that it was unconstitutional not to allow same - sex “ marriage . ”
Six months later , homosexual marriages began to be performed .
The public schools
The homosexual “ marriage ” onslaught in public schools across the state started soon after the November 2003 , court decision .
At my own children 's high school there was a school - wide assembly to celebrate same - sex “ marriage ” in early December , 2003 .
It featured an array of speakers , including teachers at the school who announced that they would be “ marrying ” their same - sex partners and starting families either through adoption or artificial insemination .
Literature on same - sex marriage – how it is now a normal part of society – was handed out to the students .
Within months it was brought into the middle schools .
In September , 2004 , an 8th - grade teacher in Brookline , MA , told National Public Radio that the marriage ruling had opened up the floodgates for teaching homosexuality .
“ In my mind , I know that , `OK , this is legal now . '
If somebody wants to challenge me , I 'll say , ` Give me a break .
It 's legal now , ' ” she told NPR .
She added that she now discusses gay sex with her students as explicitly as she desires .
For example , she said she tells the kids that lesbians can have vaginal intercourse using sex toys .
By the following year it was in elementary school curricula .
Kindergartners were given picture books telling them that same - sex couples are just another kind of family , like their own parents .
In 2005 , when David Parker of Lexington , MA – a parent of a kindergartner – strongly insisted on being notified when teachers were discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son , the school had him arrested and put in jail overnight .
Second graders at the same school were read a book , “ King and King ” , about two men who have a romance and marry each other , with a picture of them kissing .
When parents Rob and Robin Wirthlin complained , they were told that the school had no obligation to notify them or allow them to opt - out their child .
In 2006 the Parkers and Wirthlins filed a federal Civil Rights lawsuit to force the schools to notify parents and allow them to opt - out their elementary - school children when homosexual - related subjects were taught .
The federal judges dismissed the case .
The judges ruled that because same - sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts , the school actually had a duty to normalize homosexual relationships to children , and that schools have no obligation to notify parents or let them opt - out their children !
Acceptance of homosexuality had become a matter of good citizenship !
Think about that :
Because same - sex marriage is “ legal ” , a federal judge has ruled that the schools now have a duty to portray homosexual relationships as normal to children , despite what parents think or believe !
In 2006 , in the elementary school where my daughter went to Kindergarten , the parents of a third - grader were forced to take their child out of school because a man undergoing a sex - change operation and cross - dressing was being brought into class to teach the children that there are now “ different kinds of families . ”
School officials told the mother that her complaints to the principal were considered “ inappropriate behavior . ”
Libraries have also radically changed .
School libraries across the state , from elementary school to high school , now have shelves of books to normalize homosexual behavior and the lifestyle in the minds of kids , some of them quite explicit and even pornographic .
Parents complaints are ignored or met with hostility .
Over the past year , homosexual groups have been using taxpayer money to distribute a large , slick hardcover book celebrating homosexual marriage titled “ Courting Equality ” into every school library in the state .
It ’s become commonplace in Massachusetts schools for teachers to prominently display photos of their same - sex “ spouses ” and occasionally bring them to school functions .
Both high schools in my own town now have principals who are “ married ” to their same - sex partners , whom they bring to school and introduce to the students .
“ Gay days ” in schools are considered necessary to fight “ intolerance ” which may exist against same - sex relationships .
Hundreds of high schools and even middle schools across the state now hold “ gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender appreciation days ” .
They “ celebrate ” homosexual marriage and move forward to other behaviors such as cross-dressing and transsexuality .
In my own town , a school committee member recently announced that combating “ homophobia ” is now a top priority .
Once homosexuality has been normalized , all boundaries will come down .
The schools are already moving on to normalizing transgenderism ( including cross - dressing and sex changes ) .
The state - funded Commission on Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender Youth includes leaders who are transsexuals .
Public health
The Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health is “ married ” to another man .
In 2007 he told a crowd of kids at a state - sponsored youth event that it ’s “ wonderful being gay ” and he wants to make sure there ’s enough HIV testing available for all of them .
Since homosexual marriage became “ legal ” the rates of HIV / AIDS have gone up considerably in Massachusetts .
This year public funding to deal with HIV / AIDS has risen by $ 500,000 .
As the homosexual lobby group MassEquality wrote to their supporters after successfully persuading the Legislature to spend that money : " With the rate of HIV infections rising dramatically in Massachusetts , it 's clear the fight against AIDS is far from over . "
Citing “ the right to marry ” as one of the “ important challenges ” in a place where “ it ’s a great time to be gay ” , the Massachusetts Department of Public Health helped produce The Little Black Book , Queer in the 21st Century , a hideous work of obscene pornography which was given to kids at Brookline High School on April 30 , 2005 .
Among other things , it gives “ tips ” to boys on how to perform oral sex on other males , masturbate other males , and how to “ safely ” have someone urinate on you for sexual pleasure .
It also included a directory of bars in Boston where young men meet for anonymous sex .
Domestic violence
Given the extreme dysfunctional nature of homosexual relationships , the Massachusetts Legislature has felt the need to spend more money every year to deal with skyrocketing homosexual domestic violence .
This year $ 350,000 was budgeted , up $ 100,000 from last year .
Business
All insurance in Massachusetts must now recognize same - sex “ married ” couples in their coverage .
This includes auto insurance , health insurance , life insurance , etc .
Businesses must recognize same - sex “ married ” couples in all their benefits , activities , etc. , regarding both employees and customers .
The wedding industry is required serve the homosexual community if requested .
Wedding photographers , halls , caterers , etc. , must do same - sex marriages or be arrested for discrimination .
Businesses are often “ tested ” for tolerance by homosexual activists .
Groups of homosexual activists often go into restaurants or bars and publicly kiss and fondle each other to test whether the establishment demonstrates sufficient “ equality ” — now that homosexual marriage is “ legal ” .
In fact , more and more overt displays of homosexual affection are seen in public places across the state to reinforce " marriage equality " .
Legal profession
The Massachusetts Bar Exam now tests lawyers on their knowledge of same - sex " marriage " issues .
In 2007 , a Boston man , Stephen Dunne , failed the Massachusetts bar exam because he refused to answer the questions in it about homosexual marriage .
Issues regarding homosexual “ families ” are now firmly entrenched in the Massachusetts legal system .
In many firms , lawyers in Massachusetts practicing family law must now attend seminars on homosexual " marriage " .
There are also now several homosexual judges overseeing the Massachusetts family courts .
Adoption of children to homosexual “ married ” couples
Homosexual “ married ” couples can now demand to be able to adopt children the same as normal couples .
Catholic Charities decided to abandon handling adoptions rather submit to regulations requiring them to allow homosexuals to adopt the children in their care .
In 2006 the Massachusetts Department of Social Services ( DSS ) honored two men “ married ” to each other as their “ Parents of the Year ” .
The men already adopted a baby through DSS ( against the wishes of the baby ’s birth parents ) .
According to news reports , the day after that adoption was final DSS approached the men about adopting a second child .
Homosexuals now appear to be put in line for adopting children ahead of heterosexual parents by state agencies in Massachusetts .
Government mandates
In 2004 , Governor Mitt Romney ordered Justices of the Peace to perform homosexual marriages when requested or be fired .
At least one Justice of the Peace decided to resign .
Also thanks to Gov. Romney , marriage licenses in Massachusetts now have “ Party A and Party B ” instead of “ husband and wife . ”
Romney did not have a legal requirement to do this ; he did it on his own .
( See more on this below . )
Since homosexual relationships are now officially “ normal ” , the Legislature now gives enormous tax money to homosexual activist groups .
In particular , the Massachusetts Commission on Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender Youth is made up of the most radical and militant homosexual groups which target children in the schools .
This year they are getting $ 700,000 of taxpayer money to go into the public schools .
In 2008 Massachusetts changed the state Medicare laws to include homosexual “ married ” couples in the coverage .
The public square
Since gay “ marriage ” , annual gay pride parades have become more prominent .
There are more politicians and corporations participating , and even police organizations take part .
And the envelope gets pushed further and further .
There is now a profane “ Dyke March ” through downtown Boston , and recently a “ transgender ” parade in Northampton that included bare - chested women who have had their breasts surgically removed so they could “ become ” men .
Governor Patrick even marched with his “ out lesbian ” 17 - year old daughter in the 2008 Boston Pride event , right behind a “ leather ” group brandishing a black & blue flag , whips and chains !
The media
Boston media , particularly the Boston Globe newspaper , regularly does feature stories and news stories portraying homosexual “ married ” couples where regular married couples would normally be used .
It ’s “ equal ” , they insist , so there must be no difference in the coverage .
Also , the newspaper advice columns now deal with homosexual " marriage " issues , and how to properly accept it .
A growing number of news reporters and TV anchors are openly “ married ” homosexuals who march in the “ gay pride ” parades .
Is gay marriage actually legal in Massachusetts ?
Like everywhere else in America , the imposition of same - sex marriage on the people of Massachusetts was a combination of radical , arrogant judges and pitifully cowardly politicians .
The Goodridge ruling resulted in a complete cave - in by politicians of both parties on this issue .
Same - sex “ marriage ” is still illegal in Massachusetts .
On November 18 , 2003 the court merely ruled that it was unconstitutional not to allow it , and gave the Legislature six months to “ take such action as it may deem appropriate . ”
Note that the Massachusetts Constitution strongly denies courts the power to make or change laws , or from ordering the other branches to take any action .
The constitution effectively bans “ judicial review ” – a court changing or nullifying a law .
Thus , the court did not order anything to happen ; it simply rendered an opinion on that specific case .
And the Legislature did nothing .
The marriage statutes were never changed .
However , against the advice of many , Gov. Romney took it upon himself to alter the state 's marriage licenses to say " Party A and Party B " and order officials to perform same - sex " weddings " if asked , though he had no legal obligation to do so .
Technically , same - sex marriages are still illegal in Massachusetts .
Nevertheless , we are having to live with it .
And furthermore , this abdication of their proper constitutional roles by the Legislature and Governor has caused a domino effect as " copycat " rulings have been issued in California and Connecticut , with other states fearful it will happen there .
In conclusion
Homosexual “ marriage ” hangs over society like a hammer with the force of law .
And it ’s only just begun .
It ’s pretty clear that the homosexual movement ’s obsession with marriage is not because large numbers of them actually want to marry each other .
Research shows that homosexual relationships are fundamentally dysfunctional on many levels , and “ marriage ” as we know it is n’t something they can achieve , or even desire .
( In fact , over the last three months , the Sunday Boston Globe ’s marriage section has n’t had any photos of homosexual marriages .
In the beginning it was full of them . )
This is about putting the legal stamp of approval on homosexuality and imposing it with force throughout the various social and political institutions of a society that would never accept it otherwise .
To the rest of America : You 've been forewarned .
I understand that from her kitchen window you can see hypocrisy .
From the Wash Post :
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who has made a crackdown on gift - giving to state officials a centerpiece of her ethics reform agenda , has accepted gifts valued at $ 25,367 from industry executives , municipalities and a cultural center whose board includes officials from some of the largest mining interests in the state , a review of state records shows .
The 41 gifts Palin accepted during her 20 months as governor include honorific tributes , expensive artwork and free travel for a family member .
They also include more than $ 2,500 in personal items from Calista , a large Alaska native corporation with a variety of pending state regulatory and budgetary issues , and a gold - nugget pin valued at $ 1,200 from the city of Nome , which lobbies on municipal , local and capital budget matters , documents show .
About a quarter of the entities bestowing gifts on the governor are represented by one of Alaska ’s most influential mining lobbyists , who said in an interview that she was not involved in the tributes .
The lobbyist , Wendy Chamberlain , has a relationship with the governor ’s family through the friendship of their teenage daughters .

U.S. commanders in Afghanistan say they expect the Taliban to launch a winter offensive , a move that could bring bloodshed during a time of year that historically has been relatively peaceful .
Since the U.S. invasion in 2001 , violence in Afghanistan has usually tracked the country 's seasons , decreasing during the harsh winter months and then resuming in the spring .
This year is shaping up differently , with the U.S. picking up indications that militants who normally spend the winter months training in Pakistan are instead preparing ...
In an apparent coincidence , the Homeland Security Department ’s privacy officer , Hugo Teufel III , issued his annual privacy report on Friday .
It said there were 4,184 privacy complaints over a recent six - month period , but gave few details about them .
The Department of Homeland Security declined to make Mr. Teufel available for an interview or to say whether administration officials had edited his report .
“ We are not able to comment on this specific report , ” said Laura C. Keehner , the department press secretary .
She added that the department ’s activities to date had complied with the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and the Constitution .
A spokeswoman for Representative Bennie Thompson , Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , said he would write a letter Monday to the department questioning the process by which the report was made .
The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether Congress can pass a law that puts an executive branch official beyond the control of the president when it comes to giving information to oversight committees .
The court has , however , upheld statutes that gave regulatory agencies and prosecutors independence from presidential control .
The Justice Department memorandum issued in January said that those precedents covered different kinds of situations and so did not apply , and that the restrictions Congress sought to impose on the reports by the Homeland Security Department privacy officer “ must yield to the extent their application would interfere with the president ’s constitutional authority to comment upon or amend ” any information provided to Congress .
Several law professors said the administration ’s legal theory went too far .
Neil Kinkopf , a law professor at Georgia State University who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Clinton administration , called the opinion an example of the administration ’s expansive theories of executive power “ run amok . ”
PHILADELPHIA 
Who 's pitching is more important than where as the World Series resumes Saturday night in Philadelphia .
With the focus squarely on the Phillies ' inability to hit with runners in scoring position , nearly lost in the discussion is that the series is 1 - 1 .
Manager Charlie Manuel called Game 2 his Phillies ' sloppiest game of the year .
His hitters have disappeared with runners in scoring position .
But , as center fielder Shane Victorino was quick to remind , " We won Game 1 and we were within one swing of winning Game 2 . "
So , now it's in the hands — unless the rain forecast for most of the day Saturday intervenes — of Tampa Bay 's hottest starting pitchers and Philadelphia 's coldest in the Matt Garza - Jamie Moyer matchup .
What happened in the first two games in St. Petersburg is n't so much about home advantage .
It 's more about holding serve .
Despite all the talk about the perceived quirks of the Tropicana Dome or the home run tendencies of Citizens Bank Park , home field has mattered little this month .
DIAMOND VISION BLOG : Series shifts to Philadelphia
SERIES NOTES : Garza aims to control emotions
The Rays just got through a seven - game series with the Red Sox and the home team won three times .
The composite record for home teams in the six series leading up to the World Series was 14 - 13 .
So , in assessing advantages at this point , it 's more about matchups .
The Phillies needed Game 1 more than the Rays did .
After all , the Rays seem to thrive on losing openers of big series .
They lost the first game of both September showdown series with Boston , then won the next two games in each case .
They lost Game 1 of the ALCS , then won the next three .
More importantly , the Phillies needed Game 1 because Cole Hamels was their starter .
Hamels is the clear ace for the Phillies and significantly better than the other pitchers in the Philadelphia rotation .
None of the four Rays starters sticks out as the clear ace but their performances tends to be more balanced .
During the regular season , the ERAs of Scott Kazmir , James Shields and Garza ranged from 3.49 to 3.70 , with Andy Sonnanstine at 4.38 .
The Phillies range from Hamels ' 3.09 to Moyer 's 3.71 to Joe Blanton 's 4.20 and Brett Myers ' 4.55 .
That 's further clouded by Moyer 's 13.51 ERA in this postseason .
Once Hamels got his victory , it was up the Rays to get even in Game 2 , which they did .
Thus , the Phillies must find a way in Game 3 to reverse the recent trends — not just Moyer 's but what Garza did in seven one - run , two - hit innings in Game 7 against Boston .
A couple of other developing story lines , and whether they continue , could be crucial to the outcome .
For the Rays , we should be beyond wondering about how manager Joe Maddon is going to handle his bullpen .
We 're likely to see them all , in whatever order he deems necessary on any given night .
We 're certainly going to see more of David Price .
Price has been so poised and so effective — oh , and he 's so left - handed , an extremely important point against the the Phillies ' biggest offensive threats .
The focus on the rookie when he entered the playoffs was making certain he was handled carefully .
He had n't relieved before this September .
He had n't learned how to warm up quickly , as late - inning relievers must .
And , as the most prized prospect in the organization , doing anything the least bit untoward with this valuable arm could have created an investment gone bad to match anything any mortgage lenders have done lately .
Now , listen to Maddon — after Price finished off Game 2 with 2 1/3 innings .
" He 's been a starter , " Maddon said .
" He 's been stretched out .
That 's the difference with him than other relief pitchers . …
You feel comfortable with him going 40 pitches and not even blinking an eye . "
Understand that , Chase Utley and Ryan Howard .
Just like in Game 2 , the Phillies ' lefty sluggers could find themselves facing Price a second time through the batting order .
Of course , the problem could be solved from the Phillies standpoint by making their closer , Brad Lidge , and his set - up men the focus .
In other words , get the lead , as they did in Game 1 .
That leads to the factor that has steered this series more than any other so far .
The Phillies are 1 - for - 28 with runners in scoring position .
The only hit was an infield single in Game 2 that did n't score a run , though the Phillies have driven in a run with a runner in scoring position — on Carlos Ruiz 's fourth - inning groundout in Game 1 .
The Phillies can't be that bad with runners on second and / or third .
The law of averages would insist the stat begins swinging the other way .
Or is there a trend at work here ?
It might be less Phillies hitters and more Rays pitchers .
Tampa
Bay is making an art form of stopping the opposition with runners in scoring position .
In the seven - game American League Championship Series , the Rays held Boston to .200 ( 12 - for - 60 ) in the same situations and the Red Sox left 63 runners on base .
So , in the past nine post - season games , the opposition is batting .153 ( 13 - for - 85 ) against the Rays with runners in scoring position .
As a point of reference , Rays pitchers allowed a .243 batting average during the season with runners in scoring position .
For the Phillies , the biggest offensive concern is Howard .
Maybe they 'll eventually hit with runners in scoring position .
But Howard is struggling mightily against a steady diet of breaking pitches , mostly sliders .
" I 'm concerned about us hitting with guys on base , " Manuel said .
" It looks like at times we might be trying a little too hard .
But we can fix that . "
Manuel said he noticed Howard " not staying on the ball , and he was trying too hard . "
The manager had a similar assessment of leadoff man Jimmy Rollins .
" Jimmy 's swinging hard , " Manuel said .
" And that comes from trying too hard .
But , he 's capable of coming out and hitting the ball hard four times the next time he plays .
That 's kind of the way the game goes at times . "
Austrian far - Right leader Haider goes to his grave , taking secret of last hours in gay club with him
Austria 's far - Right leader Joerg Haider was buried with pomp and circumstance yesterday - but with a seedy gay bar as the backdrop to the official farewell .
It emerged that he spent the last hour of his life polishing off a bottle of vodka in a homosexual haunt in his hometown of Klagenfurt with an unknown young man before dying aged 58 in a car crash .
Yesterday the 30,000 mourners included Saif al - Islam , son of Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi , and SS veterans .
Many cabinet members , led by president Heinz Fischer , also attended the funeral .
Guards of honour stand by Joerg Haider 's coffin
There was an air of Princess Diana hysteria as the roads were thronged with people and flowers piled high at the cathedral in tribute to Haider , an admirer of Hitler .
Joerg Haider died in a car crash last week after being nearly four times over the legal limit
Despite past Press reports of his homosexuality , he was seemingly happily married - to Claudia - with two daughters , Ulrike and Cornelia , and poised once more to become a power broker after his splinter group Alliance For Austria ’s Future won a third of the vote in last month ’s general election .
But he seemed to possess the self - destruct gene .
A customer at the bar offered to drive Haider home because he looked worse for wear , but was turned down .
Haider went there after going to a nightclub , the public prosecutor in Klagenfurt said .
He arrived at 12.15 am on October 11 , left 30 minutes later and half an hour after that he was dead .
The official VW Phaeton limousine he was driving skidded out of control after he overtook another vehicle , hit a concrete barrier and flipped over several times .
He was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital .
Crowds :
Thousands of mourners watch the open air memorial service
Tradition : Mountain men act as pall bearers , carrying Mr Haider 's coffin
Haider ’s car , which had been in full working order according to experts , was travelling at nearly 90 mph - twice the speed limit - and he was three times over the drink - drive maximum .
Yesterday , black flags were flying from public buildings in Austria as his coffin - draped
in a flag and festooned with red roses - was carried through the streets of Klagenfurt in bright sunshine towards the cathedral .
Haider ’s £ 13 million country estate will pass to his widow Claudia .
Tears : Mr Haider 's widow Claudia shows her grief by embracing daughter Ulrike
Friends : Lybian dictator Colonel Gaddafi's son , Saif Gaddafi , centre , at the service

Atheist group sues Bush over national prayer day Associated Press
Published : Friday October 3 , 2008
Print This Email This MADISON , Wis. ( AP ) _
The nation 's largest group of atheists and agnostics is suing President Bush , the governor of Wisconsin and other officials over the federal law designating a National Day of Prayer .
The Freedom From Religion Foundation sued Friday in U.S. district court , arguing that the president 's mandated proclamations calling on Americans to pray violates a constitutional ban on government officials endorsing religion .
The day of prayer , held each year on the first Thursday of May , creates a " hostile environment for nonbelievers , who are made to feel as if they are political outsiders , " the lawsuit said .

Police photos of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ( Source : Exhibits from the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg Case File , 03/13/1951 - 03/27/1951 )
Washington , D.C. , September 11 , 2008 – – The Julius and Ethel Rosenberg grand jury transcripts released today as the result of legal action by the National Security Archive and a coalition of historians directly contradict the central charge against Ethel Rosenberg in the atomic espionage prosecution that J. Edgar Hoover called “ the case of the century , ” according to experts who analyzed the documents today .
The documents include the grand jury testimony of Ethel Rosenberg ’s sister - in - law , Ruth Greenglass , in which she describes writing in her own longhand the information her husband obtained at the Los Alamos nuclear installation , for passing on to Julius Rosenberg and the Soviet Union .
Records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that ten days before the trial against the Rosenbergs commenced , Ruth and David Greenglass for the first time mentioned that Ethel Rosenberg had typed those notes .
At trial , Ruth and David Greenglass testified that Ethel Rosenberg had typed up the information from the Los Alamos nuclear installation .
Ruth Greenglass was never herself prosecuted for her role .
The lead prosecutor used the Greenglass testimony as the culmination of his closing speech to the jury , saying that Ethel Rosenberg sat at that typewriter and “ struck the keys , blow by blow , against her own country in the interests of the Soviets . ”
Ronald Radosh , co-author of The Rosenberg File and one of the experts who filed affidavits in the case , commented , “ The grand jury documents cast significant doubt on the key prosecution charge used to convict Ethel Rosenberg at the trial and sentence her to death . ”
Radosh found confirmation for the grand jury version , in contradiction to the trial version , in the VENONA intercepts of Soviet intelligence communications , which describe key information on Los Alamos coming from David Greenglass through Julius Rosenberg in hand - written form in January 1945 .
Today ’s release includes 940 pages of the Rosenberg grand jury testimony , and 41 of the 45 witnesses who appeared before the grand jury between August 1950 and March 1951 .
David Vladeck , lead attorney for the plaintiffs , remarked that today ’s release was only the fourth time in history that historical grand jury testimony has been released to the public .
Vladeck called the release the “ first act in a two - act play , ” referring to the still - withheld grand jury testimony from the Brothman - Moskowitz trial , which served as a “ tuneup ” for the Rosenberg trial .
“ It is quite clear that if the trial were held today the government would have had a very difficult time establishing that Ethel Rosenberg was an active participant in this conspiracy and indeed it looks like the key testimony against her was perjured , ” commented Vladeck .
“ It is clear that at some point the government strategy took a dramatic turn .
Grand jury testimony reveals that there was a great deal of espionage on conventional munitions but none of that came out at trial .
Why not ?
It may be that the government did not want to reveal the extent to which Rosenberg and other Soviet spy rings had managed to penetrate the U.S. defense establishment . “
Steven Usdin , author of Engineering Communism : How Two Americans Spied for Stalin and Founded the Soviet Silicon Valley ( Yale Univ. Press ) , commented that there is no question about the guilt of Julius Rosenberg and those associated with him in spying for the Soviet Union , “ but the new records suggest that the government committed its own misconduct in the way it prosecuted the Rosenbergs . ”
In Usdin ’s view , the grand jury testimony was also important for what was not there , that is , evidence on the industrial espionage carried out by the group around Julius Rosenberg , which the government apparently did not pursue .
Bruce Craig , professor of History at the University of Prince Edward Island , Canada and author of Treasonable Doubt : The Harry Dexter White Spy Case ( University of Kansas ) , remarked that the new evidence raised significant questions about whether the trial was fair , whether the prosecution strategy was improper , and whether the prosecutors manipulated the grand jury .
Martin Sherwin , University Professor of History at George Mason University and co-author of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning American Prometheus : The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer , cautioned that the real analogy between the Rosenberg trial and today was not so much any similarity between Communists and Islamists , but the “ charged atmosphere ” to the point of hysteria in which the government reacted in both the early Cold War and post 9/11 .
The release of the previously secret transcripts resulted from a successful law suit filed by the National Security Archive and several historical groups and historians almost eight months ago .
The National Archives and Records Administration today released transcripts from 41 of 45 witnesses ’ appearances before the grand jury between August 1950 and March 1951 , providing key insights into the early Cold War period .
A chronology of the Rosenberg case is available here .
A list of all the witnesses and a description of their identity is available here .
The petitioners who won the lawsuit to unseal the Rosenberg grand jury records include the National Security Archive at George Washington University , the American Historical Association , the American Society for Legal History , the Organization of American Historians , the Society of American Archivists , and New York Times reporter Sam Roberts .
The petitioners are represented by David Vladeck of the Institute for Public Representation at the Georgetown University Law Center , who also served as counsel on the successful Hiss grand jury petition , and Debra L. Raskin , at Vladeck , Waldman , Elias & Engelhard in New York .

I have had a long - time problem with Mono and the Mono - based applications that , for reasons I do not understand , come installed by default with Ubuntu .
For those who do n’t know about it , Mono :
provides the necessary software to develop and run .NET client and server applications on Linux , Solaris , Mac OS X , Windows , and Unix .
That sounds pretty innocuous on the face of it .
But Mono has a potentially fatal sting - in - the - tail for some , and leaves a rather nasty taste in the mouths of many others …
The potential sting is because Mono is developed and supported largely by Novell who are , as we all know so well , in a patent - protection deal with Microsoft .
This caused a huge storm when they signed the deal – basically because it gave some “ credence ” to Ballmer ’s “ Linux / OSS breaches 235 + patents ” line .
So , it ’s O.K. for Novell to do stuff that implements helps M$ ’s stuff because they have “ protection ” from being sued [ yeah right – who really believes that one ! ] .
But what about everyone else ???
The nasty taste which has always ‘ ever - so - slightly ’ tainted my use of Ubuntu is that Mono is there only to support applications written in languages and for platforms which are basically Microsoft’s .
It encourages software development using systems that are based on technologies almost certainly encumbered by a whole raft of M$ patents .
To my mind , there are many great non M$ languages and architectures out there which are almost part - and - parcel of Linux programming and I see no need to bring .
NET , ASP or even Visual Basic to my desktop .
If I want to write an application , I could use PHP , Python , PERL , C , C++ , Java and , of course , many others .
Why do I need to endorse and encourage the proliferation of non-free software by relying on M$ ’s IP and the smell of their stinky patents ?
Well , I figured I do n’t .
So , I thought I ’d see what happened if I removed Mono from Ubuntu .
As a test I typed the following ( but I did n’t accept the Y/n question before doing some further research ) :
sudo apt - get remove -- purge mono- common
The following packages will be REMOVED
banshee f-spot libart2.0-cil libavahi1.0-cil libboo2.0-cil libflickrnet2.1.5-cil libgconf2.0-cil libglade2.0-cil
libglib2.0-cil libgmime2.2-cil libgnome-vfs2.0-cil libgnome2.0-cil libgtk2.0-cil libgtkhtml3.16-cil

mono - common mono - gac mono - jit mono - runtime tomboy
This lot removes just three applications from Ubuntu 8.04 : Tomboy , F - Spot and Banshee .
And they are n’t exactly desktop behemoths either .
The long list of libraries and things that just might break something else looked pretty scary to simply accept without question .
So I built a quick Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 VM using Virtualbox and tried it in there first .
It seemed to be fine .
Nothing else I tried broke .
I rebooted the VM and tried loading several applications and it all worked as expected .
So here we go then ; to get rid of Mono , Tomboy , Banshee and F - Spot , simply type the following .
sudo apt - get remove -- purge mono - common libmono0
( The -- purge switch removes the old packages from the package manager ’s cache so you actually get the disk space freed up too )
Now I must confess to having used Tomboy in the past .
But after a bit of research some time ago I found what I think is actually a better alternative called Zim .
It is basically a desktop Wiki application :
Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2 - Perl which aims to bring the concept of a wiki to your desktop .
Every page is saved as a text file with wiki markup .
Pages can contain links to other pages , and are saved automatically .
Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing page .
Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that gives it the look and feel of an outliner .
This tool is intended to keep track of TODO lists or to serve as a personal scratch book .
I have been using Zim for several months now and am very happy with it .
F - Spot is easily replaced by gthumb which , for me at least , does exactly the same thing : it gets photos from my camera .
I never used Banshee after looking at the UI once .
I found Rhythmbox much more obvious and easy to use , and it is already installed as well .
So , to replace the 44 packages ( and 3 apps ) above with non-encumbered alternatives , simply type :
sudo apt - get install gthumb zim
Of course please check your own system before blindly following my instructions .
I checked carefully before removing Mono to make sure nothing was going to break .
I would recommend you do the same , and , of course , back up your Tomboy notes first 😉

If your face lights up after spotting a “ Free Wi - Fi ” sign outside a local café , then you just might be a notebook warrior — or perhaps a cheapskate who lives nearby .
For many notebook nomads , a laptop ’s integrated trackball or ball mouse just does n’t cut it .
Now that most PCs sold are laptops , we ’re seeing more and more notebook mice enter the market , meaning that the competition is fierce with companies fighting over your hard - earned dollars .
Characteristics of a great notebook mouse are small size , lightweight , easy portability options like snap - in receivers , and of course , comfort .
We recently examined Microsoft ’s newest Explorer Mice with their next - gen BlueTrack Technology tracking system .
These are handy in being able to track across virtually any surface .
Today , we ’re testing the new Microsoft Arc mouse that offers users an innovative design catered for easy portability .
Microsoft ’s Arc Mouse has a fitting name — a symmetrical , well crafted semi-circle shape that is suitable equally for righties and lefties .
Forget the traditional soap design seen with most mice .
The Arc can fold up like a flip phone for easier storage along with an auto - shutoff when closed shut .
It is held together by a metal hinge that can withstand 25 pounds of pressure .
Guided with a laser sensor and three Teflon pads , the Arc Mouse is fitting for smooth tracking across multiple surfaces .
The mouse measures 4.44 - inches long , 2.32 - inches wide and folds to 60 % of its expanded size .
It sports a rubberized matte surface area , outlined by a glossy strip for extra sex appeal .
There ’s one side button on the left , but no button on the right .
The scroll wheel registers clicky detents for accurate line - by - line scrolling .
Belly up , the Arc has a battery compartment for two AA batteries ( included ) , a trio of slick Teflon pads , and a small compartment to snap in the mini USB receiver .
The Arc communicates at 2.4 GHZ with a 30 - foot wireless range .
There ’s a battery status indicator located between the left - and right - click buttons .
According to Microsoft , the Arc should last at least six months before replacing the batteries .
The mouse is easy to set up , no software required .
But if you want to customize it , you can visit Microsoft ’s site and download the IntelliPoint software .
So how did we like the mouse ?
Let ’s find out .

NASA spinoff firm the Ad Astra Rocket Company has announced a key milestone in ground testing of its prototype plasma drive technology , Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket ( VASIMR ) .
The electric rocket turns on .
The VASIMR " helicon first stage " - which generates the plasma for acceleration by the rest of the drive - has achieved its full rated power of 30 kilowatts using Argon propellant , according to the company .
This paves the way for further trials in which in which the ion-cyclotron second stage will get to strut its stuff , boosting the helicon plasma stream to the target power of 200 kW .
The successful first - stage fire - up was a collaborative effort between Ad Astra and Nautel of Canada .
“ We are elated with this achievement and exceptionally proud of the Ad Astra - Nautel team whose diligence and dedication made it possible , in spite of the disruption caused by the [ recent ] hurricane , ” said Franklin Chang Díaz , Ad Astra ’s chairman and CEO .
The idea of the plasma drives is to use electric power to blast reaction mass ( in this case Argon ) from its rocket nozzles at a much higher speed than regular chemical rockets can achieve .
This means that the carrying spacecraft gets a lot more poke from a given amount of fuel , and so can make interplanetary journeys in much shorter times .
Another potential application seen for VASIMR is maintaining the orbit of the international space station ( ISS ) without the need to burn large amounts of chemical rocket fuel .
A concept VASIMR ship able to carry astronauts
to Callisto , ice moon of Jupiter
VASIMR is the brainchild of Mr Chang - Díaz , MIT plasma physicist and former NASA astronaut with seven Shuttle flights and 1600 hours in space .
Chang - Díaz nowadays develops VASIMR at the Ad Astra Rocket Company .
He believes that VASIMR - or some kind of more fuel - efficient propulsion , anyway - must be developed , or travel beyond Earth orbit will never become a serious activity .
For now , Ad Astra is in negotiations to put a VASIMR test unit aboard the ISS , to help in maintaining station orbit and simultaneously prove the plasma drive tech in space .
NASA seems unwilling to find room for VASIMR on any of the remaining planned Shuttle flights to the ISS , but there have been hints that it might travel on a commercial - off - the - shelf lift ( for instance aboard a Falcon rocket from Elon Musk 's SpaceX venture ) - if any of these actually come into service soon .
Presuming that Chang - Díaz can get his gear tested in space , and it performs to spec , VASIMR plasma drives could fill key roles in NASA 's long - term push to the Moon and Mars .
They do n't have the power - to - weight ratio to be useful in reaching orbit , but once outside the atmosphere and furnished with a good supply of electricity they can leave chemical rockets choking in their superhot plasma exhaust .
Solar - powered VASIMR vessels , according to Chang - Díaz , would be very handy on the Earth - Moon run .
Such ships would do less well on Martian voyages or still further from the Sun , but might still have a place .
Alternatively , if concerns over nuclear power could be assuaged , small dustbin - sized fission reactors of the type used in submarines could be employed .
Chang - Díaz reckons that such a ship could do the Earth - Mars run in just 39 days .
In 2002 , he wrote ( pdf ) :
While a human Mars mission based on solar power is technically feasible , it is operationally fragile .
Beyond Mars , the use of solar power for transporting and supporting human life would not be possible ...
As their robotic precursors have done , future human interplanetary spacecraft will rely on nuclear power to explore the far reaches of the solar system and beyond .
If the human race is ever going beyond Mars , or ever going to see anything more of the universe than our own planetary backyard - if any of the more adventurous science fiction is ever going to become true - we 're going to need nuclear power , it would seem .
And lots of it . ®
That ideological sellout , unfortunately , was not the worst leadership trait the last - minute vice presidential pick revealed about McCain .
His speed - dating of Palin reaffirmed a more dangerous personality tic that has dogged his entire career .
His decision - making process is impetuous and , in its Bush - like preference for gut instinct over facts , potentially reckless .
As The New York Times reported last Tuesday , Palin was sloppily vetted , at best .
McCain operatives and some of their press surrogates responded to this revelation by trying to discredit The Times article .
After all , The Washington Post had cited McCain aides ( including his campaign manager , Rick Davis ) last weekend to assure us that Palin had a “ full vetting process . ”
She had been subjected to “ an F.B.I. background check , ” we were told , and “ the McCain camp had reviewed everything it could find on her . ”
The Times had it right .
The McCain campaign ’s claims of a “ full vetting process ” for Palin were as much a lie as the biographical details they ’ve invented for her .
There was no F.B.I. background check .
The Times found no evidence that a McCain representative spoke to anyone in the State Legislature or business community .
Nor did anyone talk to the fired state public safety commissioner at the center of the Palin ethics investigation .
No McCain researcher even bothered to consult the relevant back issues of the Wasilla paper .
Apparently when McCain said in June that his vice presidential vetting process was basically “ a Google , ” he was n’t joking .

This is a roll of the dice beyond even Bill Clinton ’s imagination .
“ Often my haste is a mistake , ” McCain conceded in his 2002 memoir , “ but I live with the consequences without complaint . ”
Well , maybe it ’s fine if he wants to live with the consequences , but what about his country ?
Should the unexamined Palin prove unfit to serve at the pinnacle of American power , it will be too late for the rest of us to complain .
We ’ve already seen where such visceral decision - making by McCain can lead .
In October 2001 , he speculated that Saddam Hussein might have been behind the anthrax attacks in America .
That same month he out - Cheneyed Cheney in his repeated public insistence that Iraq had a role in 9/11  even after both American and foreign intelligence services found that unlikely .
He was similarly rash in his reading of the supposed evidence of Saddam ’s W.M.D. and in his estimate of the number of troops needed to occupy Iraq .
( McCain told MSNBC in late 2001 that we could do with fewer than 100,000 . )
It was n’t until months after “ Mission Accomplished ” that he called for more American forces to be tossed into the bloodbath .
The whole fiasco might have been prevented had he listened to those like Gen. Eric Shinseki who faulted the Rumsfeld war plan from the start .
In other words , McCain ’s hasty vetting of Palin was all too reminiscent of his grave dereliction of due diligence on the war .
He has been no less hasty in implying that we might somehow ride to the military rescue of Georgia ( “ Today , we are all Georgians ” ) or in reaffirming as late as December 2007 that the crumbling anti-democratic regime of Pervez Musharraf deserved “ the benefit of the doubt ” even as it was enabling the resurgence of the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
McCain ’s blanket endorsement of Bush administration policy in Pakistan could have consequences for years to come .
Linear Scan Register Allocation for the Java HotSpot™ Client Compiler Christian Wimmer
Institute for System Software
wimmer@ssw.jku.at
Abstract Register allocation is the task of assigning local variables and temporary values to physical registers of a processor .
It is crucial for the efficiency of compiled code .
The most commonly used algorithm treats the task of register allocation as a graph coloring problem .
It generates code of good quality , but is too slow for just - in - time compilers because of its quadratic runtime complexity .
For such compilers , the linear scan algorithm is an efficient alternative :
It generates code of nearly the same quality , but is much faster than the graph coloring algorithm because it needs only a single pass over the lifetime intervals .
The Java HotSpot™ Virtual Machine by Sun Microsystems uses a just - in - time compiler to generate native code for frequently executed methods .
To achieve a high compilation speed and a low startup time , the HotSpot client compiler avoids time - consuming optimizations .
The current product version assigns registers using a local heuristic .
In the context of this master thesis , a research version of the compiler was extended with the linear scan algorithm for register allocation .
The implemented variant improves the basic algorithm with more advanced optimizations :
It makes use of lifetime holes , splits intervals if necessary and models register constraints of the target architecture with fixed intervals .
Benchmark results prove that the linear scan algorithm is a good tradeoff if both compilation time and runtime of a program matter :
The compilation time is only slightly higher in comparison with the old local heuristic for register allocation , but the resulting code executes about 30 % faster .
The benchmarks also indicate the high impact of the Intel SSE2 extensions on the speed of numeric Java applications .
Kurzfassung Eine der wichtigsten Compileroptimierungen ist die Registerallokation , die lokale Variablen und temporäre Werte auf die Register des Prozessors abbildet .
Das am häufigsten verwendete Verfahren basiert auf Graphfärbung .
Es erzeugt hochqualitativen Code , ist aber wegen seiner quadratischen Laufzeitkomplexität zu langsam für Just - in - Time - Compiler .
Für solche Anwendungen ist das Linear - Scan-Verfahren eine effiziente Alternative .
Es erzeugt zwar nicht ganz so guten Code , ist aber in der Laufzeit im Wesentlichen linear .
Die Java HotSpot™ Virtual Machine von Sun Microsystems verwendet einen Just - in - Time - Compiler , um Maschinencode für häufig ausgeführte Methoden zu erzeugen .
Um eine hohe Übersetzungsgeschwindigkeit zu erreichen , führt der HotSpot Client Compiler dabei keine zeitaufwendigen Optimierungen durch .
Die aktuelle Produkt - Version verwendet derzeit eine einfache Heuristik für die Registerallokation .
Diese Diplomarbeit beschreibt die Registerallokation nach dem Linear - Scan-Verfahren für eine Forschungs - Version des Compilers .
Optimierungen wie die Ausnutzung von Löchern in Live - Intervallen , die Möglichkeit zur Teilung von Intervallen und die Verwendung von vorgefärbten Intervallen führen zu einer Verbesserung der Code - Qualität .
Benchmarks zeigen , dass das Linear - Scan - Verfahren einen guten Kompromiss zwischen Übersetzungszeit und Laufzeit eines Programms darstellt : Die Übersetzungszeit steigt im Vergleich mit dem alten , heuristischen Registerallokations - Verfahren nicht wesentlich an , die Geschwindigkeit des erzeugen Codes ist jedoch um etwa 30 % höher .
Zusätzlich zeigen die Benchmarks den großen Einfluss der Intel SSE2 - Erweiterungen auf die Geschwindigkeit von numerischen Java - Anwendungen .

MANILA ( Reuters ) - When Philippine police confiscated 22 bags of broken pottery from antiquity smugglers near an area where Muslim rebels operated , little did they know that they may have uncovered the remnants of a long - lost tribe .
A local government official shows samples of the broken burial jars with human forms that were seized from antiquity smugglers near a conflict area on the southern island of Mindanao in mid-August are seen on September 2 , 2008 .
Archaeologists say the discovery of 22 sacks of broken anthropomorphic pottery could lead to a long , lost local tribe that existed around 2,000 years ago .
REUTERS / Stringer
Now , experts at the National Museum in the capital Manila are studying the burial urns from a tribe that lived in the Philippines over 2,000 years ago , in what could be a major archaeological discovery .
“ The pottery has human faces that show emotions , ” Eusebio Dizon , head of the archaeological unit at the National Museum , told Reuters .
Dizon said that pictures of people on the shards might mean the tribe that used the vessels had different origins from the known indigenous tribes in the Philippines .
“ The Manobos , Tirurays and B’laans tribes that have survived over time do not bury their dead in painted anthropomorphic ( human form ) jars .
So , we have no idea what kind of people are behind these unique burial jars , ” Dizon said .
A U.S. - trained archaeologist , Dizon spent several years in the 1990s excavating in a cave in Sarangani province on Mindanao after he was tipped off by treasure hunters about rare anthropomorphic , or human form , pottery in the area .
Carbon dating tests showed the jars to be from about 5 BC .
He said the latest pottery find could be much older because of the cruder method used in the pottery as well as the human forms on the jars .
But , further studies are needed to establish the real origins of the latest finds , he added .
“ We have no idea where these artifacts come from because the people who were trying to smuggle them out from the area could not tell us where exactly they found those materials .
But , I am sure the materials are not fake . ”
Rene Miguel Dominguez , governor of Sarangani province , said they were told the latest pottery was found near Palembang town , a coastal area in the adjacent Sultan Kudarat province where Muslim rebels are very active .
RARE AND UNIQUE
Archaeologists have uncovered late stone - age weapons , pottery and other artifacts in digs in the region .
“ ( But ) Anthropomorphic pottery is seldom seen in this part of the world , ” Dizon said .
Angel Bautista , head of the National Museum ’s cultural property division , said the government wanted the new discovery to be declared a “ national treasure , ” but further investigations were needed to establish provenance .
Dizon said it was important for archaeology experts to inspect the places where the pottery was found and examine the “ primary data ” that might reveal valuable information about what could be one of the earliest sites of human habitation in the country .
However , the museum lacked the resources to embark on a major exploration in an area where there has been sporadic fighting between troops and the country ’s largest Islamic rebel group .
Dominguez said some areas where the pottery was suspected to have been found were controlled by Muslim rebels that demand huge sums of money to allow further archaeological exploration work .
“ These pottery pieces are part of our pre-historic history and the government must do everything to protect the site where these materials were found , ” he said .
Apart from rebels and lawless groups active in the areas , archaeologists may have to race against antiquity dealers and treasure hunters as the artifacts could fetch millions of pesos on the black market .
“ We could learn more about our past from this pottery , but first we need to preserve and protect the areas from where these materials have been found , ” he added .

By Susan Estrich - October 5 , 2008
Michigan .
With all the attention last week focused on the vice presidential debate , it was easy to overlook what may have been the biggest story of the week : John McCain 's withdrawal from the key state of Michigan .
The fact that the news broke literaly on the day of the Biden - Palin debate was obviously not a coincidence , but an effort to bury , or at least put some dirt , on top of the story .
Even so , it got atention , deservedly so .
In the long run , it may count for more than the debate that was supposed to overshadow it .
It is , of course , true that Michigan has gone Democratic in the last four elections .
But it 's been close , especially in the last two .
What 's more , Michigan was not an Obama stronghold .
Hillary won it handlily in the contest that was n't ; McCain himself won it in 2000 , even as Bush was steaming toward the nomination .
Michigan is full of the sort of lunch bucket white Democrats who started off this summer with more questions than affection for Barack Obama .
It is the home , historically and ideologically , of the so - called Reagan Democrats .
It represents precisely the sort of sate that a victorious McCain would have liked to win , or at least force Obama to spend money to beat him there .
Now , Michigan voters are likely to see about as much campaign activity as we do here in California , which is a sign of Obama 's growing strength and McCain 's weakening position .
Conceding Michigan may well make sense for McCain given the most recent polls , showing him falling further and further behind , and the reality that presidential politics , particularly when things are looking down , is a zero sum game in which a shrinking pie must be divided with ever greater precision .
There are places where McCain is closer ; states where he has a better chance of winning than Michigan .
And a contest in Michigan means spending less in Ohio and Florida , and the remaining " battleground " states .
But make no mistake .
Leaving a battleground state is a sign of weakness .
Weakness in presidential politics begets more weakness .
It hurts fundraising .
It undermines confidence in the campaign .
It ups the pressure on the candidate to take risks which are called that because they usually carry at least as big a downside potential as an upside risk .
Of course , the obvious reason that Michigan turned on McCain is that the economy devloved into a crisis , and it's hard to argue that the party that 's been in charge for the last eight years and would claim credit for peace and prosperity is not to blame when it has produced neither .
It is particularly hard when what has been the mantra of the Republican party for the past two plus decades - smaller government , less regulation , more freedom for free markets - is so closely tied to everything that 's gone wrong .
Who let what Palin called those " predator " lenders out of their cages , free from any restraints ?
And , more to the point , how do you argue that the answer on which Republicans have built their past successes , is the solution when it so clearly seems to be part of the problem instead ?
Indeed , what was most striking about Thursday 's vice presidential debate was not that Palin did n't totally embarrass herself ( she would have to be an idiot to do that after being locked up in debate prep for a week , not to mention having been forced to confront what letting Palin be Palin looked like night after night on the CBS News ) or that Joe Biden managed to avoid patronizing either his opponent or the moderator ( how much do you think that was drilled into his head ) , but how flat Palin 's repeated efforts to invoke solid - gold Reagan gems fell in 2008 .
It 's too easy to say that Palin is no Ronald Reagan .
Sure , Reagan delivered his lines better ; he was an actor , after all , not to mention a two term governor of California , which is certainly better preparation for the national stage than two years in Juneau .
But I do n't think Reagan himself could make smaller government and freer markets sell amid the collapse of the unregulated , too free banking system that Americans are grudgingly being forced to bailout .
The experiment with less government has produced more government than Reagan ever dreamt of ; the bail out bill is definitely not one for the Gipper .
It was n't so much that Palin 's efforts to channel Ronald Reagan were forced or rehearsed ; it 's that what came out sounded painfully stale , and as much as she claimed to " get it , " what she said suggested just the opposite .
Republicans need a new approach , a new set of talking points , new rules of engagement , to address the mess that deregulation and less government has produced in real life , and Sarah Palin - and her partner , John McCain - have yet to articulate that approach .
In explaining her disastrous performace with Katie Couric , Governor Palin said she found Couric - or at least her questions - " annoying . "
Who was Couric to ask the Vice Presidential nominee to name a Supreme Court opinion other than Roe ( she could n't ) , or to list what newspapers she read ( not even the Washington Times or the Wall Street Journal ) , to inquire about why Russia 's proximity to Alaska gave her foreign policy experience , much less to ask her opinion on the bailout package .
As Palin told FOX News , " It 's like , man , no matter what you say , you are going to get clobbered .
If you choose to answer a question , you are going to get clobbered on the answer .
If you choose to try to pivot and go to another subject that you believe that Americans want to hear about , you get clobbered for that , too . "
The reason Sarah Palin got clobbered was not because her answers were " wrong " but because she did n't have them , and her inability to answer such straightforward questions raises serious questions about her competence for high office .
What she wanted to do was just attack Barack Obama : " I wanted to talk about his proposal to increase government spending by another trillion dollars .
Some of his comments that he 's made about the war , that I think may , in my world , disqualify someone from consideration as the next commander in chief .
Some of the comments that he has made about Afghanistan -- what we are doing there , supposedly just air raiding villages and killing civilians .
That 's reckless .
I want to talk about things like that .
So I guess I have to apologize for being a bit annoyed , but that 's also an indication of being outside the Washington elite , outside of the media elite also . "
This is not about the " media elite . "
It is about minimum standards for high office .
What Sarah Palin needs to apologize for is not her annoyance , but her ignorance , not for embarrassing herself with Couric , which she did , but for embarrassing all of the women who looked to her as a symbol of the competence and qualifications women can bring to high office .
If she did not always answer the questions that were asked on Thursday night , at least her avoidance was not as obvious as it was with Couric .
The Republicans may have been complaining about moderator Gwen Ifill on the eve of the debate , but in its aftermath , they should be thanking her for going easy on the candidate who ignored her questions .
But at the end of the day , if Palin cannot win this election for McCain - and that was certainly his hope when he picked her - she will also not be responsible for their defeat , which is where they are headed now .
Michigan is n't her fault ; she did n't create the mess that is forcing Michigan voters , some of them reluctantly , to conclude that they cannot vote Republican this times Reagan Democrats are still Democrats when Reagan 's answers , no matter how enthusiastically or genuinely they are invoked , no longer ring true .

The point of John McCain ’s coming back to Washington was for him to show leadership during a crisis , but McCain ’s return has revealed him to be unable to lead .
Even more damning , the Republican presidential candidate has not even taken a position on the issue of a federal bailout for Wall Street .
McCain has opened himself up to a round of criticism on both sides .
The House Republicans who are trying to kill the bill would nothing more than for McCain to either lead their cause , or offer an alternative of his own , but he has done neither .
His own Senate Republicans are already on board with the plan , so they do n’t need his input .
The bill has bipartisan support without him .
Not even the largest bank failure in American history can move John McCain to take a public stand on the issue .
Let me be clear , I do n’t care what position John McCain takes .
If he really is a leader , then he needs to lead .
President Bush has been doing his best to keep the markets afloat by promising that a package will be passed , but it appears that all John McCain has done is get in the way .
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) said this morning that President Bush should , “ respectfully tell Sen. McCain to get out of town .
He is not helping , he is harming .
Before Sen. McCain made his announcement , we were making progress . ”

The problem McCain faces is in part the institutional barrier between the House and Senate .
McCain may be the leader of his party , but he is also a senator , and senators have little influence on the other side of the Hill .
McCain did meet with Republican Minority Leader John Boehner this morning , but it is uncertain if he is leading an effort , proposing an alternative , or getting updates on the situation .
My guess is that if McCain had an alternative , he would be talking about it .
McCain ’s position is confusing , incoherent , and largely unknown .
He has shifted his position on the economy and the bailout at least 5 times in the past 10 days .
He is not exhibiting presidential leadership .
He has the look of a candidate caught in a trap of his own making .
McCain is going to Mississippi tonight , and we have a presidential debate , but I doubt that McCain will announce a clear position on the issue .
Instead of making him look like a leader , McCain latest gamble may have cost him this election .
Interestingly , the only people who can save John McCain from his horrible strategic blunder are the House Republicans who have shown little interest in helping their own president over the last five years , much less a senator who happens to be their current nominee .
Who would have guessed on Monday that the fate of John McCain ’s campaign may be in the hands of a group of Republican ideologues ?
McCain put himself in this mess and he has no clue how to get himself out .
We have seen this type behavior out of our current president for five years .
I do n’t think we need to see it for another four .

ここから得られる教訓は，国家的機密情報を扱う場合は，細かさだけでなく耐久性と速度も備えたシュレッダーを用意しておかなければならないということか。あるいは，省内に焼却炉を作っておいた方がよかったんじゃない……？
A naked and apparently emotionally disturbed man fell to his death from a building ledge in Brooklyn on Wednesday after an officer shot him with a Taser stun gun , the police said .
The police and witnesses said he had been yelling at passers - by and swinging a long light bulb tube at officers before he fell .
The man , identified by the police as Iman Morales , 35 , was taken to Kings County Hospital Center with serious head trauma after falling about 10 feet to the ground , witnesses said .
He was later pronounced dead , officials said .
Mr. Morales ’s death on Wednesday afternoon was another episode in the controversial history of Taser use in the city .
While Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has looked cautiously on the use of stun gun technology by the Police Department , he recently said he was open to broadening the use of the weapons after a city - commissioned study on police shooting habits urged the department to consider using Tasers more frequently instead of deadly force when applicable .
A video taken by a witness and posted on the Web site of The New York Post shows Mr. Morales naked on the ledge , waving the filament tube over the heads of officers as onlookers screamed , an eerie soundtrack to what soon followed .

Yesterday 's article got such a good response that I had to follow it up with this article , Twenty More of Football 's Worst - Ever Jerseys .
Because of the vast amount of terribly awful football shirts out there I found it easy to add another 20 .
There are some that did n't make it on to the last list by a whisker , and others that have been suggested to me .
Finally , as a treat , a picture of the infamous Colorado " Cowboy " shirt in action .
So once again I hope you enjoy them .
And once again shame on you if you own any .
Read the original " Twenty of the World 's Worst Football Jerseys . "
20 . Jorge Campos ( Yes , him again )
Even though he made it in the original list , none is complete without Mr. Campos .
In my opinion the world of football need characters like Campos .
On a trivia note he often wore No. 9 on his shirt as he was also a striker and one club signed him as striker before he made his name as a goalkeeper .
19 . Chelsea Goalkeeper Peter Cech
One of the world 's best goalkeepers sporting one of the world 's worst goalkeeping shirts .
At least it avoids the problems suffered by those who wear Manchester United 's grey kit .
18 . Manchester United
There really is no excuse for the awful blue and white pattern on these numbers .
17 . York City
The material is more akin to what a jockey would wear and what is the deal with the chequered flag on the sleeve ?
16 . Clydebank
In the last top 20 quite a few suggested pink was rather okay , did this one change your mind ?
15 . Norwich
Just picture yourself as a fan of the Canaries wearing this to show your pride .
Nah , me either !
14 . Newcastle United
Newcastle fans do have it tough .
Not alone do their club constantly underperform but they 're expected to sport tops like this .
Either have thin stripes of thick stripes , not both .
13 . Scotland
It 's not so much the actual top of colours .
It more the shirt and shorts combo .
What is with the navy band ?
12 . England Goalkeeper David Seaman
Yes indeed I do not lie , English goalkeepers once played in this kit looking like a pack of refresher sweets .
Nice , David , nice !!
11 . Cameroon
It 's the infamous Cameroon all - in - one kit as modelled by Samuel Eto'o .
Not bad colours but it is a bad idea and no guys , no one believes that a big cat mauled your sides .
10 . Malaga
Apparently Malaga are going to wear this shirt away from home this year .
Good luck to them .
9. Brighton and Hove Albion
That design was surely just created to hurt the eyes of the opposition .
8. Notts County
Another nice little tartan number .
Only for your grandfather .
7. Exeter City
It 's like a shirt your geeky brother would wear to a disco in the early 1990s .
6. Aston Villa 1993
I do n't think it 's one of the worst myself , but it was voted in .
The public spoke , well one person did :-)
5. Liverpool
The grey kit from 1989 although I do think they could see each other :-)
4. Crystal Palace
In a word : embarrassing !
3. Australia
I suppose they got their national colours in !
2. Stockport County
There is just so much going on in this shirt , busy I think is the term .
No. 1 , and still the undisputed winner ...
And here — proof it was worn :
They were a team from the North American Soccer League based in Denver .
They lasted for one year in 1978 before folding .
They had the worst record in the league with eight wins and 22 defeats .
Is it any wonder ?

The House of Representatives approved the $ 700 - billion Wall Street bailout Friday , setting in motion the biggest government intervention in the financial system since the Great Depression .
President Bush quickly signed the bill , and Treasury Department officials vowed to move swiftly to use sweeping new powers to try to stabilize financial markets and ease deepening fears about the economy .
The vote took place amid anxiety that the turmoil was paralyzing sources of credit vital to businesses , consumers and government .
Underscoring that concern , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warned this week that the state might need an emergency federal loan because of the crisis .
The House ’s 263-171 vote was a sharp reversal from Monday , when the chamber rejected a similar bill and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 777 points in reaction .
Lawmakers from both parties described Friday ’s vote , coming a month before they face reelection , as among the most gut - wrenching of their careers .

“ I may lose this race over this , ” said Rep. Sue Myrick ( R - N.C. ) , who voted for the bill Friday after opposing it earlier in the week .
“ But that ’s OK because I believe in my heart I ’m doing the right thing . ”
Proponents sought to portray the measure as important to ordinary Americans even as some made clear their contempt for Wall Street ’s recklessness .
“ Those greedy pigs on Wall Street do n’t deserve help from hardworking Americans , ” said Rep. Lee Terry ( R - Neb . ) , another vote convert .
“ But allowing them to fail will cause so many other businesses . . . to lose access to credit , lose business . ”
Before Monday ’s vote , Congress had been deluged with calls and e-mails from constituents opposed to the bailout plan , but Monday ’s brutal market drop was met with public outrage and led to four days of heavy lobbying for the proposal .
Senate leaders added tax breaks and other sweeteners to the measure and it passed there Wednesday .
On Friday , the bill won 58 new “ yes ” votes in the House , clinching approval .

“ We have acted boldly to help prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country , ” Bush said .
Nonetheless , markets declined Friday , reflecting broader economic uncertainty and worries about a government report showing that unemployment rose sharply in September .
The 451 - page Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act grants the Treasury secretary unprecedented authority to buy up to $ 700 billion of troubled assets from ailing financial institutions in an effort to stave off more bankruptcies and provide cash for new loans to ease the credit market freeze - up .

New and improved
Lawmakers demanded numerous changes to the Treasury Department ’s original , three - page proposal , including limits on how much executives may be paid if their firms sell assets to the government .
Congress also added an oversight board to supervise the program , raised the cap on Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
account coverage from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 , and required steps to help homeowners avoid foreclosure .
Sweeteners added an estimated $ 150 billion in costs , including a provision that shields 24 million taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax .
The new law also has tax relief provisions for disaster victims ; research and development tax credits ; a hybrid car tax credit ; and tax breaks for teachers who spend their own money on school supplies .
Many
House members said they were reluctant to help an unpopular industry and approve new federal spending but felt they had no choice .

“ Nobody in east Tennessee hates the fact more than me that I ’m going to vote ‘ yes , ’ ” said Rep. Zach Wamp , a Republican who came to favor the bill after helping defeat it in Monday ’s 228-205 vote .
“ Things are really bad , and we do n’t have any choice . ”
“ I am just as angry and frustrated as many of those who have called my office , ” said Rep. Jerry McNerney ( D - Pleasanton ) , who voted “ yes ” both times .
“ But I voted for it because my constituents ’ 401 ( k ) s , their life savings , and the ability to take out car , home and student loans hang in the balance . ”
Preparing for the political fallout , Rep. Jim Marshall ( D - Ga. ) has already begun airing a TV ad in his district in which he declares : “ I do n’t like this rescue plan any more than you do .
. . .
But I ’m not going to stand by and let this crisis undermine our economy and damage the financial future of everyone in America . ”
Within the California delegation , Democrats voted 26 - 8 in favor of the bill , while Republicans voted 10 - 9 in favor .
Seven Californians , all Democrats , supported the measure after opposing the earlier version .

Overall , Democrats in the House favored the bill 172-63 in Friday ’s vote ; Republicans voted 108- 91 against it .
In Monday ’s vote , Democrats voted 140- 95 in favor while Republicans voted 133-65 against .
Between the two votes , 33 Democrats switched their votes to “ yes , ” while one Democrat changed his vote from “ yes ” to “ no . ”
Twenty - five Republicans switched to “ yes , ” and one other Republican voted “ yes ” Friday after missing Monday ’s vote .
For many California lawmakers , the state ’s credit crisis amounted to a tipping point .
“ California now faces a budgetary situation so perilous that our public services are now threatened , ” said Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D - Petaluma ) , who opposed the bill Monday but supported it Friday .

Lobbying lawmakers
The presidential candidates -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain -- took part in a broad - based effort to lobby lawmakers , joined by outside groups and Schwarzenegger , who phoned California members of the House .
“ I never talked to so many bank presidents in my life , ” said Rep. Joe Knollenberg ( R - Mich . ) , a convert to the “ yes ” camp Friday .
He also received a call from General Motors Corp. Chairman Rick Wagoner

The mood on the floor of the chamber was markedly more relaxed Friday than it had been Monday , reflecting expectations of passage .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) , who on Monday riled Republicans by criticizing Bush ’s economic policies in a floor speech before the vote , softened her rhetoric Friday .
Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , who denigrated the earlier version of the measure , urged Republicans to help pass its successor Friday .
“ Let ’s not kid ourselves .
We ’re in the midst of a recession , ” Boehner said .
“ It ’s going to be a rough ride .
But it will be a whole lot rougher ride if we do n’t pass this bill . ”
To demonstrate concern for Main Street , the House approved a separate measure to extend unemployment benefits .
That bill needs Senate approval .

The bailout vote divided members of the same party , and , in one case , a husband and wife .
Rep. Connie Mack ( R - Fla . ) said the vote would go down in history as “ the day Congress killed the free market . ”
His wife , Rep. Mary Bono Mack ( R - Palm Springs ) , voted for the bill .
Despite the political shift in support , some opponents remained steadfast , encompassing an odd - fellows coalition of liberals and conservatives .
“ This is not a time for panic , ” said Rep. Devin Nunes ( R - Tulare ) .
“ Why do we need to give $ 700 billion to one man to play hedge - fund god from the gilded offices of the United States Treasury ? ”
Advertisement
Rep. Paul W. Hodes ( D - N.H. ) said that despite improvements , the bill focused “ too much on Wall Street . ”
--
Things ’ll be different
With lawmakers now heading home for the fall campaign , Congress will wait until next year to consider tougher regulations on financial institutions .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said lawmakers will “ do some serious surgery on the financial structure . ”

The Five Worst Supreme Court Decisions of the Past Fifty Years
JB
David Savage of the L.A.
Times asked me to list the worst Supreme Court decisions of the past fifty years -- dating back to 1958 .
It 's hard to say what makes a decision bad .
It could be an incorrect reading of precedent , a mangling of history , or a failure to exercise judgment and understand the long - term consequences of a decision .
In any case , here is a list of five decisions that I think , for various reasons , are the worst of the past half - century , and why I think they were bad .
1. Clinton v. Jones ( 1997 ) .
Clinton v. Jones held that sitting Presidents may not delay civil litigation directed against them during their term in office .
Clinton v. Jones badly misjudged how a president 's political opponents could use the civil justice system to create scandals and bog down a presidency , thus effectively hijacking most of Clinton 's second term .
I am pretty certain that if the Justices had a do - over , Clinton v. Jones would have come out the other way .
2. Bowers v. Hardwick ( 1986 ) .
Bowers held that states could imprison homosexuals for having sex with their partners and it facilitated many different forms of discrimination against gays and lesbians .
It is one of the worst civil rights decisions since Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) , which gave the Supreme Court 's blessing to Jim Crow .
3. Bush v. Gore ( 2000 ) .
Bush v. Gore was a self - inflicted wound that made the Court appear overtly partisan .
It compounded this problem by suggesting that the new rule it announced would probably never apply to any future case .
By intervening in an election dispute that would have been resolved by Congress without its help , the Court made itself partially responsible for the debacle of the last eight years .
4. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez ( 1973 ) .
This decision is not well known but had important long term effects .
It held that education is not a fundamental right and effectively announced the end of constitutional protections for the poor .
It shifted the focus of constitutional reform of public education from class and race to just race , which proved to be a dead end .
Moreover , it helped divorce the question of racial integration from issues of school quality and equal educational opportunity , which , along with shifting demographics and housing patterns , made racial integration increasingly irrelevant to the problems of inner city schools .
The next year , the Supreme Court decided Miliken v. Bradley ( 1974 ) , which relieved suburban school districts of most of their obligations to work with inner city school districts to integrate schools and share burdens .
Together , Rodriguez and Miliken made Brown v. Board of Education practically irrelevant , with the result that our public schools today are once again heavily segregated by race .
If any two cases can be said to have " overruled " Brown in practice , it would be the deadly duo of Rodriguez and Milliken .
5. United States v. Miller ( 1976 ) .
Another little known decision with important ramifications , Miller held that when a person reveals information about themselves to a third party , they waive all their Fourth Amendment rights to privacy .
This decision makes the Fourth Amendment increasingly irrelevant in an information age where people must share personal information -- including health and financial data -- with others all the time .
As the Internet has made privacy a central civil liberties concern , Miller made the Constitution 's central guarantee of privacy largely ineffective in the digital age .
No doubt one could extend the list .
Obviously , your list of worst decisions will depend heavily on your views about constitutional interpretation as well as your politics .
People who oppose abortion rights would certainly list Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood as among the worst decisions of all time , much less the past 50 years .
Probably Kelo v. New London will top many people 's lists , although I think that whether Kelo is correct or not , it prove to have fewer bad consequences than many people have feared , largely because public pressure will lead state and local governments to impose new limits on takings practices .
Sometimes it is difficult to know how bad a decision is until many years later .
There are many cases that , when they originally came down , I thought were very bad indeed .
However , years later , even though the reasoning remains bad , the Court effectively distinguished or confined them , or their bad effects were limited .
Chou En Lai once said of the French Revolution that it is too soon to tell whether it was a success .
The same can be said , in reverse , for whether a Supreme Court decision is a disaster .
If I wanted to make a list solely of bad interpretations of the Constitution of the past fifty years , the list would be much longer .
Here I limit myself to bad interpretations that also had pernicious consequences -- where the Supreme Court not only made really bad constitutional arguments but was willfully blind to the consequences of what it was doing .
Bowers v. Hardwick is a little different : I had little doubt when it was decided in 1986 that eventually the case would be reversed or made irrelevant by legislation , although during the 17 years it was on the books it had very bad consequences for gays and lesbians .
But Bowers seemed remarkably homophobic -- the Court went out of its way to rewrite the Georgia statute so that it concerned only homosexuals so that it could avoid addressing the rather embarrassing fact that the statute banned sexual conduct by gays and straights alike .
And the opinion was such a slap in the face to gays -- at one point Justice
White labels their claims facetious -- that I thought it was really unworthy of the Court , and therefore belongs in the class of worst decisions .
As you will see from my list , some of these are cases where the Court intervened when it should have stayed out , and some are cases where the Court left an issue up the political process where it should not ( Kelo , by the way , falls in that category , if you think it is one of the worst . ) .
The idea of good or bad judging is really orthogonal to the hackneyed debates over judicial activism and judicial restraint .
If a constitutional right should be protected , courts should n't refuse to protect it .
Feel free to give your own list of the worst decisions of the past 50 years ( from 1958 onward ) in the comments .
Russia Today
Thursday , Oct 16 , 2008
The International Court of Justice in The Hague has rejected a request from Georgia to prosecute Russia over the conflict in the Caucasus .
The court also called for both parties to do everything possible to protect human rights in areas hit by the conflict .
Court President Rosalyn Higgins said : “ The court is of the opinion that the ethnic Georgian population in the areas affected by the recent conflict remains vulnerable . ”
She added that the populations of South Ossetian and Abkhazia “ also remain vulnerable ” .
The court ordered both sides to protect civilians in the regions .
It also called for the free passage of humanitarian aid to those still suffering the effects of the August conflict .
On August 12 , Tbilisi , appealed to the UN ’s highest court to stop what it called a campaign of “ racial discrimination ” by Russia against Georgians living in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
It accused Moscow of violating the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination .
Two days later Georgia repeatedly appealed to the court , asking it to take temporary measures to protect the rights of ethnic Georgians .
Hearings were held at The Hague on September 8 - 10 .
The ruling was handed down on Wednesday .
Roman Kolodkin , the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry ’s legal department said the “ measures are very different from those that Georgia requested from the court .
“ That Georgia was claiming that Russia is in breach of its obligations under the international convention of the illumination of all forms of racial discrimination of 1965 .
In the territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia Russia is discriminating against Georgia .
And Georgia is claiming that Russia is occupying its territories .
You can find nothing about this in the court order . ”
Moscow is expected to continue its campaign to demonstrate that The Hague has no jurisdiction on Georgia ’s application against Russia , the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday .

Lipstick on a Bailout
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
This time last week , the biggest bailout in the history of the world seemed to be a fait accompli .
Last weekend , the Fed Chairman and the Secretary of the Treasury had harsh words of doom and gloom for Congressional leaders , with the rest of the administration parroting along , and by last Monday it seemed both parties were about to fall in line and vote our Republic away by socializing the banking industry through this bailout .
Foolish business behavior was about to be rewarded , and propped up a little longer , the bubble blown a little bigger , and our coming Depression made that much greater , but then something happened on the way to the House floor .
Citizens made their voices heard .
The real story behind the story in Congress this week was the thousands of calls and emails sent to Representatives , clogging up inboxes and even slowing down the House internet system .
Slowly , like the Titanic turning around , sentiments on the Hill shifted , and we heard Congressmen capitulating and changing their tune a little , desperately trying to find ways to salvage the bailout without completely enraging their constituencies .
Now we hear about taxpayer protections , about golden parachutes , and about other nuances that hardly cover up the fact that we would be creating more money out of thin air and further devaluing the dollar !
The problem is not HOW the government is spending this money ; it ’s the fact that the government is spending this money .
We do n’t have it .
We are already nearly $ 10 trillion in debt , not including unfunded liabilities .
We already spend about $ 1 trillion a year we do n’t have on our overseas empire .
Now nearly $ 1 trillion more is somehow supposed to magically appear and solve all our problems !
No — creating more money might delay the inevitable for some well - connected banks on Wall Street , but in a few weeks we will find ourselves right back in this same position , but much poorer .
The unfortunate thing is that we ’ve already spent at least $ 700 billion on other bailouts that did not solve the problem .
And while all this negotiation was taking place , the auto industry was quietly bailed out , with no controversy , no discussion , to the tune of $ 25 billion .
Inevitably , it appears Congress will call their constituents ’ bluff and the bailout will pass , because that is the habit Wall Street and Washington have fallen into .
People are right to be concerned about our financial future .
I ’ve been talking for 30 some years about reasons we need to be concerned and change our ways .
We find ourselves now in a position of no good options , and no silver bullets .
But the worst thing we can do is to compound our problems by intensifying the mistakes of the past .
We do have tough economic times ahead , no doubt , no matter what we do , even if we do nothing .
The question , is will we have the courage to take our medicine now and get it over with , or will we prolong the misery for many years to come ?
I ’m less and less optimistic about the answer to that question .

Facts , no matter how convincing , rarely trump a good , solid dose of repetition .
This is an extremely distressing story : a woman faxes a suicide note to her mortgage servicer on the day the foreclosure sale is scheduled , and is dead by the time the police arrive .
Distressing for anyone with what I take to be a normal sense of human decency , that is .
To the local and now national media , it seems to be catnip .
Carlene Balderrama 's personal tragedy is in danger of becoming an indelible urban legend of the Great Predatory Foreclosure Crisis , uncomfortable facts be damned .
The tenor of the reporting , of course , makes anyone who expresses any skepticism about the media 's line on this sad event sound inhuman .
I have been telling myself since I first saw this story that only a fool would try to steer a course through the rock of credulousness or the hard place of callousness .
But I guess it 's my job to be a fool today .
***************
The Boston Globe got the thing underway on Thursday : TAUNTON - The housing crunch has caused anguish and anxiety for millions of Americans .
For Carlene Balderrama , a 53 - year - old wife and mother , the pressure was apparently too much .
Police say that Balderrama fatally shot herself Tuesday afternoon , 90 minutes before her foreclosed home was scheduled to be sold at auction .
Chief Raymond O'Berg said that Balderrama faxed a letter to her mortgage company at 2:30 p.m. , saying that " by the time they foreclosed on the house today she'd be dead . "
The mortgage company notified police , who found her body at 3:30 p.m .
The auction had been scheduled to start at 5 p.m. , when bidders showed up at the house and found it surrounded by police cruisers .
But , unbeknownst to buyers and to Balderrama , the auction had been postponed by the time she grabbed her husband 's high - powered rifle , O'Berg said .
Balderrama left a note for her family , saying they should " take the [ life ] insurance money and pay for the house , " O'Berg said .
The chief said he did not know , however , if the family would be able to collect on the policy in the event of a suicide .
Those appear to be facts .
Then we get this : Joe Whitney , who works with Balderrama 's husband , said that she handled the bills in the household and that the husband was unaware of the foreclosure .
" John did n't even know about it ; that 's the surprise , " Whitney said outside the home , where he had come to comfort the family .
" It 's just one of those awful , awful , tragic events . "
John Balderrama did , however , file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy three times from 2004 to 2006 , but the courts dismissed the petitions .
Debtors who declare bankruptcy under Chapter 13 generally can keep their homes while paying off their debts under a court - approved reorganization plan .
Something does n't add up here .
Nonetheless , the reporter is undeterred :
As Congress rushed yesterday to help 400,000 strapped homeowners avoid foreclosure and prevent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from collapsing , the suicide underscored the potentially devastating toll of the housing crunch .
Bruce Marks , chief executive of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America , said it is not uncommon for homeowners to contemplate suicide when they cannot keep up their mortgage payments .
Marks 's group counsels homeowners in crisis and responds to such crises by immediately notifying the police , he said .
" What gets us so angry is that people blame themselves , " Marks said .
" They can't see past their sense of responsibility to see the responsibility and the predatory nature of these lenders .
The fact of the matter is , unless something dramatic happens , there 's going to be more and more people like her taking their lives . "
Police believe that when the Balderramas bought the house in a stronger market , the family chose an adjustable rate mortgage , confident they would be able to keep up the payments .
But as the housing market plummeted and the rates rose , the family fell behind , O'Berg said .
We have Bruce Marks , who should be ashamed of himself , labelling Balderrama 's mortgage lender a predator .
We have a cop making claims about the terms of the mortgage loan and the sequence of events leading to the default -- claims that the reporter could have verified by searching the public records .
( Note : I have not examined the Balderrama 's recorded mortgage documents , because the North Bristol MA Registry of Deeds requires creation of an account with an account fee and a $ 1.00 per page charge for the documents .
I am not inclined to spend $ 15 to see a copy of their mortgage , but I 'm inclined to wonder why the Boston Globe is n't so inclined . )
But we get even more from the co-worker and the cop :
Whitney said he did not believe that Carlene Balderrama had a history of mental illness .
" It looked like a happy couple , " Whitney said .
" That 's why John was so blown away .
Nothing medically ever came up , and I 've known them for 20 years . "
O'Berg said he was troubled that the pressures of foreclosure had triggered suicide on a street that he described as solidly middle - class .
" That 's the real sad part :
This is a middle - class family , a husband working , the son is working , " O'Berg said .
But the housing crunch , he said , " is inflicting real pain on middle - class Americans .
" Put yourself in her shoes , " he added .
" You handle the finances , and you 're hiding everything from family .
It 's a lot of pressure . "
Why are two people who are neither psychologists nor economists so eager to convince us that the primary cause of this suicide was " the foreclosure crisis " ?
Since when do the local cops become your go - to sociologists ?
The Boston Herald on the same day provided some facts that rather confound this narrative : John Balderrama bought the three - bedroom house at 103 Duffy Drive in October 2002 , using a $ 220,255 mortgage to cover most of the $ 232,000 purchase price , public records show .
But less than eight months later , PHH initiated foreclosure proceedings - usually a sign that a borrower is at least 90 days delinquent .
The Herald does not confirm that the mortgage loan in question was an ARM , but it certainly casts doubt on the idea that rising interest rates and plummeting house prices had anything to do with the Balderramas ' difficulties with their mortgage .
According to the Herald , John Balderrama filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions in 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 .
I did spend some time looking at these bankruptcy filings , which are available to anyone with a PACER account and the willingness to spend 8 cents a page .
In all three filings , the only debts listed for Balderrama were a single mortgage on the house and a car loan .
There are no unsecured debts and no undischargeable or " priority " debts .
There are no catastrophic ( or even modest ) medical expenses or debts .
In fact , in all three filings , the only debt to be paid through the Chapter 13 plan is the arrearage on the mortgage , which seems to have been around $ 27,000 in the first filing and around $ 44,000 by the last one ( in April 2006 ) .
Otherwise , each plan indicated that Balderrama would pay his approximately $ 1700 house payment ( that figure includes taxes and insurance ) and $ 289 car loan directly to the creditors during the BK .
Each plan indicated that there were no assets above exempt amounts .
The only real difference among the three filings is that Balderrama 's income kept increasing substantially , meaning that in each filing the required payment to the trustee kept increasing .
In the first filing , he claimed gross monthly income of $ 6,202 , which resulted in a monthly repayment plan requirement of $ 527 ( in addition to the regular monthly car and house payment ) .
( The Herald story reports his net ( after tax ) income instead of gross . )
By the third filing , the gross monthly income was $ 10,461 and the plan payment was $ 1066 .
As far as I can tell , Balderrama never made more than one plan payment during any of these BKs .
It 's hard to tell whether the mortgage payment was made post-petition , but in at least two of the BKs the post- petition car payment did n't get made .
All the bankruptcies were dismissed due to either failure to make payments to the trustee or failure to attend hearings or creditors ' meetings .
I have to say that these were a very strange set of BK filings .
Carlene Balderrama never appears as a debtor , or even as a spousal signatory .
( Did Carlene even know about the BK filings ?
It makes more sense that she would be in the dark about the BKs than that her husband was in the dark about the mortgage arrearage . )
Although the household income keeps rising , there are no increases in bank accounts or other debts or assets that can account for where the money goes every month .
In the first BK , filed just over a year and half after the purchase of the home and a year after the first foreclosure attempt , Balderrama 's debt - to - income ratio as a mortgage lender would calculate it was 41 % , including the Chapter 13 payment .
By the last BK , the DTI was 29 % .
There is no indication that Balderrama 's mortgage payment increased ; in fact if the debtor 's filing is correct it decreased ( from $ 1740 in the first filing to $ 1703 in the last ) .
It seems quite obvious that these filings were intended solely to stay foreclosure rather than to deal with crippling debt payments and reduced income .
Yet Balderrama never cooperated with the court or made an effort to make payments , resulting in serial dismissals .
Even on the assumption that the household budget in a Chapter 13 is often unrealistically tight , I just can't see from the paperwork why the Balderramas could n't pay their house and car payment and the arrearage installments .
Are these folks debt - bingers ?
Apparently not .
They 've had exactly two debts in the last six years : a house payment and a car payment .
Did they buy an overpriced home with a mortgage that instantly went upside down ?
It does n't look like it .
If Zillow is to be believed , the mortgage has never been upside down and was probably quite close to break - even when the foreclosure was completed ( including arrearages in the loan amount ) .
Victims of job loss or serious illness ?
Does n't look like it .
Victims of a predatory lender squeezing them with an exploding ARM in a falling RE market ?
The BK paperwork suggests that that claim is ridiculous .
Nonetheless , by this morning ABC news got ahold of the story .
A new detail : But for one reason or another , it appeared that Carlene Balderrama decided to deal with the family 's flagging finances on her own .
O'Berg [ our ubiquitous cop quote - bot ] said that according to Balderrama 's husband , John , Carlene handled all of the family 's financial matters .
" I had no clue , " John Balderrama told The Associated Press on Wednesday , adding that Carlene had hidden from him the fact that she had n't paid the mortgage in 42 months .
Mr. Balderrama filed two bankruptcies during the last 42 months .
But he had no idea his mortgage payments were in arrears ?
Are we supposed to believe that Carlene Balderrama forged her husband 's signature on the BK filings and suborned the perjury of at least one attorney ?
How else do we square this claim of ignorance with the BK records ?
Little details like that , however , do n't stop the ABC reporter or his psychologist quote - bots : " Suicide is certainly a response to hard economic times , " noted Dr. Harold Koenig , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , N.C. " Consider what happened when the stock market fell in 1929 .
There was a rash of suicides . "
Well , John Kenneth Galbraith labelled that " rash of suicides " a " myth " in 1955 , and if anyone has more recent hard data that says otherwise , I 'd like to see it .
Before we construct another myth about the Great RE Crash of 2008 with the same kind of " data . "
I do not doubt for a moment that Carlene Balderrama was under severe psychological stress .
Whatever kept her going through six years of an inability to make her mortgage payments , clearly the reality of the day of foreclosure sale was too much to bear .
What I do object to is the transformation of this story into an urban legend about " predatory lenders " and the effects of an RE downturn based on no evidence whatsoever .
I object to these reporters ' unwillingness to deal with the facts available to them that surely complicate this currently popular narrative .
I object to cops running off at the mouth with unsubstantiated claims and a husband and his co-worker heaping blame for the family 's financial woes on a dead woman who can no longer defend herself , and I surely object to it when it gets used to slander a mortgage servicer who was , apparently , the only party involved who ever took this woman seriously enough to call 911 .
If anybody can explain to me how this series of reports on Carlene Balderrama 's suicide are anything other than exploitation of her tragedy in order to support an overwrought rhetoric that sees every foreclosure that has occurred in the last year or so as " predatory " and " unnecessary , " then please do so in the comments .
I am not seeing it .
When P Diddy started going to Ibiza and hanging out with Dutch trance DJ Armin van Buuren a few years ago , some people thought he was crazy .
It turns out he definitely is crazy , although he was right about one thing - the trance / hip - hop connection has since taken off in the US .
Over the last year or so , a number of trance - influenced rap songs have surfaced via labels like Alabama 's Paper Route Recordz and Slow Motion Soundz .
Early standouts included Lookin ' Good by Amp G , Bama Gettin ' Money by Hood Headlinaz and the amazing Robert Miles - sampling Rollin by Jackie Chan feat .
Jhi Ali ( below ) .
The arpeggiated trance - rap of Wes Fif and B.O.B's Haterz became a cult hit and later B.O.B made a video for the song with rapper Rich Boy .
Following this , Pittsburgh - based rapper Wiz Khalifa obviously decided things were n't cheesy enough so sampled Alice Deejay 's pop trance chart hit Better Off Alone for his single Say Yeah .
And then when it looked like things could n't get any more ridiculous along came Princess , of Atlanta outfit Crime Mob , with her Eurotrance - sampling tween - friendly club track Pretty Rave Girl .
So why on earth are these rappers so keen on these really euphoric , uplifting hip - hop tracks ?
I 'm blaming ecstasy .
According to Atlanta rapper Lil Jon , for years ecstasy has been seeping into the Southern hip - hop scene through strip clubs .
The club owners would give pills to their dancers to keep them dancing all night and then eventually the guys going to the clubs started taking them too .
There 's even a dance called the Bean Pop where girls mimic putting pills in their mouth .
It seems as if the music became more euphoric to match the mood of the people in the clubs .
After all , nobody wants to listen to DJ Screw when their brain is ready to jump out of their mouth so it can breakdance on the floor .
Trance - influenced hip - hop ( trance - hop , if you will ) has also infiltrated the mainstream .
Timbaland 's The Way I Are and Usher 's Love in This Club both had riffs which would n't sound out of place in an Armin van Buuren set .
Everything seems to have gone quiet on the trance - hop front for the last few months though .
Is the fad coming to an end ?
It may be , unless P Diddy gets any ideas about starting a Dutch Danity Kane - esque trance - rap supergroup going .
He 's certainly crazy enough to think it might work .
Dr McDonald , a comic novelist and a senior lecturer in creative writing , added : " We began with the assumption that the oldest forms of jokes just would not have modern day appeal , but a lot of them do .
The stock market is faltering and house prices are on the edge of a precipice .
Could cannabis smokers be the unlikely saviours of the British economy ?
A major new study is being used to advise well known household and high - street companies about the gains and losses they face as cannabis smoking becomes commonplace .
Research has revealed that Britain's ' cannabis economy ' is worth £ 5 billion a year in sales alone .
Now it has been discovered that a further £ 6bn of consumer expenditure each year is closely linked to the growing cannabis - users ' market .
' Young people between 15 and 30 are very trend - conscious and aspirational , ' said Andy Davidson , who commissioned the study for The Research Business International , trend analysts who tracked the spending habits of young people for six months .
The study found that cannabis users spend an average of £ 20 on products that accompany their drug use each time they smoke .
Because smoking cannabis heightens appetite , users are providing a £ 120 million weekly windfall to a string of takeaway food suppliers , such as Domino and Pizza Hut , and manufacturers of ' munchie ' products such as Mars bars and Haribo jellies .
Video suppliers and manufacturers of home entertainments such as PlayStation and Nintendo GameCube are also benefiting from the need of a generation of users to keep themselves occupied at home while their drug of choice remains unlawful .
' Some of these brands benefit at the moment , ' said Davidson , ' but if people become more willing to smoke in public when the law is relaxed next year , they may be hit . '
The Government has announced that cannabis will be ' downgraded ' to a class C drug next summer making arrest and prosecution for possession less likely .
The move follows a controversial experiment in Lambeth , south London , where police attention focused on hard drug users and suppliers rather than cannabis smokers .
' Cannabis users also have discretionary expenditure of tens of millions of pounds each week on places to meet and eat , ' said Davidson .
' They do n't like shiny , noisy environments with lots of choices such as McDonald's .
On the whole , they prefer somewhere with low - key lighting and a straightforward menu .
' And they do n't like venues solely devoted to heavy drinking .
That does n't mean that they wo n't still go out for a big night once a week , but they avoid the sort of pubs that have heavy bouncers on the door . '
Many cannabis users also avoid high alcohol drinks , even strong lagers .
' Thursday is now my biggest night , ' reported a 22 - year old woman from London .
' I hate Saturday , it 's full of idiots , it 's expensive .
That 's when I love to stay at home and smoke [ cannabis ] . '
' I do n't visit big chain bars any more , ' said Anthony Green , a student from Leicester .
' They 're very intolerant of anything that 's outside their obvious remit of drinking and pulling .
' When we use cannabis at home , there are some things we always consume at the same time .
Red Bull or smoothies , for example , and takeaway food .
There 's a sort of conspiracy between consumers and retailers nowadays .
You know why you buy these things and they know why you 're buying these things , but no one says anything . '
Drug use may even affect radio and TV scheduling in future , the research suggests .
A typical 24 - year old male admitted : ' I 've started taking much more interest in the Discovery Channel .
Cannabis really gets you thinking deeply about things . '
Government research has already confirmed that more than 15 million people in Britain have tried cannabis .
There are six million regular users , more people than attend church , play Sunday league football or go jogging .
TRBI 's Project Edge is the first study which has openly monitored cannabis use for commercial , rather than medical , purposes .
Tobacco companies have worked secretly for years on trials of cannabis cigarettes , in spite of the fact that their scientists working on the projects risk arrest for drug possession .
However , manufacturers such as Imperial Tobacco still insist that their ' King Size ' Rizla cigarette papers are intended solely for making handmade cigarettes rather than rolling joints .
Carl Ratcliff of advertising agency TBWA said : ' As cannabis gets closer to decriminalisation , you 'll see more brands recognising that through their advertising .
It wo n't be explicit , but will be heavily implicit in terms of the signs and symbols that they use . '
' It 's no longer a moral issue , ' said Davidson .
' Businesses targeting the youth market can no longer ignore the fact that almost half of their customer base is getting stoned every day .
They need to make specific projections about how that affects them . '
Today , everyone wants to get out of the foreign oil money pit .
We talk about reducing the use of petroleum through conservation , building cars with better mileage or developing alternative fuels that will not pollute or at least produce less pollution .
That ’s good , but the cost of oil and emissions are not the only problems with automobiles .
We have congestion ; accidents with injuries and deaths , and courts tied up with the resultant lawsuits ; acres of land devoted to roads and parking ; high costs to buy , insure and maintain a car ; and lack of mobility for those who are unable or unwilling to drive .
In the near future , 70 million of us will enter retirement , and inevitably some of us will lose the ability to drive a car , whether from physical disability , poverty or denial of insurance .
We will need something better than the auto -- and better is here , now .
It ’s a “ podcar , ” also called “ personal rapid transit ” -- a system of vehicles that provide on - demand , private , nonstop travel .
These vehicles can carry people or light freight .
They ride on small , overhead guideways -- like a monorail or people mover -- above existing roads , and are powered entirely by electricity .
Picture the car as an elevated , driverless taxi .
It ’s under computer control , so there would be no accidents , thereby saving lives and lowering insurance costs .
Podcars operate on demand , waiting at off - line stations ; they can be summoned if one is not available when you arrive at the station .
Each vehicle can hold four people , yet the system can be cost - effective even with a single rider for each trip .
The capital cost is low , about $ 25 million to $ 40 million a mile for the first systems , which include guideways , vehicles and stations , compared to $ 100 million to $ 300 million a mile for light - rail or subway systems .
Because it operates over existing streets and sidewalks , there are few costs for rights of way or taking of private property .
It is also inexpensive to operate and thus can be available 24/7 and still make an operating profit , depending on pricing policies .
Detractors say it ca n’t be done :
That to be cost - effective , public transit must mass large groups of people together to travel to the same place ; that a podcar system would be too complex and expensive ; that an elevated guideway would be ugly .
The naysayers have n’t done their homework .
A podcar system called ULTra is being built at London ’s Heathrow airport .
Vectus , a Korean podcar , is being tested in Uppsala , Sweden .
One or both of these systems may be used in the Masdar eco-city in the United Arab Emirates that is being planned as the world ’s first auto - free , carbon - free new town .
This indicates that those who are buying the systems believe they are cost - effective even in the more costly early stages of development .
Visual intrusion is in the eye of the beholder , but the small scale of podcar guideways makes them unobtrusive over city streets and sidewalks .
Existing wires and street lighting also could be run through the guideway , reducing visual clutter .
Although the ultimate goal would be a network connected to serve most of the urbanized population of an area such as Los Angeles , the first small podcar networks could enhance existing rail and bus systems by providing an easy and convenient way for passengers to get to their final destination when they leave the larger system .
The existing rail system might be better patronized if passengers had a podcar system connecting Union Station with the rest of downtown .
Another system could link the Green Line , hotels , airport parking and car rentals with LAX .
Such connections could be created rapidly as guideways are built in factories and then bolted onto pre-staged footings .
A city block can be completed in a day and an entire network completed in a few weeks or months , not years , as with rails .
Private developers , shopping malls , universities and industrial complexes also could build internal networks and connect them to the public network .
Current public transit can only serve those who live near stations or bus lines and who want to travel where and when the system operates .
That ’s why most people prefer a car that ’s available 24/7 , if we can drive and can afford the gas .
There have been no significant service innovations in public transit in more than 100 years .
Streetcar , subway and rail systems were introduced in the 19th century .
Even the monorail , often seen as something new , was first used in Germany in 1901 .
Buses were introduced in London in 1905 , and automobile use became widespread in the U.S. in the 1920s .
Podcars offer a new kind of service , providing the convenience of an auto without the negatives for the individual -- costly to purchase plus high costs for gasoline , insurance , maintenance and parking .
For society , podcars would reduce the use of petroleum as well as pollution , congestion , accidents , injuries and deaths .
With governments in Europe and South Korea already supporting this development , the U.S. needs to get onboard and begin test runs on the podcar designs being created in this country .

FINANCE houses set out to be monuments of stone and steel .
In the widening gyre the greatest of them have splintered into matchwood .
Ten short days saw the nationalisation , failure or rescue of what was once the world 's biggest insurer , with assets of $ 1 trillion , two of the world 's biggest investment banks , with combined assets of another $ 1.5 trillion , and two giants of America 's mortgage markets , with assets of $ 1.8 trillion .
The government of the world 's leading capitalist nation has been sucked deep into the maelstrom of its most capitalist industry .
And it looks overwhelmed .
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch 's rapid sale to Bank of America were shocking enough .
But the government rescue of American International Group ( AIG ) , through an $ 85 billion loan at punitive interest rates thrown together on the evening of September 16th , marked a new low in an already catastrophic year .
AIG is mostly a safe , well - run insurer .
But its financial - products division , which accounted for just a fraction of its revenues , wrote enough derivatives contracts to destroy the firm and shake the world .
It helps explain one of the mysteries of recent years : who was taking on the risk that banks and investors were shedding ?
Now we know .
Yet AIG 's rescue has done little to banish the naked fear that has the markets in its grip .
Pick your measure — the interest rates banks charge to lend to each other , the extra costs of borrowing and of insuring corporate debt , the flight to safety in Treasury bonds , gold , financial stocks : all register contagion .
On September 17th HBOS , Britain 's largest mortgage lender , fell into the arms of Lloyds TSB for a mere £ 12 billion ( $ 22 billion ) , after its shares pitched into the abyss that had swallowed Lehman and AIG .
Other banks , including Morgan Stanley and Washington Mutual , looked as if they would suffer the same fate .
Russia said it would lend its three biggest banks 1.12 trillion roubles ( $ 44 billion ) .
An American money - market fund , supposedly the safest of safe investments , this week became the first since 1994 to report a loss .
If investors flee the money markets for Treasuries , banks will lose funding and the contagion will suck in hedge funds and companies .
A brave man would see catharsis in all this misery ; a wise man would not be so hasty .
The blood - dimmed tide
Some will argue that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury , nationalising the economy faster than you can say Hugo Chávez , should have left AIG to oblivion .
Amid this contagion that would have been reckless .
Its contracts — almost $ 450 billion - worth in the credit - default swaps market alone — underpin the health of the world 's banks and investment funds .
The collapse of its insurance arm would hit ordinary policyholders .
At the weekend the Fed and the Treasury watched Lehman Brothers go bankrupt sooner than save it .
In principle that was admirable — capitalism requires people to pay for their mistakes .
But AIG was bigger and the bankruptcy of Lehman had set off vortices and currents that may have contributed to its downfall .
With the markets reeling , pragmatism trumped principle .
Even though it undermined their own authority , the Fed and the Treasury rightly felt they could not say no again .
What happens next depends on three questions .
Why has the crisis lurched onto a new , destructive path ?
How vulnerable are the financial system and the economy ?
And what can be done to put finance right ?
It is no hyperbole to say that for an inkling of what is at stake , you have only to study the 1930s .
Shorn of all its complexity , the finance industry is caught between two brutally simple forces .
It needs capital , because assets like houses and promises to pay debts are worth less than most people thought .
Even if some gain from falling asset prices , lenders and insurers have to book losses , which leaves them needing money .
Finance also needs to shrink .
The credit boom not only inflated asset prices , it also inflated finance itself .
The financial - services industry 's share of total American corporate profits rose from 10 % in the early 1980s to 40 % at its peak last year .
By one calculation , profits in the past decade amounted to $ 1.2 trillion more than you would have expected .
This industry will not be able to make money after the boom unless it is far smaller — and it will be hard to make money while it shrinks .
No wonder investors are scarce .
The brave few , such as sovereign - wealth funds , who put money into weak banks have lost a lot .
Better to pick over their carcasses than to take on their toxic assets — just as Britain 's Barclays walked away from Lehman as a going concern , only to swoop on its North American business after it failed .
The centre cannot hold
Governments will thus often be the only buyers around .
If necessary , they may create a special fund to manage and wind down troubled assets .
Yet do not underestimate the cost of rescues , even necessary ones .
Nobody would buy Lehman unless the government offered them the sort of help it had provided JPMorgan Chase when it saved Bear Stearns .
The nationalisation that , for good reason , wiped out Fannie 's and Freddie 's shareholders has made it riskier for others to put fresh equity into ailing banks .
The only wise recapitalisation just now is an outright purchase , preferably by a retail bank backed by deposits insured by the government — as with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch , Lloyds and HBOS and , possibly , Wachovia with Morgan Stanley .
The bigger the bank , the harder that is .
Most of all , each rescue discourages investors from worrying about the creditworthiness of those they trade with — and thus encourages the next excess .
For all the costs of a rescue , the cost of failure to the economy would sometimes be higher .
As finance shrinks , credit will be sucked out of the economy and without credit , people cannot buy houses , run businesses or as easily invest in the future .
So far the American economy has held up .
The hope is that the housing bust is nearing its bottom and that countries like China and India will continue to thrive .
Recent falls in the price of oil and other commodities give central banks scope to cut interest rates — as China showed this week .
But there is a darker side , too .
Unemployment in America rose to 6.1 % in August and is likely to climb further .
Industrial production fell by 1.1 % last month ; and the annual change in retail sales is at its weakest since the aftermath of the 2001 recession .
Output is shrinking in Japan , Germany , Spain and Britain , and is barely positive in many other countries .
On a quarterly basis , prices are falling in half of the 20 countries in The Economist 's house - price index .
Emerging economies ' stocks , bonds and currencies have been battered as investors fret that they will no longer be “ decoupled ” from the rich countries .
Unless policymakers blunder unforgivably — by letting “ systemic ” institutions fail or by keeping monetary policy too tight — there is no need for today 's misery to turn into a new Depression .
A longer - term worry is the inevitable urge to regulate modern finance into submission .
Though understandable , that desire is wrong and dangerous — and the colossal success of commerce in the emerging world ( see article ) shows how much there is to lose .
Finance is the brain of the economy .
For all its excesses , it allocates resources to where they are productive better than any central planner ever could .
Regulation is necessary , and much must now be done to improve the laws of finance .
But it must be the right regulation : an end to America 's fragmented system of oversight ; more transparency ; capital requirements that lean against booms and flex with busts ; supervision of giants , like AIG , that are too big and too interconnected to fail ; accounting that values risks better and that everyone accepts ; clearing houses and exchanges to make derivatives safer and less opaque .
All that would count as progress .
But naive faith in regulators ' powers creates ruinous false security .
Financiers know more than regulators and their voices carry more weight in a boom .
Banks can exploit the regulations ' inevitable blind spots : assets hidden off their balance sheets , or insurance ( such as that provided by AIG ) which enables them to profit by sliding out of the capital requirements the regulators set .
It is no accident that both schemes were at the heart of the crisis .
This is a black week .
Those of us who have supported financial capitalism are open to the charge that the system we championed has merely enabled a few spivs to get rich .
But it helped produce healthy economic growth and low inflation for a generation .
It would take a very big recession indeed to wipe out those gains .
Do not forget that in the debate ahead .
The financial crisis gripping the U.S. has the largest banks and insurance companies begging for massive government bailouts .
The banking , investment , finance and insurance industries , long the foes of taxation , now need money from working - class taxpayers to stay alive .
Taxpayers should be in the driver ’s seat now .
Instead , decisions that will cost people for decades are being made behind closed doors , by the wealthy , by the regulators and by those they have failed to regulate .
Tuesday , the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to a massive , $ 85 - billion bailout of AIG , the insurance giant .
This follows the abrupt bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the 158 - year - old investment bank ; the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America ; the bailout of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ; the collapse of retail bank IndyMac ; and the federally guaranteed buyout of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase .
AIG was deemed “ too big to fail , ” with 103,000 employees and more than $ 1 trillion in assets .
According to regulators , an unruly collapse could cause global financial turmoil .
U.S. taxpayers now own close to 80 percent of AIG , so the orderly sale of AIG will allow the taxpayers to recoup their money , the theory goes .
It ’s not so easy .
The financial crisis will most likely deepen .
More banks and giant financial institutions could collapse .
Millions of people bought houses with shady subprime mortgages and have already lost or will soon lose their homes .
The financiers packaged these mortgages into complex “ mortgage - backed securities ” and other derivative investment schemes .
Investors went hog - wild , buying these derivatives with more and more borrowed money .
Nomi Prins used to run the European analytics group at Bear Stearns and also worked at Lehman Brothers .
“ AIG was acting not simply as an insurance company , ” she told me .
“ It was acting as a speculative investment bank / hedge fund , as was Bear Stearns , as was Lehman Brothers , as is what will become Bank of America / Merrill Lynch .
So you have a situation where it ’s [ the U.S. government ] … taking on the risk of items it cannot even begin to understand . ”
She went on : “ It ’s about taking on too much leverage and borrowing to take on the risk and borrowing again and borrowing again , 25 to 30 times the amount of capital . …
They had to basically back the borrowing that they were doing . …
There was no transparency to the Fed , to the SEC , to the Treasury , to anyone who would have even bothered to look as to how much of a catastrophe was being created , so that when anything fell , whether it was the subprime mortgage or whether it was a credit complex security , it was all below a pile of immense interlocked , incestuous borrowing , and that ’s what is bringing down the entire banking system . ”
As these high - rolling gamblers are losing all their banks ’ money , it comes to the taxpayer to bail them out .
A better use of the money , says Michael Hudson , professor of economics at the University of Missouri , Kansas City , and an economic adviser to Rep. Dennis Kucinich , would be to “ save these 4 million homeowners from defaulting and being kicked out of their houses .
Now they ’re going to be kicked out of the houses .
The houses will be vacant .
The cities are going to [ lose ] property taxes , they ’re going to have to cut back local expenditures , local infrastructure .
The economy is being sacrificed to pay the gamblers . ”
Prins elaborated : “ You ’re nationalizing the worst portion of the banking system . …
You ’re taking on risk you wo n’t be able to understand .
So it ’s even more dangerous . ”
I asked Prins , in light of all this nationalization , to comment on the prospect of nationalizing health care into a single - payer system .
She responded , “ You could actually put some money into something that pre-empts a problem happening and helps people get health care . ”
The meltdown is a bipartisan affair .
Presidential contenders John McCain and Barack Obama each have received millions of dollars from these very companies that are collapsing and are receiving the corporate welfare .
President Clinton and his treasury secretary , Robert Rubin ( now an Obama economic adviser ) , presided over the repeal in 1999 of the Glass - Steagall Act , passed after the 1929 start of the Great Depression to curb speculation that caused that calamity .
The repeal was pushed through by former Republican Sen. Phil Gramm , one of McCain ’s former top advisers .
Politicians are too dependent on Wall Street to do anything .
The people who vote for them , and whose taxes are being handed over to these failed financiers , need to show their outrage and demand that their leaders truly put “ country first ” and bring about “ change . ”

ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
Republicans launched their first night of full - scale conventioneering Tuesday by praising party standard - bearer John McCain 's experience and attacking Democratic rival Barack Obama .
Fred Thompson on Tuesday night lauded John McCain 's career as a naval officer and politician .

Republican leaders also strongly defended vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , the Alaska governor who was McCain 's surprise addition to the ticket last week over better - known contenders like former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty .
Palin has won plaudits from many influential conservatives for her opposition to abortion and her pro-business record .
But Palin has also grabbed headlines for Monday 's revelation that her unmarried teenaged daughter is pregnant .
Actor and former Sen. Fred Thompson , who briefly ran for president himself before dropping out in January , gave the speech that most roused the tens of thousands of Republican faithful at the convention .
iReport.com :
What do you think of the speeches ?
" John McCain 's character has been tested like no other presidential candidate in the history of this nation , " Thompson said , contrasting him with Obama , whom he labeled the " most liberal , most inexperienced nominee to ever run for president . "
Of McCain , he said : " It 's pretty clear there are two questions we will never have to ask ourselves , ' Who is this man ? ' and ' Can we trust this man with the Presidency ? ' "
He recounted McCain 's years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , telling the story of the downed Navy flier 's fortitude in the face of physical and mental abuse .
" We hear a lot of talk about hope , " Thompson said , a reference to Obama 's main campaign theme .
" John McCain knows about hope .
That 's all he had to survive on . "
He praised McCain for advocating an increase in the number of U.S. troops in Iraq " at a point when the war in Iraq was going badly and the public lost confidence ... and now we are winning , " he said , prompting chants of " USA ! USA ! " from the crowd .
Thompson dismissed Obama as all talk , saying , " the Senate has always had more than its share of smooth talkers .
And big talkers .
And obviously , it still has . "
Watch Thompson criticize Obama »
McCain , by contrast , had earned his place in the world , Thompson said .
" The respect he is given around the world is not because of a teleprompter speech designed to appeal to American critics abroad but because of decades of clearly demonstrated character and statesmanship . "
Thompson never mentioned Obama by name .
The only speaker who did was independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman , a former Democrat who was Al Gore 's running mate in 2000 and who has been an vocal backer of his friend McCain this cycle .
iReport.com : ' I was moved '
Lieberman , speaking last on the program , prompted boos from the crowd by contrasting McCain and Obama 's positions on Iraq , the issue that most separates Lieberman from his former party .
" When others were silent , John McCain had the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in Iraq , " Lieberman said .
" Colleagues like Barack Obama were voting to cut off funding for our American troops on the ground . "
Conventioneers responded with their loudest boos of the night .
Lieberman also argued that Obama did not have McCain 's record of working with members of the opposing party .
" In the Senate , during the three - and - a - half years that Sen . Obama has been a member , he has not reached across party lines to accomplish anything significant , nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic Party to get something done , " Lieberman said .
Harry Reid , the Democratic leader in the Senate , bristled at the tone of the convention address .
" Sen . Reid was very disappointed in Sen. Lieberman 's speech tonight , " Reid spokesman Jim Manley told CNN .
" As the American people have made very clear , the last thing this country needs is another four years of the same old failed Bush - McCain policies of the past . "
Lieberman said McCain " is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward . "
Watch Lieberman ask voters to " come together for McCain " »
" God only made one John McCain , and he is his own man , " Lieberman said to cheers .
First lady Laura Bush undercut Obama 's campaign slogan as she praised her husband , President Bush .
" Thanks to the president 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , [ the ] number [ of Africans receiving AIDS medication ] is now nearly 2 million .
You might call that ' change you can really believe in , ' " the first lady said .
President Bush spoke to the convention by video link from the White House , where he said he was monitoring the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav .
He mentioned the September 11 terrorist attacks in his endorsement of McCain .
Watch Bush tell delegates McCain is ready to lead »
" We need a president who understands the lessons of September 11 , 2001 : that to protect America , we must stay on the offense , stop attacks before they happen and not wait to be hit again .
The man we need is John McCain , " he said .
He also mentioned McCain 's time as a prisoner of war , linking it to an explicitly partisan argument .
" Fellow citizens :
If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain 's resolve to do what is best for his country , you can be sure the angry left never will , " he said .
Democrats worked hard during their own convention last week to link McCain to Bush , who has historically low approval ratings .
Some pundits have suggested it was a stroke of luck for McCain that Bush was unable to appear in person at the convention .
There were never plans for the two men to appear together .
The last time an incumbent president skipped his party 's convention was in 1968 , when President Lyndon Johnson stayed at his Texas Ranch while Democrats met in Chicago .
But the Minnesota event was a reminder that Bush remains popular among the Republican faithful .
Kathi Thompson , the wife of a retired Army officer from Hawaii , said whatever you think of President Bush 's administration : " He never wavered , and what you see is what you get .
You can like it or not , but at least he is a man of conviction . "
Liz Tait from Houston , Texas , said " We 're extremely proud of him .
He kept us safe , and he fought for the values we believe in , " she said .
Bush and his wife both praised Palin as well as McCain .
Laura Bush hailed her as " a strong executive and a proven reformer . "
" I am proud that America 's first female vice president will be a Republican woman , " she said .
Fred Thompson called her " a breath of fresh air . "
" She is a courageous , successful reformer , who is not afraid to take on the establishment .
Sound like anyone else we know ? " he said .
" She has run a municipality and she has run a state , " he said , an apparent attempt to rebut claims that the 44 - year - old , who has been governor for less than two years , did not have enough experience for the White House .
Since her unexpected elevation to McCain 's running mate , Palin has won plaudits from many influential conservatives for her opposition to abortion , her pro-business record and her reputation as a reformer .
But she has also grabbed headlines for Monday 's revelation that her unmarried teenaged daughter is pregnant , as well as accusations she improperly used her position as governor to dismiss an underling , and the suggestion that she lobbied for pork - barrel spending to benefit the small town she led as mayor .
A gaffe from party leader did underscore Palin 's newcomer status , even among Republicans .
Republican National Committee co-chair Jo Ann Davidson mistakenly referred to the vice - presidential candidate as " Sarah Pawlenty , " merging her name with the Minnesota governor , who had been considered one of the front - runners for the slot .
Talking about how a woman first addressed a Republican Convention in 1892 , Davidson said : " Today , 116 years later , we are holding a convention that will nominate Republican woman Governor Sarah Pawlenty to be the next vice president . "
The Obama campaign criticized Republicans more for what they did not say in St. Paul than what they did say .
Watch highlights from the convention »
" At a time when millions of Americans are struggling like never before to pay their mortgage , their medical bills , and their gas bills , tonight 's speakers at John McCain 's Republican convention proved how out of touch their candidate is by saying not one word about his plans to put our economy back on track and provide real relief to middle - class families .
Apparently , John McCain 's belief that we 've made ' great progress ' economically over the last eight years means he does n't have to offer any plans at all to fix our ailing economy , " said Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor .
The convention roared to life on its second day after a muted start .
Planners thought it best to remain low - key on Monday as Hurricane Gustav was ripping across Louisiana .
McCain is due to speak on Thursday , the last night of the convention , to accept the party 's nomination .
CNN 's Dana Bash and Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report .
All About John McCain • Republican Party • Sarah Palin • George W. Bush
This is part 1 of what I intend to be something of a recurring theme : how to avoid the use of dynamic controls in ASP .
NET .
Whilst dynamic controls have their uses in a small number of cases , they come with a significant amount of extra baggage .
For example :
* Dynamic controls need to be created early in the page lifecycle to participate in viewstate
* Dynamic controls need to be re-created on each postback , and assigned the same control IDs to maintain viewstate
* Extracting values from dynamic controls on postback is not straightforward .
There are of course workarounds to all of the above obstacles - but the fact remains , if a built - in ASP .
NET control does , or can be coerced into doing , what you need , then the simpler approach should prevail .
I 'm often surprised by the number of times I see some code like this :
private void CreateTextBoxes ( int count )
{
TextBox tb = null ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < count ; i++)
{
tb = new TextBox ( ) ;
tb.ID = " txt " + i. ToString ( ) ;
this .Panel1.Controls .Add(tb ) ;
}
}
To dynamically create textboxes .
When asked why they are using dynamic controls , the coder will often reply ' because I do n't know how many textboxes I need until runtime ' .
This is , of course , a valid concern , but in this case , dynamic controls are usually not a good solution when a Repeater , DataList , or ListView control can be employed to the same effect , with much less effort .
For example , let ’s take the case of a page which initially loads with a single textbox , but contains a button which allows the user to add additional textboxes at runtime .
To show how much easier the solution is using built - in .NET controls , I started by adding a ListView control to the page , and edited its ItemTemplate and LayoutTemplate like so :
< asp : ListView ID = " lvDynamicTextboxes " runat =" server "
ItemPlaceholderID = " itemPlaceholder " > < LayoutTemplate > < table > < asp : PlaceHolder ID = " itemPlaceholder "
runat = " server " ></ asp : PlaceHolder > </ table > </ LayoutTemplate > < ItemTemplate > < tr > < asp : TextBox ID = " txtText " runat = " server " > </ asp : TextBox > </ tr > </ ItemTemplate >
</ asp : ListView >
Next up , I added a button to the page , which will be used to add new textboxes :
< asp:Button ID = " btnAddTextBox " runat =" server "
Text = " Add " onclick = " btnAddTextBox_Click " />
I then created two methods - one for binding the ListView , and one for incrementing the current textbox count , which I chose to store using ViewState :
private void BindListView ( )
{
// get the current textbox count int count = 1 ;
if ( ViewState [ " textboxCount " ] != null )
count = ( int ) ViewState [ " textboxCount " ] ;
// create an enumerable range based on the current count IEnumerable < int > enumerable = Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , count ) ;
// bind the listview this .lvDynamicTextboxes .DataSource = enumerable ;
this .lvDynamicTextboxes.DataBind ( ) ;
}
private void IncrementTextboxCount ( )
{
int count = 1 ;
if ( ViewState [ " textboxCount " ] != null )
count = ( int ) ViewState [ " textboxCount " ] ;
count ++;
ViewState [ " textboxCount " ] = count ;
}
You will notice in the above that I ’m using the Enumerable .
Range ( ) method which is located within the System .
Linq namespace in the .NET framework 3.0 and greater .
This is used to automatically create an integer collection with a specified range : a quick and easy way of generating a datasource for these purposes .
The only thing left to do now , is bind the ListView in the page load , and increment the TextBox count and rebind when the button is clicked :
protected void Page_Load ( object sender , EventArgs e )
{
if (! Page .IsPostBack )
{
this .BindListView ( ) ;
}
}
protected void btnAddTextBox_Click ( object sender , EventArgs e )
{
this .
IncrementTextboxCount ( ) ;
this .BindListView ( ) ;
}
“ But … hang on a minute ” , you might well say , “ that ’s actually more code than I needed before , using dynamic controls " .
Well , yes , it is .
But the real gains come when you need to extract the values from the textboxes you have dynamically created .
Using dynamic controls , this gets very ugly very quickly .
Using a ListView , you need only to iterate through the ListView ’s data items , and extract the textbox values from the data rows , like so :
private IList < string > GetValues ()
{
List < string > values = new List < string >( ) ;
TextBox txt = null ;
foreach ( ListViewItem item in this .lvDynamicTextboxes .
Items )
{
if ( item is ListViewDataItem )
{
txt = ( TextBox ) item . FindControl( " txtText " ) ;
values .
Add( txt . Text ) ;
}
}
return values ;
}
And that ’s all there is to it .
For preserving the values of the textboxes between postbacks , see part 2 .
Of course .
Fan-fucking - tastic :
Treasury officials do not plan to manage the mortgage assets on their own .
Instead , they will outsource nearly all of the work to professionals ...
The government will hire only a bare - bones internal staff of about two dozen people with expertise in asset management , accounting and legal issues , according to administration officials , and will outsource the bulk of the program to 5 to 10 asset management firms ...
[ W] ith $ 700 billion to disburse , the plan could still generate tens of billions of dollars in fees if the firms negotiate anywhere close to their standard fees .
I want somebody in the Secretary of Defense office who has enough credibility to sell our military on the idea that we ’re really going to be serious about making progress on those other elements of security that have been neglected under the Bush administration .
I want also that Secretary of Defense to be someone who has the confidence of mid-rank officers and troops on the ground that their interests are being looked after .
That they are not just being sent into missions based on ideology or based on preconceived notions , but that somebody is their advocate .
One of the things that has happened during the course of this campaign is that you meet remarkable young men and women who have been doing everything that we ’ve asked of them , made enormous sacrifices and oftentimes they do n’t feel as if those in the higher ranks are thinking about them , certainly do n’t feel as if they are being thought about after they leave . ”
Q . In your book , you refer to your January 2006 visit to Iraq , I think that ’s the last time you were there .
Why ….
A. Given how important this is , why have n’t I gone back ?
Q . If you think of all the things that have happened since January ’ 06 , there was the bombing of the mosque in Samara , the rise of the sectarian violence , the replacement of General Casey with General Petraeus , the introduction of the so - called surge strategy , this whole business of Anbar and the rise of the tribes and working with former insurgents has all emerged since then .
There ’s been enormous changes there , although it ’s still an extremely difficult situation .
Why have n’t you returned , given the centrality of this issue to the campaign ?
A. I ’ll be honest with you .
Part of it is that my schedule is such that the trips would be one or two days and would be centered primarily around the Green Zone .
We might take a helicopter and drop in for a moment somewhere and then come back out .
There has n’t been the sense that the information that I was going to be getting there was going to be significantly different than the information that I ’m getting here .
But it is something that what I know I have missed form the trips there is the interaction with the troops .
So I ’m seeing the troops here , but I have n’t seen the troops in Iraq in quite some time and I think that ’s something that we ’d like to make happen .
Q. Does that mean you ’re going back to Iraq ?
A. I suspect we will be going back .
It probably wo n’t be before Iowa , realistically speaking .
Q. Obviously , there is an enormous desire among Democratic base to pull American forces out of Iraq ...
On the other hand , no one wants to give Al Qaeda in Iraq any kind of a free hand .
But I wonder as you think through this mission , how realistic it really is to posit a counter terrorism capability for Iraq , outside of Iraq and to have such a small force ?
.... One is an intelligence issue .
The way the U.S. military gathers intelligence about Al Qaeda now is really being in and around the country with the population .
It ’s a means of deriving human intelligence and if you do n’t have that , you ’re essentially relying entirely on the Iraqis or .... reconnaissance systems from above , so it limits your access to intelligence .
Certainly , it limits your responsiveness if you ’re not in the country .
And also , when they do counter terrorism in Iraq now , it ’s not simply an operation by special operations forces ..... If you think back to the Democratic critique of the Bush administration ’s performance in Afghanistan , when bin Laden got away , that was a mission when we relied entirely on special operations forces and local forces and did n’t have sufficient troops to capture anyone or cordon an area off , which makes me wonder how effective a counterterrorism mission can be without a conventional capability in country .
Lastly , if there is progress toward political accommodation , you are going to assume the role of training the Iraqi military to some extent , which means you ’re going to have a substantial number of trainers in and among these Iraqi forces … .
Politico is reporting that the Democrats are on track to potentially reach a super - majority of sixty seats in the U.S. Senate .
Sixty is a very important number in the Senate because it neuters any attempt by the opposing party to block legislation by eliminating the opportunity to filibuster .
If Barack Obama is elected President , such a super - majority in both houses of Congress would give him the type of free reign that allowed Franklin Roosevelt to pass the New Deal during the Great Depression .
The United States could be on the verge of a major change in electoral politics and political direction .
The House of Representatives is likely to have a huge Democratic majority come January .
The question is the Senate .
A few months ago , sixty was seen as an impossible stretch for Democrats .
Now , it is ever more likely .
Sixty is the magic number to stop filibusters by the opposition party .
The term first came into use in the United States Senate , where Senate rules permit a senator , or a series of senators , to speak for as long as they wish and on any topic they choose , unless a supermajority of three - fifths of the Senate ( 60 Senators , if all 100 seats are filled ) brings debate to a close by invoking cloture .

The blogsite Five Thirty Eight is reporting that Democrats are now leading in a number of tight races where the Republicans had previously led .
The Democrats have gained ground in several races this week , including North Carolina , where for the first time we have Kay Hagan listed as a favorite to unseat Elizabeth Dole , New Hampshire , where Jeanne Shaheen appears to have bounced back after some tight polling in mid-September , and Mississippi , where Rasmussen shows the race closing to two points .
In addition , polling in Georgia and Texas indicates that those races may be viable pickup opportunities in a wave election , and even Nebraska has tightened a bit , with that race retaining a fairly high percentage of undecideds .
– Five Thirty Eight
With seats like Elizabeth Dole ’s ( R - NC ) and Norm Coleman ’s ( R - MN ) now on the line , what is going to stop the Democrats from sweeping to New Deal - style power in November ?
The possibility that Democrats will build a muscular , 60 - seat Senate majority is looking increasing plausible , with new polls showing a powerful surge for the party ’s candidates in Minnesota , Kentucky and other states .
A poll out Friday shows Sen. Norm Coleman could now easily lose his Minnesota seat to comedian - turned - candidate Al Franken .
A Colorado race that initially looked like a nail - biter has now broken decisively for the Democrats .
A top official in the McCain camp told us Sen. Elizabeth Dole is virtually certain to lose in conservative North Carolina .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has seen his race tighten dangerously close over the past week — and Democrats are considering moving more money into the state very soon .
And there is even talk that Republican Sen.
Saxby Chambliss is beatable in conservative Georgia after backing the economic bailout package opposed by many voters .
“ Before the economic crisis , we had a number of races moving our way , ” said Matthew Miller , communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
“ But now we ’re seeing Republican numbers plummet . ” GOP officials largely agree .
Senate races do n’t grab national attention like the White House battle does .
But if these trends hold , the Senate outcome could be almost as important to Washington governance as the presidential winner will be .
It takes 60 votes to pass anything through the slow - moving Senate .
So the closer the Democrats get to the number , the more power they will have next year to put their stamp on the country .
Democrats say their candidates are benefiting from the wipeout on Wall Street with a single message in every region of the country : “ These are the Bush policies coming home to roost . ”
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , told Politico : “ Americans know that in economically difficult times , we need a change from George Bush ’s policies .
And incumbents who have voted for six years with Bush , up and down the line , are having a difficult time trying to convince the electorate that they ’ve changed their spots . ”
The trends reflect the growing fear of among top Republicans that their prospects could crater on Nov. 4 , with Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) running weakly at the top of the ticket , President Bush as unpopular as ever and the economic crisis serving as a last - minute propellant for the change message of Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
With Republicans fearing the loss of 17 to 21 House seats , January 2009 could bring Democrats a dominance over Washington that neither party has experienced since the Reagan years .

From relative obscurity , Textbook Torrents , the world 's largest BitTorrent index of textbooks , found itself in the world spotlight during July 2008 and was forced to close down by its host .
The site returned weeks later , growing massively in the process , but now , just a couple of months on , the site has closed for good .
Quietly and with little fuss , January 2007 saw the birth of TextBook Torrents , a relatively small site initially , offering a BitTorrent tracker dedicated to the indexing of textbooks .
In 6 months the site had accumulated 10,000 members .
Just 3 months later , the number of users had doubled to 20,000 and by January 2008 the membership doubled again to an impressive 40,000 .
By the end of June 2008 , almost 70,000 members were registered at TextBook Torrents and more and more people were becoming aware of its existence .
On July 1st 2008 , Jeff Young , a writer with The Chronicle of Higher Education , wrote an article entitled Textbook Piracy Grows Online , Prompting a Counterattack From Publishers .
The article focused on TextBook Torrents and it quickly gained traction after being picked up by Slashdot and subsequently , many other mainstream publications .
In this explosion of publicity the site ’s membership grew rapidly , but almost inevitably , the anti-piracy hawks began to circle .
Within days , Textbook Torrents ’ host and domain registrar received takedown requests .
At the time , Geekman , the admin of the tracker told TorrentFreak : “ We received a DMCA notice from Pearson Education a week or so prior , which we complied with , but it was a group of publishers that contacted our host . ”
On July 5th Dreamhost suspended Geekman ’s account and refused to speak with him and it took a week to even transfer the domain .
It took a month for the site to return .
“ I want to see the textbook industry change such that we are no longer needed , ” Geekman told Torrent Freak when we asked him in early August about his motivation to bring back the site .
Now , just 2 months later , visitors to the TextBook Torrents site this week were faced with the grim reality that the site has gone .
“ TextBook Torrents wo n’t be coming back , ” Geekman told Torrent Freak .
“ I ’ve been at it for two years and it has been an awesome two years , but i’m ready to step back and hopefully allow somebody else to rise up in our place . ”
Geekman told us that he felt that when it became clear to the copyright owners that simple threats to the site and its host would n’t be sufficient to close down the tracker , he himself became the next logical target :
“ We got word from several credible sources that there was a lawsuit in the works against myself personally , ” he explained .
Of course , when anyone invests a huge amount of work into a project , there will be some pain to endure when it comes to an end , and Geekman is no different .
“ It does hurt .
Textbook Torrents was my baby and one of my proudest projects , both personally and certainly as Geekman .
At the same time , running the site had become very demanding .
Since the attention last summer the site nearly doubled in size in 4 months from 60,000 to over 100,000 members .
In all honesty , it was all I could do to keep up with media interview requests . ”
Geekman told us that he was sorry to have to shut down the site without notice , but in the absence of others immediately stepping up to take over the running of the site , he had no alternative .
He also said that he was disappointed that nobody stepped in with a replacement site when TextBook Torrents was down for 3 weeks in August , but hopes that someone will do so now .
When asked if book publishers have learned anything from the whole affair , Geekman said he doubted that : “ Intellectual property corporations are notorious for missing the point .
Like I ’ve said before , we were out to make a statement , to give out as much free stuff as possible , and I think we ’ve made that statement – perhaps not as loudly as we could have given another few months and a little more perseverance – but certainly people have heard , and are talking .
Piracy will never be sustainable for the textbook industry , but perhaps this is the first step towards a more sustainable model in the future . ”
When a torrent site goes offline , especially when it ’s quite a quick shutdown , it ’s inevitable that users get nervous that somehow they could be implicated if the site ’s logs fall into the wrong hands .
However , ex-users of the site have absolutely nothing to fear in this respect : “ Textbook Torrents files , including logs and backups , have been permanently removed from all servers where they were stored , ” notes Geekman , “ We no longer have any data on the site or its users . ”
All donations made to the site have been secured for the possibility of mounting a legal defense , should the need arise .
However , once it ’s established that Geekman is in the clear , whatever money is left over will be donated to a textbook or education - related non-profit organization .
For his part , Geekman says he will ceremonially take the last $ 12 for himself , to cover the only thing he ever paid for on the site – the domain registration .
“ I ’m an activist , I ’ll freely admit it but I believe activism is about a lot more than parading around holding a sign , ” Geekman told Torrent Freak .
“ There are far more effective ways to get peoples ’ attention . ”
There can be no denying that TextBook Torrents did just that .

Print This Email This Senator Obama had choice words for Senator McCain 's Monday assertion that " the fundamentals of our economy are strong " in the wake of this week 's Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , the following 500 - point plunge in the Dow Jones , Bank of America 's Merrill Lynch buyout , and the American taxpayers ' underwriting of an $ 85 billion infusion into insurer AIG , the 18th - largest company in the world .
" Now , his campaign must have realized that probably this was n't the smartest thing to say on the day of a financial meltdown , " Obama said in Elko , Nevada today , " so they sent him back a few hours later to clean up his remarks .
" But it sounds like he got a little carried away , because yesterday John McCain actually said that if he 's President , he 'll take on , and I quote , ' the old boys ' network in Washington . '
I 'm not making this up .
This is somebody who 's been in Congress for 26 years who put seven of the most powerful Washington lobbyists in charge of his campaign .
And now , he tells us that he's the one who 's going to take on the ' old boys ' network ' .
The 'old boys network ! '
In the McCain campaign that 's called a ' staff meeting . '
Come on . "
" I reject the doom and gloom that says our nation is in decline , " Senator McCain said today at a General Motors factory in Lake Orion , Michigan .
" America 's best days are ahead of us . "
" We 're going to take care of the workers , " he added .
" They 're the ones that deserve our help . "
Sen . Obama went on to lampoon Sen. McCain's " anger " at greedy elements on Wall Street .
" He is so angry , " said Obama , " that he wants to punish them with $ 200 billion worth of tax cuts for them !
And if they 're not careful , he 'll give them even more tax cuts for shipping our jobs overseas .
" I mean , who 's he getting these lines from ?
The lobbyists who are running his campaign ?
Maybe it 's Phil Gramm .
Some of you know Phil Gramm , the man who was the architect of some of the deregulation in Washington that helped cause the mess on Wall Street . "
Former Texas Congressman and Senator Phil Gramm stepped down from his post as campaign co-chairman , though he remains an informal economic adviser , after his infamous July remarks calling the United States a " nation of whiners . "
" You 've heard of mental depression ; this is a mental recession , " Gramm told the Washington Times on July 9 , 2008 .
" We have sort of become a nation of whiners .
You just hear this constant whining , complaining about a loss of competitiveness , America in decline ...
We 've never been more dominant ; we 've never had more natural advantages than we have today . "
Gramm opined that the nation has " benefited greatly " from three decades of globalization .
" Misery sells newspapers , " Gramm went on .
" Thank God the economy is not as bad as you read in the newspaper every day . "

NyroModal v2 :: jQuery Plugin
Edito Designers seem to like using modal windows more and more , as they provide a quick way to show data without reloading the entire page .
It 's easy to use and easy to design .
The big problem I experienced with every plugin I tried either using Prototype / Scriptaculous or jQuery is the customization .
They say you can do whatever you want simply but that 's not fully true .
The default CSS works fine , but most of time it 's a mix between required elements and optional .
That mean you have to be very careful when editing it .
The other problem is the animation .
That 's the worst point .
I never found one plugin allowing to redefine easily the animations .
I tried to solve these problems with my plugin .
I documented everything possible .
Regarding the animations , you can simply redefine them from A to Z .
Thanks to the useful jQuery function like animate or fadeTo it 's pretty simple .
nyroModal v2 now works with filters that let you define totally new possibilities for the plugin about the way it should work .
like in the version 1 , you still have a bunch of callbacks that you can define in many different places .
Enough talk , let 's try it and learn it !

Usage
The plugin provide some functions to work with it : nyroModal ( ) ; is the basic function to set the click or submit function .
To add the nyroModal functionnality to all links containing in #container , you 'll do : $ ( ' # container a' ) .nyroModal ( ) ;
Think it 's too long ?
nyroModal comes with a shortcut for this exact same function , nm ( ) ; .
So you could also do : $ ( ' # container a ' ) . nm ( ) ;
As all jQuery plugin , the chain is not broken .
That mean you can use it like all other jQuery functions .
You can also set the settings as an object parameter to overwrite the default parameter .
Think it 's too long ?
nyroModal comes with a shortcut for this exact same function , nm ( ) ; .
So you could also do :
As all jQuery plugin , the chain is not broken .
That mean you can use it like all other jQuery functions .
You can also set the settings as an object parameter to overwrite the default parameter .
nmDestroy ( ) ; to remove all elements added by nyroModal ( only for closed modal ) .
nmCall( ) ; will execute the same action like a click in a real link or a submit form .
You can simulate an user click or create your modal content .
See demos to better understand .
If you read the code of this nmCall function , you 'll see that it simply trigger a nyroModal event like .
So doing the calling trigger ( ' nyroModal ' ) will do exactly the same .
$ .nmManual ( url , options ) ; let you , as you imagine , open a nyroModal with a single line .
Link filter required .
. $ .nm Data( data , options ) ; let you , as you imagine , open a nyroModal by defining your content a single line .
Link filter and data filter required .
. $.nmTop ( ) ; will give you the modal at the very top of the screen .
To close it , you will do : $.nmTop ( ) .close ( ) ;
In order to work , you will have to : Include nyroModal.css stylesheet
Include jQuery
Include jquery.nyroModal.js javaScript
Include jquery.nyromodal-ie6.js javascript for IE 6 compatibility .
You have to include it with conditionnal comment .
Bind your elements to be nyroModal ready
All the needed stuff in a few lines : < link rel= " stylesheet " href= " styles/nyroModal.css " type =" text / css " media= " screen " /> < script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js "></script> < script type =" text / javascript " src="js/jquery.nyroModal.custom.js " ></ script > <!--[ if IE 6 ] > < script type =" text / javascript " src="js/jquery.nyroModal-ie6.min.js " ></script > <![ endif ] --> < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ ( '.nyroModal ').nyroModal( ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Overwritting nyroModal
You can overwrite absolutely all nyroModal functions using : $ .nm Obj( opts ) ; to overwite the nnObject properties or function
$ .nmInternal ( opts ) ; to overwrite internal function such as calculate the size .
$ .nm Anims ( opts ) ; to overwrite animations set or overwite exting ones
$ .nm Filters ( opts ) ; to overwrite or add filters ( see below ) Filters Filters are used to provide many basics functionnality like Ajax download , but it alos let you the ability to fully customize the way nyroModal work , by adding as many callbacks as you need .
A filter is a set function that will be called by nyroModal core at many differents points .
These functions call be used to do everything needed to make the modal work as you excpet or to add others behaviors needed for your projet : add some elements inside the modal , updating your page content , add some Ajax call , etc ...
Here is how filters works :
When $ ( ' element ' ) .nyroModal( ) ; is called , the nyroModal object is created and attached to the DOM element instancied Every available filters are tested again the nyroModal object using the is function
If this function returns true , the filters will be used all the time for this element .
If it returns false , the filters will not be used anymore for this element .
nyroModal core calls every init function of every filters selected for the element
These init function should bind the event they need , create their own object if needed .
If the filters need to be the one used to load the content , the loadFilter setting of the nyroModal ovject should be defined to its name .
Througout the living of nyroModal , every function or callback defined in all selected filters will be called ( see the list below )
All function or callbacks receive the same nyroModal object as a unique parameter .
The list of all function or callback that can be called in a filter : is : should return true or false to select the filter for the current or element or not .
This function is REQUIRED !
! initFilters : called just after every filters have been determined to use or not , and just before the init of them .
Good place to force filters .
init : called at the very beggining of the process .
This function should bind element or create object needed later
initElts : called at the beggining of the open process , juste before the load start .
After that , all the needed div are created and attached to the DOM
load : called only for ONE filter defined in nm.loadFilter attribute .
This function should load the function and set it 's content using the _setCont function
function filledContent : called once the content is placed on the hidden div
error : called in case of error ( URL not founr for example )
size : called after the size has been defined
close : called at the end of the closing process , regarding only the data ( useful for gallery )
beforeClose : called at the beggining of the closing process , regarding the animation
afterClose : called at the end of the closing process , regarding the animation
keyHandle : called when a key is hit if the keyHandle is enable and if the modal is on the top
destroy : called when nmDestroy is called , it should unbind events that it added and remove all extra elements the filter added Like the version 1 , there is a bunch of others callback that you can define before and after every animation .
The version 2 put it in a new way by letting you the ability to define a function before and after every animation function .
beforeShowBg : called just before the showBg animation
afterShowBg : called just after the showBg animation
beforeHideBg : called just before the hideBg animation
afterHideBg : called just after the hideBg animation
beforeShowLoad : called just before the showLoad animation
afterShowLoad : called just after the showLoad animation
beforeHideLoad : called just before the hideLoad animation
afterHideLoad : called just after the hideLoad animation
beforeShowCont : called just before the showCont animation ( also called in case of a transition , before beforeHideTrans )
afterShowCont : called just after the showCont animation ( also called in case of a transition , after afterHideTrans )
afterReposition : called just after the .nmRepositon have been placed
afterUnreposition : called just after the .nmRepositon have been replaced on their initial positions
beforeHideCont : called just before the hideCont animation
afterHideCont : called just after the hideCont animation
beforeShowTrans : called just before the showTrans animation ( transition )
afterShowTrans : called just after the showTrans animation ( transition )
beforeHideTrans : called just before the hideTrans animation ( transition )
afterHideTrans : called just after the hideTrans animation ( transition )
beforeResize : called just before the resize animation
afterresize : called just after the resize animation nyroModal automatically add 2 filters for every elements : basic : used to provide basic functionnality .
This filter should n't be modified unless you know exactly what you 're doing
unless you know exactly what you 're doing custom :
This filter has absolutely no programming .
It 's added here juste to provide a quick way to add your filters callback
There is some some basic filters that you can use on your project that enable the basic usage of this kind of plugin .
Here is a list of the filters officially provided : Title :
Show the title for the modal using the title attribute of the opener element
Gallery : Enable arrows and navigation keys trough the element with the same rel attribute defined in the DOM ( depends on title )
Link : Bind an anchor element and load the target using Ajax to retrieve content
Dom : Instead of using Ajax , it get the content within the page using an id .
( exemple link : < a href= " #myContent " ></a >) ( depends on link )
Image : Show an image , and resize it if needed ( depends on link )
SWF : Show a SWf animation ( depends on link )
Form : Bind a form and load the target by sending it 's data trhough Ajax
Form file : Same as Form but used when form should send file
Iframe : Used to show data from an other domain name or when target = " _blank " is present ( depends on link )
Iframe form :
Used to open a form in an iframe ( depends iframe )
Embedly : Used to show a bunch of different element using embedly API ( Examples ) ( depends on link )
Using callbacks
To use callback , you can : define tour own filter , using the custom filter by adding the callback function you need define your own filter , enabling it when needed and write the callback you need
use the custom filter which is enabled everytime and use the $ .nm Filters ( ) ; function to add the callback you need
define your callbacks in the callbacks settings for the nyroModal object .
You can do this using the $ .nm Obj ( ) ; function for every nyroModal object or in the nyroModal parameter for activating them on specific links Misc
When using the gallery modal , you can use these code : $.nmTop ( ) ._callFilters ( ' galleryNext ' ) to go to the next element .
to go to the next element .
$ .nmTop ( )._callFilters ( ' galleryPrev' ) to go to the previous element .
When you open a modal using an Ajax request , the scripts included in the loaded page are executed folowing these rules :
If the modal is a targeting content , only the scripts inside this element are executed
If the modal is n't targeting :
All the inline script are executed
The scripts with a src attribute loading a javascript file are loaded only if the attribute rel= " forceLoad " is here .
This avoid the reload of jQuery for example
Embed.ly nyroModal uses the great Embed.ly API in order to show videos form many different websites .
To use this feature in nyroModal , you have to include the embed.ly filter first , and then set your API key .
If your API key is not set , nyroModal will simply ignore the Embed.ly filter .
To set your API key , is a simple single line of code that should be placed after including the nyroModal files , and before the initialization of links .
< script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ .nm Obj({embedly : {key : ' YOUR EMBED.LY KEY'}} ) ; } ) ; </ script >
To create your free API key , go to the embed.ly sign up page Caching embed.ly results
When you have a lots of embed.ly calls , you may rich the free API limit ( that 's actually the case of nyroModal ) .
To fix this problem , we can use a server - side script to retrieve the API result , store on it on the server , and send it to the user .
We created a simple PHP script to do so .
You can get it on github .
To use it , simply place this script on your server and configure it regarding your needs .
Finally , you have to indicates to nyroModal that the URL to use is a local URL .
You can do it with : < script type = " text / javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ .nm Obj ( { embedlyUrl : ' embedlyProxy.php ' , embedly : {key : ' php'} } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
The key still have to be set to work .
In this case , it will be defined in the PHP .
nmObject nmObject or nyroModal Object is an object associated with every DOM element that are nyroModal enabled .
This object is stored with the jQuery data function with the name of nmObj in the opner element .
This object provides many function useful for the life of the modal : resizing , closing , calling filters callbacks , etc ...
You can overwrite or add more functionnality to this object using the $ .nm Obj( options ) ; function , or when initializing the nyroModal with nyroModal ( options ) ; function ( or its synonymous : nm( options ) ; ) .
Here is the list of all parameter in this object : filters : [ ] , // List of filters used callbacks : {} , // Sepcific callbacks anims : {} , // Sepcific animations functions loadFilter : undefined , // Name of the filter used for loading enabled : true , // Indicates if it 's enabled or not modal : false , // Indicates if it 's a modal window or not closeOnEscape : true , // Indicates if the modal should close on Escape key closeOnClick : true , // Indicates if a click on the background should close the modal useKeyHandler : false , // Indicates if the modal has to handle key down event showCloseButton : true , // Indicates if the closeButonn should be added closeButton : ' < a href= " # " class= " nyroModalClose nyroModalCloseButton nmReposition " title= " close " >

GOP resurging as party of mavericks Republicans : Palin helps resurging GOP gain image as maverick party

For John McCain and Sarah Palin , it was " mission accomplished " at last week 's Republican National Convention .
The GOP senator from Arizona and his surprise running mate , the governor of Alaska , got the party 's grassroots activists revved into fighting mode - and sent them out fully charged for battle against the Democrats .
But appealing to the true believers in the GOP arena was the easy part .
Now comes the reality check for the brutal 60 - day campaign sprint against the Democratic ticket of Sens. Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
Can McCain - Palin sell themselves as the agents of change - and distance themselves from their party 's two - term hold on the White House under George W. Bush - in the urban and suburban enclaves where moderate and independent voters are worried about gas prices and the war in Iraq , the home mortgage crisis and health care ?
" You never saw the word ' Republican ' in the convention hall , " said Democratic strategist Phil Trounstine , who noted the waving signs proclaiming " service " and " peace " but nothing regarding Bush or the GOP .
" McCain is saying elect me because of who I am .
Which might work , if they were n't so closely tied to the party that has been in power for the past eight years .
" They 're trying to present themselves as the maverick party , not the Republican Party ... and John McCain is trying to position himself as if he were not the standard bearer for the GOP , " he said .
" He 's running as an independent - and it 's Palin 's job to gin up the base .
It 's a two - pronged attack . "
Indeed , Republicans are hoping that the magic formula was cast in St. Paul , Minn. , last week , when a self - described " hockey mom " and mother of five added a jolt of excitement , a new saleswoman , and fresh appeal to a new swath of voters .
Subhed please
Mervin Field , the dean of California pollsters , said " her emergence changed the whole thrust of McCain 's campaign from being a Republican one to being a war hero who will restore the country - and it all happened in 10 days . "
" Republicans remain a team with marketing savvy , " agreed Golden Gate University 's Michal Ann Strahilevitz , a marketing expert .
" They needed to rebrand - and rebrand they did , " reshaping a new pitch and a new product in St. Paul .
And '' they have taken what has been the old - if not really old - McCain image and added a youthful zinger , by picking Sarah Palin as VP , " she said .
Republicans say that means an appeal to evangelicals and the women who had been looking at the Democratic ticket .
" Moderate GOP women who might be tempted to stay home are now engaged , " said Ken Khachigian , a speechwriter for former President Ronald Reagan and senior adviser to the campaign of former Sen.
Fred Thompson .
" We wo n't get the 29 - year - old Hillary Clinton voters .
But we may get the 50 - year - old Hillary Clinton voters .
...
They get it when Palin talks about raising her kids .
They identify with her . "
Subhed please
Sacramento State politics Professor Michael Semler also sees Republicans trying to make a new appeal to female voters .
" The GOP - also known as the non-George Bush party - are going after the suburban women once again .
They 're hoping she can relate to women and men who come from the heartland better than ( Democratic vice presidential candidate ) Joe Biden and Washington can . "
California Secretary of State Bill Jones , the McCain campaign chair in California , said Palin will help where it counts : in fundraising , in party - building , and in generating excitement in rural America .
" She 's made for that territory , and she 's the right candidate when paired with McCain , " he said .
" I was a bit anxious , " said GOP strategist Joel Fox before Palin 's acceptance speech .
" But we got a sense of the tiger who 's there .
...
She 's tough enough for this campaign . "
But with 80 percent of Americans believing that the country is on the wrong track , and Bush 's approval ratings at an all - time low , Fox and other political observers said the sales job wo n't be easy .
The party 's convention was unabashed in its efforts to erase the memory of its standard - bearer , Bush , whose name was mentioned just twice the entire week by elected officials .
Subhed please
But by making Palin the campaign 's attack dog - however charismatic - insiders said it 's clear the Republicans are hoping to turn this into an Obama - Palin contest , a game which the Democrats say they will not play .
" The McCain campaign would like the focus to be on Sarah Palin , " said Field of the closing weeks of the presidential race .
" But the issues still remain : housing , unemployment , energy , health care and most women and voters in the lower 48 ... will likely get beyond their fascination with her at some point - and turn to the basic issues driving the campaign . "
It is likely that McCain - and Palin - will now have to put the exuberance of the first days of the campaign in the rear view mirror , and face some tough questions about their legislative records , and how those records square with the maverick image they want to portray .
Subhed please
That includes an examination of the $ 20 million deficit in Palin 's term as mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , where she pushed for a sales tax increase .
And also fodder will be her support of earmarks for the so - called " bridge to nowhere " before she flip - flopped on the issue - and kept the $ 27 million so her state could construct a road leading to the bridge .
Palin herself does n't look to be answering those questions any time soon .
Obama , McCain and Biden are all guests on Sunday shows this morning , while Palin is the only candidate on the presidential tickets who is not .
" Sarah Palin is driving the presidential election right now , " said Simon Rosenberg , who heads NDN , a Washington - based moderate Democratic advocacy group .
" The McCain campaign is no longer in charge of their own campaign .
They 've hitched their ticket to a media superstar , and she could be the key to their victory - or the thing that takes them down .
She could be a rocket ship or a train wreck . "
The Economy Will Thump Open Source ?
Phooey
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 22 , 2008
Now here is a dissenting opinion if I 've ever seen one .
Andrew Keen is arguing that the economic crisis will " give open source a good thumping . "
That flies directly in the face of our prediction that open source will flourish in the downturn , and we 're not alone in predicting that .
There are several reasons why I do n't agree with Keen 's view of things .
" One of the very few positive consequences of the current financial miasma will be a sharp cultural shift in our attitude toward the economic value of our labor , " argues Keen , which leads up to his conclusion that nobody will want to work for free .
He adds this :
" So how will today 's brutal economic climate change the Web 2.0 " free " economy ?
It will result in the rise of online media businesses that reward their contributors with cash ; it will mean the success of Knol over Wikipedia , Mahalo over Google , TheAtlantic.com over the HuffingtonPost.com , iTunes over MySpace , Hulu over YouTube Inc. , Playboy.com over Voyeurweb.com , TechCrunch over the blogosphere , CNN ’s professional journalism over CNN ’s iReporter citizen - journalism . "
Let 's all synchronize our watches now so we can let out a collective gasp when Mahalo topples Google .
Give me a break .
One reason I disagree with Keen 's conclusions is that commercial entities are recognizing that funding open source , and combining paid developers with volunteer developers , makes a lot of sense -- especially in a downturn .
Just yesterday , we reported on Wind River and Kyocera building entire businesses around Android , on the very same day the code for Android became open .
Within businesses , open source is incresingly being adopted as a cost - cutting measure , and increased adoption is good for the open source ecosystem , not bad .
Another reason I disagree with Keen is that many people in the open source community dislike the idea of tying commercial efforts and dollar value to open source in the first place .
Javier Paniza , creator and lead developer of OpenXava , discussed this in our interview with him .
There are several more reasons why I disagree with Keen .
Keen sums up with this : " When , in 50 years time , the definitive histories of the Web 2.0 epoch are written , historians will look back at the open - source mania between 2000 and 2008 with a mixture of incredulity and amusement . "
I 'm already incredulous and amused .
In JRR Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings trilogy , the malevolent title character Sauron is an evil force represented by a single fiery eye .
A ring of dust around the bright star Fomalhaut looks uncannily like the Great Eye of Sauron in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope a few years ago .
The image confirms that Fomalhaut 's ring is curiously offset with respect to the star , suggesting that the gravity of one or more unseen planets is dragging the ring askew .

A giant , spectral " eel " appears to be chasing after a spiral galaxy in this image from the Victor M Blanco telescope in Chile .
The eel is actually a type of small , isolated cloud of gas and dust called a cometary globule because of its resemblance to a comet .
Called CG4 , it lies about 1300 light years from Earth towards the constellation Puppis , at the stern of the ship of the Argonauts .
The eel appears on the verge of devouring a spiral galaxy called ESO 257- 19 .
Fortunately , that galaxy is safely out of reach , actually lying more than 100 million light years farther away than CG4 .

A ghostly visage is haunting the galaxy in the form of the Skull Nebula , which lies 1600 light years from Earth in the constellation Cetus , the Sea Monster .
It is one of about 1600 known planetary nebula , which form when stars up to eight times the mass of the Sun begin to die .
They bloat into red giants before shedding as much as half their mass in shells of gas and dust .
Left behind are dense stellar corpses called white dwarfs .
The white dwarf in this nebula is speeding through space at 80 km /s .
Gas sloughed off the star in the direction of its movement ( up ) slams into surrounding interstellar gas and compresses , while gas expelled in its wake expands freely , explaining why the skull 's top half is more defined than its gaping mouth .

Forget ' canals ' on Mars - when the Viking 1 probe returned this image of a face on the Red Planet in 1976 , some speculated that it must have been built by aliens .
More recent images reveal it to be merely an eroded hill , but there are plenty of other suspicious - looking features on Mars to keep conspiracy theorists busy for a long time to come .

A mammoth network of gas filaments inside the galaxy NGC 1275 resembles the Flying Spaghetti Monster .
Until recently , it was not clear what prevented the delicate filaments from being destroyed by competing gravitational forces , but Hubble Space Telescope images suggest they are supported by magnetic fields generated near the galaxy 's central black hole .

A dark figure seems to emerge from the fog in this image of a gas and dust nebula called NGC 1999 .
A bright young star called V380 Orionis ( upper left ) illuminates the nebula - except for where a cold cloud of gas and dust is so dense that it blocks all light behind it .
Stars may be condensing inside this dark cloud , called a Bok globule .

A giant black widow is lurking in the Milky Way , spawning young and zapping its surroundings with intense radiation .
Hanging just above the galactic plane , the Black Widow Nebula is a cloud of dust , gas and stars about 10,000 light years from Earth .
NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope captured wispy streams of dust , flowing like spider 's legs from the centre of the nebula , where massive young stars are forming .
These enfants terribles are actually spewing out radiation and particles that " are basically destroying their natal material " , said Ed Churchwell , an astronomer at the University of Wisconsin in Madison , US , who led the observations .

Saturn 's moon Mimas looks for all the world like the Death Star - the planet - destroying space station from the movie Star Wars - in this Cassini image taken in 2005 .
The giant crater at the centre of the image , called Herschel , was probably gouged out by an enormous asteroid impact .
If the asteroid had been any bigger or had been moving much faster , it probably would have split the moon in two .

The blast rippled across Beirut just after dawn , throwing Khodr Hammoud out of bed and stumbling to his front door .
Gazing across the packed houses of the Shiite - populated slums east of Beirut airport , the young Shiite resident saw a huge plume of smoke rising into the pale sky .
A suicide bomber had just hit the barracks housing the US Marines beside Beirut airport .
The blast 25 years ago on Thursday killed 241 Americans , almost all of them marines , in what remains the highest fatality toll for the Corps in a single day since Iwo Jima in World War II .
" When I heard that marines had been blown up , I could n't believe it , " says Mr. Hammoud .
" We did n't think of [ the Marines ] as an enemy then like we do now . "
The bombing that left the Reagan administration 's Lebanon ambitions in tatters continues to reverberate today in shaping US diplomatic , political , and counterinsurgency policies toward Lebanon and the Middle East .
" It was a turning point in asymmetrical warfare , especially in the Middle East , " says Timur Goksel , a security analyst and former long - serving United Nations peacekeeper in south Lebanon .
" All those people who could n't fight powerful armies such as the United States suddenly found an easy way of balancing strength on the ground .
That was the beginning and we have been seeing it ever since . "
The attack exposed the vulnerabilities of even a superpower such as the US , which found itself unable to retaliate against its shadowy and anonymous adversaries , and ushered in a new era of grand - scale bombings – the World Trade Center in 1993 , the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 , the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 – that reached its apogee on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" In terms of significance it forced us out of Lebanon – and a cascade of attacks of the same nature forced us into the crusader castles that we live in today in the Middle East , " says Robert Baer , a former Central Intelligence Agency field agent who operated in Beirut in the 1980s .
The tactic was first used against the Americans in Beirut six months earlier when the US Embassy was destroyed in a suicide car bomb blast that claimed the lives of 57 people .
But the first suicide car - bomb attack had occurred three years earlier when a militant from the Dawa Party , an Iraqi opposition group , car - bombed the Iraqi Embassy in Beirut .
While the 1983 barracks bombing was not the first attack using an explosives - packed vehicle , it was the first to have a major political consequence .
The bombing broke the spine of US policy toward Lebanon , and four months later the marines had been withdrawn from the country , effectively ending Washington 's involvement in war - torn Lebanon for another five years .
Iran is generally cited as the chief suspect in ordering the attack , with Lebanese Shiites carrying it out .
Lebanon 's militant Hezbollah is often blamed , although it was still coalescing in Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley at the time and would not formally announce its existence for another 17 months .
Imad Mughniyah , who was posthumously identified as Hezbollah 's top military commander following his assassination in Damascus , Syria , in February , often is linked to the attack on the marines .
To this day no evidence has publicly emerged to clarify who was responsible .
" We never even narrowed down the name , " says Mr. Baer .
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has cited Israel 's 1982 invasion of Lebanon as a key motivator for his decision to participate in the struggle against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s .
And it was Mr. bin Laden who emulated and adapted the suicide car bomb tactic first used by Shiites in Lebanon .
The marines were based around Beirut airport at the southern end of the city , barricaded in a bombed - out building known as the BLT – the Battalion Landing Team .
The Americans – part of a multinational peacekeeping mission – generated little public hostility initially – most Lebanese were happy at the sight of foreign soldiers helping maintain stability in a country that had been at war for eight years .
But the US found itself in the months ahead sucked into Lebanon 's chaos as it lent ever - greater support to the Lebanese government and Army then battling pro-Syrian Druze militiamen .
The US came to be regarded as just another faction in the civil war .
By Oct. 22 , the 1,600 - strong Marine force had suffered seven fatalities and 47 wounded .
The next morning at 6.30 a.m. , while the American servicemen were asleep in the BLT , a truck accelerated though the barbed - wire obstacles and crashed into the lobby of the building and exploded .
At the same moment , another suicide bomber drove into the French paratroop headquarters , killing 58 people .
The Federal Bureau of Investigations concluded that the bomb used to flatten the Marine barracks – which had an explosive force comparable to 12,000 pounds of TNT – was the largest ever nonnuclear blast investigated by explosives experts .
In February 1984 , the Lebanese Army collapsed , Reagan ordered the withdrawal of the marines and , 11 days later , the last of them had departed Lebanon , bringing to an end what Caspar Weinberger , the defense secretary , described as a " particularly miserable affair . "
PALM BEACH COUNTY , Florida ( CNN ) --
As Election Day approaches , Brad Merriman does a lot of praying .
Poll workers in Miami - Dade County , Florida , train on the optical scan voting system .
" Our motto right now is we 're gonna plan for a recount and pray that we do n't have one , " he said jokingly .
Merriman , a county administrator , was brought in to oversee the upcoming general election after a botched judicial election this August in Palm Beach County , Florida .
Eight years ago in Florida , all eyes were on the hanging chad .
The chads are gone and so are the ATM - style touch screen voting machines .
They 've been replaced by voting machines called optical scan , which provide an old - fashioned paper trail , something many critics felt was missing in the event of a recount .
The entire state has switched to the optical scan technology .
More than half of the state 's 10.75 million voters will use the system for the first time and for most Floridians , this will be the third voting system in eight years , leaving plenty of room for confusion .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist eliminated the touch screen machines to boost voter confidence , which has been shaken in places like Sarasota , Florida , where 18,000 non-votes were recorded in a 2006 race for a congressional seat .
John Zarrella finds there might still be voting problems »
" Confidence in our system is the oil of the engine of democracy , " said Buddy Johnson , who is supervisor of elections in Hillsborough County .
" Whatever it takes to secure confidence in the system is worth it . "
Confidence was also shaken in Palm Beach County , home to the butterfly ballot in 2000 and synonymous with the presidential recount that resulted in the presidency for George W. Bush .
During a recent judicial election , a recount found 3,500 missing ballots .

Are you voting early ?

" They were n't lost .
They were in the warehouse .
They just were never counted , " Merriman said .
' American Morning '
All this week CNN's " American Morning " examines the potential voting problems in key battleground states in the special series , " Count the Vote . "
Weekdays , 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
Merriman said he found an office staff that was disorganized and unfamiliar with the recount process .
The ballots were put in the wrong box , he said .
Merriman said the office is doing a better job of ballot control and ballot management .
" We 're treating these paper ballots like they 're evidence .
There has to be a good chain of custody , " said Merriman .
Palm Beach County is one of 15 counties using the system for the first time .
In Palm Beach County alone , the potential landmines are everywhere : 700,000 voters have never used the system , the ballot is two pages long and this will be the first time many of the poll workers have used the new system .
Floridians will mark their vote for president and other offices with a pen , by filling in an oval or by connecting a line on a paper ballot .
The machines then use optical scanners to read the paper ballots , which are retained for verification purposes in the event of any problems .
Elections staff must be trained on the new voting system .
So do the thousands of Election Day temporary workers and volunteers who will staff thousands of polling locations across the state .
" It 's a familiarization process that really makes it -- I would n't say difficult -- but it makes it so very important , " said Johnson .
CNN recently visited a poll worker training session in Tampa , Florida , where elections official Rich Cervetti tutored a class of eight , including one poll watcher from the Democratic Party .
Cervetti schooled his class on how the optical scan system works and some of the things that will undoubtedly pop up on Election Day , including miss - marked ballots by voters .
" It 's looking inside the oval out , " explained Cervetti .
" If it does n't see anything , a blank space , even though the voter circled , it 's a blank ballot . "
Retiree Nancy Bailey , who will work the polls on Election Day , says she wants to get it right .
" They called us ' Flori - duh . '
And , I think we need to be represented better than that , " said Bailey .
She said her training is good and thinks the system works well , but she 's feeling the pressure to make sure things go smoothly .
" I'm a little nervous about this election , because I think it 's going to be a huge , huge major turnout and I want it to go well ' cause we do n't want Florida in the news again , " Bailey said with a laugh .
Voting education is not limited to poll workers -- it 's needed for the general public as well .
The state is spending millions of dollars to educate the public .
Elections supervisors statewide are broadcasting public service announcements , distributing DVDs and offering community outreach classes on how to use the optical scan machines .
What if there are problems on Election Day ?
" We have a system , a GPS , radio - dispatched technical team that can be anywhere in the county within 10 or 15 minutes , to any site if there 's an issue , " says Johnson .
Add to the mix statewide voter turnout , which could be 90 percent , and include half a million first - time voters .
" We build the racetrack for all the cars to run on .
We do n't care who comes onto the track to run .
We do n't care who wins , " said Johnson .
" But the track needs to be smooth and that 's what we 're all about . "

KDE Relaunches Community Forums
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 16 , 2008
KDE users have a new online spot to get together and talk about their favorite desktop environment .
The KDE Forum re-launched this week and is already over 17,000 members strong .
There are plenty of categories that cover everything from troubleshooting Internet and network issues to canoodling about new styles and themes .
KDE developer Sebastian Kuegler says , " The new forum uses the bulletin board software MyBB offering users , developers and people interested in KDE a place to help each other , discuss KDE - related topics and exchange ideas .
The KDE Forum complements KDE's UserBase , the home for KDE users as a valuable support resource . "
Kuegler says the existing categories are simply a starting point and community members are welcome to request more .
Future plans for the KDE forums include integration with KDE 's existing infrastructure to notify members of new posts via IRC bots , mailing list messages , and RSS feeds .
While the previous KDE forums assigned moderators to specific categories , the new forums will be managed by super - moderators whose permissions will allow them to edit threads and posts across the entire board .
Of course the idea of project - or distribution - specific forums is nothing new , I 'm always glad to see these kinds of message boards get some TLC .
While longtime or hardcore Linux users typically gravitate toward IRC to chat with community members , many people prefer a message board format and the more options a newcomer has , the better .
ST . PAUL ( Reuters ) - Sarah Palin has dominated the Republican convention for days without saying a word , but on Wednesday she takes the spotlight with a prime - time speech that will introduce her to American voters and try to answer questions about her experience and life story .
Since John McCain made the virtually unknown Palin his choice for vice president , the Alaska governor has been the center of a media storm fueled by disclosures about her unmarried teenage daughter ’s pregnancy , a probe into her role in an Alaskan official ’s firing and questions about her political record .
Palin ’s anti-abortion and pro-gun history have excited conservatives and party activists but the appearance on Wednesday will be the first chance for voters nationwide to judge her for themselves .
It comes just five days after McCain shocked the U.S. political world by introducing the 44 - year - old first - term governor and former mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , as his running mate at an Ohio rally .
“ She already has more executive experience than the entire Democratic ticket , ” Rudy Giuliani , the former New York mayor , said in remarks prepared for delivery to the convention on Wednesday .
“ She ’s led a city and a state . ”
McCain , 72 , an Arizona senator , and Palin will face Democrat Barack Obama and his vice presidential running mate , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , in the November 4 presidential election .
The McCain campaign released a television ad comparing Palin ’s experience with the qualifications of Obama , a first - term senator from Illinois .
“ She ’s earned a reputation as a reformer , ” the ad ’s narrator says .
“ His reputation ?
Empty words . ”
Obama told voters in Ohio that the Republicans had barely mentioned the faltering U.S. economy at their convention session on Tuesday .
Polls show voters rank the economy as the top election issue .
“ All these speakers came up , you did not hear a single word about the economy .
Think about it .
Not once did people mention the hardships that folks are going through , ” Obama said at a campaign stop in New Philadelphia , Ohio .
McCain arrived in the St. Paul area on Wednesday and was greeted by his family and Palin ’s family .
Among those meeting him were Palin ’s pregnant daughter Bristol , 17 , and her boyfriend .
McCain briefly chatted with both .
Palin , the first female Republican vice presidential nominee , has stayed out of the public eye in Minnesota for two days while the revelations about her family and record in Alaska surfaced .
She has yet to give a news interview or news conference .
PREPARATION
She has been preparing for her address with McCain aides .
“ This speech is about a record of reform , her case for Sen.
McCain ’s election and a close - up look at an individual with both hands on the steering wheel of America ’s energy economy , ” McCain aide Tucker Eskew said .
Slideshow ( 33 images )
The speech will give Palin a chance to move past the issue of her daughter ’s pregnancy and the Alaska probe into whether she abused her power in having a public safety commissioner fired , although it is unclear if she will directly address either topic .
Carly Fiorina , a senior McCain campaign adviser , and other Republican women said the media storm over Palin was a result of sexism .
“ The Republican Party will not stand by while Sarah Palin is subjected to sexist attacks , ” Fiorina told a news conference .
The furor over Palin has raised questions about McCain ’s judgment and the depth of the investigation that preceded her selection , and could put a dent in McCain ’s efforts to build momentum heading out of the convention .
Slideshow ( 33 images )
McCain aides said they would answer no more questions about the process .
“ This vetting controversy is a faux media scandal designed to destroy the first female Republican nominee for vice president of the United States , who has never been a part of the old boys ’ network , ” McCain adviser Steve Schmidt said .
Much of Monday ’s convention schedule was delayed by Hurricane Gustav ’s assault on the Gulf Coast , but the gathering resumed on Tuesday with the passing of leadership in the party from President George W. Bush to McCain .
Bush did not attend the convention , but praised McCain , who had been his rival in a bitter presidential nominating battle in 2000 .
“ He ’s not afraid to tell you when he disagrees .
Believe me , I know , ” Bush told the convention in a brief speech via satellite from Washington .

Many people deny that the U.S. government presides over a global empire .
If you speak of U.S. imperialism , they will fancy that you must be a decrepit Marxist - Leninist who has recently awakened after spending decades in a coma .
Yet the facts cannot be denied , however much people ’s ideology may predispose them to distort or obfuscate those facts .
How can a government that maintains more than 800 military facilities in more than 140 different foreign countries be anything other than an imperial power ?
The hundreds of thousands of troops who operate those bases and conduct operations from them , not to mention the approximately 125,000 sailors and Marines aboard the U.S. warships that cruise the oceans , are not going door to door selling Girl Scout cookies .
United States of America is the name ; intimidation is the game .
Of course , the kingpins who control this massive machinery of coercion never describe it in such terms .
In their lexis , American motives and actions are invariably noble .
Listening to these bigwigs describe what the U.S. forces abroad are doing , you would never suspect that they seek anything but “ regional stability , ” “ security , ” “ deterrence of potential regional aggressors , ” and “ economic development and cooperation among nations . ”
Inasmuch as hardly anybody favors instability , insecurity , international aggression , economic retrogression , and mutual strife among nations , the U.S. objectives , and hence the actions taken in their furtherance , would appear to be indisputably laudable .
( Article continues below )
Yet , from time to time , a U.S. leader lets slip an expression so revealing that it warrants a thousand times greater weight than the vague , mealy - mouthed banalities they routinely dispense .
I came across such a statement recently .
In seeking funds in 2007 for construction of a $ 62 million ammunition storage facility at Bagram Air Base , Admiral William J. Fallon , then the commander of the U.S. Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , referred to Bagram as “ the centerpiece for the CENTCOM Master Plan for future access to and operations in Central Asia . ”
Pause to savor this phrase for a moment ; let it roll around in your mind : CENTCOM Master Plan for future access to and operations in Central Asia .
What an intriguing expression !
What dramatic images of future U.S. military actions it evokes !
But can those actions be anything other than the very sort that empires undertake ?
Ask yourself : why does the U.S. military anticipate conducting operations in Central Asia , a region that lies thousands of miles from the United States and comprises countries that lack either the capacity or the intention to seriously harm Americans who mind their own business in their own national territory ?
Indeed , what is the U.S. military doing in Central Asia in the first place ?
Have you ever heard of “ the Great Game ” ?
When the Army sought the funds for the new ammunition storage facility at Bagram again this year , its request echoed Admiral Fallon ’s sentiments by stating : “ As a forward operating site , Bagram must be able to provide for a long term , steady state presence which is able to surge to meet theater contingency requirements . ”
The statement ’s reference to “ a long term , steady state presence ” would seem to be especially revealing because it takes for granted that U.S. forces will not be leaving this part of the world any time soon .
Giving even more weight to this interpretation , Congress approved not only the $ 62 million for the ammunition storage facility , but also $ 41 billion for a 30 - megawatt electrical power plant at Bagram , a plant large enough to serve more than 20,000 American homes .
Along the same lines , Lt. Colonel John Sotham , commander of the 455 Expeditionary Force Support Squadron , which is now stationed at Bagram Air Base , recently described a number of improvements his squadron is making at the base , looking toward giving it “ a more permanent footprint . ”
He added : “ It ’s pretty clear that the U.S. Air Force will be at Camp Cunningham [ a living area at Bagram ] and involved in the fight against terrorism for a very long time . ”
He relished the opportunity to “ help drive Bagram from expeditionary to enduring ! ”
The United States government divides the world into six military regions called Unified Combatant Commands .
( A separate Africa Command has been created only recently .
Once it is fully operational , it will include all of the African countries except Egypt .
A few other northeastern African countries were previously included in the Central Command ’s area of responsibility . )
The Central Command , abbreviated as CENTCOM , stretches from Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Yemen in the West to Kazakhstan , Kyrgystan , Tajikistan , and Pakistan in the East .
The easternmost reaches of this combatant area butt up against India , China , and Russia .
Looking carefully at the map , one discovers that Israel is not included in the CENTCOM area , but in the European Command area .
In a sense , however , we may describe the twenty - one countries in CENTCOM ’s newly defined “ area of responsibility ” as a sort of logical complement of Israel : the people of every one of these countries devoutly wish ( and here I have chosen my adverb carefully ) that Israel had never come into existence and that it will go out of existence as soon as possible .
Thus , CENTCOM ’s area , inhabited predominantly by Muslims , comprises a predominant subset of Israel ’s avowed enemies .
It comes as no surprise , then , that of all the unified commands , CENTCOM is the one in which , in today ’s world , the U.S. empire ’s rubber meets the road most abrasively .
The command ’s area of responsibility includes a great part of the world ’s known petroleum and natural gas deposits , a preponderance of Israel ’s enemies , and the places in which the George W. Bush administration has chosen to focus its so - called Global War on Terror .
Of course , the region also includes Iraq and Afghanistan , where U.S. forces have been fighting for years , and , sandwiched between these two battlefields , Iran , where Dick Cheney and the rest of the neocons ardently desire to extend the fighting at the earliest opportunity .
The high imperial authorities are not embarrassed by the U.S. empire ; on the contrary , they are immensely proud of it .
They simply do not describe their activities as the maintenance and exploitation of an empire .
If you care to read an extended example , I invite you to peruse Admiral Fallon ’s testimony of May 3 , 2007 , before the Senate Armed Services Committee , regarding CENTCOM’S “ posture . ”
This carefully prepared statement , written in impeccable military bureaucratese , illustrates well how imperial commanders wish to represent their forces ’ actions and , equally important , how members of Congress wish to have those actions represented to them .
Of course , it ’s all a solemn farce , a polished and meaningless charade staged purely for public - relations purposes ―a ceremonial hors d’oeuvres served in public before the diners consume the entrée , which consists of a massive amount of the taxpayers ’ money ladled out to the armed forces and their civilian contractors .
“ Our top priority , ” Fallon declares , “ is achieving stability and security in Iraq . ”
Everyone knows , of course , that Iraq was more stable and secure before the U.S. invasion , which suggests that perhaps the quickest way to reestablish those conditions is for the U.S. forces to leave the country .
Certainly many Iraqis resolutely oppose a permanent U.S. presence there , and some of them will continue their violent resistance to U.S. forces as long as the Americans remain .
Intelligent adults also know that when Fallon or any other U.S. official speaks of achieving stability and security , he has in mind the achievement of those blessed conditions only on terms acceptable to the U.S. government , and most likely in accordance with its prescription .
That the U.S. forces will ever pull out of Iraq and leave the Iraqis to do as they please is virtually impossible to conceive at this point .
Indeed , a mere pullout is nearly inconceivable , despite the great amount of talk that goes on about it on both sides .
On the Iraqi side , this talk is sincere ; on the U.S. side , it is all for show .
Fallon testified that in Afghanistan , “ the foundation of security and governance is in place . ”
He must have known how ludicrous that statement was .
Outside of Kabul , the U.S. forces , their allies , and the puppet regime control hardly anything , and U.S. and allied forces that move about the country are at constant risk of attack .
The Taliban has not been vanquished , and in fact it has been rebuilding its ranks and its operational capabilities recently .
The likelihood that outside forces will ever impose their designs on Afghanistan ’s backward but fiercely resilient tribesmen verges on nil .
Even Fallon has the temerity to observe that “ parts of the country have never known centralized governance . ”
Great powers have sought to conquer Afghanistan and bend it to their imperial will for centuries , never with more than short - lived success .
Eventually the imperialists leave , and the Afghans remain .
In an earlier day , Rudyard Kipling advised “ The Young British Soldier ” who served in Britain ’s imperial army :
When you ’re wounded and left on Afghanistan ’s plains ,
And the women come out to cut up what remains ,
Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
An ’ go to your Gawd like a soldier .
It ’s probably still good advice .
Alternatively , you can get yourself killed by your own comrades and instantly become a Great American Hero , thanks to the Great American Military Bullshit Information Team ( GAMBIT ) .
Continuing his parade of politicking platitudes , Fallon declares that “ Iran ’s most destabilizing activity has been the pursuit of nuclear weapons technology in defiance of the international community . ”
Of course , if the Iranians have undertaken any such pursuit at all , which remains in doubt , it has been not in defiance of the mythical “ international community , ” but in defiance of the United States and Israel , as everybody who reads the newspapers knows .
It is nothing short of astonishing that U.S. officials speak in almost hysterical tones of the threat posed by nonexistent Iranian nuclear weapons , yet never breathe a word about the hundreds of such weapons already in the Israeli arsenal , not to mention the thousands that remain at the disposal of U.S. forces .
Of course , members of Congress , who live in mortal fear of the American Israel Political Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , want to be seen listening to this phony - baloney message , so military politicians such as Admiral Fallon dare not disappoint them .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Fallon arranged the bulk of his testimony around a description of how CENTCOM ’s “ initiatives are organized into five focus areas : setting conditions for stability in Iraq ; expanding governance and security in Afghanistan ; degrading violent extremist networks and operations ; strengthening relationships and influencing states to contribute to regional stability ; and posturing the force to build and sustain joint and combined war fighting capabilities and readiness . ”
Notice that except possibly for the third item listed ( “ degrading violent extremist networks and operations ” ) , none of this has more than a very remote connection with defending the people of the United States against foreign enemies .
Instead , it has everything to do with maintenance of the U.S. empire in the Middle East and Central Asia .
The U.S. government maintains a lavishly financed Department of Defense , ostensibly to protect Americans in their own country from foreign attackers .
In reality , however , this department acts as an overfed foreign legion , operating around the world as an offensive or potentially offensive force to bully other countries into submission to the U.S. government ’s wishes .
To read Fallon ’s testimony is to take a refresher course in U.S. nation building .
He speaks about “ infrastructure development , ” “ provision of basic services to Iraq ’s citizens , ” and improving “ local government performance and capacity . ”
In Afghanistan , he perceives that the “ priorities are roads and electricity , followed by agricultural development , microcredit , job skills , and education . ”
The occupation force , he testified , “ is actively pursuing initiatives in these areas , from building schools and providing them with supplies to encouraging and stimulating the growth of small businesses . ”
Should we laugh or cry ?
Someone needs to remind the admiral and his audience that the military is trained and equipped to dispense death and destruction .
Military leaders know nothing about nation building , and their efforts along these lines result only in gigantic waste of time , money , and lives .
( Of course , we must never forget , especially when discussing the U.S. empire , that one man ’s waste is another man ’s fabulously enriching government contract . )
To make matters even worse , “ CENTCOM supports US government and United Kingdom lead nation counter - narcotics activities . ”
No U.S. war is complete , it seems , without dragging the disastrous drug war along with it .
The imperial authorities constantly emphasize their efforts to promote our security by suppressing “ violent extremism ” abroad .
Repeat after me : extremism always bad ; moderation always good .
If Barry Goldwater were alive today and still telling us that “ extremism in defense of liberty is no vice , ” he might well be placed on the Air Force ’s target list for the Predator drone .
While decrying the violent extremists in the Middle East , Admiral Fallon notes : “ Unfortunately , their tactics and radical ideology remain almost unchallenged by voices of moderation . ”
It takes a heap of chutzpah to impose sanctions on a country , killing hundreds of thousands of children and others with weakened immune systems , then invade the country , killing hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children by bombing , shooting , shelling , beating , stabbing , suffocating , and immolating them , then create such chaos and violence among the populace that millions are forced to abandon their residence and rendered homeless , then announce your regret that so few speak in favor of moderation .
Next thing you know , the Devil will express regret that so few denizens of Hell speak in favor of fraternal kindness and Christian charity .
Fallon aims at “ de- legitimizing the underlying social and political movements that support ” the extremist groups .
He fails to recognize that such delegitimization is utterly impossible as long as the U.S. forces continue to occupy Iraq and Afghanistan and to brutalize their people .
The admiral proposes “ building capacity in governance and security that helps at - risk societies address problems that foster internal and local grievances . ”
The overwhelming grievance in the Middle East , however , is the presence of U.S. forces and Washington ’s support for local dictators and their legions of thugs .
Fallon , however , looks to “ empowering credible experts to expose the flaws and internal contradictions of the enemy ’s ideology ; provide viable , competing alternative worldviews ; and contest the intellectual ‘ safe harbors ’ where extremist ideas incubate . ”
U.S. military leaders seem to have made a little progress since the days when they lived by the motto , “ If you ’ve got ’em by the balls , their hearts and minds will follow . ”
Yet the idea that in the midst of everything the U.S. forces are doing in the Middle East they can employ “ credible experts ” to transform the dominant ideology is sheer lunacy .
Al - Qaida requires no wily recruiting agents in Afghanistan and Iraq ; its supporters need only invite people to look out their windows .
Fallon speaks glowingly of the various Middle Eastern dictatorships with whom the U.S. government maintains cordial relationships .
( It ’s amazing how many “ friends ” you can win with a combination of generous bribes and credible threats . )
The United States ’ “ close , reliable partner nations ” include such paragons of social and political modernity as “ Egypt , Jordan , Kuwait , Bahrain , and Pakistan . ”
Moreover , “ Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates are important partners in maintaining stability in the Gulf . ”
An honest observer feels compelled to recognize , however , that every one of the filthy - rich sheiks in these desert despotisms would gladly cut Fallon ’s throat if they were n’t raking in such fabulous amounts of money from the current arrangements .
The admiral does recognize a few problems .
“ Our present inventory of language and intelligence specialists ( especially human intelligence ) and counterintelligence agents does not support current requirements . ”
Translation : because we do n’t speak or understand Arabic , Pashto , Persian , or any other local language in this part of the world , we have n’t a clue as to what ’s going on in the politics and social life of these countries , and therefore we are constantly at the mercy of English - speaking collaborators who will take the risk of feeding us lies and fabricated “ intelligence ” long enough to get rich and then flee the country before their infuriated countrymen kill them .
Notwithstanding the many troubles that plague the imperial crusaders in CENTCOM ’s area of responsibility , Fallon bravely concludes , “ we fight tirelessly against those who would do us harm . ”
He fails to mention , however , that the people of southwest Asia would harbor no grievances whatsoever against Americans if the U.S. government had only possessed the intelligence and the decency to stay out of their affairs .

The Novice Oct 7 , 2008 How to Embalm a Body
Those who ca n’t do , learn .
In this installment of our series in which the clueless apprentice with the experts , we visited a funeral home in New Jersey to learn , hands - on , how to prepare someone for an eternal rest .
Credit : Paul Castle
The first dead body I saw was my grandfather ’s , at his funeral .
More recently , I attended the funeral of a friend who ’d died in a car accident .
I forced myself to the dais to say goodbye .
Looking over at him — he was striking in his beard and suit , clutching a leather - bound book — I thought he did n’t seem quite like himself : I ’d never seen him with such cleanly cut hair .
Likewise , my grandfather did n’t seem like himself , either :
He was waxy , glowing , with makeup on his collar .
Though not entirely lifelike , their embalmed bodies were at least similar to how they appeared in life — similar enough that their casketed images surface alongside my memories of their smiles , movements , and voices .
For many of us , death is a grim prospect — facing it or dealing with it — but for embalmers , it ’s in the job description .
By learning how to embalm , I hoped to learn how these final portraits are constructed , and how those in the business view death and grieving .
Though thin and energetic , Carla , a funeral director in New Jersey , manages to project calm and control .
Over dinner , as she shared stories of picking up bodies for a medical examiner ’s office , it was n’t difficult to imagine her methodically removing maggots from the body of young man who ’d died days before from a drug overdose , or suturing the top of someone ’s head back on after an autopsy .
Well , it was hard to imagine , but only because it ’s completely disgusting — not for any lack of projected composure on Carla ’s part .
I happened to head for the bathroom after a particularly morbid account of a man who had died in the woods and had his face eaten off by bees .
“ You did n’t just vomit , did you ? ” Carla asked with genuine concern .
“ No , no , ” I assured her , “ but now that you mention it , maybe I should . ”
Despite the jokes , I was determined to see the embalming through .
Demanding to tag along while someone negotiates the cheerless gray area between life and death is asking a lot , but I was n’t about to force Carla to hold my hand — or hair — at the same time .
“ The worst thing for me , the first time I saw Carla work on a body , ” Carla ’s girlfriend Mary confided , “ was the smell .
It ’s not a dead body smell .
It ’s more the smell of embalming fluid that really gets in your clothes and hair . ”
If the smell of embalming fluid is the worst thing about tonight , I ’ll get in the coffin myself , I thought .
We paid the bill and headed out to spend the rest of the evening with the corpse of a man Carla ’s boss had picked up from a nursing home earlier that day .
Step 1 : Clean the Body and Break Down Rigor Mortis
In the basement of the funeral home , fluorescent lights bounced off the tile that covered the floor and walls of the prep room , which was barely above 50 degrees .
Shivering , Carla turned up the thermostat and wrapped herself in a white paper gown .
I ’d taken less than three steps inside , noticed a covered , man - shaped lump on the porcelain embalming table at the center of the room and stopped , frozen in fear .
She casually tossed away the sheet to expose the body of a tall , elderly man .
What struck me first was the stillness .
His head was cocked back , open - mouthed .
Purple and blue bruises were scattered across his arms and hands .
There were yellowing folds of skin around the hips of what was otherwise the thin body of an average - looking old man .
He looked more like a wax sculpture or mannequin than an actual person .
Carla grabbed a spray bottle and quickly spritzed his face .
His eyes shot open and I jumped back .
“ What did you just do ? ”
“ Oh , I just disinfected his eyes , nose , and mouth .
Those are the places were decay starts most easily and it ’s important to keep them clean . ”
She glanced down at his face .
“ Aw , man , the guy ’s got a beard .
Shaving him is going to be pain . ”
Carla explained that they shave everybody ’s face , male or female — otherwise the makeup wo n’t look as good if our natural facial hair is n’t removed .
However , if the person had a beard during life , the hair stays .
“ OK , I ’m going to thread the wire onto the needle , put it in the gun , and you shoot it underneath his bottom teeth , ” she instructed .
“ Once I worked on an old man with a really bad moustache , like the kind a teenager would grow .
It was really crooked and misshapen , so I shaved it off .
At the funeral his family kept coming up saying , ‘ Oh , where ’s his moustache ? ’
Apparently , it was supposed to look that way . ”
The closer to its living self a body looked , the happier a family would be .
And keeping families happy , I ’d learn as the night went on , was the main objective of Carla ’s work , and a task she took very seriously .
The man on the table had already undergone obvious physical changes .
He was pale , almost translucent .
Carla pointed out where his ears and nose had become emaciated and bony .
“ See this puckering . ”
Her fingers made indentations in the sagging skin on his sides , “ This is edema .
When he was in the nursing home , he may have been on a saline drip that was working to keep him alive , but now , all that fluid is causing the skin to bloat .
Mostly , though , he ’s in really good shape .
He even has his own teeth .
It ’s really rare to see someone this old who still has his own teeth . ”
I crept toward him .
Edging around the table , I could n’t stop looking at his face .
“ So , do you wanna help me with this ? ” Carla asked .
I spread a paper gown over my clothes and pulled on some blue latex gloves .
“ We ’ve gotta break down the rigor mortis . ”
Carla squeezed some soap into my gloved hands and told me to start rubbing the man ’s arms , but to “ be careful not to pull too hard in case something pops . ”
I imagine dead weight as the force of someone ’s sleeping body on yours , or a head in your lap .
This man ’s body had none of that mass — think of it as stiff weight .
It was hard to even get the arms to straighten , but their mass had no muscle , no heaviness .
“ Always place the hands right over left ” Carla instructed , “ unless there ’s some religious reason why we would n’t .
Later we ’ll use makeup to do something about those bruises . ”

Step 2 : Close the Mouth
Carla brandished what looked like a simple metal gun with a pointy tip and effortlessly shot a needle with a protruding wire between his lip and upper gums .
“ The needle injector is tough , and if you miss it could mess things up , ” she warned , as I practiced firing the gun .
It felt like using a strengthening grip , and popped like a staple gun when I finally managed to pull it all the way closed .
“ OK , I ’m going to thread the wire onto the needle , put it in the gun , and you shoot it underneath his bottom teeth , ” she instructed .
With both hands and all my strength , I pulled back the lip , aimed and pulled the grip closed .
The needle shot into his gums with a bang .
Carla twisted the wires to pull his upper and lower palates together , and , using what looked like a long pair of pliers , began stuffing his mouth with cotton .
“ When I first started embalming , it would take me forever just to do something like fill the mouth with cotton . ”
She was finished in under a minute .
Step 3 : Open the Carotid Artery and Embalm the Body
“ I can tell so much about someone ’s health from doing this , ” Carla said as she gently incised the skin on his right clavicle , revealing gaping insides .
“ If someone has been drinking I can smell it .
The arteries are sometimes really hard and thick — that is , if someone has had an arterial disease . ”
She sifted through the man ’s neck , locating the thick , white carotid artery and tying it off with string .
The jugular vein , where the blood would leave the body once the embalming fluid was pumped in , proved tougher to find and eventually Carla gave up , expecting that the blood would flow from the wound regardless .
Carla and I went to an adjacent table , and she reached into the cabinet below and retrieved some pink - hued chemicals , which she set next to a glass cylinder .
“ So , I ’m embalming him with formaldehyde and something called Metaflow that will pave the way for the formaldehyde in his arteries , ” she said as she poured the fluids into the cylinder .
“ Then we add some Chromatech ” — it was like watching a chef season Pepto Bismol — ” and a bit of water . ”
The smell Carla ’s girlfriend had described at dinner slowly filled the room .
It reminded me of a vet ’s office — completely sterile , though still animal .
It was enough I would have to ride home smelling of embalming fluid .
I did not want to leave the funeral home looking like the lone survivor in a horror movie .
Carla unveiled a plastic tube connected to a cylindrical tank about the size of a 50 - gallon aquarium .
This was the embalming machine .
It would mix the chemicals and pump them into the tube and out a thin metal pipe called an arterial tube ; bent at a 90 - degree angle with a hole at the end , the arterial tube inserts the fluid into the carotid artery .
“ Since I ca n’t find the jugular vein , we ’ll have to be careful to make sure he ’s draining .
Step back , cause it could get messy if the blood wo n’t flow out easily . ”
At the word “ messy ” I leapt behind her .
It was enough I would have to ride home smelling of embalming fluid .
I did not want to leave the funeral home looking like the lone survivor in a horror movie .
Luckily , we had nothing to worry about .
Seconds after she ’d put the arterial tube into his artery , blood began to pour through the hole in his chest and formed a small rapid that ran quickly down a well on the perimeter of the table .
“ Go ahead and massage his limbs to make sure the blood is flowing out and the embalming fluid moves through , ” Carla put some more soap on my hands and I got to work rubbing the loose flesh on his arms and then the taut skin over his legs .
Carla pointed out where the color was coming into his legs and the left side of his face .
I had to admit , he looked a bit healthier than he had when we first arrived .
Still worse for wear , but with slightly rosier veins .
The machine chugged away , the fluid level falling as more and more pink chemicals pumped through his circulatory system .
Eventually , Carla switched sides and tied off the other end of the artery so she could embalm the right side of his face .
Step 4 : Visceral Embalming and Tying Up Loose Ends
It turns out that , when embalming a body , the worst part comes last .
Though a body ’s veins may be overflowing with formaldehyde , decay — or purge — can still occur if the internal organs are n’t drained of fluid .
The process for removing that fluid makes everything we ’d done up to now seem like a warm bubble bath .
“ This , ” Carla said , brandishing a two - foot long metal tube attached to a plastic hose , “ is a trocar . ”
She pushed the pointed end of the trocar slightly above and to the left of his belly button and began prodding .
“ This hose is attached to a hydroaspirator .
We ’re sucking fluids out of his internal organs .
Right now I ’m draining his kidney — no , wait , ” she gave a little push with the trocar , “ his spleen .
After I get fluid out , I ’m going to reverse the pressure and put chemicals inside .
Do you want to give it a try ? ”
I nervously took the wand .
Liquid was being sucked into the tube and down the drain , so I started feeling around , trying to figure out where more excess fluid might be lurking .
Suddenly I hit bone — and also my threshold for mortuary work .
“ Oh , no way , forget it , I ca n’t do this . ”
I gave the trocar back to Carla and shuffled over to the safety of his head .
She switched directions on the hydroaspirator and used the trocar to pump in a solution ( made from chemicals named “ Freedom Cav ” and “ Dry Cav ” ) .
She finished up , filling the hole in his abdomen with cotton and putting the probe away .
“ I ’m going to clean him off , suture up his neck , and then put cream over his face and hands so they wo n’t dry out .
Working on a body that has dried out is a nightmare .
Tomorrow my boss will come in to do his makeup and trim his hair . ”
I asked how long he could keep until the funeral .
“ He ’s in pretty good shape .
Probably about a week .
The trick is to keep him cold and embalm as soon as possible after death . ”
Using a needle and thread , Carla made an appropriately named baseball suture to close the hole she ’d cut for the fluids , then brushed a heavy , white moisturizer over any skin that would be exposed during the viewing .
“ He ’s gonna get makeup , right ? ” I asked .
“ Oh , more than that , see how emaciated his face is , we can make the features look more lifelike , too . ”
Carla gave me a quick feature - fixer demonstration .
“ Here we ’ve got big needles , bigger needles and really big needles , ” she waved a cartoon - sized syringe at me .
“ Because he ’s already pretty thin , we ’ll add some feature fixer or tissue fixer to fill his face in . ”
She injected a thick , pink ( always pink ! ) gel into the tip of his nose , which immediately bubbled with health and fullness .
She then gave his ears and brow the same treatment .
By far , injections of feature fixer were the most noticeable cosmetic enhancement .
After only a couple of squirts , he looked like he could have sat upright and walked out of the mortuary .
As we were cleaning up , Carla and I chatted about the nature of the business .
“ I guess funeral directors are working with dangerous chemicals all day , but for some reason they typically live really long lives . ”
She added that she definitely planned to be cremated .
Sarah Palin has ensured disgruntled Clinton supporters will vote for Obama , writes Dana Milbankin Philadelphia
THE HILLARY voter has come home .
It was n't primarily the work of Hillary Clinton , although by her count she has made more than 50 public appearances for Barack Obama .
Nor was it the work of Obama , who has kept Clinton and her advisers at arm 's length .
No , the one who put the Hillary Clinton voters in Obama 's column was John McCain - with his choice of a running mate .
" Palin - God forbid !
Where did they find her ? "
Evelyn Fruman exclaimed on Monday before a Clinton speech at a Jewish community centre here .
" God forbid ! " Gail Silverberg chimed in .
" Hockey moms and lipstick on a pig and six - packs ?
I do n't want that stuff . "
Nearby , Rina Jampolsky was wearing a " Hillary Sent Me " button next to a pin saying " Barack Obama " in Hebrew .
" I thought I would n't vote at all when Hillary left the race , " she said , " but as soon as McCain selected Sarah Palin , my decision was made . "
They were the quintessential Hillary supporters waiting for their heroine at the hall in northeast Philly : virtually all white , mostly women and mostly old .
Of the minority who were not Jewish , most were Catholic .
In the local state Senate district , primary voters went for Clinton over Obama by three to one .
Something has happened in recent weeks among the Clinton faithful .
Fear of the right - wing Palin , coupled with the economic collapse , has caused them to quietly swallow their Obama misgivings .
The latest Washington Post - ABC
News poll finds that 81 per cent of Democrats and like - minded independents who favoured Clinton now back Obama .
Of course , there are still some tender feelings - most publicly those of Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell , who gave a most unusual introduction to Clinton at her rally for Obama on Monday in Horsham , near Philadelphia .
" Of all the things I 've done in politics , the proudest accomplishment I 'll look back on is the seven - week campaign we ran for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania , " Rendell said .
About half the outdoor rally applauded .
" Hillary did so many things right .
She spoke for us , she had our dreams and our hopes . "
A smaller number of people clapped .
" It was a wonderful campaign , and it was wonderful to see people who would tell me , ' I 'm never voting for Hillary Clinton ' , by the end of that seven weeks were avid Hillary Clinton supporters , " Rendell continued .
This time nobody applauded .
Rendell recovered , sort of .
" In Washington DC , if we lose all of our supporters , all the people who look out for us , there will be one man left standing , " he said , " but that man will be a woman , Hillary Rodham Clinton . "
Clinton tried to take over the microphone , uttering a " Whoa ! " - but Rendell reclaimed the floor .
" One last time ! " he shouted , leading the crowd in a chant of " Hillary !
Hillary ! "
And this would be an Obama rally ?
The sentiment was much the same in Scranton , Pennsylvania , on Sunday , when Bill and Hillary Clinton joined Joe Biden and his wife at an Obama rally .
Bill Clinton got nearly two - thirds of the way through his speech before speaking the words " Barack Obama " , while he mentioned his wife more often than the presidential nominee .
" I expect to spend the rest of my natural life trying to show people how grateful I am to those who supported Hillary in her long quest this last year , " the former president said .
Hillary Clinton , up next , had a modest proposal .
" Go out and make the case , because Barack and Joe are not asking you to marry them .
They are asking you to vote for them - and vote for yourselves . "
Clinton herself has been a loyal soldier for Obama on the stump - no small matter for a woman who , if Obama prevails , will have her own presidential ambitions postponed for eight years , if not indefinitely .
Although she offers little in the way of a personal endorsement , she combines a cerebral defence of Obama with a visceral denunciation of McCain .
The closest she got to a personal endorsement was describing Biden and Obama as " two leaders with the intelligence and the determination and the good ideas and the savvy to get the job done " .
She reasoned : " Barack and Joe are for you , and that 's why I 'm for Barack and Joe . "
But she , and the crowd , were far more passionate in denunciation of McCain and President Bush .
" We are in a financial crisis born and bred by the failed Republican policies of George Bush and John McCain . "
The very mention of Palin 's name caused the crowd to erupt in boos and hisses ; Clinton gave an exaggerated shrug .
" It took a Democratic president to clean up after the last Bush and it's going to take a Democratic president to clean up after this Bush . "
She had used the same line in the primary season but said it would take a Clinton to do the cleaning .
The crowd in Horsham was stirred to the familiar old chant of " Hillary !
Hillary ! " when the former candidate felt stirred to respond .
" I know that there are many of you in this crowd who supported me , and I will be forever grateful , " she said .
" We love you ! " somebody called out .
" I love you , too , " Clinton said , but she then returned to the business at hand .
" There is only one choice , " she said .
" Barack Obama and Joe Biden will fight for you . " - ( Los Angeles Times - Washington Post service )
Billion - dollar poll : priciest US vote
NEW YORK -
The cost of the US presidential election could break the billion - dollar barrier for the first time in history this year , experts say .
Michael Toner , chairman of the Federal Election Commission , which governs the election , told the Washington Postthat the 2008 race would be " the most expensive election in American history " and a " $ 1 billion election " .
The cost of the last presidential campaign in 2004 , considered a peak for its time , was $ 693 million ( €508 million ) .
Just two decades ago , the race which saw Republican George HW Bush succeed Ronald Reagan at the White House cost $ 59 million .
In 2008 , the figures are staggering .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has frequently broken fundraising records , bringing in $ 66 million last August alone , taking his total to more than $ 454 million by September 20th .
John McCain has raised $ 230 million .
Once all the money spent by the candidates , their parties ' national committees , political action committees , so - called 527 groups created to influence the election , trade unions and trade groups is considered , it will be a $ 3 billion election , the US business magazine Fortune predicts .
The key battleground state of Pennsylvania has been targeted by both campaigns , with more than $ 40 million being spent there alone , $ 10 million more than anywhere else in the country .

Amtrak and the Transportation Security Administration deployed officers from about 100 local police departments to 150 train stations in 13 states and the District of Columbia during the morning rush on Tuesday in a drill to familiarize law enforcement personnel with the rail system and to practice working together .
An Amtrak spokesman said some travelers were asked for identification and some were told to open their bags for inspection .
In many cases , the exercise meant mostly that more police officers were present in Amtrak and commuter rail stations , although some commuters may not have noticed .
In some stations , police dogs were present .
Officials said the drill , along the Northeast corridor from Virginia to Vermont , was not in response to any threat , but was meant to demonstrate how the authorities could respond to one , or to an actual attack .
Participating agencies included police departments from small jurisdictions , like Kingston , R.I. , and Old Saybrook , Conn. , Linden and Metuchen , N.J. , Lower Merion , Pa. , and Harpers Ferry , W.Va. , as well as from big cities , including Boston , New York , Philadelphia and Washington .
At Union Station in Washington , a few blocks from the Capitol , there was a noticeable increase in the security presence .
Transportation Security Administration officers who said they were ordinarily assigned to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport stood near a busy Starbucks , watching passengers who had just arrived on an Acela from New York .
“ It ’s national rail security day , ” one officer said cheerily , as if it were a new holiday .
He said he was not authorized to give his name to the press .

If there was any shred of credibility left to the McCain campaign , it 's all gone now .
On H&C Wednesday night , John McCain dived into Sean Hannity 's bath tub and called for a full vetting of Obama 's relationship with Bill Ayers .
It 's interesting how bad poll numbers turned the Media 's Maverick into a bottom feeder now .
He certainly has made Hannity , Karl Rove and Lee Atwater very proud tonight .
I really thought it was going to be Sarah Palin who would answer these questions posed by the despicable Hannity as McCain sat and watched , ( Hannity most recently used a known anti-Semite named Andy Martin to come on his show to smear Obama ) but McCain answered them directly .
McCain :
It 's about Sen Obama being candid and straight forward with the American people about their relationship .
Hannity : Should the American people be concerned that he 's capable in a post 9/11 world of fighting terrorism when he is friends with an unrepentant terrorist ?
McCain : Well I think that 's also part of the judgement the American people make .
But first I think we ought to have a full and complete examination of the relationship and then the American people can make a judgment ...
I hope it 's vetted out , I think it needs to be vetted out ..... including the ACORN organization
With the country suffering right now as much as it is , John McCain , who once said he would run a respectable campaign chose to become a clone of Sean Hannity .
Sure , they 'll grab a news cycle , but voters want answers to our problems not whacked out FOX News nonsense .
Shame on you John McCain .
Obama has plenty of material to work with if McCain goes there in the last debate .
Expect McCain 's surrogates to go on the offensive too .
And I find it laughable that Republicans are crying about voter fraud , but that 's for another post .
Last year , Jennifer Reisinger , a Web developer from Sheboygan , Wisconsin , received a letter from the city .
It demanded that she cease and desist the publication of a hyperlink on her web site pointing to the home page for the Sheboygan Police Department .
Reisinger used the website in question - Brat City Web Design , so named in honor of the Bratwurst sausage that has brought Sheboygan fame - for her web design business , and it contained links to several other public agencies besides the police department .
The cease - and - desist letter did not mention any of the other links besides the one for the police department , and Reisinger promptly removed the link from her site .
After she received a call from the Sheboygan Police informing her of a police investigation into the link 's presence on her site , however , Reisinger retained an attorney , who advised her to reinstate the link immediately .
The lawyer , Paul Bucher , also fired off letters to the city 's mayor , police chief , and city attorney requesting documentation related to the affair , and a description of the legal basis the city felt it had in demanding the removal of the link .
The following day , the city informed Reisinger that it would refrain from pursuing any legal action against her , and the mayor apologized for the whole affair in a letter to the editor of the town 's newspaper .
But that was n't the end of the story .
Last month , Reisinger filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the city , particularly the mayor , Juan Perez , sent the cease - and - desist letter in retaliation for her participation in a mayoral recall campaign .
Her complaint requests a judicial declaration that the city violated her First Amendment rights , as well as $ 250,000 and punitive damages to be determined by a jury .
Reisinger might have a case .
FindLaw columnist Anita Ramasastry , an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle , argues in a recent column that linking is generally protected under the First Amendment and points out that at least one federal court has agreed with that position .
While there are exceptions to this notion - discussed below - Reisinger 's link to the Sheboygan police site does not seem to fall into any of them .
She directed her visitors to the page for a government body meant to serve and protect the public , which is the exact sort of information - sharing that the First Amendment was established to protect .
Governments must have a compelling reason to curtail protected speech , and it does n't appear that the City of Sheboygan had much reason to send the letter at all .
Of course , the judge in the case could declare the case moot , since the city withdrew its cease - and - desist letter and never initiated any kind of formal prosecution or other legal action .
So Reisinger may be in the right , but whether she gets any money or a judicial declaration in her favor remains to be seen .
Regardless of the outcome , Reisinger 's case highlights the legal issues surrounding links on the Internet .
Few courts have dealt directly with these issues , but the decisions that have come down illustrate the difficulties inherent in applying the law to linking .
Bamboo : Nowadays , you can't really go to an anime forum without seeing some form of discussion about moe .
It 's a topic that many people have mixed emotions about , and it's lead to some heated debates in the past .
Before we really talk about moe , I want to get a good definition of what it is .
Casey , can you give us a little heads up on what the term means ?
Casey : I 've done lectures about this in the past , and have said that there is really no one - word definition in English that exactly matches up with moe .
The technical definition would be something like an overwhelming sentiment of affection you feel when you see something that is unbearably cute .
Of course , that really does n't get much of a reaction from people when they hear it , so I always say it 's how dog lovers feel when they see a really cute puppy , or the way that cat lovers feel when they see a really cute cat .
The main issue , I think , that needs to be kept in mind is that it 's distinct from lolicon because you do n't normally think of the dog lover as wanting to jump into bed and have sex with the puppy .
Generally speaking , although there is some overlap between moe and lolicon , the hardcore people who are real moe fans will tell you that moe is not sexualized and that it is pure love .
It 's not about sexual or physical love .
Whether you believe that or not is under question , but that 's the definition .
Sara :
I think it 's so interesting that the textbook definition of " moe " makes it sound like a very feminine kind of emotion , but in fandom , this type of affectionate sentiment is primarily associated with men .
Casey :
While moe as a fan - related phenomena appears to have emerged from male - dominant segments of fandom , I have since seen it appropriated by female fans and creators as well .
Besides , I do n't think that the emotion itself is gender - specific .
Although some emotions are considered stereotypically characteristic of one gender or another , I can't conceive of any human emotion out there that would be truly gender - specific .
Bamboo :
The first time I ever read a really well thought - out definition of moe was from an article written by Tomohiro Machiyama for Patrick Macias ' book , Cruising the Anime City : An Otaku Guide to Neo Tokyo .
He mentions that " moe , " as a verb , means a plant that sprouts , and it has a very positive image of a fresh beginning , like a fresh flower .
He also mentioned in the article that it is something very virginal — something that people see as an image of something that is not corrupted yet .
I think for a lot of men , at least a lot of Japanese men in fandom , they see these little sister types and think , " Oh , she is so untainted by the world .
Look at her running around in her bloomers having fun !
I feel this overwhelming need to protect her . "
So it 's totally not sketchy .
It 's this very innocent feeling .
Casey :
Also in that same vein , they do n't feel threatened by her .
Bamboo :
What do you mean ?
Casey :
Well , think about it .
If the girl is little and young and cute and vulnerable and innocent , then she is not a threat .
Sara : I can't speak for moe viewership in general , since every viewer is obviously different and watches moe titles for his own reasons , but the impression I get from the packaging and presentation of moe itself is that female maturity and sexuality seem like a very threatening presence .
To me , there 's a marked difference between moe characters who are designed just to be looked at and fawned over — like the OS - tan girls , who I think are amazingly cute — and moe characters who are placed in more nuanced types of relationship scenarios .
Like Misuzu from Air , for instance .
In the latter case , I worry slightly about the effect this type of archetype has on expectations of real - life relationships on the part of the viewer , because I do n't think this kind of innocence and docility really exists in most girls .
Bamboo : Well , Casey , you wrote a review of Honey and Clover in which you mentioned something about the character , Hagu .
You wrote that she is very much the portrait of a diminutive Japanese woman that does n't talk much or do anything , yet is the object of so many men 's desires .
Do you think that she is moe ?
Casey :
Oh , I definitely think she is a very good example of a moe character .
As I mentioned earlier , an adoring , protective impulse toward the small and vulnerable can be felt by women as easy as men , and moe has been appropriated by female creators .
And generally speaking , the aesthetic seems to have moved from male - oriented comics or media in general to other types of media .
I did n't see that particular depiction in Honey & Clover as being ironic either , although perhaps that would be open to interpretation .
Bamboo :
So do you think that moe can have negative undertones ?
Casey :
Well , I think you have to remember , too , in the case of some moe , it 's all about marketability .
And since lolicon and moe can , in practice , overlap ( lolicon , of course , being tremendously marketable — and profitable — as well ) , you definitely see examples of moe that are not tremendously affirmative depictions of girls and women .
Bamboo :
Moe itself is very marketable .
They even have all those books in Japan , like the Moetan books , in which the whole purpose is to have an extremely moe character do moe things .
They 're super cute .
I 'm not going to lie — I think they 're pretty great .
You said earlier that it 's possible for females to feel moe towards characters .
I think it makes sense , though maybe they 're not the exact same feelings .
Sara :
In terms of marketing , a lot of moe merchandise is very appealing to both genders .
I love looking at cute things just as much as the next person .
I begin to have a problem with some of it where the line between wholesome cuteness and fetish territory begin to blur .
I know that the technical definition of moe is clearly separate from loli and other sexual fetishes , but that 's hard to buy when you suddenly stumble across all this " moe " merchandise that pictures these girls with very childish features and panties flashing all over the place .
Where 's the line ?
Casey : I think you are right to point that out .
Because in the example I just gave with the dog lover loving the puppy , it 's actually different from an anime fan loving a moe character , in the sense that the moe character is a representation , and the puppy is presumably real .
And so while a real - life puppy would be dependent upon its owner for food , water , shelter , etc. , a moe character is really and truly an object for the consumer 's adoration , exploitation , and objectification .
Because the character has no feelings , fans feel no responsibility toward her , and they may manifest behavior which , taken out of context or perhaps sinisterly transferred to a real young person by someone mentally unstable , can be distasteful or outright frightening .
Bamboo : I suppose there 's a fine line .
I mean , these characters are represented as these young , fresh - faced innocent girls , who are then turned around and marketed as something more sexual .
I think it's with the merchandising aspect of it that these sweet girls can sometimes cross the line between moe and possible fetish .
When you have a character where you can think , " Gee , I wish I could protect her , she 's my little sister , " and then you buy a body pillow of her and sleep next to her , suddenly it crosses a weird line .
You can watch a show and think , “ I really like this character .
She makes me feel like I should be a better person .
I should protect her , ” and whatnot .
But then when you buy a figure of her , or some doujinshi , and the original definition of moe almost loses its meaning .
Once you have a body pillow of a little girl …
I mean , I do n't know a lot of men who platonically sleep with their little sisters .
Sara : I love puppies , but I do n't think I 'd necessarily buy a body pillow of a puppy .
Bamboo : I have a lot of plush puppies , though , but I do n't know if that works as an appropriate parallel .
They provide me with comfort , but never having bought a body pillow of a human character before , I 'm not sure if there are any similarities or differences in thought .
Casey :
Well , I know there are dog fans who like to buy calendars of puppies .
Or puppy photobooks .
Sara :
Well , this kind of brings us back to that point you brought up earlier , where we need to keep in mind the difference between representation and reality .
Puppy calendars and photobooks are pictures of real dogs , obviously .
If I bought a huge dog - shaped stuffed animal , it would be because I 'd want the simulated comfort of a real pet .
In terms of moe character body pillows , though , I 'm not convinced it 's quite the same thought process .
If it was , it means that people are buying these pillows to simulate sleeping with a pre-teen every night .
I think it 's more the idea of the particular character itself , and the pure ideal it represents , that people are drawn to .
Casey :
That 's a really hard question to ask a person , though .
Bamboo :
Well , Sara , a few weeks ago , you mentioned that in your animation studio , you 've often been stuck animating or drawing the boyfriend character .
From sketches I 've seen in the past , a lot of these boyfriend types are these young bishounen types .
So , even with a lot of girls , it seems like there 's an affinity for these young , very boyish anime characters .
Do you think that has a similar crossover with moe ?
Sara : I think so .
I mean , the aesthetic of Japanese animation , in general , is about creating very idealistic , visually perfect people .
These are the romantic ideals that you can't get in real life .
But I think a difference has to be specified here , because the characters I was assigned to design and animate were clearly meant to be attractive and desirable to young women .
Like , they sing and give flowers and make bedroom eyes and what not .
Moe fans consistently assert that feelings of lust and desire — and even romance — need to be left out of the equation .
Bamboo :
So going back to the whole representation of real life .
If you have a representation of a little girl character , you can't necessarily translate that to real life .
And that 's one of the things that moe defenders will tell you .
Sara :
That 's very true .
Bamboo :
That 's one of those things that , even though they may really like this character , that because it 's just a representation to them , it 's not going to carry over .
At the same time , it 's one of those things where only some parts carry over .
Perhaps not the age or the look , but perhaps it 's part of the personality .
If the representation is a young girl , then perhaps the real life representation of that is a very quiet girl , a naïve girl , or one who is very girly .
Casey :
Well , we really have n't talked about this too much , but moe actually kind of had its moment after lolicon .
So lolicon is actually older then moe .
And so you see with moe a logical progression away from the female as a sexual — and thus threatening — being .
As we all know from watching anime , mature women can be awfully frightening , and Japanese guys who are hung up about their masculinity may find even a mature woman a threat .
So we get lolicon , which turns the object of desire into a less threatening little girl .
Yet it seems that for some , even the sexual power of the lolicon character was too powerful , so we get moe , which neutralizes the threat of female sexuality entirely .
Bamboo : I guess for me , it 's really hard to step into that mindset of the demographic of a moe show .
You know , I can watch a show like Air and think , “ oh , that 's a cute girl , ” but I do n't have any overwhelming feelings for her .
Outside of my feelings for her as a human towards another human being , I do n't really have a desire to protect her , so I guess for me , it 's hard to separate those who do have that feeling , and those who may look at her as something more sexualized .
Casey : I 'm not sure how much of the ideal of the moe fan is actually true .
That 's what I was kind of hinting at in the beginning .
On one hand , I do n't know that you can really say that the moe fans have no kind of sexual interest at all .
On the other hand , you might argue that , say you have a very insecure male who feels attached to a character , and to feel that the demands of reproduction and of sexual love are not present — it might be comforting to them .
So that might be a part of the appeal as well .
And in a sick way , the only way they can relate to the opposite sex is in a completely desexualized way .
Bamboo :
But it 's also interesting when you look at all the cases in anime in which you have the brother complex .
It 's a little hard to say , “ Well , that 's not sexual at all , ” when you have girls who say , “ Oh , he is my brother , and I want him to be mine for the rest of my life . ”
For example , shows like Please Twins or Sister Princess or Magikano , where you have these female who are super possessive of their brothers .
In one respect , it 's protective , but in another , it 's a little weird sometimes .
Some shows even poke fun at it , like the most recent Kujibiki Unbalance , where the sister is all over him .
Now , to cover my bases , I think this is completely different from shows that do bring up incest , but in a very unique and different way , like Koi Kaze .
I think the show is beautiful , but rather than use the brother - sister complex as some comedy device , it becomes the central focus point .
With them , it 's more like , “ Well , look at us .
There may be shame , but I can't hide this feeling , ” and I think that tugs on a very interesting subject , and I think the series is very thought - provoking and even heart - breaking .
Sara : I think the “ brother complex ” in its more fetishized form might tie in with what Casey was talking about before , with the ideal of the young , non-threatening innocent girl .
She will never be this scary alpha - female presence in your life ; she 'll just be this supportive girl who will always be there for you without her scary female sexuality hanging all over you .
Bamboo :
There does seem to always be a contrast between the cute moe girl and the scary woman he wants to avoid .
I guess it 's your typical foil between the douchey jock and the kind - hearted chess nerd who wo n't dump you after prom .
At the same time , I think it 's hard for us to understand since we do live in such a progressive society where being the powerful woman is totally cool .
You look at all those new series like Lipstick Jungle and what not , and you have these completely badass women .
Even back in the day with Ally McBeal , who was a total girl , but still kind of awesome and strong .
Casey : I 've noticed at least in manga that moe manga has not exactly taken off the same way here in the United States as it has in Japan .
For whatever that 's worth .
I 'm not sure what the situation is with anime as a category separate from manga , but it may be possible that the market for moe manga in the U.S. — and the most important purchasing demographic for all categories of printed fiction in general is women anyway — just is n't big enough to sustain it as a niche genre .
It just has n't become the phenomenon , at least not yet , so all of the stuff we 've been talking about is really only about the situation in Japan .
Or maybe moe is a product of cultural or economic facts on the ground in Japan that do not apply here ; they say that the phenomena of the shut - in is that way .
Sara :
We need more shut -ins .
Casey :
We need to make shut - ins a topic for another week .
Bamboo : I feel like a lot of the bagging on moe and comparing it to lolicon really comes from within the anime community .
Like , the persecution comes from fellow fans .
Casey :
Well , anime fans are used to feeling somewhat repressed , I think .
Not all , but some , especially in the context of mainstream pop culture .
There may be a tendency , just within the community itself , to point fingers at someone you feel superior to , just because in other contexts , you had people point fingers at you .
Sara : I also think there 's a persecution complex within anime fandom where , as the term implies , they feel they 're being persecuted .
Maybe even if it 's just joking or light mocking .
I think those two things combined can create some potentially disastrous flame war situations .
Bamboo : Bringing up the article I mentioned earlier , there is an interesting passage where he mentions , and I quote , “ Otaku guys fantasize about living in a girls - only world , like Little Women . ” I wonder if there is truth in that .
Interestingly , there 's a series that was recently released in the US called Otoboku .
The main character is a boy who , in order to fulfill his grandfather 's will , he ends up going to the same school his mother did .
But , it 's an all - girls school so he has to cross - dress in order to fit in .
It 's kind of a cute show , I think , but I wonder if that ties into the statement about otaku men wanting to live in a girls ' only world .
Sara : I think we'd have to ask an otaku man about that because I have no idea .
I think the closest equivalent to a flip flop for female viewers would be the Ouran Host Club , where girls leave their normal school lives behind to experience this fantastic male pampering .
Casey : I 've heard a lot of people talk about the origins of lolicon as being a kind of reaction against things like Fist of the North Star , for example , or Crying Freeman , where you have these über masculine guys , which is hard to live up to if you 're a real guy .
So instead of depictions of a hyper - masculinized culture everywhere , you start seeing depictions of a more feminine culture .
It 's also around the time you start to see more shojo manga - styled drawings in shonen manga .
The creator of Oh My Goddess was one of the pioneers of this .
I do definitely think there may be amongst some Japanese men a desire to not be male because of the pressures of being male in a very patriarchal society .
There is so much pressure to perform , pressure to make money , to have a family , to support your wife … sometimes these things are difficult or financially impossible .
It might also be stressful , and the desire to get away from that , or check out completely , can be overwhelming for some people .
Bamboo :
That is a really interesting point and I had n't really thought about that before .
You know , I guess it does make sense , especially when you look at so many male heroes today in anime that are popular nowadays .
You do n't have as many , “ Woah , I 'm gonna take over the world ! ” people .
You have more normal people who are high school students or college students , who do extraordinary things because of talent or hard work .
Maybe that 's where moe comes in , where you can be this normal guy , but still have a girl looking up to you who thinks you 'll protect her forever .
You do n't even have to take 20 punches to the face .
Casey : I think there may be something to that .
The more insecure somebody feels , the less they are willing to go up against somebody strong .
Sara :
That includes females , too , which would be a good explanation of why moe girls are so …
I 'm trying to look for an adjective that 's not too derogatory .
So innocent , I guess .
I 'll just go with that .
Bamboo :
You know , something that 's always struck me is that anime fans have amazing imaginations .
When I was at Anime Expo , Funimation had an Ouran High School Host Club booth where they had mostly female cosplayers dressing up as the boys , and they set up their own host club .
These hosts would stay in character , and would take customers on mini-dates around the exhibitor 's hall .
They'd chat with them , they 'd pretend to sip tea with them , and it was pretty incredible .
The customers loved them .
Casey :
Were the customers mostly men or women ?
Bamboo : Mostly women .
Sara :
That reminds me a lot of the Takarazuka Revue , a Japanese musical troupe originating in 1913 that 's all women .
They play all the different roles , including the male parts , and there 's all this elaborate stage make - up .
They have a big following , which is largely made up of women as well — something like 80 or 90 percent .
They 're still going strong today , and I hear anecdotes about mothers , who have seen the troupe perform 30 years ago , come back to contemporary shows with their daughters .
Casey : I think that it's hard to judge people at a convention , though , in relation to how they would feel in other contexts .
For some people , the convention is a kind of play already .
I think a lot of these gender issues have to do with power shifts .
For men , they 're being viewed as the more powerful ones , at least in the lenses of a heteronormative society .
Being female kind of means a divestment of power .
Men can say , “ I do n't have to be in control , I can let go , ” whereas for women , androgyny or masculinity represents power they are n't ordinarily allowed to have .
Or , and this is going off on a completely different topic , a lot of people say the reason why women want boys ' love is because they themselves are not present in the story .
It can be truly a romance between equals , because they are unable to imagine romance between equals when one of the two lovers in female .
Sara : I 've also heard of this , though I do n't know what it has to do with moe .
Bamboo : Well , if you look at boys ' love anime , it 's between two people who are presumably equals , but the readership is largely women , so they may have different views .
The scholarly argument , amongst some scholars anyway , is that with a male readership , they do n't necessarily want that same equality .
They do n't want a woman who is the equal , which is why moe comes into play .
Suddenly , he is dealing with something he can manage .
He 's not dealing with a woman trying to be the alpha male .
I do n't know that I agree with this viewpoint 100 % , but it 's interesting to consider .
Sara :
That 's a good point , especially considering the viewership of moe shows , and especially the kind of male protagonist that shows up in moe shows .
One of the points that consistently keep arising is the blandness in the “ everyman ” sorts of protagonists that tend to star in these types of titles .
They 're catalysts for the viewers more than any kind of substantial personality .
These types of catalyst characters tend not to appear much in boys ' love comics and anime and the female reader takes on a much more passive kind of voyeurism than full - on immersion .
Casey :
It 's really sad in a way when you think about the context of these two phenomena together , because what you have is men who only can feel powerful with a child .
And then you have women who are checking out of relationships altogether either by fantasizing about something that can't happen , or mock dating a woman in drag .
I mean , it 's just an utter disconnect between the sexes in Japan .
This is n't to say that all the heavy stuff we 've been talking about applies to all moe in the same way or to the same degree .
I 'll end this by saying that I really like Azumanga Daioh because it was so funny .
Sara : I wanted to mention that , too , the first time you brought it up .
I 'll have to side with the moe fans on that one .
I really love that show .
I can't get enough of it .
I watch it all the time .
I was just watching a few episodes last night , in fact .
Sakaki is amazing .
Casey : I almost died laughing .
Bamboo : I think a lot of anti-moe people are quick to judge and quick to jump the gun on the whole anti-loli thing .
There are a lot of shows I like that have these tiny , cute girls , and as a female viewer , I have no sexual feelings towards these girls .
I still think some of those shows are really hilarious , like Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star .
Shows like Strawberry Marshmallow and Bottle Fairies — I thought those shows were really cute .
What was that one show …
A Tiny Snow Fairy Sugar ?
Super cute .
Sara :
Oh my God , I love that show !
Bamboo : Yeah , it was a really cute show .
It 's unfair to male fans sometimes because you presumably have guys just like us who are thinking , “ Ah man , that show is so cute ! ” and then you have these haters who are like , “ Well obviously you 're a pedophile . ”
That 's not really fair .
Sara :
What other moe shows do you like ?
Bamboo : A lot of people give me crap for this , but I like some of those moe dating sim shows , like Air and Kannon .
They 're really cute , and some of them make me tear up at the end , because some of that stuff they put those characters through is just brutal .
You have to feel protective towards these girls in some of these dating sims .
The girls are either dying , or they 're not human , or they are in some screwed - up state of life .
I think in those cases , you almost have to feel protective of them .
Like , if you do n't feel protective of them , you 're kind of a cold person .
If you want to have sex with them , then that 's just some weird snuff film stuff going on .
That 's just weird .
Casey :
Well , like I said , I like Azumanga Daioh .
I began reading the manga first while browsing at the bookstore one evening .
I never even intended to buy it .
But there I was , standing in the bookstore reading it , and was just laughing in front of the bookshelf and attracting an embarrassing amount of attention .
I know if I re-read it , I would n't laugh the same way again because I know what it going to happen .
But for whatever reason , it really tickled my funny bone .
That 's enough for me to say I loved it .
Sara : I really like Strawberry Marshmallow .
There 's this character in it , Miu , who is probably one of my favorite characters ever .
She 's just this asshole kid who is kind of amazing .
She has a really bizarre personality and loves unapologetically aggravating everyone around her , and I guess I feel like I can connect with that because that 's how a lot of my friends acted while I was growing up .
She 's also a very assertive little girl , which I love .
I mean , she probably fits neatly into some moe category , but I really do n't care .
I really love all the Strawberry Marshmallow characters and I think the show is super funny and well written .
So I 've been busy with this Stack Overflow thing over the last two weeks .
By way of apology , I 'll share a little statistic you might find interesting : the percentage of traffic from search engines at stackoverflow.com .
Sept 16th
one day after public launch 10 % October 11th
less than one month after public launch 50 %
I try to be politically correct in discussing web search , avoiding the g- word whenever possible , desperately attempting to preserve the illusion that web search is actually a competitive market .
But it 's becoming a transparent and cruel joke at this point .
When we say " web search " we mean one thing , and one thing only : Google .
Rich Skrenta explains :
I 'm not a professional analyst , and my approach here is pretty back - of - the - napkin .
Still , it confirms what those of us in the search industry have known for a long time .
The New York Times , for instance , gets nearly 6 times as much traffic from Google as it does from Yahoo .
Tripadvisor gets 8 times as much traffic from Google vs. Yahoo .
Even Yahoo's own sites are no different .
While it receives a greater fraction of Yahoo search traffic than average , Yahoo's own flickr service gets 2.4 times as much traffic from Google as it does from Yahoo .
My favorite example : According to Hitwise , [ ex ]
Yahoo blogger Jeremy Zawodny gets 92 % of his inbound search traffic from Google , and only 2.7 % from Yahoo .
That was written almost two years ago .
Guess which way those numbers have gone since then ?
Google generally does a great job , so they deserve their success wholeheartedly , but I have to tell you : Google 's current position as the start page for the internet kind of scares the crap out of me , in a way that Microsoft 's dominance over the desktop PC never did .
I mean , monopoly power over a desktop PC is one thing -- but the internet is the whole of human knowledge , or something rapidly approaching that .
Do we really trust one company to be a benevolent monopoly over .. well , everything ?
But I digress .
Our public website is n't even a month old , and Google is already half our traffic .
I 'm perfectly happy to feed Google the kind of quality posts ( well , mostly ) fellow programmers are creating on Stack Overflow .
The traffic graph provided by Analytics is amusingly predictable , as well .
Giant peak of initial interest , followed by the inevitable trough of disillusionment , and then the growing weekly humpback pattern of a site that actually ( shock and horror ) appears to be useful to some people .
Go figure .
Guess they call it crackoverflow for a reason .
We knew from the outset that Google would be a big part of our traffic , and I wanted us to rank highly in Google for one very selfish reason -- writing search code is hard .
It 's far easier to outsource the burden of search to Google and their legions of server farms than it is for our tiny development team to do it on our one itty - bitty server .
At least not well .
I 'm constantly looking up my own stuff via Google searches , and I guess I 've gotten spoiled .
I expect to type in a few relatively unique words from the title and have whatever web page I know is there appear instantly in front of me .
For the first two weeks , this was definitely not happening reliably for Stack Overflow questions .
I 'd type in the exact title of a question and get nothing .
Sometimes I 'd even get copies of our content from evil RSS scraper sites that plug in their own ads of questionable provenance , which was downright depressing .
Other times , I 'd enter a question title and get a perfect match .
Why was old reliable Google letting me down ?
Our site is simple , designed from the outset to be easy for search engines to crawl .
What gives ?
What I did n't understand was the importance of a little file called sitemap.xml .
On a Q&A site like Stack Overflow , only the most recent questions are visible on the homepage .
The URL to get to the entire list of questions looks like this :
http://stackoverflow.com/questions
http://stackoverflow.com/questions?page=2
http://stackoverflow.com/questions?page=3 ..
http://stackoverflow.com/questions?page=931
Not particularly complicated .
I naively thought Google would have no problem crawling all the questions in this format .
But after two weeks , it was n't happening .
My teammate , Geoff , clued me in to Google 's webmaster help page on sitemaps :
Sitemaps are particularly helpful if : Your site has dynamic content .
Your site has pages that are n't easily discovered by Googlebot during the crawl process - for example , pages featuring rich AJAX or Flash .
Your site is new and has few links to it .
( Googlebot crawls the web by following links from one page to another , so if your site is n't well linked , it may be hard for us to discover it . )
Your site has a large archive of content pages that are not well linked to each other , or are not linked at all .
I guess I was spoiled by my previous experience with blogs , which are almost incestuously hyperlinked , where everything ever posted has a permanent and static hyperlink attached to it , with simple monthly and yearly archive pages .
With more dynamic websites , this is n't necessarily the case .
The pagination links on Stack Overflow were apparently enough to prevent full indexing .
Enter sitemap.xml .
The file itself is really quite simple ; it 's basically a non-spammy , non-shady way to have a " page " full of links that you feed to search engines .
A way that is officially supported and endorsed by all the major web search engines .
An individual record looks something like this :
The above element is repeated for each one of the ~ 27,000 questions on Stack Overflow at the moment .
Most search engines assume the file is at the root of your site , but you can inform them of an alternate location through robots .
txt :
User -Agent : * Allow : / Sitemap : /sitemap.xml
There are also limits on size .
The sitemaps.xml file cannot exceed 10 megabytes in size , with no more than 50,000 URLs per file .
But you can have multiple sitemaps in a sitemap index file , too .
If you have millions of URLs , you can see where this starts to get hairy fast .
I 'm a little aggravated that we have to set up this special file for the Googlebot to do its job properly ; it seems to me that web crawlers should be able to spider down our simple paging URL scheme without me giving them an explicit assist .
The good news is that since we set up our sitemaps.xml , every question on Stack Overflow is eminently findable .
But when 50 % of your traffic comes from one source , perhaps it 's best not to ask these kinds of questions .
Just smile and nod and follow the rules like everyone else .
I , for one , welcome our pixelated Google overlords !
When the 12,000 person city of Monticello , Minnesota voted overwhelmingly to put in a city - owned and - operated fiber - optic network that would link up all homes and business to a fast Internet pipe , the local telco sued to stop them .
Wednesday , District Court Judge Jonathan Jasper dismissed the suit with prejudice after finding that the city was well within its rights to build the network by issuing municipal bonds .
In this case , however , a total loss for the telco might actually turn out to be a perverse sort of victory .
The judge 's ruling , a copy of which was seen by Ars Technica , is noteworthy for two things : ( 1 ) the judge 's complete dismissal of Bridgewater Telephone Company 's complaint and ( 2 ) his obvious anger at the underfunding of Minnesota 's state courts .
Indeed , the longest footnote in the opinion is an extended jeremiad about how much work judges are under and why it took so long to decide this case , even going so far as to cite approvingly a newspaper editorial backing more funds for the court .
Bridgewater 's basic complaint was that cities in Minnesota are not allowed to use bonds in order to offer data services to residents , because they lack the necessary authority .
State statute says that such bonds may be issued for a host of projects ( sewers , stadia , playgrounds , and " homes for aged , " among others ) , and they can more generally be used to fund " other public conveniences . "
But is Internet access a " public convenience " ?
According to the judge , the entire point of the statute is to give cities the money - raising authority they need to " make a city a better place for its citizens to live . "
The fact that a fee would be charged to access the new fiber network is irrelevant ; such fees are also charged to use municipal swimming pools or subway systems or city - owned sports stadia and art galleries .
After a descent into grammar , which — if you were n't aware — is a " complementary analytical tool for understanding how language is used in a statute to convey meaning , " the judge got down to the heart of the matter .
Cities have the express right to operate a telephone exchange and a cable system ; the legislature also noted that the goal of all this was to encourage deployment of " higher speed telecommunications services and greater capacity for voice , video , and data transmission . "
This indicated that the " public convenience " was certainly meant to extend to data pipes , and the judge tossed the entire case .
Loss=win ?
Chris Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self - Reliance , which has been heavily involved in the case , praised the judge 's ruling , telling Ars that the entire case was little more than a " delaying tactic . "
After the Monticello referendum that approved the project , Bridgewater sued the city and immediately rolled out a fiber deployment of its own .
In our own conversation with TDS Telecom , the parent company of Bridgewater , Ars was told that nine crews were in town , laying a 100 - mile fiber network ( 20 miles were complete as of a month ago ) .
That puts the city network at a disadvantage .
Without being able to use funds from the bonds , the city has only been able to start construction on a basic loop to connect government offices and downtown businesses .
The bigger buildout to residential homes now must be postponed until after Minnesota 's harsh winter , potentially giving TDS a big head start .
The city 's FiberNet installation ( courtesy MonticelloFiber.com )
In Mitchell 's view , this was the only point of the lawsuit ; even in defeat , Bridgewater has tied the project up for six months and delayed it into next year .
TDS , for its part , insists to us that it simply wanted to protect taxpayers from covering an expensive system that TDS itself could operate more efficiently .
The telco might still appeal the ruling , but Mitchell was optimistic .
" We 've seen cities win these cases " all across the US , he said , and the Minnesota ruling should give other cities in the state a " giant green light " to roll out such projects of their own .
As for Monticello , it will now have the profligate luxury of having two fiber optic networks where most cities have none .
Monticello 's actions certainly spurred the TDS deployment , but the city now will have to compete with a telco for customers , as both offer similar services .
Unlike the city , TDS can also undercut the city 's network on cost by subsidizing it with profits from the many other communities where the company operates , and no doubt TDS would like nothing better than to see the city 's project turn into an expensive , underused boondoggle .
" See ? " it can say .
" We sue because we care .
And we turned out to be right . "
Update
In a statement , Drew Petersen of TDS Telecom makes the best of bad situation .
" While disappointed with the courts decision , " he writes , " we believe Judge Jasper recognized , on several occasions , including in his written decision , the validity of our suit when he states , ' the Court found that this litigation presented a substantial issue of statutory construction . ' "
Having your entire case dismissed on the merits can't feel like much of a victory , though the judge 's words will allow the company to dispute the charge that the lawsuit was merely a frivolous delay tactic .
TDS also stresses its commitment to its own fiber buildout and says that it " will continue to move forward with our construction plan to complete our fiber network by the end of the year . "

The boss of the US Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke has warned that there are still " downside risks " to growth in the world 's largest economy .
He also said that the " upside risks " to inflation had intensified recently .
Separately , President Bush said the economy was " remarkably resilient " , but urged Congress to pass legislation to help homeowners as soon as possible .
He defended plans to help mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but denied they were being bailed out .
' Special case '
Plans to offer the mortgage institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac access to fresh credit , if called upon , were necessary to stabilise the mortgage market and boost confidence , President Bush said .
However , he stressed that the two firms should remain shareholder owned .
I know there is a lot of nervousness
President George W. Bush Government moves to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - which between them guarantee nearly half of US mortgage debt - came after concerns about their exposure to rising mortgage foreclosures saw their share prices collapse .
The government 's response showed it was prepared to take tough decisions , President Bush said , adding that he hoped the action would " calm nerves " among the public and financial markets about the state of the economy .
Despite the problems faced by mortgage lenders and Wall Street institutions , he said that the country 's banking system was " basically sound " .
" We felt a special need to step up to provide , if needed , temporary assistance , " he said of the support for the two mortgage institutions .
" It is really important for people to have confidence in the mortgage market and for there to be stability in the mortgage market , " he added .
' Tough times '
While acknowledging the economy was facing " tough times " , President Bush said long - term prospects were still good and shrugged off talk of a possible recession .
" I know there is a lot of nervousness but the economy is growing , productivity is high and trade is up . "
However , his comments failed to allay market jitters with the Dow Jones index of leading shares closing below the 11,000 mark for the first time in two years .
Testifying before Congress , Mr Bernanke said the economy faced " numerous difficulties " but expressed hope that the slump in house building could begin to " level out " by the end of the year .

President Bush and Fed boss Mr Bernanke 's comments come as problems in the US housing market weigh on the wider economy , slowing consumer spending and boosting recession fears .
Figures published on Tuesday showed a sharp rise in wholesale price inflation , due to the rising cost of oil , as well as growing pressure on household budgets .
Retail spending rose a weaker - than - expected 0.1 % last month , showing that higher living costs and declining confidence have made consumers much more cautious .
With consumer spending accounting for nearly two - thirds of overall economic output , this suggests growth in the US economy could be minimal in the second half of 2008 , analysts said .
Balancing act Earlier this month , the Fed left its main interest rate unchanged at 2 % , as it tries to strike a balance between helping avoid a recession and containing rising prices .
The US is not alone in dealing with these twin economic problems , and the UK is wrestling with slower growth and quickening inflation .
Analysts have said that accelerating consumer price growth may mean they are unable to cut interest rates to stoke up growth .
" The Fed 's having a difficult time , as are most other central banks , as to what the next move should be , " said Dustin Reid of ABN Amro .

What are these ?
Nouriel Roubini has been almost freakishly accurate in calling the progression of the credit crisis , with his only major failings being predicting its onset on the early side and his fondness for an apocalyptic writing style , which now seems fully justified .
Even by the standards of his alarming missives , his latest is truly troubling .
Roubini effectively says the wheels are coming off the global financial system , and if corrective action is not taken immediately , the damage to the real economy will be extensive .
Note that Roubini ’s most recent forecast was that hedge funds would start folding due to redemptions and poor performance .
This can lead to cascading destruction of value .
Funds who have lost value and need to sell assets to cash out investors who want to exit sell positions into this lousy market .
The selling pressure leads to price declines , which affects the value of holding of other hedge funds .
At a minimum , they report losses to investors , some of whom will want out , feeding into the selling pressure .
And some who have used leverage will face margin calls due to the decline in asset value , again leading to liquidation of positions .
Apparently a bit of that was behind the end - of - day fall in the Dow on Thursday .
A hedge fund manager told me that apparently a West Coast hedge fund had to dump major positions , a portion of which were real estate debt related ( no detail here , they might have been late entrant bottom fishers ) and the prices they were getting were simply dreadful .
The concern was that other banks and hedge funds would be required to use these prices for valuation of their assets , leading to further markdowns and selling pressure .
The objective of the Paulson plan , to allow banks and investors to mark their books at above what would be market prices due to the Treasury ’s above market bids appears to have been trumped by events .
From Roubini’s RGE Monitor :
The U.S. and advanced economies ’ financial systems are now headed towards a near - term systemic financial meltdown as day after day stock markets are in free fall , money markets have shut down while their spreads are skyrocketing , and credit spreads are surging through the roof .
There is now the beginning of a generalized run on the banking system of these economies ; a collapse of the shadow banking system , i.e. those non-banks ( broker dealers , non -bank mortgage lenders , SIV and conduits , hedge funds , money market funds , private equity firms ) that , like banks , borrow short and liquid , are highly leveraged and lend and invest long and illiquid , and are thus at risk of a run on their short - term liabilities ; and now a roll - off of the short term liabilities of the corporate sectors that may lead to widespread bankruptcies of solvent but illiquid financial and non-financial firms .
On the real economic side , all the advanced economies representing 55 % of global GDP ( U.S. , Eurozone , UK , other smaller European countries , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Japan ) entered a recession even before the massive financial shocks
…
So we have a severe recession , a severe financial crisis and a severe banking crisis in advanced economies …
Countries with large current account deficits and / or large fiscal deficits and with large short - term foreign currency liabilities and borrowings have been the most fragile .
But even the better performing ones – like the BRICs club of Brazil , Russia , India and China – are now at risk of a hard landing .
Trade and financial and currency and confidence channels are now leading to a massive slowdown of growth in emerging markets with many of them now at risk not only of a recession but also of a severe financial crisis … .
At this point the recession train has left the station ; the financial and banking crisis train has left the station .
The delusion that the U.S. and advanced economies contraction would be short and shallow – a V - shaped six month recession – has been replaced by the certainty that this will be a long and protracted U - shaped recession that may last at least two years in the U.S. and close to two years in most of the rest of the world .
And given the rising risk of a global systemic financial meltdown , the probability that the outcome could become a decade long L - shaped recession – like the one experienced by Japan after the bursting of its real estate and equity bubble – cannot be ruled out .
And in a world where there is a glut and excess capacity of goods while aggregate demand is falling , soon enough we will start to worry about deflation , debt deflation , liquidity traps and what monetary policy makers should do to fight deflation when policy rates get dangerously close to zero .
At this point the risk of an imminent stock market crash – like the one - day collapse of 20 % plus in U.S. stock prices in 1987 – cannot be ruled out as the financial system is breaking down , panic and lack of confidence in any counterparty is sharply rising and the investors have totally lost faith in the ability of policy authorities to control this meltdown .
This disconnect between more and more aggressive policy actions and easings , and greater and greater strains in the financial market is scary .
When Bear Stearns ’ creditors were bailed out to the tune of $ 30 bn in March , the rally in equity , money and credit markets lasted eight weeks ; when in July the U.S. Treasury announced legislation to bail out the mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie , the rally lasted four weeks ; when the actual $ 200 billion rescue of these firms was undertaken and their $ 6 trillion liabilities taken over by the U.S. government , the rally lasted one day , and by the next day the panic had moved to Lehman ’s collapse ; when AIG was bailed out to the tune of $ 85 billion , the market did not even rally for a day and instead fell 5 % .
Next when the $ 700 billion U.S. rescue package was passed by the U.S. Senate and House , markets fell another 7 % in two days as there was no confidence in this flawed plan and the authorities .
Next , as authorities in the U.S. and abroad took even more radical policy actions between October 6th and October 9th ( payment of interest on reserves , doubling of the liquidity support of banks , extension of credit to the seized corporate sector , guarantees of bank deposits , plans to recapitalize banks , coordinated monetary policy easing , etc. ) , the stock markets and the credit markets and the money markets fell further and further and at accelerated rates day after day all week , including another 7 % fall in U.S. equities today .
When in markets that are clearly way oversold , even the most radical policy actions do n’t provide rallies or relief to market participants .
You know that you are one step away from a market crash and a systemic financial sector and corporate sector collapse .
A vicious circle of deleveraging , asset collapses , margin calls , and cascading falls in asset prices well below falling fundamentals , and panic is now underway .
At this point severe damage is done and one cannot rule out a systemic collapse and a global depression .
It will take a significant change in leadership of economic policy and very radical , coordinated policy actions among all advanced and emerging market economies to avoid this economic and financial disaster .
Urgent and immediate necessary actions that need to be done globally ( with some variants across countries depending on the severity of the problem and the overall resources available to the sovereigns ) include :
another rapid round of policy rate cuts of the order of at least 150 basis points on average globally .
a temporary blanket guarantee of all deposits while a triage between insolvent financial institutions that need to be shut down and distressed but solvent institutions that need to be partially nationalized with injections of public capital is made ; a rapid reduction of the debt burden of insolvent households preceded by a temporary freeze on all foreclosures ;
massive and unlimited provision of liquidity to solvent financial institutions ; public provision of credit to the solvent parts of the corporate sector to avoid a short - term debt refinancing crisis for solvent but illiquid corporations and small businesses ; a massive direct government fiscal stimulus packages that includes public works , infrastructure spending , unemployment benefits , tax rebates to lower income households and provision of grants to strapped and crunched state and local government ; a rapid resolution of the banking problems via triage , public recapitalization of financial institutions and reduction of the debt burden of distressed households and borrowers ; an agreement between lender and creditor countries running current account surpluses and borrowing , and debtor countries running current account deficits to maintain an orderly financing of deficits and a recycling of the surpluses of creditors to avoid a disorderly adjustment of such imbalances .
At this point anything short of these radical and coordinated actions may lead to a market crash , a global systemic financial meltdown and to a global depression .
The time to act is now as all the policy officials of the world are meeting this weekend in Washington at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings .
Those programs allow about 15 percent of their collateral to be in equities or debt that is below investment - grade , and most of that is reserved for equities .
On Friday , Timothy F. Geithner , president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , urged Wall Street chieftains to come up with a solution to stem the growing crisis of confidence .
Echoing comments made earlier in the week by the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , Mr. Geithner said the government would not rescue financial firms .
In the end , the government succeeded in getting Wall Street to create its own insurance policy .
But at the same time , the Fed , in agreeing to loosen terms under which it lends money to firms , is potentially putting more taxpayer money at risk .
The events over a harrowing weekend indicate that top officials at the Federal Reserve and at the Treasury will take a harder line on providing government support to troubled institutions .
But that does not mean they are unwilling to provide indirect help , or even relax regulatory requirements temporarily .
At first glance , the new strategy by Mr. Paulson and the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben S. Bernanke , represents a purer and tougher insistence that Wall Street work out its own problems without government help .
But before the weekend was over , it was also clear that they could stand by their principles  and be creative , too .
For example , if Bank of America completes its acquisition of Merrill Lynch , its capital reserves would immediately fall below the minimum requirements for bank holding companies .
Regulators , including the Federal Reserve , would have to show lenience for as long as it takes the capital markets to regain their confidence  which could be quite a while .
And the expansion of the Fed ’s lending facilities adds another novel approach to help stabilize markets , but without supporting yet another bailout .
Celebrities Caught Goofing Off ( Photos )

This is the suspension ?
What did I miss ?
The guy is literally out of control .
At what point do his friends need to start discussing an intervention ?
So it ’s been about 2 weeks now since I ’ve been banned from Digg .
Life continues to go on , the sun has continued to come out each day .
By golly , I think I ’m gonna make it .
( sarcasm exudes ) .
Since being banned I have joined many other social networks like Mixx and others .
I have started a new news submission sight at Reddit , called ExDiggers .
Things are going well there with 26 subscribers to the group in only 4 days of operation .
I think about all the BS that Digg makes people go through and I become aware of how glad I do n’t have to be there .
All of the rocket science that is the Recommendation Engine , the having to digg people ’s crap all of the time .
Hell as much as Sir Popper submitted , ( 20 - 30 submissions per day ) I damn well needed a script just to keep up with digging his stuff .
Not to mention at one time I had 1,000 friends .
It was getting old fast .
Shortly after being banned from Digg , I registered again under the name of Arthur McNasty and was able to post a post telling all of my friends what happened and to see how long it would take to get banned again .
I had the same icon of Alfred E. Newman from Mad Magazine fame , and just as a comical experiment wanted to see how long before Digg and the Gestapo caught me .
It took Digg a solid 48 hours to ban me again .
I thought it was funny when some of my old Digg friends alerted me that I should have used a different icon so as to not tip off the Gestapo at Digg , and they did n’t know this was just an experiment on Digg banning .
Question : Has anyone ever seen Kevin Rose without a laptop ?
Is that piece of apparatus joined permanently to his crotch ?
Just as a joke and to bring negative publicity to Digg and the unfair ways it treats it ’s members , I am calling on a boycot of Digg on Halloween , October 31 , 2008 .
Let ’s scare the crap out of Digg by not even going to the site , digging or submitting anything .
Let ’s see what that does to their Recommendation Engine .
Maybe that will allow Kevin Rose to get that laptop unstuck from his crotch .
FOR MCCAIN , A SUDDEN SWITCH IN STRATEGY FOR MCCAIN , A SUDDEN SWITCH IN STRATEGY
How the political drama between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama unfolded Wednesday : 8:30 a.m. ET Obama calls McCain but does not reach him .
Obama says later that he intended to speak with his rival about issuing a joint statement on the financial crisis .
2:30 p.m. McCain calls back .
Brian Rogers , a McCain spokesman , says McCain suggested they both return to Washington to work on the bailout plan .
Obama says he asked McCain to join him in issuing a statement about their commitment to work toward a solution .
He says McCain mentioned the idea of suspending their campaigns and delaying their Friday debate .
2:35 p.m .
In a statement to reporters in New York , McCain says he is suspending his campaign and seeking to delay Friday 's debate .
National TV outlets air video of the remarks about 20 minutes later .
3:12 p.m. Bill Burton , an Obama spokesman , e-mails reporters saying McCain had agreed earlier to a joint statement and that the campaigns were working out details .
4:39 p.m. Obama tells reporters in Clearwater , Fla. , the debate should go on .
He says he 'll return to Washington if it 's helpful but is wary of injecting presidential politics into sensitive talks on the Wall Street bailout .
5:33 p.m. The Commission on Presidential Debates says it is moving forward with the debate in Oxford , Miss .
7:30 p.m. President Bush invites McCain and Obama to a White House meeting today with congressional leaders on the rescue plan .
8:30 p.m .
The candidates issue a joint statement saying it's " time to rise above partisan politics for the good of the country . "

More coverage : Recession is official , economists say NEW YORK  Statesmanship or gamesmanship ?
As he did four weeks ago with his pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate , Republican John McCain shook up the presidential race Wednesday with an unexpected maneuver .
Announcing that he was suspending his campaign so he could return to Washington and join negotiations on the White House 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street , McCain sought to portray himself as a forceful leader on the economy , an issue on which he 's been stumbling in the polls .
POLITICS BLOG : McCain says ' America should be proud of ' bipartisan work on rescue plan MORE BLOG : Text of McCain speech Thursday in New York " I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands , and we are running out of time , " McCain said .
Democrat Barack Obama agreed the talks " should not be subject to the usual partisan politics " but questioned McCain 's call to postpone their debate scheduled for Friday in Oxford , Miss .
" This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who , in approximately 40 days , will be responsible for dealing with this mess , " he said .
The fast - moving developments sent behind - the - scenes talks on Capitol Hill colliding with a fierce presidential campaign now heading into its final five weeks .
McCain 's move — praised by some Republicans as a sign of leadership , ridiculed by Democrats as grandstanding — was a gamble that might recast a slipping campaign .
It also could affect what is likely to be the biggest bailout in U.S. history .
POLITICS BLOG : How the news unfolded BUSH : ' Entire economy ' at risk Late Wednesday , Obama and McCain issued a joint statement calling for " a spirit of cooperation " to resolve the financial crisis .
Both senators are expected at the White House this afternoon for a meeting with President Bush and congressional leaders .
The back - and - forth between the McCain and Obama campaigns Wednesday underscored what has emerged as striking differences in the candidates ' characters and responses to a crisis : McCain 's willingness to take a risk and Obama 's refusal to be distracted from his game plan .
" McCain needed to do something dramatic to change the tone of the conversation , " said Dan Schnur , a top aide in McCain 's 2000 campaign .
" It may work .
It may not work .
But it 's got a much better chance of working than just sitting there and letting this crisis roll over him . "
Democrats — noting that until recently McCain had opposed government intervention in the financial crisis and insisted the economy was fundamentally sound — cast his move as politically convenient .
" Transparent , vapid publicity stunt , " Democratic pollster Mark Mellman scoffed .
McCain essentially tried to cast Obama in the position of junior partner , following McCain 's lead on the dominant issue of the day .
Obama made clear that he was the one who first called McCain Wednesday morning to ask that the two campaigns issue a joint statement outlining their principles for a deal .
Obama said he only learned of McCain 's plans to return to Washington from TV .
Still unclear was the status of their debate , scheduled for 9 p.m. ET Friday .
Obama said he was prepared to participate .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , who has represented McCain in debate negotiations , said the Arizona senator would n't participate unless a deal had been sealed in Congress by then , which seems unlikely .
McCain 's move came as his campaign faces trouble on several fronts .
National polls sponsored by ABC - Washington Post and NBC - Wall Street Journal showed Obama gaining favor as the economy dominated voters ' concerns .
There 's also a brewing controversy over payments to McCain campaign manager Rick Davis and his firm from mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which have been taken over by the government .
On Capitol Hill , McCain 's move could complicate sensitive negotiations on the bailout .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made it clear McCain was n't welcome .
When McCain called Reid and said he wanted to sit down with congressional leaders , Reid read him a statement he had released to reporters characterizing McCain 's move as a gimmick .
Reid spokesman Jim Manley said the Nevada Democrat told McCain " it would not be helpful " for the candidates to get involved in the talks and risk injecting presidential politics in them .
" We need leadership , not a campaign photo op , " Reid said .
In the long haul , though , the support of both McCain and Obama is likely to be crucial for any bailout deal .
As president , one of them will be responsible for implementing its provisions and dealing with its consequences .
Playing phone tag
So who called first ?
In a sign of the political one - upmanship at work throughout the day , the campaigns jockeyed to take credit for making the first step toward joint action on the financial crisis .
Obama said he got the idea of a joint statement from Oklahoma 's Tom Coburn , one of the most conservative Republicans in the Senate .
Coburn entered the Senate in 2005 , the same year as Obama , and the two became fast , if unlikely , friends .
At 8:30 a.m. ET , Obama called McCain to suggest the idea .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said Obama wanted " to ask ( McCain ) if he would join in issuing a joint statement outlining their shared principles and conditions for the Treasury proposal , and urging Congress and the White House to act in a bipartisan manner to pass such a proposal . "
McCain called back at 2:30 p.m. and the two agreed to have staffers work on a statement .
About five minutes later , McCain was telling reporters the he was suspending his campaign , returning to Washington and calling for a postponement of the debate .
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers downplayed Obama 's call , saying the Democrat had n't reached McCain or said why he was calling .
" Sen. McCain was meeting with economic advisers and talking to leaders in Congress throughout the day prior to calling Sen. Obama , " Rogers said .
When McCain called him back , Rogers said , the Arizona senator expressed " deep concern that the plan on the table would not pass " and asked Obama to join him in returning to Washington to help solve the problem .
Obama told reporters he thought McCain was only " mulling " the idea of going back to Washington .
Almost immediately afterward , he saw McCain on TV .
Graham , a McCain confidant , said he has given the GOP nominee daily briefings on the negotiations over the bailout package and that they decided Tuesday night the campaign should be suspended until the financial crisis was resolved .
" Obama and McCain both need to come back , " Graham said , adding that he 's concerned about the consequences if Congress fails to reach a deal .
The South Carolina Republican denied that McCain 's move was motivated by politics or polls showing the economic crisis was pushing voters into Obama 's camp .
" The numbers he 's worried about now are people 's 401 ( k ) s , " Graham said .
He called the congressional hearings " a disaster , " with no signs that members of Congress or voters were coalescing around the plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
However , Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , countered that there has been progress in the bailout negotiations , and that McCain 's return to Washington is an effort to take credit for a solution that will happen anyway .
He called McCain 's move " the longest Hail Mary pass in the history of either football or Marys . "
Agreement on principles During the first presidential race in U.S. history to feature two sitting senators , both have been AWOL from their day jobs as they pursue the White House .
The last time Obama cast a vote in the Senate was July 9 ; McCain 's last vote was April 8 .
For all the political wrangling over whether the candidates should be involved in the bailout talks , there were some on both sides who said they belong at the table .
In an interview Tuesday night , Sen. Mark Pryor , a centrist Democrat who has worked with McCain and Obama on other bipartisan deals , expressed what he thought was only a wistful hope that they might return .
" We need leadership right now , " Pryor had said .
" It would be good … for them to suspend their campaigns and come back here and really work with us on this , come up with something we can all do together . "
But , he said , " they would n't do this ; they 've got a debate Friday . "
Despite their bickering , Obama and McCain generally agree about what the key principles of a bailout plan should be .
McCain 's ideas track closely with what Obama has demanded , including an independent oversight board , relief for homeowners threatened with foreclosure and pay limits for executives whose troubled companies take part in the bailout program .
President Bush last night said he hoped the presence of the two presidential competitors at the negotiating table would " help speed our discussions toward a bipartisan bill " in a divided Congress , where complaints about the administration 's rescue plan span the ideological gamut from free - market conservatives such as Sen.
Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , to Sen. Bernie Sanders , a Vermont independent who describes himself as a socialist .
Still , Obama is a first - term senator and McCain is n't particularly influential with the conservative wing of his party .
Indeed , some of the fiercest GOP critics of the bailout plan — DeMint and Sens. Jeff Sessions , R - Ala. , and John Cornyn , R - Texas — are the same lawmakers who tangled with McCain last year over a bipartisan immigration bill the Arizona Republican drafted with Sen.
Edward Kennedy , D - Mass .
A similar prairie fire has engulfed Capitol Hill this week .
DeMint said the reaction from his constituents reflects his opposition .
" It 's 100 to 1 against it . "

Statement of the Grand Inquisitor :
The American election cycle is the perfect complement to America ’s vain , self - serving Calvinist religion .
American Democracy and American Calvinism both pander to lazy , bipolar drama queens who lack the least capacity for moral introspection .
The Calvinist never considers his actions in the cold light of conscience , because he has no conscience .
The American voter shares this lack .
Thus , after eight years of total disaster , we find not a single hint of humility , let alone shame or repentance , in this most corrupt polity .
The 2008 election serves instead to wipe the American memory clean , just as the Holy Roller ’s spastic , gibbering hop to the pulpit to be baptized again wipes from his memory all the vile , selfish and stupid crimes he has committed .
Americans decry “ The Blame Game . ”
We consider the blame game to be the very source of morality .
Blame would be an excellent contribution to the improvement of the American polity .
Blame is very much warranted .
Blame is your due .
You should blame yourselves .
Why do you not ?
Instead you have wormed your way , in a manner all too typical of your nation , to the center of attention as a wronged innocent .
You , the ordinary American , are the antithesis of innocence .
You are lazy , yes ; there is no more intellectually and lazy creature on this earth .
And you are ignorant , willfully so .
But a life spent actively avoiding moral introspection is not innocence .
It is prima facie evidence of deep complicity in every crime your chosen proxies have committed .
This November , you will weep and be born again , while Oprah baptizes you anew , to begin another of your nine lives of selfish , stupid meanness .
You are the masters of your own backyard immorality plays .
If you choose Obama , you will consider yourselves absolved of the last eight years , and spend the next four stroking yourselves for being such fine , broadminded specimens .
When he proves unable to stem the rot you have indulged for your entire adult lives , you will regretfully return to outright fanged madness .
If you choose McCain , you vote more simply for the worst of yourselves , but you will find a way to detach yourselves from him as he presides over an accelerated debacle .
However you vote , you will emerge from the voting booth like a Baptist from the tub , full of self - satisfaction and coy optimism .
You will give the performance of your hammish lifetime , affecting shock and sorrow over how badly it all turned out .
Analysts say that Obama would have enough electoral votes to win the presidency , or very close to it , if the election were held today .
He has been lifted by the Wall Street meltdown and economic anxieties over the last several weeks , with many polls showing voters trust Obama ( and Democrats generally ) more to right the economy .
It 's not just the middle class that has money worries .
Even the affluent are worrying about running out of cash .
American Express Publishing and Harrison Group
According to a new survey from American Express Publishing and the Harrison Group , nearly half of respondents with incomes of $ 250,000 or more agreed with the statement that " I worry ...
You ’re headed somewhere on your bike and you want to bring your lunch along .
Maybe you ’re commuting or just headed to the park .
Backpacks get warm , so you ’d rather not wear one , and you do n’t have a rack on your bike to pack your lunch on .
Here ’s a solution : a bike frame lunch bag you can make that will perfectly hold a box of leftovers or a sandwich .
This one is designed for a standard “ entree ” sized plastic container , which is reasonably waterproof and acts as a structural integrity field for your sandwich .
The bag is made from three pieces of fabric : an 8 ″ x 8 ″ square , an 8 ″ x 13 ″ rectangle , and a 3 ″ x 22 ″ strip .
Canvas ( shown here ) is a nice material to use , but any sturdy fabric like oilcloth or vinyl would work as well .
Seam allowances are 1/2 ″ throughout , so the finished dimensions are about 7 ″ x 7 ″ x 2 ″ .
You can adapt the pattern to fit your preferred leftover box or sandwich bread .
Also needed is velcro , but more on that later .
The first step is to sew the strip around the outside of the front of the bag .
Put your sewing machine needle down and pivot at the corners to turn the strip and the square in the next direction .
Fold over 1/4 ″ and 1/4 ″ again across the top of the front and the top of the sides of the bag to form a rolled hem and sew it down .
This canvas held a finger crease well , which made the rolled hem fairly easy .
Sew the back on , rotating at the corners again .
Next , hem your flap .
If you fold in the tips of the corners before rolling the sides , you can form a neat point .
It ’s velcro time !
Velcro cable ties can be found at hardware and electronic stores and are the perfect thing for mounting the bag to the bike .
They have an ultra - thin profile and are extremely easy to sew to .
The loop side is soft like felt and the hook side feels remarkably smooth , but when stuck back onto itself , it holds extremely well .
They ’re thin enough not to interfere with the cabling on your bicycle .
Sew two straps to the top of the flap to use for connecting to the top tube of your bike .
Sew one more strap to the bottom of one of the sides to connect to the seat tube .
You can see the rectangles of stitches where the top ones are sewn on here .
Also sew some additional velcro ( conventional velcro will work fine ) onto the front and flap to keep the flap closed .
You wo n’t figure this out until you get going fast , but you ’ll want that extra little bit on the side of the flap that points to the front of the bicycle to keep it from flapping as you zoom along .
Slide your lunch in , strap the bag on and you ’re ready to go !

According to a recent Rasmussen Reports survey , 28 % of Americans support the banker bailout plan and another 35 % are not sure what to think .
“ Adding weight to the large number of undecideds is the finding that 82 % of Americans are following the bailout story , including 44 % who say they are following it very closely .
Sixty - five percent ( 65 % ) say they are at least somewhat confident they understand the reasons why the plan is being proposed . ”
Goldman Sachs chairman Paulson ’s appointment was no mistake and it surely was n’t a conflict of interest .
In fact , most people have no idea what ’s behind the plan because the corporate media is not telling them the whole story .
Most do not realize there is a crash right around the corner and it is part of the New International Economic Order — synonymous with the phrase New World Order — proposed by the Trilateral Commission , a coterie of bankers and directors of transnational corporations headed up by the chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank and a central figure in the Council on Foreign Relations , David Rockefeller .
“ The Trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States , ” Barry Goldwater wrote in 1979 .
How best to realize this multinational consolidation ?
Break the bank — or rather the U.S. Treasury .
In 2005 , writing for the Federal Reserve , Dr. Laurence J. Kotlikoff noted : “ Countries can and do go bankrupt .
The United States , with its $ 65 trillion fiscal gap , seems clearly headed down that path . ”
One year after Kotlikoff wrote this , the Bush administration sacked Treasury Secretary John Snow and replaced him with Hank Paulson , chairman of Goldman Sachs , one of a small number of institutions allowed to purchase bills , bonds , and notes directly form the Treasury .
Paulson ’s appointment was no mistake and it surely was n’t a conflict of interest .
On March 31 , 2008 , Paulson released a 200 page document titled , “ Blueprint for a Modernized Regulatory Structure . ”
It calls for the complete restructuring of U.S. markets and their regulatory structures to meet new “ global standards , ” that is to say bring them in line with the New International Economic Order , i.e. , the New World Order .
Under Paulson ’s “ Proposed Treasury Authority to Purchase Troubled Assets , ” ( see the Fact Sheet on the U.S. Treasury ’s website ) , the “ Secretary will have the discretion , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , to purchase other assets , as deemed necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets . ”
In other words , if passed by Congress , Paulson and Bernanke will have the authority to intervene in the markets as they — as minions of the global elite — deem necessary .
It is not a stretch to imagine the outcome : a cornering of the gold , silver , or platinum markets , the snatching up of prime real estate and corporations , running the competition out of business .
In essence , this represents the sovietization of the U.S. economy .
It is central planning as envisioned by the global elite .
It is a triumph for the New International Economic Order .
It is a fait accompli for the globalists .
Not that you can do anything about it , at least nothing legal .
“ The bill would bar courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority , ” reports Bloomberg .
“ This is a much - needed declaration of power for the Treasury secretary , ” remarked historian John Steele Gordon , author of “ Hamilton ’s Blessing . ”
( Alexander Hamilton was a blessing for the bankers — he conceived the First Bank of the United States , modeled after the Bank of England . )
Frank Razzano , a former assistant chief trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission , told Bloomberg the Bush administration wants “ dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts . ”
“ This is not a monarchy , ” economist Nouriel Roubini complained earlier this week .
No , it ’s not a monarchy — instead , it ’s shaping up to be a fascist dictatorship as Mussolini , the father of fascism , understood it : an absolutist state controlled by corporations and international bankers .
“ If Wall Street gets away with this , ” writes William Greider for The Nation , “ I predict it will become a transforming event in American politics — exposing the deep deformities in our democracy and launching a tidal wave of righteous anger and popular rebellion . ”
Mr. Greider may not know it , but the globalists are one step ahead of him .
These would - be rebels will have to deal with the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team and other components of Northern Command , soon to be “ an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks , ” according to the Army Times .
It ’s an “ enduring mission , ” dealing with terrorists who are opposed to being reduced to chattel slaves for the bankers and global elite .
“ This is not a plan aimed at reviving the economy , ” remarked Robert Brusca , chief economist of Fact and Opinion Economics .
Brusca ’s right .
It ’s a plan designed by bankers to steal wealth through bankruptcy and economic depression .
It ’s designed to reduce you to serfdom and make you a peon to the New International Economic Order , aka the New World Order .
Finally , Council on Foreign Relations insider Carroll Quigley warned us about this back in 1966 when he wrote :
The powers of financial capitalism had ( a ) far - reaching aim , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences .
The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world ’s central banks which were themselves private corporations .
Each central bank … sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans , to manipulate foreign exchanges , to influence the level of economic activity in the country , and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Quick :
What would you do if you impaled yourself with a large , sharp , piece of wood ?
If your tooth fell out ?
If you fell from a high ladder ?
If your friend had a severe allergic reaction ?
Even if you do n't have first aid training , there are simple things everyone can learn to do in emergency situations .
" You really could save somebody 's life , " says Dr. Assaad Sayah , chief of emergency medicine at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts .
Think of it as " first aid for idiots " -- five things to remember if you otherwise know nothing about first aid .
1 . Do n't remove a foreign object .
It happens more often than you might think : a child impaled by a pencil or someone stepping on a nail or even someone being stabbed .
Particularly after storms , debris is also an impalement hazard .
Among injuries that cause ER visits , punctures rank fourth behind falls , car accidents and being struck by an object , according to the CDC .
The doctor 's advice : Leave it in and call 911 ( unless it 's something small , like a splinter ) .
" It may be plugging a hole in an artery or vein , and as soon as you take it out , you could bleed to death , " says Dr. David Beiser , an emergency medicine physician at the University of Chicago Medical Center .
2 . Do n't apply a tourniquet to stop bleeding .
Apply pressure and do n't put on a tourniquet unless you 've been trained to do so .
" If you do n't know what you 're doing , you could destroy that limb , " Sayah says .
3 . Do ask around for an epinephrine auto - injector in case of allergic reaction .
If someone has an allergic reaction , ask if he or she has an epinephrine pen .
They may have one but forgotten .
" People get very panicked when they can't breathe , " Sayah says .
" If they do n't have one , ask other people who might be nearby . "
Sayah says these auto - injectors are easy to use even without training .
" It 's like a ballpoint pen that clicks , " he says .
And of course , call 911 .
4 . Do n't clean a tooth that 's fallen out .
" You 're cleaning off important structures like nerves and ligaments , " Beiser says .
Put the tooth in milk and head to the emergency room , says Dr. Richard Bradley , a member of the American Red Cross advisory council on first aid , aquatics , safety and preparedness .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Stocking a first aid kit
As an alternative , you can try to hold it in the socket where it fell out , he says , adding that if a child loses a baby tooth , doctors will not try to put it back in -- it 's gone for good .
5 . Do n't move someone who 's fallen from a high place .
Anyone who 's fallen from an elevation is at risk of sprains , fractures and worse , internal injuries .
" If they 're in back or neck pain , leave them in the position they 're in , " Bradley says .
" If you need to move them , do a log roll so you 're moving their head , body , and legs all as one unit . "
For more first aid basics , go to the guides from the Mayo Clinic and the Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide .

Bob Barr vs. Texas GOP and Dems :
The saga continues
We reported on Bob Barr being the only candidate to submit his paperwork on time to be on the Texas ballot last Wednesday .
Then we reported on the Texas Secretary of State " finding " the Democratic and Republican paperwork " upon further checking . "
We also covered the Barr camps response to this " upon-further - checking - discovery . "
Now we can mention a few legal precedents that might get the Democrats and Republicans on the ballot , in spite of the technical legal requirements .
According to Ballot Access News :
" Although that it seems undisputed that both the Republican and Democratic Parties missed the August 26 Texas deadline for filing a certificate naming their presidential and vice - presidential nominees , there are two Texas Supreme Court decisions that say that candidates should not suffer the loss of ballot access due to the mistakes of state party officials .
The cases are Davis v Taylor , 930 SW 2d 581 , and Bird v Rothstein , 930 SW 2d 586 .
The first case put a Republican nominee for State Court of Appeals Justice on the November ballot ; the second one put a Democratic nominee for state house on the November ballot . "
The Barr campaign , quoted in Independent Political Report , thinks the two major parties will get exceptions that put them " above the law " :
" In Texas , we have a clear deadline that was not met by the Republicans and Democrats , but it is all but certain that some way , some how , the establishment candidates will find a way on the ballot .
Some people are just above the law . "
There 's reason to think the Barr campaign is right .
While there are legal precedents that permit Democrats and Republicans from getting on the ballot in spite of technically violating the law on filing paperwork on time , other parties have no such precedents to lean on .
Again according to Ballot Access News :
" In 2004 , Ralph Nader submitted his independent presidential petition two weeks late .
He submitted it on the more lenient deadline for minor party petitions , but the federal courts upheld the earlier deadline and kept Nader off the ballot . "
Double standard ?
Sounds like it .

Family members of the victims attended a ceremony for the four , as well as for eight other soldiers killed over the past 12 months , held just before the start of the parade through the central streets of Madrid .
From BailoutSleuth.com :
When the Treasury Department 's bailout czar provided an update this week on the government 's $ 700 billion plan to rescue troubled financial institutions , he vowed that it would be an " open and transparent program with appropriate oversight . "
The next day , the Treasury Department put out an announcement about a major bailout - related contract with Bank of New York Mellon Corp. that fell short in the transparency department .
The copy of the agreement that was made public had blacked - out paragraphs in the section covering Bank of New York Mellon 's compensation .
If the Treasury Department is unwilling to disclose the particulars of that contract — or even the general outline of the compensation scheme — that raises questions about how it will treat disclosure of other bailout transactions .
There ’s a financial crisis in our country .
Politicians can’t successfully work together on a plan to save our struggling economy , but at least they can agree on a stupid catch phrase to say : ‘ we have to rescue Wall Street and Main Street ...’
Everyone is using that expression : Obama , McCain and the news media are doing their best to hammer it into our heads .
Stop it , assholes !
We get it .
Wall Street is where all the businesses are .
Main Street is the name of a street in many small towns .
Can everybody stop comparing them now , please ?
It does n’t even really work as an analogy .
When politicians refer to “ Main Street , ” they ’re talking about regular folks who are n’t CEOs or major corporations .
How would the ( now failed ) bailout affect Joe Doritobag ?
However , Main Street is usually the hub of small businesses , not where people actually live .
Walnut Street or Evergreen Ave or Lakeview Terrace ( now in theaters ) would at least be more accurate .
However , if there ’s one thing politicians enjoy , it ’s repeating shit .
For one , it saves their speech writers from working too hard .
* Phew *
Also , let ’s face it , people love catch phrases , like the popular “ yes we can , ” “ read my lips , ” and most notably , “ he look - a like a man ! ”
In fact , Michael McDonald single - handedly kept MadTV on the air by playing the little retarded boy and saying “ let me do it ! ” over a million times .
It ’s comforting to know that the best way to market a politician or idea to Americans is to present it like a MadTV sketch .
I have nothing against sound bytes , but if Lincoln were around today , and every time he opened his mouth he said “ four score ” this or “ four score ” that , I ’d want to suffocate him with his own top hat — no matter how many civil wars he won !
So I ’m suggesting a name change to the endlessly repeated intersection of Wall Street and Main Street — Blow Yourself Junction .
I ’ll call the Mayor ’s office and get the ball rolling .
With all due respect to Sen. Barack Obama , I think he 's mistaken about John McCain .
The selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate - a candidate not only " uniquely and supremely unqualified " for the office she seeks , but one for whom casual and cavalier abuse of power is an apparent matter of routine - is only the latest indicator that John McCain views his would - be presidency with precisely the same cynicism and carelessness that bedevils the current administration .
McCain has proven through this campaign that in the final analysis , he is nothing so much as George Bush III .
His paradigm of governance is predicated on the Bushian principle of doing whatever the hell he wants to do and not giving a damn what anyone thinks about it .
And as Kagro X wrote earlier this week , the selection of Sarah Palin as his top lieutenant only reinforces this fact .
Some would call this Maverickitude .
Others would call it lousy leadership .
The reason that Sarah Palin 's presence on the Republican ticket is so critically relevant is because it speaks volumes about John McCain 's approach to governing .
With the entire Republican Party plus Joe Lieberman at his disposal , John McCain picked as his chosen successor a candidate so Not Ready for Prime Time that the campaign has literally been hiding her from the press :
Over the next 60 days , I 'm curious to see whether the McCain campaign will drastically restrict press access to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- and , if so , whether that will make any difference with voters .
I bring this up because Palin just took her first off - the - cuff question from a reporter since joining the Republican ticket last Friday .
Ah , to have a Vice President so well - informed and articulate that they only let her out of hiding when she has a TelePrompTer to guide her through her manufactured statements .
Sounds like exactly the person to be One Heartbeat Away .
It 's not that the McCain camp did n't know Palin was n't ready .
They knew .
They came with preposterous talking points prepared , going on and on about her executive experience commanding the Alaska National Guard ( to whom she never issued an order ) , mooseburgers , and what have you .
Well , fine , but her executive experience involves a pattern of abuse of power and quid pro quo firings .
It started with one of her very first acts as mayor , an attempt to censor public libraries .
The problem only got worse when she became governor ; her vendetta against State Trooper ( and former brother in law ) Mike Wooten led her not only to fire a competent public servant and replace him with a sexual harasser , but to break into his personnel file to dig up dirt on him .
And yet , the McCain campaign , in selecting Palin over legions of Republican women with superior qualifications , essentially placed their seal of approval on Palin 's Bushesque style of governing .
As Kagro X notes , it is the hallmark of Palin 's tenure in politics that she expects to do as she pleases without consequence :
There are a million problems with naming someone as Not Ready for Prime Time as Sarah Palin to the ticket .
But one that deserves more attention is the broader implications of her " it 's not rocket science " attitude toward governance .
While it 's a great applause line for the Republican Party faithful who hate government anyway , and who , frankly , have fallen a bit too much in love with anti-intellectualism , it 's also indicative of the fact that she 's grafted together the absolute worst possible aspects of several different brands of Republicanism .
She 's never played in a world where there are real procedures that are in place for a real reason .
She thinks everything 's a PTA meeting , and she can just do what she wants , because she 's the boss and everyone hates red tape .
Fire town officials on a whim ?
Sure .
Fire state officials on a whim ?
Well , sure .
Though it turns out someone actually cares about process a little bit there .
Still , it 's Alaska !
So who 'll ever focus on it ?
It is this view of governance , this paradigm of how " executives " should act when faced with circumstances they do n't love , in which McCain believes so strongly as to endorse it in his Vice - Presidential nominee .
Since Palin is , after all , his chosen lieutenant .
The most terrifying aspect of Sarah Palin 's selection is not that John McCain did not properly vet her .
It 's that he probably did vet her ... and he found that this reckless , me - first attitude towards governing matched his own .
And as befitting one of George W. Bush 's top lieutenants , John McCain 's disregard for rules and procedure - charmingly dismissed as " mavericky " by his supporters - have already been evident in his campaign , as he has repeatedly violated copyright law by stealing music for his campaign from such varied sources as John Mellencamp , Van Halen , Frankie Valli , and Heart .
As MissLaura opined :
Let 's be clear : this is not McCain 's campaign screwing up .
This is McCain 's campaign betting that the trouble they will get in for appropriating someone else 's property without permission will be outweighed by the stagecraft benefits of having the right song playing at the right time .
In other words , he 's campaigning like he 'll govern .
This was called to his campaign 's attention weeks ago , yet he 's done it again today , stealing Heart 's " Barracuda " on his running mate 's behalf .
But who cares ?
Screw the law !
If we get fined , Cindy can pay for it !
Like Musicgate , the disastrous selection of Sarah Palin is n't an amusing screwup by the McCain camp , or a failure to do homework .
Walter Reed Middle School is an amusing screwup .
But Sarah Palin 's failings speak to John McCain 's failings .
He could care less about her authoritarian , my - way - or - the - highway attitude towards governance ( or maybe that 's what he found attractive in her ) .
He could care less whether Sarah Palin is prepared to lead the nation .
He wanted her , so goddamn it , he 'll have her , and America will have her , and they 'll fucking like it !
It 's not that John McCain does n't get it .
It 's that he does n't care .
Not unlike the current occupant of the Oval Office .
Police in Japan have been left red - faced by an apparent murder that turned out to be an unusual case of mistaken identity .
It began in the morning with a frantic call from a couple who had spotted a " corpse " while out walking their dog in a mountain forest in Izu , central Japan , the ZakZak news website reported today .
Fifteen officers were dispatched to the scene , where they discovered a human form wrapped in plastic and tightly bound around the neck , midriff and ankles , with hair protruding from one end .
The body was left untouched and taken away for examination , and the crime scene duly secured by a police cordon .
Back at the local police headquarters , officials notified reporters who had turned up early the same morning to cover an annual earthquake drill .
They began preparing to write up the launch of a major murder investigation .
Dozens of extra officers were dispatched to interview potential witnesses , while the evening edition of the local newspaper carried a report of the gruesome find , complete with a photograph of the body 's resting place .
By mid-afternoon , the body was in the hands of police pathologists .
But when they sliced open the wrapping , they were confronted not by a decomposing corpse , but by a life - sized sex doll .
A police spokesman apologised for the commotion but defended his officers , saying they had simply been following protocol by leaving the concealed " body " untouched until it was in the hands of pathologists .
Though no crime had been committed , the spokesman could not resist admonishing the doll 's mystery owner .
The doll , he told bemused reporters , showed signs of repeated use .
" Our guess is that the owner did n't want to take a risk by throwing it away with the rest of his rubbish , " he said .
" It was an incredibly irresponsible thing to do . "
People are ignoring the biggest problem with the Palin / McCain presidential ticket .
The nightmarish possibility that — if they are elected — something terrible could happen to Sarah Palin , and John McCain would end up running the country .

MAY 31 , 2008 --
The assembly of the Indigenous Front of Binational Organisations in the Mixteca region of Oaxaca , one of the poorest areas in Mexico .
A large percentage of the indigenous population of Oaxaca and other states has left to work in northern Mexico and in the United States .
The FIOB is a political organisation of indigenous communities and migrants , with chapters in Mexico and the US .
It advocates for the rights of migrants , and for the right not to migrate -- for economic development which would enable people to stay home .
Delegates discuss FIOB 's by - laws and political positions , vote to adopt them , and then elect new binational leadership in a democratic and open process .
Julio Sandoval , a delegate from Baja California , recounts his experience as a political prisoner in the penitentiary of Ensenaada , where he was held for three years after leading a fight for housing for indigenous migrants .
At the end of the assembly , Gaspar Rivera - Salgado , newly elected as FIOB 's binational coordinator , addresses the delegates , and a group of Triqui women rise to their feet with a clenched - fist salute .

Ninjas Don't Cry
Ninja Gaiden
II , the latest installment in Tecmo 's classic action series , opens with a cut scene featuring a new character , Sonia , a woman with a shaggy mop of white - blonde hair , a prominent Greek nose , clear blue eyes and tight leather clothes .
She 's at a little shop in Tokyo , asking after Ryu Hayabusa , hero of the Ninja Gaiden games , when somebody busts through the door : a ninja of the Black Spider Clan , ancient enemies of Ryu's Dragon Lineage .
Sonia draws two .45 automatics and plugs the unfortunate Spider ninja in the belly .
She steps outside and shoots another one right in the face mask .
A third ninja knocks the guns out of her hands .
The pistols fall to the wooden deck , and the camera zooms in on them .
One lies in shadow , the other in light .
The Spider ninjas wrap Sonia up in chains and loom over her , waggling their big , menacing , claw - like weapons .
Then shurikens whirl through the Tokyo night , neatly dispatching the bad guys .
The last one standing does n't notice as Ryu himself approaches behind him .
Ryu cleaves his foe in two at the shoulder , stands over the helpless Sonia and flicks the gore off his blade .
She looks up at him plaintively .
Imposed over these images of Ryu and Sonia meeting for the first time are the following words : " Directed by Tomonobu Itagaki . "
What 's on display here is the bad blood between two game series , Ninja Gaiden and Capcom 's Devil May Cry.
Sonia is a mockery of Dante , hero of Devil May Cry , a white - blonde , blue - eyed guy with a prominent Greek nose and a propensity for leather .
He wields a pair of .45 autos called Ebony and Ivory .
The placement of Itagaki 's name on the shot of Ryu standing over a helpless parody of Dante sends a message : Ninja Gaiden , not Devil May Cry , stands at the crest of Hardcore Hill .
But who gets that joke ?
Who cares about such archaic , macho grandstanding ?
Who is Itagaki 's message really for ?
The answer is : the worst possible videogame customer .
The Hardcore Suicide Pact
Developers of games like Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry cater to hardcore players , but who is this kind of player and why is he such a bad customer ?
What does the term " hardcore " really mean ?
" Striving to be the best at the game , " says Robert " Sneh " Caron , one of the top posters at iberiansngrealm.com , a site devoted to high - level Ninja Gaiden play .
I first visited it for its videos , which showcase the immense gaming possibilities of Ninja Gaiden .
Sneh has put up some of the best vids for Mission Mode , an unlockable game that places Ryu in a series of increasingly difficult arena challenges .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his campaign are drawing criticism for not telling the truth .
It 's gotten so bad that the media , politicians , and Barack Obama have unleashed a new L - word – lie – to describe the state of the stump .
Even George Bush 's low - blow specialist Karl Rove , mentor to chief McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt , declared the campaign has " gone too far " .
Barack Obama and his camp are being called for their fibs as well , but McCain is catching more heat , and deservedly so .
The McCain - Palin advertisments feature more lies and bigger lies than the Obama side .
McCain and company persist in telling lies even after they 've been called on them .
" Obama will raise your taxes " is true when McCain says it to his millionaire wife , but not to the 97 % of Americans earning less than $ 250,000 a year .
" I told Congress ' thanks but no thanks ' on that bridge to nowhere , " Palin continues to repeat , long after the record has been reviewed to show she initially supported the bridge and that Congress killed it before she did .
Moreover , Alaska got those pork barrel funds anyway to finance other projects .
It 's no surprise that the McCain campaign keeps telling lies .
In the movie Animal House , one of the Delta fraternity pledges is entrusted to care for his big brother 's Cadillac .
After the fraternity boys ruin the car , one frat boy proposes hiding the wreck , reporting the car stolen , and letting his brother collect the insurance for a replacement .
" Do you think it 'll work ? " the pledge asks .
His fraternity brother replies , " It 's bound to work better than the truth . "
That 's the McCain campaign 's central thesis .
McCain has supported President Bush – a president with an approval rating below 30 % - 90 % of the time .
Do the math : that does n't offer much hope of winning on the facts .
So his campaign brews distractions to sidestep real issues .
" This campaign is not about issues , " campaign manager Rick Davis declared .
Many find it particularly hypocritical that McCain , who founded his reputation on straight talk , has resorted to lies , distortions and doubletalk .
Some say he 's sold his soul for a last grasp at the presidency .
But maybe - just maybe - we 've got McCain wrong .
Maybe the lies are not calculated to misrepresent his record or Obama's .
Maybe they 're part of a larger strategy .
Maybe McCain is really chasing a vast bloc of voters that candidates usual ignore , at least explicitly .
In this tight race , the outcome could come down to America 's vast hypocrite vote .
For example , the 26 % of Americans that describe themselves as evangelical Christians have strong hypocritical tendencies , politically at least .
Evangelicals first became a political force in the 1980 presidential election , when they abandoned small town Sunday school teacher and born - again Christian Jimmy Carter for divorced , Hollywood actor and infrequent churchgoer Ronald Reagan .
A Pew Research survey released early this year found that evangelicals are nearly as likely to be living together out of wedlock as the public at large and more likely to be divorced .
Perhaps more telling , the Barna Group found that only about one in five self - proclaimed evangelicals actually hold the tradition 's key core beliefs .
Underscoring that point , evangelicals have loudly applauded Bristol Palin , the 17 - year - old pregnant daughter of the Republican vice presidential candidate , as a goddess of life rather than condemn her as a sinner .
One suspects they would n't be quite so forgiving if it was an Obama offspring was the mother - to - be – or the shotgun groom .
But hypocrisy cuts across religious as well as party lines .
Tens of millions of Americans talk the talk but do n't walk the walk or think things through .
They drive their SUVs to Earth Day rallies .
They watch Fox News and parrot complaints about the media 's liberal bias .
They believe America needs to keep good , high wage jobs at home yet shop at Wal - Mart , Chinese exporters ' best customer .
They do n't see a contradiction or even a connection between abstinence - only sex education and pregnancy crisis centres .
For them , McCain offers not just a hypocritical campaign , but a hypocritical agenda for the White House .
After 26 years on Capitol Hill , President McCain will reform Washington and put the lobbyists who run his campaign out of business .
He 'll cut taxes , yet balance the budget .
He 'll reduce regulation yet bring order to Wall Street .
He 'll continue the American war in Iraq to victory , even though there 's little sign of political progress among Iraqi factions despite the decrease in violence .
He 'll stop global warming while providing bigger fixes to satisfy America 's addiction to oil .
In short , McCain will keep doing what Bush has done , but , he says , the results will be different .
That 's not just hypocritical .
That 's insane .

Introduction :
Effort Values , or EVs , are points that Pokemon gain over the course of fighting other Pokemon .
These points can greatly influence how your Pokemon ’s stats grow over the course of them leveling to 100 .
This is a complex while simple element of the game .
Many simply do n’t know about EVs but still see the effects of them ( such as an Alakazam with a high Attack Stat because all it ever fought were Fighting Types ) .
With the right EVs a powerhouse becomes able to decimate attack or any solid wall Pokemon can then tank hits like no other .
Effort Values are earned solely in conjunction with Experience Points .
There is no other way to get them .
Think of it as a reward that is underneath the frosting of Experience .
This is one of the points where playing Pokemon takes a serious turn away from just fun .
Calculators are about to become your friend , or at least the in - game calculator is .
Early in the game this practice is simply unfeasible to pull off because of the Poke - dollars needed , the sheer amount of movement required and the raw number of items required .
This is useful when you are beginning to battle other human opponents at level 100 .
You , at this point , have free access of the entire map and decent funds ( thanks to the Elite Four and an Amulet Coin ) .
Mathematics :
Here is where math comes in : Every Pokemon can earn up to 510 EVs total across all its stats ( Hit Points , Attack , Defense , Speed , Special Attack and Special Defense ) .
Each stat can only have a maximum of 255 EVs applied to it .
Every 4 EV translates to a 1 stat point increase for the Pokemon .
This allows for an approximate maximum of 127 points added to a Pokemon ’s overall stats and an approximate maximum of 64 points to any given stat .
EV ’s come in 1 , 2 or 3 from any given Pokemon , usually that number scaling up as the Pokemon progresses through its evolutions .
The RAW basics of this can be summed up in a fairly simple equation : X+Y = Z
X – EV earned from the Pokemon
Y – Item boost ( or multipled by as the case with the Macho Brace )
Z – Total
Most reward you with EVs in their dominant stat ( Ex. Bidoof awards 1 HP EV ) , but that simply is n’t always the case ( Venusuar gives 2 Special Defense EVs and 1 Special Attack ) .
.
There are a lot of guides out there giving someone the EVs for the various Pokemon you can fight in - game ( I personally recommend www.Serebii.net as they have the most comprehensive guide I know of ) .
An Example of how this increase works is this :
An Adamant Arcanine with 252 EVs in Attack has 350 Attack while 248 EVs has 349 Attack .
Player Influence :
Now that the Math is set down , let ’s talk making this actual possible and keeping it somewhat interesting .
As stated earlier , any given stat can have a maximum of 255 EVs added to it .
The big problem here is getting to 255 .
Do n’t worry , the game has your back here in a few ways :
1 : Vitamins – HP Up , Calcium , Iron , Carbos , Zinc , Protein each add 10 EVs to your Pokemon .
They are expensive , but it ’s a great way to get the ball rolling .
Each Pokemon can only have up to 10 of each of the Vitamins , that ’s 100 EVs in one stat right there , already half of the work is done !
The catch here is these only work until 100 EVs are put into any given stat .
After that point , even if lowered below 100 , they wo n't have an effect .
2 : Pokemon give varying EVs .
As an example : Bidoof gives 1 HP EV while its evolved form Bibarel gives 2 Attack EV’s .
There are some places which are simply ripe for EV farming ( like Rt. 201 in D/ P with the Bidoof show up about 50 % of the time ) .
This Method is the least efficient for 1 EV point at 255 battles to max it , but obviously the foundation for all the methods that follow .
3 : Items –
There are items IN - GAME which boost the number of EVs that any Pokemon can earn from a fight .
A Pokemon with the EXP .
SHARE will earn the same EVs that the Pokemon fighting earns .
This is a good way to help low - level Pokemon begin their EV training .
Unfortunately the augments from the Macho Brace ( obviously ) and the Pokerus do n’t apply ( I ’ve been unable to test this to date but many sites agree on this fact ) .
The Macho Brace doubles the amount of EVs earned from any one fight ( Now that Bidoof is worth 2 and Bibarel is worth 4 ) .
1 EV now requires 127 to max while 2 drops to 64 .
Time to make it get better !
The Power items earned from the Battle Tower in D/P add 4 EVs of a specific type to the total earned ( Bidoof just became worth 5 and Bibarel 6 with the right item ) .
At 1 EV , it now takes 51 battles to reach 255 .
This is the second most efficient method to EV train .
A break down of the set is as follows
Power Weight : +4 HP EV
Power Bracer : + 4 Attack EV
Power Belt : +4 Defense EV
Power Anklet : + 4 Speed
Power Lens : +4 Special Attack
Power Band : +4 Special Defense
4 : Pokerus –
This one takes a bit of luck ( or an Action Replay I suppose ) .
The Pokerus is a virus that any Pokemon can catch ONCE .
It does n’t hurt them in anyway , obvious , it being here means it helps .
Frankly , it helps a lot !
While a Pokemon has the Pokerus it gains double the EVs .
Suddenly
All those numbers I gave above DOUBLE !
To keep with my Example : Bidoof gives 1 HP EV , assuming your Pokemon has the Power Weight , that ups the total to 5 .
Now the Pokerus gets figured in and that 5 doubles to 10 !
Every Bidoof is worth a HP Up now !
HOWEVER : This boost wo n’t apply fully through the use of EXP .
SHARE
The equation from earlier changes to this : 2 x ( X+Y ) = Z
In the event you only have the Macho Brace , the Pokerus still functions the same .
1 EV simply quadruples to 4 EVs .
This sets it to 64 battles to reach the max of 255 EVs .
Diamond / Pearl : 1 EV is worth up to 10 EVs with the right Power Item and the Pokerus , dropping the total battles down to 26 to max ( 1 battle is added to account reaching 255 ) .
This becomes the most efficient method to EV train a Pokemon .
Tricks :
I only recently started the EV training for a number of my Pokemon and have been able to discern and create a few ways to streamline and speed up the EV Process .
1 ) If the Pokemon is hatched , do n’t start fighting with it , put it in the Day Care until it is Lvl. 20 .
This allows for the Pokemon to fight on its own and earn EVs .
Some guides might say otherwise , and it maybe otherwise for Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald / FireRed / LeafGreen but for Diamond / Pearl , it ’s worked so far for me and means the Pokemon can fight in very different areas and get all its EV training down in just a few levels ( Personal best is about 4 levels now )
2 ) The Pokerus , Power Items / Macho Brace stack BEST when the Pokemon being trained actually participates in the battle .
If it ca n’t win and you have one that can , switch that one in .
The one being trained gets its fully boosted amount of EVs and the other ( probably having its EV training completed directly by you or over the course of the game ) .
3 ) Elite Four + Amulet Coin / Luck Incense = Cash Cow .
One trip through them is enough to afford about 10 Vitamins .
Kick start the EV training right .
4 ) Pokerus – Yeah , I talked about it already , but it ’s rare to catch and hard to maintain .
This is what I do to keep it around .
The infection last a good while , enough that while focused EV training , you can get it done before the Pokemon recovers .
Every Pokemon can only get Pokerus ONCE !
To keep a Pokemon indefinitely infected , store them in the PC .
Pull out “ Carrier ” and put them near the Pokemon you want infected .
At the Conclusion of each Battle , each the status screen of the desired Pokemon .
Once they are infected , Immediately store the infected Pokemon again .
The Pokerus can only be spread for approximately 24 hours after infection .
This cannot wait “ until Morning ” , time moves in the game world as it does in the real world .
In the PC , however , time stands still for the Pokemon .

Banded mongooses live in extended - family groups , with as many as ten females breeding at the same time .
When they 're about a month old , pups leave the communal den to forage with the adults .
That 's when a pup usually begins to associate exclusively with one particular adult — not necessarily a parent — that provides nourishment and protection .
One might assume that the adult chooses the pup it wishes to assist .
Not so , says Jason S. Gilchrist of Napier University in Edinburgh , Scotland , who has long studied banded mongooses in Uganda .
His latest research demonstrates that the pups do the picking , then establish and jealously defend a territorial zone of about a yard radius around their adult " escort . "
Other pups that venture too close are chased away .
In field experiments , Gilchrist separated pups from their escorts and held them captive for two days .
During that time , the adults interacted freely with other pups .
When Gilchrist returned the detained pups to the group , however , they quickly reasserted exclusive rights to their escorts .
The adults , it seems , are the passive partners in the relationship .
Generally , when pups reach three months of age , they no longer require their escorts ' services and begin to fend for themselves .
Gilchrist concludes that even in cooperatively breeding societies , " conflict can be as rife as cooperation . "
The findings were detailed in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
I was n’t going to post it , just because it ’s not worth the aggravation of the faux - outraged “ you ’re laughing at his misfortune ! ” complaints , but ( a ) he ’s perfectly fine , and ( b ) if Martha MacCallum can giggle at it , so can we .

Republican former Secretary of State Colin Powell 's endorsement of Sen. Barack Obama is the latest sign that the Republican Party 's coalition is fracturing amid the stresses of the campaign .
Appearing on NBC's " Meet The Press " Sunday , Gen .
Powell lamented his party 's tilt to the right and a campaign by Sen .
John McCain that he said had dwelled too much on inconsequential issues and attacks .
Gen .
Powell , a secretary of state under George W. Bush , echoed many conservative intellectuals in his criticism of Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , saying : " I do n't believe she 's ready to be president of the United States .... That raised some questions as to the judgment that Sen. McCain made . "
Some Republicans , including Sen. McCain , dismissed the significance of the endorsement .
" It does n't come as a surprise , " the senator from Arizona said in an appearance on Fox News Sunday .
" I 'm very pleased to have the endorsement of four former secretaries of state , well over 200 retired generals and admirals .
I 've admired and continue to respect Secretary Powell . "
The endorsement comes after a series of events that have pointed to the fraying of a Republican umbrella that has relied in the past on both moderates and conservatives to bulk up its governing majority .

NOTHING about global warming is simple , alas .
Meteorological models fry the circuits of the largest supercomputers .
Feedback loops and anomalies turbocharge an ill - tempered debate about what will happen where and when .
And do n't even start on the politics of negotiating a global agreement on emissions or the intricacies of cap - and - trade .
Unfortunately , the technology of climate change is no simpler than anything else .
A field that you may think is governed by level - headed , spreadsheet - wielding engineers is alarmingly prone to zealotry and taboos .
Climate change is too important and too complex to yield to either .
It is seductive to think a new technology can solve your problems at a stroke .
But zealotry has lately suffered a defeat .
It used to be an article of faith in the motor industry that hydrogen - powered fuel cells were the green future , and companies spent billions of dollars on the technology .
But it turns out that fuel cells have three Achilles heels ( see article ) .
The first is the chicken - and - egg problem that , as there are virtually no hydrogen filling - stations , there are no hydrogen cars — and hence there is no reason to build the filling - stations .
Then comes the cost of hydrogen - based vehicles .
Just the platinum for the catalyst inside a fuel cell costs as much as an internal - combustion engine of equivalent power , according to a recent study .
And producing hydrogen from natural gas creates a lot of carbon dioxide — about double what a small , petrol - based car emits .
One day hydrogen may be produced from the electrolysis of water .
But it would have to be transported and stored , which would require a new infrastructure .
So , for the next few decades , at least , technological pragmatism will rule motoring .
More efficient internal - combustion engines will wring out mileage from every drop of fuel , and hybrid powertrains will combine an electric motor with a conventional engine .
Soon there will be “ plug - in ” hybrids , which can be recharged from the mains and call on a petrol - powered generator when needed .
The plug-ins , in turn , are a bridge towards all - electric vehicles .
The plan mapped out by the car industry may not be as technologically elegant as the fuel cell , but it has the merit that it is based on technology that works , is not expensive and can use existing infrastructure .
Fire up the Bunsen burner
Elsewhere , however , the taboos still rule .
Nowhere more so than in geo- engineering , the idea of combating global warming by altering the climate by , say , absorbing carbon dioxide in the oceans , or reflecting sunlight back into space ( see article ) .
This involves fantastic sounding schemes , such as fertilising the oceans with iron ( to cause a bloom of planktonic algae , thus sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere ) or ejecting carbon from the poles using lasers .
Scientists and policymakers have been reluctant even to discuss the subject — much less research it , because they worry that it could cause more problems than it solves and that it will give politicians an excuse to avoid curbing carbon emissions .
Both fears are reasonable .
The farmer who introduced rabbits into Australia said the bunnies would do “ little harm and might provide a touch of home , in addition to a spot of hunting . ”
The rabbit went on to become a devastating pest .
And the world 's politicians , they may well negotiate with less commitment if they feel that they may one day be let off the hook .
But neither reason should stop research as insurance .
Some forms of geo-engineering may in fact turn out to be easier and cheaper than widespread global curbs on climate emissions — though they may still be unacceptably risky .
Only research can tell .
As for the politics , geo - engineering cannot just be put back in its box .
And because research creates new information , it is as likely to disabuse those who think they can avoid climate - change agreements as it is to offer them false hope .
Just ask the people who have given their lives to the fuel cell .
The solution to climate change will probably involve an array of technologies , from renewables , nuclear , carbon sequestration , public transport to energy conservation .
It is too early to say whether geo-engineering or anything else will be part of this mix .
Geo-engineering may turn out to be too risky , however much is spent on researching it .
Then again , there may come a time when it is needed .
The world needs to be ready — and research is the only way to prepare .
From Greg Sargent at TPM Election Central :
Senior McCain advisers have flatly declared that they want the subject of the campaign changed from the economic crisis to Barack Obama ’s past associations and the various things that allegedly make Obama a “ risky ” choice .
So the question going into tonight ’s debate is this :
Will moderator Tom Brokaw let McCain do this ?
For that matter , will Brokaw himself ask about former Weatherman William Ayers ?
And if the discussion does shift over to Obama ’s relationship with Ayers — whether due to Brokaw ’s questioning or McCain ’s attacks — will Brokaw play the association game fairly and ask about the Keating Five scandal ?
No one is questioning Brokaw ’s professionalism or impartiality , but keep in mind that Brokaw has taken on a behind - the - scenes role as a kind of emissary to the McCain campaign for NBC , suggesting he may be sympathetic to the McCain team ’s claims that McCain has been treated unfairly by the media .
What ’s more , Brokaw has indicated that he may be less than sympathetic to efforts to recall McCain ’s role in the Keating Five scandal .
He recently agreed with an assessment of the scandal as “ ancient history . ”
With Wall Street in turmoil and a financial system in crisis mode , companies are facing another major challenge : figuring out how to manage a new crop of young people in the work force -- the millennial generation .
Born between 1980 and 2001 , the millennials were coddled by their parents and nurtured with a strong sense of entitlement .
In this adaptation from " The Trophy Kids Grow Up : How the Millennial Generation Is Shaking Up the Workplace , " Ron Alsop , a contributor to The Wall Street Journal , describes the workplace attitudes of the millennials and employers ' efforts to manage these demanding rookies .
When Gretchen Neels , a Boston - based consultant , was coaching a group of college students for job interviews , she asked them how they believe employers view them .
She gave them a clue , telling them that the word she was looking for begins with the letter " e . "
One young man shouted out , " excellent . "
Other students chimed in with " enthusiastic " and " energetic . "
Not even close .
The correct answer , she said , is " entitled . "
" Huh ? " the students responded , surprised and even hurt to think that managers are offended by their highfalutin opinions of themselves .
If there is one overriding perception of the millennial generation , it 's that these young people have great -- and sometimes outlandish -- expectations .
Employers realize the millennials are their future work force , but they are concerned about this generation 's desire to shape their jobs to fit their lives rather than adapt their lives to the workplace .
undefined
Although members of other generations were considered somewhat spoiled in their youth , millennials feel an unusually strong sense of entitlement .
Older adults criticize the high - maintenance rookies for demanding too much too soon .
" They want to be CEO tomorrow , " is a common refrain from corporate recruiters .
More than 85 % of hiring managers and human - resource executives said they feel that millennials have a stronger sense of entitlement than older workers , according to a survey by CareerBuilder.com .
The generation 's greatest expectations : higher pay ( 74 % of respondents ) ; flexible work schedules ( 61 % ) ; a promotion within a year ( 56 % ) ; and more vacation or personal time ( 50 % ) .
" They really do seem to want everything , and I can't decide if it's an inability or an unwillingness to make trade - offs , " says Derrick Bolton , assistant dean and M.B.A. admissions director at Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business .
" They want to be CEO , for example , but they say they do n't want to give up time with their families . "
Millennials , of course , will have to temper their expectations as they seek employment during this deep economic slump .
But their sense of entitlement is an ingrained trait that will likely resurface in a stronger job market .
Some research studies indicate that the millennial generation 's great expectations stem from feelings of superiority .
Michigan State University 's Collegiate Employment Research Institute and MonsterTrak , an online careers site , conducted a research study of 18 - to 28 - year - olds and found that nearly half had moderate to high superiority beliefs about themselves .
The superiority factor was measured by responses to such statements as " I deserve favors from others " and " I know that I have more natural talents than most . "
For their part , millennials believe they can afford to be picky , with talent shortages looming as baby boomers retire .
" They are finding that they have to adjust work around our lives instead of us adjusting our lives around work , " a teenage blogger named Olivia writes on the Web site Xanga.com .
" What other option do they have ?
We are hard working and utilize tools to get the job done .
But we do n't want to work more than 40 hours a week , and we want to wear clothes that are comfortable .
We want to be able to spice up the dull workday by listening to our iPods .
If corporate America does n't like that , too bad . "
Where do such feelings come from ?
Blame it on doting parents , teachers and coaches .
Millennials are truly " trophy kids , " the pride and joy of their parents .
The millennials were lavishly praised and often received trophies when they excelled , and sometimes when they did n't , to avoid damaging their self - esteem .
They and their parents have placed a high premium on success , filling résumés with not only academic accolades but also sports and other extracurricular activities .
Now what happens when these trophy kids arrive in the workplace with greater expectations than any generation before them ?
" Their attitude is always ' What are you going to give me , ' " says Natalie Griffith , manager of human - resource programs at Eaton Corp .
" It 's not necessarily arrogance ; it 's simply their mindset . "
Millennials want loads of attention and guidance from employers .
An annual or even semiannual evaluation is n't enough .
They want to know how they 're doing weekly , even daily .
" The millennials were raised with so much affirmation and positive reinforcement that they come into the workplace needy for more , " says Subha Barry , managing director and head of global diversity and inclusion at Merrill Lynch & Co .
But managers must tread lightly when making a critique .
This generation was treated so delicately that many schoolteachers stopped grading papers and tests in harsh - looking red ink .
Some managers have seen millennials break down in tears after a negative performance review and even quit their jobs .
" They like the constant positive reinforcement , but do n't always take suggestions for improvement well , " says Steve Canale , recruiting manager at General Electric Co .
In performance evaluations , " it 's still important to give the good , the bad and the ugly , but with a more positive emphasis . "
Millennials also want things spelled out clearly .
Many flounder without precise guidelines but thrive in structured situations that provide clearly defined rules and the order that they crave .
Managers will need to give step - by - step directions for handling everything from projects to voice - mail messages to client meetings .
It may seem obvious that employees should show up on time , limit lunchtime to an hour and turn off cellphones during meetings .
But those basics are n't necessarily apparent to many millennials .
Gail McDaniel , a corporate consultant and career coach for college students , spoke to managers at a health - care company who were frustrated by some of their millennial employees .
It seems that one young man missed an important deadline , and when his manager asked him to explain , he said , " Oh , you forgot to remind me . "
Parents and teachers are n't doing millennials any favors by constantly adapting to their needs , Ms. McDaniel says .
" Going into the workplace , they have an expectation that companies will adapt for them , too . "
Millennials also expect a flexible work routine that allows them time for their family and personal interests .
" For this generation , work is not a place you go ; work is a thing you do , " says Kaye Foster - Cheek , vice president for human resources at Johnson & Johnson .
Although millennials have high expectations about what their employers should provide them , companies should n't expect much loyalty in return .
If a job does n't prove fulfilling , millennials will forsake it in a flash .
Indeed , many employers say it 's retention that worries them most .
In the Michigan State / MonsterTrak study , about two - thirds of the millennials said they would likely " surf " from one job to the next .
In addition , about 44 % showed their lack of loyalty by stating that they would renege on a job - acceptance commitment if a better offer came along .
These workplace nomads do n't see any stigma in listing three jobs in a single year on their resumes .
They are quite confident about landing yet another job , even if it will take longer in this dismal economy .
In the meantime , they need n't worry about their next paycheck because they have their parents to cushion them .
They 're comfortable in the knowledge that they can move back home while they seek another job .
The weak job market may make millennials think twice about moving on , but once jobs are more plentiful , they will likely resume their job - hopping ways .
Justin Pfister , the founder of Open Yard , an online retailer of sports equipment , believes he and his fellow millennials will resist having their expectations deflated .
If employers fail to provide the opportunities and rewards millennials seek , he says , they 're likely to drop out of the corporate world as he did and become entrepreneurs .
" We get stifled when we 're offered single - dimensional jobs , " he says .
" We are multi-dimensional people living and working in a multi- dimensional world . "
These outspoken young people tend to be highly opinionated and fearlessly challenge recruiters and bosses .
Status and hierarchy do n't impress them much .
They want to be treated like colleagues rather than subordinates and expect ready access to senior executives , even the CEO , to share their brilliant ideas .
Recruiters at such companies as investment - banking firm Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Amazon.com describe " student stalkers " who brashly fire off emails to everyone from the CEO on down , trying to get an inside track to a job .
Companies have a vested interest in trying to slow the millennial mobility rate .
They not only will need millennials to fill positions left vacant by retiring baby boomers but also will benefit from this generation 's best and brightest , who possess significant strengths in teamwork , technology skills , social networking and multitasking .
Millennials were bred for achievement , and most will work hard if the task is engaging and promises a tangible payoff .
Clearly , companies that want to compete for top talent must bend a bit and adapt to the millennial generation .
Employers need to show new hires how their work makes a difference and why it's of value to the company .
Smart managers will listen to their young employees ' opinions , and give them some say in decisions .
Employers also can detail the career opportunities available to millennials if they 'll just stick around awhile .
Indeed , it 's the wealth of opportunities that will prove to be the most effective retention tool .
In the final analysis , the generational tension is a bit ironic .
After all , the grumbling baby - boomer managers are the same indulgent parents who produced the millennial generation .
Ms. Barry of Merrill Lynch sees the irony .
She is teaching her teenage daughter to value her own opinions and to challenge things .
Now she sees many of those challenging millennials at her company and wonders how she and other managers can expect the kids they raised to suddenly behave differently at work .
" It does n't mean we can be as indulgent as managers as we are as parents , " she says .
" But as parents of young people just like them , we can treat them with respect . "

Edmund McMillen fascinates me .
The last time we checked in with his work was when he released Aether -- a project that was dubbed “ personal ” and explored the concepts of childhood and escapism .
This time around , McMillen created a game with a great deal of levity .
It ’s called Meatboy , and it rocks .
I wanted to go on and explain the game , but McMillen does it much better than I would :
Meet Meat Boy .
He 's the protagonist of his self - titled debut , irreverently named Meat Boy , a more traditional " hardcore " platformer in the same vein as Ghost and Goblins , Mega Man and N+.
You play as the unlikely hero in search of his kidnapped love interest .
Cliché I know , but this princess is made of band - aids and she 's been kidnapped by a fetus in a jar wearing a suit and a monocle .
Oh , and you 're also a skinless ball of juicy meat .
Yes , the game stars a wad of meat .
Despite my fandom of McMillen ’s work , I was a bit skeptical about the pitch .
Fortunately , the game is quite endearing and certainly time consuming .
If you ’re a fan of , then I highly suggest checking this out .
You can download it directly here or go here for the flash version .
When this is all over , certain half - dead words will need to be put out of their misery with a quick bullet to the back of the head .
My candidates for a mercy verbicide : pivot , tank , cave , pushback , gravitas , message , game - changer , challenges , the entire litany of Palinesque nouns , attack dog , battleground , pork - barrel , earmark , impacting , and impactful .
Other words that are too important to be executed will need to undergo a long and painful rehabilitation before they can be safely used again : change , experience , straight , truth , lie , victory , character , judgment , populist , and élite .
It was Orwell , of course , who first explained the relation between decadent language and corrupt politics .
“ In our time , political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible , ” he wrote in “ Politics and the English Language . ”
“ Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism , question - begging , and sheer cloudy vagueness . ”
In our time , the corruption takes a different form .
Instead of defending the Soviet purges with Latinate words like “ liquidate , ” politicians and journalists use clichés mainly borrowed from sports , war , and rural life in order to seem to be saying something tough - minded when in fact they ’re saying nothing .
Instead of Orwell ’s intellectuals and bureaucrats clouding their true , sinister meaning “ like a cuttlefish squirting out ink , ” we have television personalities disguising the emptiness of their thoughts with a set of pre-baked homespun idioms , or else with a technical campaign vocabulary that gives a false impression of privileged knowledge .
It ’s almost enough to make me nostalgic for the days of the commissar ( which is why I often turn the channel from CNN to Fox — the latter gets much closer to the truly Orwellian ) .
It ’s a shame that “ Politics and the English Language ” is the only Orwell essay many readers know .
The essays are the essential Orwell , where his voice is at its strongest and the working of his mind at its clearest .
There are too many great ones to put between the covers of a book — which is why a new , two - volume edition of Orwell ’s essays , edited by yours truly , has just been published by Harcourt : “ Facing Unpleasant Facts , ” which gathers the narrative essays , such as “ Shooting an Elephant , ” and “ All Art Is Propaganda , ” which compiles the critical essays , like the studies of Dickens and Dalí .
I made sure to include lesser - known gems alongside the more famous essays : you ’ll find Orwell ’s wartime diary from 1940 , his dismal recollection of working in a bookshop , his review of Chaplin ’s “ The Great Dictator , ” his brilliant takedown of Eliot ’s “ Four Quartets , ” and a truly obscure piece called “ Dear Doktor Goebbels — Your British Friends Are Feeding Fine ! ”
On November 5th , you ’ll need to clear your head of a great deal of accumulated nonsense .
I would suggest a long , deep , surprising drink of Orwell .
In the beginning , there were algae ,
but there was no oil Then , from algae came oil .
Now , the algae are still there , but oil is fast depleting
In future , there will be no oil , but there will still be algae
So , does n't it make sense to explore if we can again get oil from algae ?

This is the latest auto - aero innovation from Moller , the minds that brought you the much - hyped but never built SkyCar .
This time they ’re sexing it up a notch — their new Autovolantor is a road / air hybrid that ’s built in the shell of a Ferrari 599 GTB .
Yup , a flying sports car .
Moller ’s two - passenger flying Ferrari , if it comes to fruition , will have a range of 75 miles airborne and 150 miles on the ground , 40 of those coming exclusively from battery power .
The Autovolantor will have a total payload of 375 pounds and carry 16.5 gallons of fuel .
Essentially , it will function as a plug - in hybrid until it gets stuck in traffic , at which point it could lift vertically off the ground and fly at up to 150 miles per hour .
What ’s the inspiration behind the Autovolantor ?
Is it the culmination of a longtime dream to combine a super - exotic sports car with the thrill of flight ?
Not quite .
“ We had a Russian billionaire come to us complaining that he was sick of sitting in Moscow traffic , ” the company ’s founder Paul Moller told Wired.com .
“ He gave us money , and told us to build a car that flies . ”
That part makes sense , but does n’t explain why Moller chose a $ 300,000 Ferrari rather than , say , a Ford Focus .
It came down to practicalities .
“ We must have tested 100 different cars , ” Moller explains .
“ But the Ferrari ’s long hood was really the best choice when it came time to make room for the fans . ”
They ’re the same fans that power Moller ’s ambitious SkyCar prototype .
That craft , billed as a vertical takeoff & landing vehicle ( VTOL ) , could hover up to 10 feet off the ground using ducted fans to provide lift and propulsion without exposed motor blades .
“ Really , we ’re just taking the SkyCar and morphing it into a different shape , ” Moller says of the Autovolantor .
“ That ’s why we were able to get the design done in about five months . ”
Wind tunnel and stability analysis tests have been successfully completed on the Autovolantor , and Moller says that if his Russian oligarch investor decides to continue funding the project ( though , considering the state of the Russian stock market , he may not ) , it wo n’t take all that long before actually vehicle testing begins .
But do n’t hold your breath waiting for a dealership to open up on your local Auto Mile .
Moller says that even if demand were there , the Department of Transportation would never give the car a thumbs up .
“ It would be an interesting process to see if we could make it satisfy the DOT , ” Moller says .
For now , it looks like if there ’s a market for the Autovolantor , it ’s Russia .
“ You have to assume there are other millionaires there sitting in traffic , ” Moller says .
“ Maybe some of them would want one . ”

I compare this election to a job interview .
The employers ( that ’s you , Mr. and Mrs. America ) are sick to death of the current job holder ( that ’s my team , the GOP ) .
They are itching to fire us .
But they cannot do it until they have found a plausible alternative .
Now if the alternative gives offense or embarrasses himself at the interview — if he somehow shows himself unacceptable — then the employer will have no choice :
He ’ll have to struggle on with the current incumbent for a little longer .
If , however , the alternative behaves himself — if he says the right things , if nothing disgraceful can be found in his resume — then the job is his .
So ( to repeat something I said in my very first column in this space ) Barack Obama ’s most important challenge in this race was to make himself boring .
He needed to leave behind the soaring rhetoric and grand themes of the primary campaign and act the part of a responsible , level - headed president - in - waiting .
Watching Tuesday ’s presidential debate — possibly the most boring presidential debate in history — I can only say : mission accomplished .
Meanwhile , McCain careens from mistake to mistake .
McCain ’s job in this campaign was to stay cool .
He had to recognize : “ Look , by all rights I should lose this thing .
But you never know .
Obama is inexperienced , over - educated , and likely to be perceived by many voters as exotic , even alien .
Over months of electioneering , he ’s bound to stumble .
When he does , I ’m here — a steady pair of hands — to pick up the pieces . ”
But staying cool in the face of downbeat polls requires tremendous discipline .
The natural temptation is to Do Things — to Change the Game !
Hence the Palin nomination .
Hence the campaign suspension .
Hence the misleading negative ads .
The problem is that the more a candidate Does Things , the more likely he is to make a mistake — to frighten off voters at the very moment he needs to be reassuring them .
That is what has happened to McCain .
Whatever else you say about his campaign , it ’s not boring !
The McCain campaign has depicted Obama as a dishonorable slanderer of American troops , a friend of terrorists who is thrusting sex upon kindergarten children .
Spicy stuff .
( It certainly got a reaction from Shrum . )
But then we see the actual Obama on stage — and he sure does not sound spicy .
He sounds grave and measured .
He speaks respectfully of John McCain .
He finds something nice to say about George W. Bush .
You can almost hear swing voters across America thinking , “ He ’s polite .
He ’s presentable .
He seems less jumpy than the old white guy .
He ’ll do . ”
I ’m not sure that McCain ’s negative advertising was ever meant to be believed .
I think it was meant to provoke .
McCain may have hoped to do to Obama what George W. Bush did to him in the famous South Carolina primary of 2000 : get under his skin in a way that goads him into a self - destructive outburst .
If Obama had lost his temper , if he had even complained , he would have been done for .
America is ready for a lot , but it ’s not ready to hear a young , Harvard - educated black man criticize a white war hero .
But then — Obama does n’t have to criticize him , does he ?
He can follow the advice of another white war hero , Napoleon Bonaparte :
Never interfere with an enemy in the process of self - destruction .
One of the nation ’s most influential psychiatrists earned more than $ 2.8 million in consulting arrangements with drug makers from 2000 to 2007 , failed to report at least $ 1.2 million of that income to his university and violated federal research rules , according to documents provided to Congressional investigators .
The psychiatrist , Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff of Emory University , is the most prominent figure to date in a series of disclosures that is shaking the world of academic medicine and seems likely to force broad changes in the relationships between doctors and drug makers .
In one telling example , Dr. Nemeroff signed a letter dated July 15 , 2004 , promising Emory administrators that he would earn less than $ 10,000 a year from GlaxoSmithKline to comply with federal rules .
But on that day , he was at the Four Seasons Resort in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , earning $ 3,000 of what would become $ 170,000 in income that year from that company  17 times the figure he had agreed on .
The Congressional inquiry , led by Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , is systematically asking some of the nation ’s leading researchers to provide their conflict - of - interest disclosures , and Mr. Grassley is comparing those documents with records of actual payments from drug companies .
The records often conflict , sometimes starkly .

" I hope the titans of finance who expect us little people to save them are ashamed of themselves .
But at the same time , in painting Main Street solely as a victim of a rapacious Wall Street , we are being hypocritical .
We are all to blame . "
~ Bethany McLean , " The Borrowers , " The New York Times , October 2 , 2008
In a sense , the former Fortune investigative reporter of Enron whistleblower fame has a point .
It takes two to tango .
The borrower was a willing dance partner to the lender ’s lead .
As the music kept playing , the dance floor became crowded and unruly .
Many felt the party would never end .
Some , like Citigroup ’s Chuck Prince , thought they could quietly sneak out the back door before the cops arrived .
Others — soccer moms , retirees , and avid readers of LewRockwell.com — knew better and dropped their invitations in the shredder .
A significant portion of the population acted responsibly .
We wrote about this dichotomy in June , 2006 , less than a year after the housing boom peaked :
" A long - time friend … points out a distinction in the behavior of the debtor class .
Some have clearly acted responsibly : they consolidated their debts into tax deductible mortgages , locked in the lowest long - term rates in 40 years , and tossed the interest savings into their rainy day and investment jars .
From a consumption standpoint , little has changed except that these old - school borrowers pocketed a windfall compliments of their friendly neighborhood central banker .
Others — to put it mildly — have gotten carried away . "
At the time , we reported 29 % of the mortgages taken on in 2005 were already underwater .
Housing costs consumed over half the income of 16 % of those with mortgages , up from just 2 % five years earlier .
What we failed to mention were that roughly half of all mortgages fell within long - held standard payment limits of 30 % of gross income and that 18 % of all homes were owned outright .
Scratch the surface and you ’ll find plenty of people who resisted temptation during the bubble years and lived within their means .
My sister and her husband who live in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania occupy the same home they bought in 1991 .
In 1998 they refinanced at a lower interest rate and increased their mortgage to pay for a significant extension of their house ( my brother - in - law actually did most of the work ) .
After the home improvement loan , their loan - to - value went up to approximately 55 % .
At the time their mortgage was about 14 % of total gross income , 16 % with taxes .
The bubble from 2001 to 2006 largely passed them by .
They failed to get the memo about using their house as an ATM , choosing instead to save before making major purchases ( e.g. , they began saving two years for a recent trip to Wyoming ) .
They have no credit card debt .
Today they have four years remaining on their mortgage .
Total payments are 13 % of gross income and their current LTV is about 15 % .
This is not to say my sister and her family will not suffer from the madness of others the last seven years .
Her husband works for a specialty paper company which outsourced two - thirds of the local jobs to South Carolina a few years ago .
The current hangover from our housing , credit , and consumption bender does not exactly help his job security .
My sister ’s family is also being forced to help bear the costs of a $ 1 trillion 5 - year war , some of which shows up at the grocery store and gas pump .
Now they ’re being asked to pick up the tab for a party they never attended , with the cleanup bill already over $ 1 trillion .
As you might expect , they are not exactly pleased by this prospect .
Government has no resources of its own , no elves working overtime to produce something of value , just promoters who espouse Santa Clause economics .
It can only transfer wealth from one group to another ( skimming a nominal transaction fee in the process ) .
The current $ 700 $ 800 billion bailout ( sorry , rescue ) package is nothing more than a looting of the responsible and productive by the reckless and profligate .
Call it reverse Darwinism , survival of the least fit .
As the old economics saw goes , subsidize a certain behavior and you get more of it , tax a certain behavior and get less .
Responsible people like my sister and her husband are becoming an endangered species in this country as a result .
Expect such a massive wealth transfer at the hands of the political class to be means tested .
Those who were reckless , but friendless in Washington and have already paid a heavy price for their sins will go to the back of the soup line .
Paulson ’s checkbook will not be used to help Joe Sixpack who got in a little over his head or save Lehman Brothers shareholders who bled to death before the triage unit showed up .
It will be closed to smaller banks not privy to high - level discussions about which Fannie Mae creditors the government would bail out and are now stuck with worthless preferred stock .
What will Paulson likely tell pension funds holding the very same toxic paper as his " too big to fail " banking cronies ?
Take a number .
Stripped of its lofty promises , the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will not backstop your 401 ( k ) , encourage lenders to crawl out of their bunker , resuscitate an economy on life support , or turn a profit for the hapless taxpayer .
Its primary mission in life is to rescue " the Chosen Ones " — Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup , Bank of America , and JPMorgan Chase .
The early returns are promising .
On Thursday , September 18 , the financial establishment was coming unhinged .
By early afternoon the combined market values of the five companies had shriveled to $ 360 billion .
That night DC ’s power brokers — Paulson , Bernanke , Cox , Pelosi , Frank , et al. — concocted their shameless scheme .
As of last Friday ’s close , the Chosen Ones tacked on $ 137 billion in market value for a 38 % gain while the rest of the market , as measured by the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index , lost $ 634 billion , or 5.6 % .
Market participants are not always rational , but in this case they apparently figure a blank check in the hands of a former CEO of Goldman Sachs will benefit the political economy at the expense of the real economy .
Our sense is that both are in trouble ; transferring more blood from the productive host to the parasite does not in the long run make either healthier .
For the economy and country to begin healing we need capital , credibility , and responsibility to move from the wasteful to the productive .
The power elite , predictably , is attempting to achieve the exact opposite .

One reviewer described the DRM system as " draconian " Hundreds of people have complained about the copyright protecting system on the long - awaited game Spore .
Scathing criticism of the Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) system have been posted by reviewers on Amazon.com .
The DRM system used by Electronic Arts ( EA ) restricts the number of times the game can be installed .
One of the most eagerly awaited games in recent years , it was released in the UK on 5 September and the US on 7 September .
In what reviewers described as " a draconian DRM system " , the game can only be installed three times .
DRM is used to combat piracy and protect copyright , but players of Spore complained that this meant the game was " for rent , not sale " .
" The DRM on this thing is less friendly than my recent colonoscopy - you get three installs .
That 's it .
No install returned for uninstallation , or anything else , " wrote one reviewer .
' Severely restricted ' " I have no interest in paying full price for a game that I will be severely restricted from being able to play at a later point , " a commenter said .
Hundreds of complaints have also been posted on Spore fan sites and gaming websites , including on EA 's official discussion forum .
Complaints have also been posted on Spore fan sites Developed by Will Wright , Spore involves players using tools to help their creations evolve from cells to civilised beings .
It was a much - awaited release after the success of The Sims , another creation of Mr Wright .
But many reviewers reacted with anger at the SecuROM DRM system used by EA .
Some wrote that it would stop them from purchasing the product ; others cancelled pre-orders .
" It 's such a shame that the distributor of the game treats its own customers as criminals and attempts to do their best to prevent you from actually playing the game , " one gamer wrote on Amazon.com .
" Our system works just like online music services that limit the number of machines on which you can you can play a song , " an EA spokesman told the BBC .
" This system is an effort to control piracy .
" You can install the game on three computers - perhaps at your office , at home or for your family .
What you can't do is make and distribute a thousand copies online .
" If you feel like your situation presents special circumstances , contact our customer service and we 'll talk through it with you . "
Previous games like 2 K 's Bioshock and EA 's Mass Effect have also been criticised for employing stringent DRM techniques , allowing only a limited number of installs .

What are these ?
Republican Candidate Sarah Palin claims that she is more than ready to take on the job of Vice President after successfully naming three different nation states during cross-examination on her grasp of foreign affairs .
With the governor of Alaska coming under increased scrutiny over the past few weeks , a number of political commentators had raised concerns over the suitability of the surprise choice to become the second most powerful person in the world .
They pointed to the fact that until very recently she had never been out of North America and only acquired a passport last year .
The issue came to a head in a tense press conference yesterday when a journalist put her right on the spot and asked to name as many countries as she could .
But the Republican nominee was proud to have passed the test with flying colours , later modestly confessing to being ‘ pretty surprised I could remember so many . ’
Mrs Palin got off to a great start with ‘ America ’ and soon followed this up with ‘ Canada ’ to a smattering of applause from the press pack .
After a delay of several minutes and some conferring with her advisors she completed her hat - trick with ‘ Disneyland ’ and the assembled journalists stood and applauded her in - depth knowledge of global affairs .
‘ That ’s soooo impressive ’ said one of the reporters who were clearly so overjoyed by her achievements that many of them were openly laughing .
She later withdrew a statement saying that ‘ she had got all of them ’ and amended this to ‘ all the important ones anyway . ’
Other possible countries that were overheard during her whispered discussion with her staff were ‘‘ The North Pole ? ’ , ‘ Narnia ? ’ , ‘ Latin ’ , and ‘ China ’ which was later discounted as being ‘ just another word for crockery ’.’
John McCain later congratulated his his deputy on her achievements but was asked why she left out Iran .
‘ Because there is no such country as Iran ’ he explained ‘ At least there wo n’t be by the end of my first term . ’
An Internet ad launched last week by the McCain presidential campaign has attracted more than one million hits by appearing to mock Barack Obama for presenting himself as a kind of prophetic figure .
The ad has also generated criticism from Democrats and religious scholars who see a hidden message linking Sen. Obama to the apocalyptic Biblical figure of the antichrist .

The McCain campaign 's efforts to quash the Troopergate investigation have failed .

Enlarge By Vance P. Jacobs for USA TODAY Francoise Bourzat of Woodside , Calif. , inspects solar panels on her roof in March .
Solar panel installations in California are up 74 % this year .
A congressional stand - off that has blocked extension of federal tax credits for renewable energy projects is setting off a boom in the wind and solar industries .
Developers and customers are racing to install systems by year 's end to qualify for the credits , which can cut the cost of a large commercial system by 30 % .
Wind developer EnXco has spent millions to ensure wind farms in Minnesota and California are spinning this year , says CEO Tristan Grimbert .
" We will go the extra mile to be on time . "
Randall Swisher , head of the American Wind Energy Association , says 8,000 megawatts of wind energy — the equivalent of 16 average coal - fired plants — are under construction , with developers scrambling to finish most by year 's end .
Solar panel installations in California are up 74 % this year , at least partly due to the tax - break impasse , says Larry Sherwood , a consultant for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council .
It 's mostly businesses that are racing to beat the clock , says Barry Cinnamon , CEO of installer Akeena Solar .
Sempra Generation is hurrying to finish a solar farm in Nevada , though it has n't lined up a utility to buy the power .
" We stepped out a little bit , " says CEO Michael Allman , adding he expects to find a buyer .
Extension of the tax credits has wide support in Congress , but the issue has bogged down in partisan battles .
Senate Democrats insist the subsidies — costing the Treasury at least $ 1.7 billion a year — be offset with new revenue , while Republicans insist on an energy package that includes offshore oil drilling .
Energy consultant Stow Walker expects the credits to be extended , but Congress plans to adjourn in early October , leaving just weeks to decide .
The boom could be short - lived .
Uncertainty about renewal of the credits is causing projects scheduled for 2009 and beyond to be delayed or scrapped .
Abengoa Solar can't get financing for a $ 1 billion solar thermal plant in Arizona without the credit , says company senior adviser Fred Morse .
National Wind says four Midwest projects are in limbo .
EnXco's Grimbert has rerouted turbines intended for the Midwest to the United Kingdom .
" This is a classic boom - bust cycle , and it 's not at all good for the industry , " Sherwood says .
If tax breaks are n't renewed by December , up to 115,000 workers could be laid off in early 2009 , according to the trade groups for wind and solar .
The wind industry endured similar gyrations in 1999 , 2001 and 2003 when Congress let the tax benefit expire .
Lawmakers ultimately renewed it the following years , but wind turbine installations fell as much as 93 % .
Now , the stakes are higher , because the 2 - year - old solar credit is affected for the first time .
And wind energy has nearly tripled the past five years .

Michigan firefighters are blaming an overheating Xbox and spiral notebook for a house fire in Clio last month .
Firefighters say the console was left on for as long as four days with a notebook possible blocking its air vents .
The original Xbox also still had the power cord which was recalled by Microsoft in 2003 .
The family 's apartment , which was above the cafe they ran , apparently is n't covered by their insurance so the insurance company is only paying to fix the business and not replace personal possessions ruined by smoke .
The family said they considered suing Microsoft for the fire , but can't afford the legal fees and are afraid they may not win .
Good call .
As fire experts , and the chief of the local fire department , point out electronic devices should n't be left on for such an extended time .
Grand Blanc
Fire Chief Jim Harmes said videogame consoles and laptop computers can generate a lot of heat , creating a fire risk .
" If you 're not using it , turn it off , " said Harmes .

This is n't fair to Rachel .
Why should the good news about the first week of her MSNBC show be buried in an intemperate post ( below ) about that flaming phony George F. Will ?
Even if she 's there in such excellent company as DWT standbys David Sirota and Rick Perlstein .
But David and Rick are there telling the story of Villager George 's latest outrage , while Rachel is there only via tangential connection .
That said , three days in , Rachel is having a great first week , and she should have gotten a post of her own saying so .
Instead her post got buried in the one below .
If anybody was to be buried , it should have been the Bowtie Man .
And I mean that in the ugliest way possible .

WASHINGTON , Oct 16 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Defense Department said it will scrap an Army helicopter being built by Textron Inc's TXT.N Bell Helicopter unit , after the cost of each aircraft soared nearly 70 percent to $ 14.5 million .
Chief Pentagon weapons buyer John Young said on Thursday it would be better for the Army to start from scratch rather than continue with the troubled $ 6.2 billion Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program , citing the massive cost overrun and a four - year delay in the helicopter ’s delivery until 2013 .
Young announced his decision after the program ’s costs triggered a congressionally mandated review that can lead to a program ’s termination .
Analyst Jim McAleese said it was the Pentagon ’s first cancellation under the Nunn - McCurdy law in several years , and signaled the start of leaner times for the defense industry .
“ This vote of no - confidence is an obvious wake - up call for the rest of the defense community for at least the next four years , ” McAleese said .
The Pentagon 's decision opens the door to a possible bid for future business from Boeing Co BA.N , which had lost out to Bell in the original competition in 2005 .
Bell Helicopter said it was “ extremely disappointed ” in the decision and it still believes ARH - 70A was the best replacement for the Kiowa Warrior .
Bell spokesman Joe LaMarca said the test aircraft built for the program had accumulated over 1,400 flight hours and accomplished several program milestones .
LaMarca said Bell would continue to work closely with the Army to support the existing older aircraft and was evaluating the impact of the termination decision and what further steps it could take .
The contract with Bell will be terminated for “ convenience , ” rather than cause , a move that could make Bell eligible for some termination fees .
The Army said its drive to replace 375 Bell OH - 58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters , the most heavily used fleet in Iraq and Afghanistan , remained a top priority , especially since it lost about six aircraft each year .
“ Rather than continue this program ... the best course of action is to provide the Army with an opportunity to define a coherent , disciplined Kiowa Warrior helicopter replacement program , and to obtain more rigorous contract terms for its development , ” Young said in a statement .
SOARING COSTS
Young said the overall program ’s development costs were projected to reach $ 942 million , nearly three times the original estimate of $ 359 million , despite the fact that it was to be a modification of a commercially available helicopter .
Army Secretary Pete Geren vowed to move ahead quickly to get new helicopters to troops as soon as possible .
Lt. Gen. James Thurman , Army director of operations , said the Army hoped to quickly restart the acquisition process , and would also invest in the current Kiowa Warrior fleet .
Under the contract it won in 2005 , Bell Helicopter was supposed to build 512 helicopters for the Army over 10 years .
The Army 's initial replacement for the Kiowa Warrior , the $ 14.6 billion RAH - 66 Comanche program run by Boeing and United Technologies Corp UTX.N , was canceled in 2004 .
The Pentagon decision came on the same day Textron reported a 19 percent drop in quarterly profit and its long - term credit ratings were placed on credit watch by Standard & Poor ’s ratings service .
Textron , which also makes Cessna aircraft , blamed the profit decline on troubles at its finance arm .
The Army first announced that it might cancel the Textron helicopter program in July , and Army officials last week acknowledged they were weighing alternatives .
Geren said the Army had a duty to “ move ahead with an alternative course of action to meet this critical capability for our soldiers at the best price and as soon as possible . ”
The Nunn -McCurdy law requires the Pentagon to cancel any weapons program that sees costs rise more than 25 percent unless it can show the program ’s importance to U.S. national security , the lack of a viable alternative , how reasonable new cost estimates are , and proof that the problems that led to cost overruns are now under control .

SOCHI , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of orchestrating the conflict in Georgia to benefit one of its presidential election candidates .
Russian PM Vladimir Putin has accused the U.S. of orchestrating the conflict in Georgia .
In an interview in the Black Sea city of Sochi on Thursday , Putin said the U.S. had encouraged Georgia to attack the autonomous region of South Ossetia .
Putin said his defense officials had told him it was done to benefit a presidential candidate -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are competing to succeed George W. Bush -- although he presented no evidence to back it up .
" U.S. citizens were indeed in the area in conflict , " Putin said .
" They were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered , and the only one who can give such orders is their leader . "
Watch Putin accuse the United States »
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino blasted Putin 's statements , saying they were " patently false . "
" To suggest that the United States orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational , " she said .
U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood concurred and labeled Putin 's statements " ludicrous . "
" Russia is responsible for the crisis , " Wood said in Washington on Thursday .
" For the Russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in Georgia is ludicrous .
... Russia is to blame for this crisis , and the world is responding to what Russia has done . "
When told that many diplomats in the United States and Europe blame Russia for provoking the conflict and for invading Georgia , Putin said Russia had no choice but to invade Georgia after dozens of its peacekeepers in South Ossetia were killed .
He told Chance it was to avert a human calamity .
iReport.com : First - person accounts from the center of the conflict
The former Russian president , still considered the most powerful man in the country , said he was disappointed that the U.S. had not done more to stop Georgia 's attack .
Putin recalled that he was watching the situation in Georgia and South Ossetia unfold when he was at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games on August 8 .
He said he spoke to U.S. President Bush , also attending , who told the Russian prime minister he did n't want war , but Putin spoke of his disappointment that the U.S. administration did n't do more to stop Georgia early in the conflict .
Also Thursday , Putin announced economic measures that he said were unrelated to the fighting with Georgia .
Nineteen U.S. poultry meat companies would be banned from exporting their products to Russia because they had failed health and safety tests , and 29 other companies had been warned to improve their standards or face the same ban , Putin said .
Putin said Russia 's health and agricultural ministries had randomly tested the poultry products and found them to be full of antibiotics and arsenic .
Putin repeated that the bans were not related to the Georgian conflict , but they indicate the measures that some Western countries -- particularly in Europe -- fear if Russia goes on a diplomatic offensive .
Watch analysis of Russia 's relationship with the West . »
Russia is trying to counterbalance mounting pressure from the West over its military action in Georgia and its recognition of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
But Russia 's hopes of winning international support for its actions in Georgia were dashed Thursday , when China and other Asian nations expressed concern about tension in the region .
The joint declaration from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , which includes China , Russia , Tajikistan , Kyrgystan , Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , said the countries hoped that any further conflict could be resolved peacefully .

" The presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity , " the declaration said , The Associated Press reported .
" Placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts , " AP quoted the group as saying .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had appealed to the group at a summit in Tajikistan on Thursday to support its actions , saying it would serve as a " serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression . "
On Wednesday , a U.S. ship carrying aid docked in Georgia , while Britain 's Foreign Secretary David Miliband traveled to the Ukraine , which is worried about Russia 's intentions in the region , to offer the UK 's support .
Miliband equated Moscow 's offensive in Georgia with the Soviet tanks that invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring democratic reforms in 1968 , and demanded Russia " change course , " AP reported .

Following a meeting earlier this week with House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi , the ‘ big three ’ US automakers Ford , GM and Chrysler , are optimistic about their prospects of receiving a multi-billion dollar loan .
Pelosi told reporters in Washington yesterday that she plans to unveil a $ 25 billion finance package next week , which will probably be added to a ‘ stopgap ’ government funding bill .
When ( and if ) finally approved , much of the loan will be used to convert production to smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles , which are increasingly popular in Europe as a result of the escalating energy crisis .
The money will also be added to existing U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium grants to help fund the development and manufacture of next - generation battery technology , such as those used in the forthcoming Chevrolet Volt .
Speaking after the meeting , Alan Mulally of Ford and Chrysler ’s Robert Nardelli said they were “ encouraged ” and “ pleased ” after pitching for the massive loan , likely to come in the form of low - interest financing .
The reaction is unsurprising given the continuing poor financial performance of the sector , amid heavy operating losses and double - digit interest rates in a tightening credit market .
The looming crisis in the car industry has led some commentators to speculate that , without the loan , U.S. automakers might struggle to survive long enough to produce plug-ins and other fuel - efficient models that can compete with existing Japanese offerings like the Toyota Prius .

These are extraordinary times .
One after another , the giants of the American financial system are foundering : Bear Stearns , Freddie and Fannie , Lehman Brothers , AIG , Washington Mutual .
Morgan Stanley seems likely to merge with another bank to shore up its finances -- as Merrill Lynch has already done .
Holding back the tide , or trying to , is the Federal Reserve .
Or , specifically , Ben Bernanke , the chairman .
And as both the New York Times and Washington Post report today , Bernanke ’s awesome power is making lawmakers on Capitol Hill uncomfortable .
The concern mainly stems from the Fed ’s move over the weekend to essentially seize control of AIG .
It was an unprecedented act for the Fed – to move beyond lender as last resort to actual investor .
As NYU economics professor Nouriel Roubini ( aka “ Dr. Doom ” ) puts it , “ The U.S. government is now the largest insurance company in the world . ”
The Fed acquired 80 percent of AIG in exchange for lending it $ 85 billion .
Fed officials say they do n’t plan to get their hands dirty with AIG ’s holdings .
But according to the Times , “ If the company ’s new executive cannot fix its problems quickly , Fed officials might need to get more directly involved .
That could make them tantamount to real estate investors and hedge fund managers at the same time . ”
Lawmakers , who complain that they ’ve been left on the sidelines while the Fed has made these historic decisions , think it ’s time that ground rules be set :
“ He can make any loan he wants under any terms to any entity or individual in America that he thinks is economically justified , ” said Representative Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
“ I asked the chairman if he had $ 85 billion to bestow in this way .
He said ‘ I have $ 800 billion . ’ ” “ No one in a democracy unelected should have $ 800 billion to dispense as he sees fit , ” Mr. Frank said .
Actually , according to the Times , the Fed ’s reserves have actually been depleted far below that $ 800 billion number .
The Fed held about $ 800 billion in Treasury securities last summer , the Times reports , a number that ’s dwindled to around $ 300 billion – which is why “ the Treasury Department sold tens of billions of dollars of special “ supplementary ” Treasury bills on Wednesday to provide the Fed with extra cash . ”
One leading proposal on Capitol Hill to set ground rules , the Postreports , is “ the creation of a new federal entity that would acquire ‘ toxic ’ mortgage - backed assets from failing firms and hold them until the housing market improves … .
Setting up such an entity also would give lawmakers a chance to determine the parameters of future bailouts , as opposed to leaving the decision in Bernanke 's hands . ”
Once again , it ’s Enumerating Enumerable , my series of articles in which I attempt to outdo Ruby - Doc.org ’s documentation of Ruby ’s Enumerable module .
In this article , I cover the find_index method , which was introduced in Ruby 1.9 .
In case you missed any of the previous articles , they ’re listed and linked below :
Enumerable # find_index Quick Summary
In the simplest possible terms
What ’s the index of the first item in the collection that meets the given criteria ?
Ruby version 1.9 Expects
A block containing the criteria .
Returns
The index of the item in the collection that matches the criteria , if there is one .
nil , if no item in the collection matches the crtieria .
RubyDoc.org ’s entry Enumerable # find_index
Enumerable # find_index and Arrays
When used on an array , find_index passes each item in the array to the given block and either :
Stops when the current item causes the block to return a value that evaluates to true ( that is , anything that is n’t false or nil ) and returns the index of that item , or
( that is , anything that is n’t or ) and returns the index of that item , or Returns nil if there is no item in the array that causes the block to return a value that evaluates to true .
Some examples :
# How about an array of the name of the first cosmonauts and astronauts , # listed in the chronological order of the missions ?
mission_leaders = [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] => [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] # Yuri Gagarin was the first in space mission_leaders.find_index{|leader| leader == " Gagarin " } => 0 # John Glenn was the fifth mission_leaders.find_index{|leader| leader == " Glenn " } => 4 # And James Tiberius
Kirk is not listed in the array kirk_present = mission_leaders.find_index{|leader| leader == " Kirk " } => nil 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 # How about an array of the name of the first cosmonauts and astronauts , # listed in the chronological order of the missions ?
mission_leaders = [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] = > [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] # Yuri Gagarin was the first in space mission_leaders .
find_index { | leader | leader == " Gagarin " } = >
0 # John Glenn was the fifth mission_leaders .
find_index { | leader | leader == " Glenn " } = > 4 # And James Tiberius
Kirk is not listed in the array kirk_present = mission_leaders .
find_index { | leader | leader == " Kirk " } = > nil
Enumerable # find_index and Hashes
When used on a hash , find_index passes each key / value pair in the hash to the block , which you can “ catch ” as either :
A two - element array , with the key as element 0 and its corresponding value as element 1 , or Two separate items , with the key as the first item and its corresponding value as the second item .
As with arrays , find_index :
Stops when the current item causes the block to return a value that evaluates to true ( that is , anything that is n’t false or nil ) and returns the index of that item , or
( that is , anything that is n’t or ) and returns the index of that item , or Returns nil if there is no item in the array that causes the block to return a value that evaluates to true .
Some examples :
require ' date ' => true #
These are the names of the first manned spaceships and their launch dates launch_dates = { " Kedr " => Date.new ( 1961 , 4 , 12 ) , " Freedom 7 " => Date.new ( 1961 , 5 , 5 ) , " Liberty Bell 7 " => Date.new ( 1961 , 7 , 21 ) , " Orel " => Date.new ( 1961 , 8 , 6 ) , " Friendship 7 " => Date.new ( 1962 , 2 , 20 ) , " Aurora 7 " => Date.new ( 1962 , 5 , 24 ) , " Sokol " => Date.new ( 1962 , 8 , 11 ) , " Berkut " => Date.new ( 1962 , 8 , 12 ) } => { " Kedr " = >#< Date : 4874803/2,0,2299161 > , " Freedom 7 " =>#< Date : 4874849/2,0,2299161 > , " Liberty Bell 7 " =>#< Date : 4875003/2,0,2299161 > , " Orel " = >#< Date : 4875035/2,0,2299161 > , " Friendship 7 " =>#< Date : 4875431/2,0,2299161 > , " Aurora 7 " =>#< Date : 4875617/2,0,2299161 > , " Sokol " = >#< Date : 4875775/2,0,2299161 > , " Berkut " =>#< Date : 4875777/2,0,2299161>} #

Using find_index as a Membership Test
Although Enumerable has a method for checking whether an item is a member of a collection ( the include ?
method and its synonym , member ? ) , find_index is a more powerful membership test for two reasons :
include ? / member ?
only check membership by using the == operator , while find_index lets you define a block to set up all sorts of tests .
include ? / member ?
asks
“ Is there an object X in the collection equal to my object Y ? ” while find_index can be used to ask “ Is there an object X in the collection that matches these criteria ? ” include ? / member ?
returns true if there is an object X in the collection that is equal to the given object Y. find_index goes one step further : not only can it be used to report the equivalent of true if there is an object X in the collection that is equal to the given object Y , it also reports its location in the collection .
A quick example of this use in action :
# Once again , the mission leaders mission_leaders = [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] => [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] # Yuri Gagarin is in the list gagarin_in_list = mission_leaders .
find_index { |leader| leader == " Gagarin " } => 0 # Captain James T. Kirk is not kirk_in_list = mission_leaders .find_index { |leader| leader == " Kirk " } => nil # gagarin_in_list is 0 , which as a non -false and non-nil value evaluates as true .
#
We can use it as both a membership test * and * as his location in the list .
p " Gagarin 's there .
He 's number #{gagarin_in_list + 1} in the list . " if gagarin_in_list " Gagarin 's there .
He 's number 1 in the list . " =>
" Gagarin 's there .
He 's number 1 in the list . "
# kirk_in_list is nil , which is one of Ruby 's two " false " values .
#
Let 's use it with the " something OR something else " idiom that # many Ruby programmers like .
kirk_in_list || ( p " You only * think * he was n't there . " )
" You only * think * he was n't there . " =>
" You only * think * he was n't there . "
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # Once again , the mission leaders mission_leaders = [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] = > [ " Gagarin " , " Shepard " , " Grissom " , " Titov " , " Glenn " , " Carpenter " , " Nikolayev " , " Popovich " ] # Yuri Gagarin is in the list gagarin_in_list = mission_leaders .
find_index { | leader | leader == " Gagarin " } = > 0 # Captain James T .
Kirk is not kirk_in_list = mission_leaders .
find_index { | leader | leader == " Kirk " } = > nil # gagarin_in_list is 0 , which as a non - false and non - nil value evaluates as true .
#

# kirk_in_list is nil , which is one of Ruby 's two " false " values .

Parts that Have n’t Been Implemented Yet
Ruby - Doc.org ’s documentation is generated from the comments in the C implementation of Ruby .
It mentions a way of calling find_index that is just like calling include ?
/ member ? :
# What the docs say ( does not work yet ! ) [ " Alice " , " Bob " , " Carol " ].find_index ( " Bob " ) =>
1 # What happens with the current version of Ruby 1.9 [ " Alice " , " Bob " , " Carol " ].find_index ( " Bob " ) ArgumentError : wrong number of arguments ( 1 for 0 ) ... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # What the docs say ( does not work yet ! ) [ " Alice " , " Bob " , " Carol " ] . find_index ( " Bob " ) = > 1 # What happens with the current version of Ruby 1.9 [ " Alice " , " Bob " , " Carol " ] . find_index ( " Bob " ) ArgumentError : wrong number of arguments ( 1 for 0 ) ...
Ruby 1.9 is considered to be a work in progress , so I suppose it ’ll get implemented in a later release .

Here we go again .
Thanks to uncertainty regarding the proposed U.S. Government bailout of the financial sector ( which , by the way , is looking more like a band - aid on a bullet wound ) , the dollar having its single worst day against the euro and other currencies , and commodity traders covering their short sales , the price of crude oil climbed over $ 16 per barrel today – the single largest daily price increase on record .
And it could have been worse .
Â
At today ’s peak , the price of oil was up over $ 25 from Friday ’s closing price .
While this may end up being a one day phenomenon , the fact remains oil is still very much in a bull market , and what we thought was the commodity bubble popping might have been nothing more than slight correction during an extended upward trend .
WHY OIL PRICES ARE UPWARD FROM HERE
As you ’re probably well aware from reading many of the posts on this site , I think we are in the midst of a long - term bull market for oil .
Â
Does it mean that prices will hit $ 500 within the next several years ?
Â
I ’m not sure .
Â
That being said , there are ample reasons to believe oil prices have nowhere to go from here but up :
Oil is a finite resource .
While this may be the most fundamental cause of the “ problem ” for some reason I think it ’s the one most often overlooked .
Â in the most simplistic terms , for every barrel of oil we pump out of the ground , that ’s only less barrel of oil we have left .
Â
It ’s not as if we can make more of this stuff .
For the time being , the only way to delay the inevitability of running out of oil is to hope to find previously undiscovered oil fields , but …
New oil discoveries have fallen .
Worldwide discoveries of new oil fields have been on a downward track since the 1960s .
Â
Considering worldwide demand has been on the increase , this certainly does n’t bode well for the future .
For the time being , we ’ve been able to get by thanks to more efficient methods of harvesting oil from currently know fields , but , as you know from reading the previous section , the known fields will eventually run out .
Â
And from the looks of things , there ’s not much in the pipeline ( pun somewhat intended ) to replace known fields once they go .
But , the biggest problem has clearly become the fact that …
Demand for oil continues to increase .
According to the International Energy Agency , a mostly independent organization founded in the 1970s , the worldwide demand for oil will climb to 116 million barrels per day by 2030 .
Â
This is nearly a 40 % increase over the 87 million barrels per day we currently need .
So , based on basic supply and demand economics , if we do n’t see a substantial rise in oil production between now and 2030 , we should expect the price of oil to shoot sky high .
WHAT WOULD PEAK OIL MEAN ?
Here are just a few examples of what we can expect from peak oil , should we not adjust in time :
Increased geopolitical tension as countries clamor over one another for the remaining drops of oil
Out of control inflation , as prices for EVERYTHING – not just petroleum based products – shoot through the roof
Transcontinental travel becomes a thing of the past
A dramatic decrease in lifestyle , especially in “ advanced ” nations
None of this is too appealing .
Â
But thankfully , these things might be avoidable .
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS ?
While this whole oil fiasco may seem like a hopeless scenario , if we act now , we might be able to avoid the worst of the predictions .
Â
In fact , there are some very simple things you can do :
Demand the Government focuses on this issue .
Â
Write to your elected officials and let them know that it ’s uncalled for that they appropriate $ 700 billion in emergency funding to bailout Wall Street and international banks .
Â
This economic crisis will pass .
Â
They all do .
Â
However , the peak oil issue not only is n’t going to pass , but it ’s only going to get worse as time goes on .
Â
This money needs to go towards alternative energy and not towards bailing out bankers who could n’t manage risk .

If your elected officials do n’t act , use the power of your vote .
As I ’ve said before , I think our energy crisis should be the single most important issue in this Presidential election , but unfortunately it ’s getting swept under the rug thanks to our current economic problems .
Â
So , if your elected officials do n’t take our energy policies seriously , use your vote to get them out and put someone in who will actually tackle this issue .
Obviously , this is a worldwide issue and is n’t something that the U.S. is going to solve on its own .
Â
That being said , since we are the world ’s largest consumer of oil , the solution to peak oil should start with us .
In the midst of a softball interview with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , New York Times reporter Deborah Solomon hurls this zinger :
" For all your lofty talk about democracy , last November you shut down the opposition television station in Tbilisi . "
To the oily Saakashvili , however , this is water off a duck ’s back :
" The interference with Imedi TV was an exception , not a rule .
This action was taken during mass riots when Imedi TV started to incite overthrow of the democratically elected government .
It should be noted that the government did pay damages . "
Do you suppose it would be okay if the FBI barged into the offices of , say , MSNBC , wrecked the place , hauled Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow out of the studio bodily , and shut down the station  as long as " damages " were paid ?
The station , by the way , which was the only televised platform for the Georgian opposition , has since been handed over to a regime - friendly front man , who just happens to be an American citizen .
Damages were paid , indeed
This is the regime defended by Barack Obama , as Solomon points out , as well as ( unsurprisingly ) John McCain , and that ’s hardly the only case of bipartisan fealty to a U.S. - supported dictatorship .
There ’s Afghanistan , for example , where a young aspiring journalist has just been spared the death penalty for circulating an article about women ’s rights , and given 20 years in prison instead .
This is the government Obama wants to strengthen and sacrifice more American lives for .
From the Los Angeles Times piece on the trial and conviction by Laura King :
" In a case that has illustrated this country ’s drift toward a more radically conservative brand of Islam as well as the fragility of its legal system , an appeals court today overturned a death sentence for a student convicted of blasphemy but sentenced him instead to 20 years in prison . "
So at a time when the U.S. - supported government is moving rapidly toward a Taliban - type theocracy  even as that government moves toward some type of accommodation with the radical Islamic former rulers of the country 
Obama is telling us we must pour more troops , more money , and more of our hopes into the Afghan front , which has supposedly been " neglected " by the Bushies .
No wonder he ’s been endorsed by none other than Ken " Cakewalk " Adelman , and given support ( albeit indirectly ) by any number of neocons , such as Charles Krauthammer  who , after pummeling Obama for weeks , has suddenly discovered the Democratic candidate is possessed of a " first - class intellect and a first - class temperament , " which " will likely be enough to make him president . "
And what more proof does anyone need that Obama is a disaster in the making other than that Andrew Sullivan , the former warlord of the blogosphere , has not only endorsed him , but fallen head over heels ?
Ken Silverstein  Harper ’s columnist and author of a new book that looks to be hilariously informative  is scared :
" McCain ’s foreign policy crew has quite a few cranks ( William Kristol , to state the most obvious ) and his policies are generally scarier than Obama ’s .
Agreed .
But having Powell and Adelman sign up with the Obama movement is about as uplifting as when Obama endorsed ballistic missile defense ( the scaled down version of Star Wars ) during the second debate .
It ’s conservatives who should be cheering . "
To which Sullivan adds : " Yes .
And we are . "
( ( ( Shudder ) ) )
These " conservatives , " you ’ll note , are all of the neo- variety , including Christopher Hitchens , who has also jumped on the Obama bandwagon , because , as he quite accurately writes :
" On ‘ the issues ’ in these closing weeks , there really is n’t a very sharp or highly noticeable distinction to be made between the two nominees , and their ‘ debates ’ have been cramped and boring affairs as a result . "
Hitchens happily notes , also , that " the Obama - Biden ticket is not a capitulationist one , " by which he means our foreign policy of trigger - happy aggression will carry on , as before , albeit fronted by someone with a more pleasing personality than the Great Decider .
And if you ’re wondering what motivated a good many of these dyed - in - the - wool warmongers to suddenly turn on a dime and come out for the supposed " antiwar " candidate , you ’ll be on the right track if you consider who else is rooting for him :
" Defendants in the classified - information case involving two former pro-Israel lobbyists are hoping a change in administrations next year will bring a fresh review of their prosecution , according to sources on the defense team .
The next attorney general , who will be nominated by Barack Obama or John McCain , is expected to reconsider the case of former American Israel Public Affairs Committee staffers Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , as part of general review of high - profile legal issues decided by the Bush administration .
" Sources on the defense team have speculated that a possible Obama nominee to head the justice system could be more receptive to pleas to dismiss the case . "
Obama wants to invade Pakistan and flood Afghanistan with yet more U.S. troops , and he will likely let two spies who funneled top secret intelligence to Israel off scot - free .
Why would n’t the War Party be perfectly satisfied with the election ?
After all , they ’re done with Iraq , anyway .
We ’re about to be invited to leave .
And he ’s good  from their perspective  on the Russian question , which promises to be the key area of future neocon mischief - making .
Our war - birds are naturally migratory creatures , effortlessly moving from branch to branch , and party to party , with no compunction whatsoever about changing either their nesting habits or the color of their feathers , so long as their ultimate goal  promoting conflict , in whatever form  is achieved .
Republicans , Democrats , independents , or whatever : it ’s the same program , with the same result  an America perpetually at war , defending and extending the frontiers of its empire , without regard for the costs , either financial or purely human .
Preoccupied as we are with the spectacle of " democracy " unfolding on the American stage , we fail to notice the contours of a new world conflict taking shape far from the media spotlight .
From the steppes of Central Asia to the jungles of South America , the American colossus is being challenged by rising forces of nationalism , religious zeal , and sheer resentment of the heedless exercise of hegemonic power that is often mistranslated as " anti-Americanism . "
It will take more than the calm reassurances of Barack Obama to still these tides of discontent and rancor .
If he defies the odds and actually makes it to the White House , Obama will merely put another face on the same old policies , albeit more friendly and less offensive to our own elites , who would rather not be so rudely confronted with the ruthlessness of their rulers .
As some of my readers may know , I recently moved to a small town in northern California , where antiwar feeling is high  and so is support for Obama .
Everywhere I go I see Obama posters , bumper - stickers , etc .
Why , just the other day , a gaggle of peace demonstrators gathered in the middle of the town ’s main street , holding up banners proclaiming their opposition to our government ’s foreign policy and their support for Obama .
" Honk if you ’re for peace and Obama ! "  and the resulting cacophony was audible for miles .
I live next door to a couple that has festooned their home with peace signs , and their backyard is a veritable " peace garden , " with peace signs sprouting up all over  and , yes , their car sports an Obama - Biden bumper - sticker .
A house sign supporting the Democratic ticket has sprung up in their front yard , alongside the rhododendrons .
I wonder how long it will take these well - meaning folks to become thoroughly disillusioned with their messiah .
In the case of the more honest and intelligent , I give it a few weeks , a month or so at the outside .
The rest , I ’m afraid , will follow the Dear Leader to perdition

Russia 's lower house of parliament , the Duma , has approved a raft of measures worth $ 86 bn ( £ 51 bn ) to assist banks hit by the credit freeze .
The government will make $ 50bn available to banks and firms that need to refinance foreign debt .
The rest will be available as loans to banks .
The package is designed to restore confidence in Russian banks and revive shares , which have seen steep falls .
Trade on Russian stock exchanges has been suspended since Wednesday .
Trading in the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange ( Micex ) index and the Russian Trading System ( RTS ) exchange was stopped after falls of more than 10 % in the first hour of trade on Wednesday .
The Micex was scheduled to reopen on Friday .
But fears that Russian shares would be dumped after a climate of fear saw a rout across European and Asian stock markets , prompted the order from the regulator , analysts said .
" The RTS and MICEX will not be able to escape contagion from the rest of the world , " Uralsib strategist Chris Weafer said .
Liquidity problems
The falls in Russia and elsewhere have been blamed on panic selling by global investors fearful of a deep worldwide recession .
Russian shares were also hit in August amid concerns about the conflict between Russia and Georgia .
The steep decline in oil prices has also taken its toll with energy firms accounting for about two thirds of the Russian stock indexes .
Analysts say the falls have been exaggerated as a number of Russian oligarchs have faced margin calls on loans that they took to expand their business interests .
The forced sale of shares they had used as collateral for the loans has played a part in depressing stocks .
We tend to think that everybody who 's anybody in the tech world has a blog , right ?
Well , Linus Torvalds did n't have a blog , at least not until dipping his toe into the waters with this one -- " Linus ' Blog " -- which launched last Thursday .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
There 's not a lot there yet -- three posts -- and Torvalds tells me that he sees the undertaking as an experimental outlet for personal thoughts and family expressions .
However , with the Torvalds name being practically synonymous with Linux , people are already beginning to take notice .
Here 's the e-mail exchange we had today :
First of all , Linus , is this blogger really you ?
( Ca n't be too careful today what with Fake Steve Jobs and all ) ?
Yes , yes , it 's me .
A " fake Linus " would hopefully try to be entertaining .
What prompted the decision to finally blog ?
I set it up as a trial , and to perhaps eventually really turn it into a family thing , but I 'm not sure we 'll actually ever post pictures of the kids ( privacy etc ) , and I 'll have to see if there 's much point to it as an outlet for any " random crud " that I would n't post to the kernel or git mailing lists because it 's just off topic .
It was literally a friend from back in the Bay Area that sent pictures of his kids by pointing at his blog , and the whole thing was a " let 's try it and see " kind of thing .
I just made a couple of posts about things I had been doing that were n't kernel - related but were things that I would not mind having discussed .
And is your wife on board ?
So far , no .
I do n't know what will happen to it .
I 'll probably post occasionally on random things for a while and see where it goes , and ask her again in a couple of weeks .
Do you expect to write about Linux and tech world matters there as well personal thoughts ?
( I see you 've already started . )
Well , as long as it's me writing , it 's likely about something tech - related and probably linux - related , since that 's what I 'd do .
But likely just tangentially .
Being well known and a lightning rod of sorts , I would expect that your blog will attract a following , not all of whom will be fans .
How to you anticipate handling comments ?
I do n't expect to .
If it gets to be a problem , I 'd be more likely to just turn them off , but I 'm neither interesting nor interested enough that I believe it 's going to be all that active .
After all , how much of a comment would you expect for something where I 'd probably post once a week or something , and not reply to comments .
But what do I know ?
In your third post you describe and share ( naturally ) an Internet usage tracker that 's helping you maintain limits with your children .
How has that been received in the Torvalds household ?
Oh , the kids have been on that thing pretty much since they got the computer , it just got rewritten recently ( and I decided I do n't want to lose it to another disk crash ) .
It 's the least onerous of the rules we have for them ( " no identifying information " and " homework first " being among the more obvious of the others ) .
I did n't do the tracker because they could n't keep off , I did it because this way there does n't need to be any whining about it on any side .
We do n't have to try to track it and say " OK , that 's enough , " and they do n't have to ask for permission .
So everybody 's happy - it 's some clear rules , and the way it 's done it does n't really limit them from using the computer for productive things ( i.e. they can write their essays , etc. , on their own with no limits ) .
( Update : Mere hours after our exchange , it looks as though Torvalds is going to venture into political commentary , too .
Brave man .
As someone who knows a thing or two about mixing political developments into a technology blog , I can tell him that it 's something that not every reader will appreciate .
But good for him .
It 's important . )

Busted : Miss Teen Louisiana skips on restaurant bill ... but leaves behind purse stashed with drugs
Miss Teen Louisiana and three of her girlfriends have been busted for dashing from a restaurant without paying the $ 46 bill .
But here 's the best part .
Beauty queen Lindsey Evans , 18 , left behind her purse stashed with drugs and still went back to fetch it .
However , the restaurant manager had already found Evans ' purse , which had her identification inside , so he called the police .
Caught red-faced : Still smiling in her mug shot ( right ) , Miss Teen Louisiana Lindsey
Evans left a restaurant without paying the bill - but left her purse behind which allegedly contained Xanax and marijuana
Just as officers finished taking a statement from the manager , the group returned and police immediately recognised the 5ft 8in , blonde , green - eyed beauty from her driver 's licence picture .
Screw it !
Jennifer Martin claims she and her friends tried to pay the bill but the service was too slow
Then it went from bad to worse .
Not only were the four taken into custody , but police allegedly found Xanax and a bag of marijuana in Evans ' purse .
Evans has been charged with theft and possession .
One of Evans ' friends , Jennifer Martin , 22 , claims that they were ready to pay the bill at Posado 's restaurant in Bossier City , Louisiana , with cash and debit cards , but ' the service was so slow , we just said " screw it " and left ' .
A spokesman for the Miss Louisiana Teen USA organisation says they have n't decided Evans ' fate .
Her reign ends next month .
Evans first competed in Miss Louisiana
Teen USA pageant in 2007 where she was placed runner up .
She entered the pageant again this year and won .
Evans says her hobbies include dancing , shopping and networking .
She also enjoys playing with and caring for her chihuahuas , Babii and Zeke .
Her motto in life is : ' If you want the rainbow , you have to tolerate the rain . '

A father mistakenly declared dead after going missing eight years ago has been reunited with his family after his son spotted him on television , police said on Thursday .
The family of John Delaney thought he had died when he disappeared in April 2000 .
They held a funeral and cremation after police found what they thought was his body three years later .
But Delaney , 71 , from Oldham , Greater Manchester , UK , had in fact been admitted to hospital in a confused state 10 days after he was reported missing .
The Resurrection of Hillary Clinton
October 22 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
Or “ Hillary comes around . ”
Over the past year , we at the Kiwi have been a bit , well , harsh on Hillary Clinton , especially during the primary season .
It ’s not that we do n’t like her – I voted for her in 2000 – or that we did not think she was qualified for the job , it ’s that ( as we repeatedly stated ) she did not represent the type of change the country needs at this time and because of the polarizing nature of her personality , name and history , we believed that even if she could eke out a victory ( I still maintain she would have lost ) , it would be of the 50+1 variety , resulting in the same partisan gridlock we have seen for decades in Washington .
Plus , the country would have continued the same , stupid tye - dye era fights we ’ve been waging since the Vietnam era , despite the fact that all that happened 40 years ago .
Even today , we see the attempts at this with the McCampaign ’s continued focus on Bill Ayers and his doings back when Obama was 8 .
That being said , as we have stated before , Hillary is absolutely needed in the Senate , where her wonkish ways , attention to policy detail and brutal political gamesmanship would come in very handy .
We need her in there on Capitol Hill making the legislative sausage .
And here ’s hoping she becomes a Lion of the Senate in the Teddy Kennedy mold .
But at the same time , Hillary was repeatedly chided and often vilified through the primaries because of her poor strategy ( the big state / white voter / experience strategy ) as well as her tactics ( that “ as far as I know ” he ’s a Christian bullshit , for example ) that made her come off as a visionless , domineering type who was so hungry for power she was willing to burn the Democratic party in order to save it , another Vietnam - era bit of bullshit that thankfully did not work .
Initially , following Obama ’s victory in the primaries , the Clintons were cold and distant toward the new standard - bearer .
There seemed to be no love lost between the two camps and questions began to arise about Hillary potentially sabotaging Obama ’s chances in order to keep her own 2012 dream alive and / or force her way onto the ticket .
In the run-up to the convention , Hillary supporters – who took the loss personally – were in open revolt , vowing to vote for McCain despite his not having anything in common with Hillary and blaming the media – which people forget crowned Hillary the nominee back in late 07 ) – for her loss .
But at the convention , the Clintons seemed to quash their beef with Obama .
Hillary herself moved Obama ’s nomination , ending a potential floor fight .
And though her speech seemed to be more about herself and about the democrats than about Obama , Bill Clinton ’s convention speech knocked it out of the park for the new nominee .
Since then , the pair have been campaigning for Obama in their own way .
At first , Hillary ’s approach seemed odd to me , but at least it seemed heart - felt .
She still seemed to think she would be the better candidate , but because we could see that , her campaigning for Obama comes off to me as honest .
Sure , she was just setting herself up for 2012 , but it really did n’t look as though she was sabotaging him in any way .
She made the case in September as to why voters should support Barack Obama , why it would be in their best interest and why it would dangerous and stupid to vote for McCain .
She still had n’t quite bought into Obama but because she was n’t over - the - top , her message came off more sincere than we might otherwise expect after the brutal primary campaign :
Drawing cheers and applause from the 1,600 people in the room , Mrs. Clinton said that “ we must work as hard as we possibly can ” to elect Mr. Obama , and suggested that her supporters needed to put aside personal loyalty to her former candidacy and embrace him as the best hope for their interests .
“ Who are you for ? ” Mrs. Clinton said .
“ That ’s the wrong question .
It should be : Who is for you ?
Who will fight for you ? ”
and this is a killer line :
After someone in the audience yelled , “ Tell us about Palin , ” Mrs. Clinton replied : “ I do n’t think that ’s what this election is about .
Anybody who believes that the Republicans , whoever they are , can fix the mess they created probably believes that the iceberg could have saved the Titanic . ”
She does n’t attack ( though I am sure her expression was great – she ’s a pro , she ’ll communicate in a way that is n’t quotable ) , but she subtly points out that the Republicans are trying to change the topic and trick voters with their new “ change ” message ( something she tried and failed ) .
But that was then and things have changed .
This week , Nightline ran an interview from a rally in Florida where Hillary walked into the shot and she and Obama looked very natural and very friendly and Hillary gave a rousing endorsement .
And you know what ?
It ’s because she finally seems to get it .
July 26 , 2019 : We have just unveiled a 47 feet - long billboard in Alberta urging Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer to come out in full strength against the Trudeau government 's attempt to bring back Section 13 .
Thank you to all of the donors who made this happen .
If you want us to keep that billboard in place for even longer , please click below to help .
Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives voted to repeal section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 2013 .
That ’s the censorship provision that made it an offence to hurt someone ’s feelings .
But now the Liberals are looking to bring it back , and to my horror , Andrew Scheer ’s conservatives have n’t lifted a finger against it .
They ’re not actively cheering it on — that I can see .
But they have made a team decision , party - wide , not to champion freedom of speech .
I ca n’t name a more important issue for conservatives , actually .
It ’s more important than taxes , or immigration , or fighting terrorism and respecting our military ; it ’s more important than any trade deal , more important than criminal justice .
Because if you do n’t have free speech , you ca n’t talk meaningfully about any of those other issues .
When he ran for leader of the Conservatives , Scheer promised to fight for free speech — especially on campus .
He sounded good on that .
But since then , he ’s literally deleted that policy from his website .
You ca n’t find it .
And he ’s gone wobbly — out of fear of the media .
Fear that he ’ll be demonized , too .
During recent hearings on the subject , at the Liberal - run Justice Committee , Michael Cooper , a conservative MP from St Albert , dared to push back at the hateful assertion by a Muslim lobbyist that conservatives were to blame for mass murder in New Zealand .
Cooper pushed back , saying the terrorist himself there denied that he was a conservative , in fact , said he admired Communist China .
It was true , and it was a rebuttal to a false accusation .
But after the Liberals said they were all offended —
Scheer literally fired Cooper .
And weirdly , Scheer ordered the remaining conservatives on the committee to vote to turn off the video cameras when Mark Steyn , Lindsay Shepherd and John Robson testified at that committee .
How crazy is that ?
The Conservatives invited them to testify — presumably for free speech .
They showed up .
And then the conservative MPs literally voted to turn off the cameras , so the world could n’t see them arguing for freedom .
And according to Andrew Lawton , who was right there , the order came from Scheer himself .
What is going on ?
Why is not a single Conservative MP allowed to even talk about this issue ?
Why are they not just being passive , but actively voting to suppress witnesses ?
Well , I guess because there was one man who did n’t vote to repeal section 13 — Andrew Scheer himself , who was the speaker of the house and thus did n’t vote .
What an irony — the man who controlled everyone ’s freedom of speech in Parliament , the man who was effectively the judge of the court of Parliament , who could demand an MP retract a statement — maybe , just maybe , he fell in love with the power to regulate speech .
How else can you explain it ?
So what about you ?
I know that most people watching my shows are Conservative Party members .
I would ask you to sign a petition to Justin Trudeau to have him stop Section 13 , but I know that Trudeau would n’t listen .
But what if I asked you to sign a petition to Andrew Scheer himself .
To take off the whip from his own MPs .
To let them be true conservatives — to stand up for freedom of speech .
Do n’t let Harper ’s work be undone .
Do n’t go quietly along with Justin Trudeau and Karina Gould .
And do n’t , for God ’s sake , be an active participant in it , by censoring Mark Steyn and others .
SIGN OUR PETITION NOW
It ’s simple .
You can see it below .
It simply says :
" We call upon Andrew Scheer to stand up for freedom of speech by opposing the revival of section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act . ”
That ’s it .
He promised he’d be for free speech when he ran for the leadership .
His Party was unanimously for free speech under Stephen Harper .
The country needs free speech .
We need an effective opposition .
It ’s easy for him to do — if he ’s worried about what the country thinks .
But these days —
I ’m worried he cares more about what the Media Party thinks .
Please sign our petition and I ’ll personally deliver it to Andrew Scheer myself .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A drug developed to fight leukemia appears to stop multiple sclerosis in its early stages and restore lost function to patients , British researchers said on Wednesday .

The three - year study of Bayer AG and Genzyme Corp ’s alemtuzumab for the first time show long - term improvement in disability , Alasdair Cole , a neurologist at the University of Cambridge , said in a telephone interview .
The drug , made under the brand name Campath , appears to regenerate brain cells and reverse the effects of relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis , the researchers found .
“ This is the first drug that has shown that people ’s disability at the end of a period of time has actually improved , ” Cole , who helped lead the study , said .
“ That is really encouraging for people with the disease . ”
Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the myelin sheath that protects nerve cells .
It affects 2.5 million people globally and can cause symptoms ranging from vague tingling to blindness and paralysis .
Standard treatments using a protein known as recombinant interferon beta include Biogen Idec Inc ’s Avonex , the newer treatment Tysabri , developed by Biogen Idec and Elan , and Merck KGaA ’s Rebif .
The study compared alemtuzumab to Rebif in 300 men and women with early stage MS , marked by flare - ups of numbness , vision loss and other problems that can last weeks or months .
Campath reduced the number of attacks by 74 percent compared to Rebif and reduced the risk of disability worsening by 71 percent .
More startling , Cole said , was that after three years people on the experimental drug showed better coordination , walked more quickly and had less brain tissue damage .
“ The most remarkable thing is if you look at the disability of all the patients at the end of the treatment , the people on the standard treatment were more disabled , ” he said .
“ The patients on alemtuzumab have an increase in brain volume , which means the brain is repairing itself . ”
The researchers did not compare the drug directly to Tysabri but based on existing data said they believe alemtuzumab is a more effective and safer treatment .
Tysabri is widely considered the most effective MS drug on the market , but its use has been crimped due to safety concerns .
Campath was first used in humans in the early 1980s to treat a form of leukemia .
It is a monoclonal antibody , a lab - engineered immune system protein that attacks specific targets -- in this case white blood cells that cause damage to the myelin sheath around nerves .
Without this protection , the nerves are like bare wires that fuse together and short - circuit , leading to brain damage and producing symptoms of the disease , Cole said .
The drug , however , only works for people with early stage MS and also carries risks of serious but treatable side effects that included thyroid dysfunctions and a fatal blood condition .
Cole said the drug , about to go into final Phase III clinical trials , could hit the market in four years and could be a candidate for fast - track treatment from regulators .
“ Whether or not alemtuzumab itself ends up on the market , this study will still be a landmark study showing you can improve the disability of people with multiple sclerosis if you treat it early enough and aggressively . ”
“ The point to me is we ’ve drawn a line in the sand .
We are in a new era and we can reverse disability . ”
On Sept. 11 , 2007 , the price of crude oil closed at $ 78.23 a barrel -- the last time oil closed below $ 79 a barrel , until Friday .
What seemed like a bewildering ascent in the price of crude at the time is now a relief to traders , who watched oil fall $ 8.98 a barrel to close at $ 77.61 on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest closing price in more than a year .
Like a number of other commodities , oil 's move went from a steady ascent to a vertical bounce in the spring of 2008 , topping out near $ 150 a barrel before speculative ...

Sub and Poly , two new additions to the PL Zoo
Andrej Bauer
,
I have added two new languages to the Programming Languages Zoo which demonstrate polymorphic type inference and type checking with subtypes .
The first one is poly , which is an extension of MiniHaskell with parametric polymorphism and type inference .
In fact , evaluation is exactly the same as in MiniHaskell , the only difference is omission of type information in the source code and type inference rather than type checking .
Have a look at the implementation of type inferrence if you would like to see a very simple algorithm for inferring polymorphic types .
The second language is sub , which is an extension of MiniML with records and subypes .
Have a look at the implementation of type checking if you would like to see a very simple algorithm for type checking in the presence of subtyping .
As if McCain was n’t facing enough heat for stalling talks on the federal bailout package , which Democrats like Chris Dodd claim he did for his own political gain , now one of his main surrogates is on the record seeking to use the financial crisis for monetary gain .
Rudy Giuliani ’s firm Bracewell & Giuliani announced yesterday that it has used its extensive power network to set up a high - priced task force to help companies negotiate the current fiscal and political climate .
From a Giuliani statement :
Our team of former government officials and experienced attorneys in the fields of legislation , enforcement and finance are equipped to guide institutions in this quickly evolving and complex environment .
Dems leaped on this news , as Giuliani is a constant stumper for McCain .
McCain has previously blamed the current crisis on “ unbridled greed ” on Wall Street , so it could look bad that his main surrogate is moving swiftly to make money off of it .
A DNC spokesman has already called this “ crass opportunism . ”
Come on people , let ’s not get hysterical — it ’s crass capitalism .
Ooh !
Ooh !
Crapitalism .
Yes !
It ’s Rudy , the Vulture [ NYDN ]
52 % share of the vote is Obama 's highest to date
Gallup Daily : Obama 's Lead Over McCain Expands to 11 52 % share of the vote is Obama 's highest to date
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking report shows Barack Obama with a 52 % to 41 % lead over John McCain .
These results , based on Oct. 5 - 7 polling , are the best for Obama during the campaign , both in terms of his share of the vote and the size of his lead over McCain .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Nearly all interviews in today 's report were conducted before Tuesday night 's town hall style debate in Nashville .
Any movement in voter preferences as a result of this debate will be apparent in coming days .
Voter preferences seem to have stabilized for the moment , as Obama has held a double - digit lead over McCain in each of the last three individual nights of polling .
Concern about the economy seems to be playing to Obama 's advantage ; he overtook McCain when the financial crisis worsened in the middle of September , and his strong showing today coincides with the worst rating of the economy this year ( 59 % of Americans describe current economic conditions as " poor " ) .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 5 - 7 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,747 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Greek dig unearths secrets of Alexander the Great 's golden era
It would be more than 100 years at least until Alexander the Great led the forces of Macedonia to conquer the Hellenistic world .
But , even in its early days , the Greek kingdom 's warriors were already an imposing sight on the battlefield .
A dig in an ancient burial ground in Alexander 's birthplace of Pella , northern Greece , has unearthed the graves of 20 warriors in battle dress , a find which archaeologists say sheds fresh light on the development of Macedonian culture .
Imposing : A bronze helmet with golden facial plates ( left ) and a copper helmet and gold eye - cover of two ancient warriors were found in a cemetery in Pella
The warriors , whose remains have been dated to the late Archaic period , between 580BC and 460BC , were among 43 graves excavated in the latest dig , with the other bodies ranging from 650 BC to 279BC .
Some of the warriors were buried in bronze helmets alongside iron swords and knives .
Their eyes , mouths and chests were covered in gold foil richly decorated with drawings of lions and other animals symbolising royal power .
Gold jewellery was found in a woman 's grave at the ancient cemetery
Other finds included gold jewellery and pottery .
' The discovery is rich in historical importance , shedding light on Macedonian culture during the Archaic period , ' said Pavlos Chrysostomou .
He said the graves confirmed evidence of an ancient Macedonian society organised along militaristic lines and with overseas trade as early as the second half of the 7th century BC .
Above and below : Overviews of portions of the 1,414 ancient graves uncovered during work on a new metro line in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki
Among the excavated graves , the team also found 11 women from the Archaic period , with gold and bronze necklaces , earrings and brooches .
Nine of the graves dated to the late classical or early Hellenistic period , around the death of Alexander the Great in 323BC .
The dig was part of a wider eight - year project that investigated a total of 915 ancient graves .
Alexander , whose father Philip II unified the city states of mainland Greece before his assassination in 336BC , conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks .
Gold jewellery is shown in one of the 11 women 's graves found
Educated by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle , by the age of 25 he had defeated the Persians .
His empire eventually included Egypt , Anatolia , Syria , Phoenicia , Judea , Gaza , Mesopotamia and Bactria , even stretching as far as India .
He is believed never to have been defeated in battle but in 323BC , aged just 32 , he died in Babylon , possibly as a result of malaria , poisoning , typhoid fever , viral encephalitis or the consequences of alcoholism .
Legend : Alexander the Great as played by Colin Farrell in the 2004 film
This is literally a no-punches pulled account of militant group Anti Fascist Action ’s fight against fascism in Britain by a grassroots anarchist member of AFA .
Highly recommended .
It is important , not because he makes any pretence at being a leading light but because the many small ( or not so small ) contributions such people make are key to the success that AFA achieved .
Written with honesty and a sense of humour , the tale of challenging the fascists for control of the streets – and winning – never descends to political cliché or reads like a pools forecast .

So no reproduction by capitalists .
The Democratic Party has historically attracted women and minority voters , and this year ’s national platform reiterates the party ’s support of affirmative action programs .
So why do so many Colorado Democrats support Amendment 46 , the measure on the November ballot that would end state - sponsored affirmative action programs ?
Three recent polls show that support for the measure — which would ban race and gender preferences in state hiring , contracting and education — is higher among Democrats than Republicans .
Critics of the measure and political observers say the polls likely reflect voter confusion over what the measure would really do .
They say some Democratic voters think the measure is aimed at eliminating discrimination against women and minorities rather than ending affirmative action programs .
“ My guess is that if you ’re seeing numbers that high ( among Democrats ) , people are misunderstanding what a yes vote means , because this is the party of affirmative action , ” said Pat Waak , chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party .
The most recent poll , released Aug. 13 by Rasmussen Reports , showed that likely Colorado voters supported the measure 55 percent in favor to 23 percent against .
But the poll showed that 71 percent of Democrats supported the measure while only 34 percent of Republicans supported it .
Two earlier Quinnipiac University polls also showed higher support for the measure among Hispanics than whites , and one poll showed more women supporting the amendment than men .
Bob Loevy , a political scientist at Colorado College , said the wording of the poll questions , which was similar to the wording of the amendment itself , is instructive .
The Quinnipiac poll includes language from the ballot measure that says “ the state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any group or individual on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin ” in hiring , contracting or education .
The Rasmussen poll used similar language .
“ On the surface , this amendment sounds like something most Democrats would want to vote for ; it gets rid of what sounds like racial favoritism , ” Loevy said .
“ It takes a while to explain to people that there are certain implications to this — doing away with certain affirmative action programs . ”
Loevy said that unless opponents of the measure start a robust campaign , many Democrats will support it .
“ Many may wake up after Election Day and realize they probably voted for something they did n’t want , ” he said .
Jessica Peck Corry , a spokeswoman for the Colorado Civil Rights Initiative , the campaign in support of the initiative , said she did n’t think there was any confusion about the ballot measure .
She said the high support among Democratic voters reflected “ a huge divide between the Democrat elites ” and the party ’s rank and file .
“ For the average Democrat voter , he or she is concerned about their kids getting into college , ” Corry said .
“ They do n’t have time for lofty political debates that many elite Democrats can afford to have .
The liberal elites already have their ( college and employment ) connections , whereas ordinary blue - collar voters do n’t . ”
Opponents of the ballot measure say they have an uphill battle .
Craig Hughes , an organizer of the Vote No on Amendment 46 campaign , said the confusion among Democratic voters follows a pattern with similar measures that passed in other states .
California businessman Ward Connerly is pushing Amendment 46 and measures like it in other states .
Similar measures already have passed in California , Michigan and Washington .
Hughes said the anti-46 campaign will show that opportunities for women and minorities have been diminished in states where the anti-affirmative action measures have passed .
Amendment 46 opponents filed a lawsuit in April challenging whether some petition circulators who gathered signatures for the ballot measure met legal requirements .
Secretary of State Mike Coffman ’s office is re-examining the signatures for the initiative after a preliminary sample count of signatures could not determine if there were enough to place the measure on the ballot .
But opponents ’ main strategy may lie in a counter - initiative they are trying to get on the ballot .
The proposal is worded similarly to Amendment 46 , calling for ending discrimination based on race and sex , but contains a phrase that would allow for all current affirmative action programs to remain in place .
Essentially , the proposal would do the exact opposite of Amendment 46 — preserving affirmative action in the Colorado Constitution .
In a radio ad campaign , Amendment 46 supporters have said that opponents ’ counter - initiative is deliberately misleading .
Opponents of Amendment 46 say that ’s pot -and - kettle talk .
Said Hughes : “ What ’s deceptive is trying to ban equal opportunity programs in the guise of expanding equal opportunity for all . ”

How on earth does one make sense of it ?
The last week , he has plunged from one gimmick to another , finally landing on this transparently cynical bid to " suspend " his campaign until a bailout deal - then returning to Washington to actually say nothing while the deal collapsed :
At the bipartisan White House meeting that Mr. McCain had called for a day earlier , he sat silently for more than 40 minutes , more observer than leader , and then offered only a vague sense of where he stood , said people in the meeting .
In rode the man on the white horse , whom no one really needed .
And when he got there , he did n't resolve the impasse , and he did n't propose a plan .
He just sat there , er , blinking .
Now he 's tied himself into the comic position that if this deal is n't made by tonight , he wo n't show up at the debate , so there .
It 's like a seventeen year old going to their room and slamming the door when he can't be the center of attention .
Matt Cooper notes :
McCain certainly has n't helped and now we 're at a point where a deal seems unlikely tomorrow in time for the debate which means McCain will have to make another decision -- whether to swallow his pride and show up for the Meeting in Mississippi or be the biggest no -show in the history of American politics .
Since he does n't seem to have added anything to the negotiations in Washington , it 's hard to see why on earth he should show up for the debate with Barack Obama .
If he shows up with no deal , he 'll look beyond lame .
If he shows up after the deal , he will not be able to say truthfully he had anything to do with it , especially if he now leads opposition to the bailout .
All in all : it 's very hard to know what is going on in his head , what stunt he 's going to pull next , what new drama he wants to unveil .
Calming , is n't it , to think what a McCain presidency would look like .
Not boring , anyway .

The feature - length documentary Zeitgeist was released for free on the Web in 2007 .
It served as a mesmerizing critique of western society , attacking the military industrial complex and the myths used to maintain the established order .
Its creator , Peter Joseph , has recently released a sequel , Zeitgeist : Addendum , also available on - line , which draws from libertarian , environmental , and New Age ideas in its analysis of the world 's present political , economic , and environmental challenges .
The documentary starts by focusing on the monetary system , detailing how it employs debt as an instrument of control and the fundamental role this system plays in corporate globalization .
Addendum then proposes that the development of progressive technologies is the mostly likely way to create a successful alternative to the scarcity created by the monetary system .
In conclusion , Addendum stresses the need for belief systems to embrace the ideas of emergence and interdependence and outlines concrete steps that can be taken to weaken the monetary system .
Addendum is not without flaws .
It spends a lot of time treading the same ground as documentaries like The Money Masters and Money as Debt and spends too much time on specific technical solutions .
Despite that , it 's an inspiring documentary and well worth the time for anyone interested in fresh perspectives on how to achieve progressive change .
August 23 , 2008 The Mysterious ' Sarkozy Letter '
Is n't it funny how some ' western ' politician still bluster about the signed ceasefire agreement over Georgia and Russian peacekeepers in Georgia .
But they do this , of course , with a purpose .
They want to change the accepted and signed ceasefire agreement .
To understand what is happening here , one has to go back to the phases that led to the ceasefire agreement .
I will try to do so below and unfortunately it will be a bit longish .
So here is the short version :
The United States tries to change the signed ceasefire agreement over Georgia .
After Sarkozy negotiated with Russia and the ceasefire was agreed upon by both sides , the U.S. was very disappointed ( and mad with Sarko ) .
Rice went to Paris and pressed Sarkozy to write a letter to Saakashvili that gives a very lopsided U.S. / Georgia friendly interpretation of the ceasefire agreement .
Legally that letter is completely without merit .
But now the U.S. wants this lopsided interpretation laid down only in a letter from Sarkozy to Saakashvili to became a legal part of the ceasefire agreement via a resolution at the UN Security Council .
It uses the ' Sarkozy letter ' to make propaganda against legal troop movements and checkpoints the Russians are operating within Georgia .
The media , of course , falls for it .
Russia of course will never agree to that outcome .
It has no reason to do so and still most of the pressure points .
The situation on the ground :
The Russians have pulled their troops back into or near South Ossetia and Abkhasia along the peacekeeping lines that were agreed upon in the 1990s .
They additionally keep lookout posts at Georgia 's main port Poti and in Senaki as well as near the major east - west road north of Gori .
Map courtesy of BBC ( the map is a few days old - there currently are no clashes )
To any strategist the reason is obvious .
The port at Poti is the most likely point through which heavier weapons could get into the country .
( Turkey is unlikely to allow any weapon transports that could seriously upset its relations with Russia . )
The outpost in Senaki is needed to provide a secure ' line of communication ' from Abkhazia to the observer troops in Poti .
The post north of Gori is a lookout for heavy truck and military traffic on that major road .
These troops WILL stay there until Russia gets what it wants at the UN Security Council .
The U.S. , of course , does not like that : U.S. Deputy State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the Russians " without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement . "
An immediate concern expressed by all sides involved buffer zones outside of two Georgian breakaway provinces , South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Russia insists it has the right to create these zones under the cease - fire deal , but Wood said , " Establishing check - points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement . "
Wood is of course wrong .
Point 5 of the signed ceasefire agreement says : Russian forces must go back to positions they held prior to the outbreak of hostilities .
Pending an international peace monitoring mechanism , Russian peacekeepers will take additional security measures .
That is of course an excellent , short but wideranging formulation - from the Russian point of view .
Any " international peace monitoring mechanism " will need a Security Council mandate or an OSCE agreement , both of which can be stalled until Russia gets what it wants .
" Additional security measures " can arguably include about any military or police measure the Russians want to implement on the ground of Georgia .
If traffic control by Russian peacekeepers in Tbilisi is needed as an additional security measure , there is little anyone can legally say against Russia implementing such .
( They would not be so dumb to actually try such a thing . )
The CNN report linked above tries to explain the U.S. justification for Robert Wood 's faked outrage :
In a letter clarifying that point , French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- who helped broker the deal -- wrote that such measures " may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of South Ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of Georgian territory . "
He added that the measures must be " inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between South Ossetia and the rest of Georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included . "
Huh , what letter ?
Written to whom , when , where ?
CNN will not tell you any of that ...
Here is the history of the ' Sarkozy letter ' :
In the early morning hours of Friday August 8 Georgia opened an artillery barrage against the South Ossetian city of Tskhinvali which was under protection of internationally acknowledged Russian peacekeepers .
Russia asked for an immediate UN statement to restore peace , but the ' ' west ' declined .
( InnerCity Press live - blogged the day from the UN . )
Within twelve hours Russia reacted and put forces on the ground to fight back the attacking Georgians .
On August 10 the Georgian forces were mostly beaten and Saakashshvili offered ceasefire talks .
On August 11 the French foreign minister Kouchner and his Finnish colleague Stubb made up some ceasefire agreement , presumably without talking to the Russians , which Saakashvili is said to have signed .
They were supposed to bring that paper to Moscow , but there is no report that they ever arrived there .
Either Georgia or Russia ( or someone else ? ) rejected that paper .
In the night from the 11th to 12th Georgian troops fled from the western part of Georgia and the central city of Gori towards Tbilisi as it was feared that the Russians would march towards the capital .
On August 12 the Russian foreign minister Lavrov : sharply criticized the West for failing to convince Tbilisi to renounce force .
“ Our foreign partners have done nothing to force Tbilisi , to use their influence with Tbilisi , for the signature of a legally - binding document " on renunciation of force , Lavrov said .
With Kouchner 's mission aborted , Sarkozy flew to Moscow on August 12 to negotiate a new version .
The Russians told him what they wanted and Sarkozy dutifully wrote it down .
He then flew to Tbilisi but Saakashvili ( and his U.S. minders ) did not want to agree to the terms .
The point of difference was one word in point 6 of the agreement : Launch of international discussions on status , security and stability arrangements for Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The formulation was taken from the Kosovo case where it had been used by the ' west ' to take Kosovo away from Serbia .
Georgia demanded to take away the word " status " as this would endanger its ' territorial integrity ' .
Russia agreed because it found the formulation " discussion on security and stability agreement " strong enough for its purpose as it includes no guarantee for ' territorial integrity ' .
This is currently one point of trouble within the UN security council .
The ' west ' wants to have the words ' territorial integrity ' of Georgia in the new resolution , Russia demands the exact quote from the signed ceasefire agreement which then in later negotiations could eventually allow to split off South Ossetia and Abchasia .
After the word " status " was taken out of clause 6 , Saakashvili accepted the ceasefire agreement but did not formally sign any paper .
On August 13 / 14 Sec State Rice flew to Paris to talk with Sarkozy .
She was supposed to take the formal agreement from Paris for signature to Tbilisi .
But as the world only learned days later , she pressed Sarkozy to write a letter to Saakashvili to ' clarify ' points in the ceasefire agreement in a way that changed the meaning of two important points of the original agreement .
The Russians were verbally informed about the letter but said , " So what ? "
They made clear that in relation to them such a letter represents in no way a legal document .
" Why should we care what love letters Sarko writes to Saak ? "
On August 15 Rice arrived in Tbilisi .
Later that day Saakashvili was reported to have signed the ceasefire .
But did he ?
Late on Friday US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov from her plane after leaving the Georgian capital Tbilisi .
A US official said Lavrov told Rice Russia would faithfully implement the ceasefire agreement , but wanted to see Saakashvili 's signature on the document first .
Never trust anyone until the dotted line is really signed ...
On Sunday the 16th Medvedev signed the formal agreement the French sent him , but somehow that version was different from the one Saakashvili signed ( after signature such documents get swapped ) :
The copy signed by Saakashvili somehow lost a preamble that said the document was the result of an agreement reached between Medvedev and Sarkozy .
When this became known , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he would use diplomatic channels to find out who had modified the text .
Rice picked up the document ( and Sarko 's letter ) in Paris on her way to Tbilisi .
The document that was sent from Paris to Moscow for signature had the preamble .
The one to Tbilisi arrived without it .
Did Rice take away the part that credited Sarkozy - Medvedev negotiations ?
Why ?
( How does this relate to the letter ? )
The negotiations were over , the documents signed and exchanged and the legal process closed .
But then on Saturday ( ! ) , August 16 , this somewhat weird report came out : PARIS , Aug 16 ( Reuters ) - Russia must withdraw from all major towns in Georgia under a peace accord it has signed , despite conditions authorising " additional security measures , " according to a letter sent by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili .
" As I specified at our joint press conference in Tbilisi , these ' additional security measures ' can only be implemented in the immediate proximity of South Ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of Georgian territory , " read the letter , made public by Sarkozy 's office on Sunday .
The French - brokered agreement drafted this week authorises Russian forces to take extra security measures on a temporary basis pending the arrival of international peacekeepers -- which requires a U.N. Security Council resolution .
...
Sarkozy 's letter said that under the accord , Russian forces would not be authorised to remain in any major towns outside South Ossetia and road and rail transport should be guaranteed .
" More precisely , these ' measures ' may only be implemented within a zone of a few kilometres from the administrative limits between South Ossetia and the rest of Georgia , in such a way that no major urban centre is included -- I am thinking in particular of the town of Gori , " the letter read .
" Special arrangements will have to be defined to guarantee freedom of movement along the road and rail routes of Georgia , " it said .
None of these specifications are mentioned in the very short , legally signed and binding actual agreement .
Why does Sarkozy believe he can interpret that at will and in this quite specific manner ?
S arranges a contract between A and B where B has to pay 10,000 .
After the contract is signed , S tells B that he interprets 10,000 as to be actually seen as 100 .
B very much likes that interpretation .
But why should A agree to it ?
The letter that Reuters published on Saturday while reporting it to be published on Sunday seems to have been kept completely secret until the Inner City Press ( ICP ) got hold of it :
While the document handed to Inner City Press Thursday at the stakeout begins , " The Presidency of the Republic [ of France ] , for the sake of transparency , wished to make public the letter , " afterwards numerous reporters and even senior diplomats in the Security Council asked Inner City Press for copies of Sarkozy 's letter .
Inner City Press made copies , for the sake of France 's transparency .
To sum it up : Sarkozy took a dictation from Russia for the ceasefire in Georgia , especially point 5 and 6 .
He went to Tbilisi and after further negotiation , the Russians agreed to a one word change .
Saakashvili verbally agreed to that ' draft ' .
The U.S. did n't like that .
Then Rice flies to Paris and also gives a dictation to Sarkozy .
He pens a letter to Saakashvili and includes the U.S. interpretation that the unlimited clause ' additional security measures ' in the agreement actually is supposed to mean whatever the U.S. says it means .
Rice takes the letter and the ceasefire document to Tbilisi and Saakashvili must sign .
Now the U.S. in the public media and in the UN Security Council uses the formerly secret Sarkozy letter to argue that Russia is not keeping to a version of the ceasefire it has never agreed to .
The Russian UN ambassador had rather opinionated words for that which you can hear and see in this RealVideo stream at 5:20 .

Eavesdropping allegations prompt Senate investigation
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV on Thursday promised an investigation into allegations of wiretapping of American citizens abroad , prompted by a story from ABC News .
On Thursday morning , ABC reported that hundreds of U.S. citizens overseas have been eavesdropped on as they called friends and family back home , according to two former military intercept operators who worked at the giant National Security Agency center in Fort Gordon , Ga .
“ These are extremely disturbing allegations , ” Rockefeller said in a statement .
“ The Senate Intelligence Committee is examining this now and we have requested all relevant information from the Bush administration . ”
Rockefeller was a key negotiator in passing an update of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act earlier this year .
“ Any time there is an allegation regarding abuse of the privacy and civil liberties of Americans , it is a very serious matter , ” he said .
“ The committee will take whatever action is necessary to ensure those rules are followed and any violations are addressed . ”
According to the ABC report , NSA operators routinely shared salacious or tantalizing phone calls that had been intercepted , alerting office mates to certain time codes of " cuts " that were available on each operator 's computer .
On Thursday afternoon , White House press secretary Dana Perino told reporters she had not yet seen the report and would withhold comment until she viewed the story .
UPDATE : Rockefeller spokeswoman Jamie Smith provides an update :
“ These allegations are serious and disturbing – the Senate Intelligence Committee is gathering facts and any decision on potential hearings will be made as the committee examination progresses , ” said Smith .
When asked if the committee has received any documents from the administration , Smith said the committee " cannot comment on its internal activities . "
With the noises from Congress growing louder , Wall Street says it ’s getting the message .
Top executives are " in discussions to possibly cap their own compensation , " the Wall Street Journal reports .
Of course , these talks do n’t come unprompted .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) recently requested information about what the first nine banks participating in the Treasury Department ’s capital injection program ( getting $ 125 billion in total ) plan for this year ’s bonuses .
Potentially even more worrisome for the banks , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo recently requested the same information .
Cuomo has already threatened legal action against AIG for excessive exec bonuses .
But if recent history has taught us anything , it ’s that Wall Street can be quite innovative .
And while execs may be discussing curtailing annual bonuses , the Journal also reports that the firms owe their executives billions through other means , such as deferred pay and special executive pensions .
The sums , compiled by the Journal because they are usually not reported , can be staggering : $ 11.8 billion at Goldman Sachs , $ 8.5 billion at J.P. Morgan Chase , $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion at Morgan Stanley , and around $ 5 billion at Citigroup .
In the case of Goldman , that sum vastly exceeds its $ 399 million pension plan for employees .
The executive goody bags , says the Journal , " are like 401 ( k ) plans on steroids . "
The execs defer bonuses or salary into an account , which can sometimes be matched by the employer – and sweetened on top of that with a healthy interest rate :
Often , it is a generous rate .
At Freddie Mac , executives earned 9.25 % on their deferred - pay accounts in 2007 , regulatory filings show -- a better deal than regular employees of the mortgage buyer could get in a 401 ( k ) .
Since all this money is tax - deferred , the Treasury , and by extension the U.S. taxpayer , subsidizes the accounts .
These bonuses are especially relevant for two reasons .
First , because the bailout rules , which place some restrictions on executive pay , do n’t affect this type of compensation .
And second , because a number of firms do n’t set aside assets to cover these expenses , departures by top execs can hit a firm ’s balance sheet when it does n’t expect it .
It ’s unclear whether the recent inquiries by Waxman or Cuomo will touch on these types of bonuses .
Certainly anything is possible .
In this new era of government investment in Wall Street , executives are learning a new sensitivity to public perception .
As one corporate watchdog told Bloomberg , " They are just a bonus away from having the villagers come after them with torches . "
The letter and other documents indicate that Mr. Sargeant currently has just one other partner in the venture , suggesting that they would largely divide those profits .
“ Mr. Sargeant ’s personal gain from these four contracts may have been $ 70 million or higher , ” Mr. Waxman ’s letter says .
A spokesman for Mr. Gates , Chris Isleib , said that the Pentagon had supplied all the documents that Mr. Waxman had requested in the case .
“ As a result of these documents and subsequent discussions with the committee , Congressman Waxman asked the secretary of defense to investigate allegations that I.O.T.C. has overcharged for the delivery of fuel , ” Mr. Isleib said in an e-mail message .
The Pentagon will respond directly to the committee on that request , Mr. Isleib said .
Image Harry Sargeant III is the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party .
Credit ... S.V. Date / Palm Beach Post
Jim Greer , the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida , said , “ Since Harry Sargeant has been the finance chairman , he has always demonstrated the highest degree of ethics and integrity and has always served the party well . ”
Brian Rogers , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , said : “ This obviously has nothing do with the McCain campaign .
John McCain has always called for full transparency in military contracting , and if there ’s a nonpolitical mechanism for looking at credible allegations , then that should obviously go forward . ”
Ryan Alexander , president of Taxpayers for Common Sense in Washington , said that further investigation was warranted even though the initial inquiry did not turn up direct evidence of political meddling .
Mr. Waxman estimated that if the lowest bidder had been awarded the contracts , taxpayers would have saved some $ 180 million .
“ The fact that the contracting officer warned them lends credence to the general allegation that this is profiteering and that this is an unfair contract , ” Ms. Alexander said .
“ To allow that high of a profit to deliver fuel to the troops is not the kind of management we need right now . ”

AUTHOR : kai zhu - kaizhu@hpc.usc.edu
HOMEPAGE : http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~kaizhu/work/py3to2
ABSTRACT :
py3to2 is a patch / module that backports py3 k opcode instructions
to python 2.x ( py2 x ) .
this allows py2x to run py3 k code natively @ the
bytecode - level .
the motivation is that py3 k lacks many useful 2.x modules .
the lack
of 3rd - party modules in particular ( eg scipy , PIL , ... ) is a hindrance to py3 k
development / testing .
py3to2 addresses these issues by allowing py3 k code to b
developed / integrated / run natively under the robust , software - rich , py2x
environment .
MECHANISM :
1. upon init , py3to2 starts up a py3 k server w/ pipe io .
2. -> received via pipe io from py3to2 , the py3 k server 1st
natively compiles the src code into a py3 k codeobj , then converts it
to py2 x format w/ the addition of the backported opcodes .
3. <- the serialized py2x codeobj is piped back to py3to2 ,
which unserializes it & eval / exec it as normal .
in theory , this mechanism should transparently implement any bytecode - level py3 k
language feature .
performance and robustness should b minimally impacted , since
the compiled code is directly run as native 2.x++ bytecode .
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY :
make test ( patched python 2.6 on redhat opteron x86_64 )
...
324 tests OK .

October surprise , appearance of mythical terror leader only factor that can rescue a 7 point deficit
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , October 2 , 2008
With just 31 days left until the presidential election , attention has turned to the widely anticipated “ October surprise . ”
There is only one man that can now prevent Barack Obama from becoming the next President of the United States – and it is n’t John McCain .
The establishment media is certainly entertaining the probability that a late political development will impact voters , with the Associated Press today reporting , “ The specter of an October surprise has already factored into the 2008 campaign . ”
But with the latest polls now showing Obama ahead by at least 7 points on the back of the financial crisis , and leading McCain by as much as 15 points in key states like Pennsylvania , it ’s reasonable to speculate that the only beneficiaries from any potential October surprise would be the McCain campaign .
And judging by past history it seems that there ’s only one man who could help McCain overturn such a significant deficit – Osama Bin Laden .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Both John Kerry and George W. Bush attributed Bush ’s 2004 success to a video tape featuring Bin Laden that was released days before voters went to the polls .
Veteran news broadcaster Walter Cronkite called the tape a Karl Rove - orchestrated set up .
As we wrote on the eve of the vote four years ago , “ Bush ’s poll numbers have been significantly boosted and this will be enough to win him re-election . ”
Bin Laden ’s chastisement of Bush resulted in a 6 point swing , enabling Bush to seal a second term in office .
“ It changed the entire dynamic of the last five days , ” Kerry told the AP this week of the bin Laden tape .
“ We saw it in the polling .
There was no other intervening event .
We saw the polls freeze and then we saw them drop a point , because all the security moms , it agitated people over 9/11 . ”
Who will the finger of suspicion point to should we witness the emergence of yet another dubious Bin Laden tape or a catastrophic event linked with Al - Qaeda ?
Consider the comments of one of McCain ’s top advisors , Charlie Black , who in June said that a terror attack on American soil would be a “ big advantage ” to McCain ’s election hopes .
Black added that last December ’s assassination of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had helped McCain to win the New Hampshire primary , a state he had to win to save his candidacy .
According to John Kerry , should either campaign attempt to stage an October surprise , the consequences could backfire .
“ I think the media has grown much more suspicious of it because of the recent experiences , ” he said , “ so I suspect there ’ll be a lot of scrutiny and maybe even some backlash . ”
But Kerry did n’t ask any questions when Bin Laden miraculously popped up in October 2004 , and many accused him of taking a dive when clear evidence of vote fraud later surfaced .
The “ chatter ” surrounding the probable entrance of Bin Laden or Al - Qaeda to impact the election is widespread .
According to a New York Sun report , in August America ’s military and intelligence agencies intercepted messages indicating that “ Al - Qaeda ” was planning to launch operations to coincide with the November election .
Earlier this month , the L.A. Times speculated that the recent incursions into Pakistan are aimed at capturing Bin Laden before Bush leaves office .
The report coincided with pulitzer prize winning journalist Bob Woodward ’s admission to CNN ’s Larry King that the U.S. had devised a new secret weapon in the war on terror .
“ We ’ll see – maybe they can use it on Bin Laden and all of a sudden the September or October surprise is gonna be the apprehension or the death of Bin Laden , ” Woodward said .
To win the White House , McCain has to make a gargantuan comeback that is unprecedented in at least the last 50 years .
He can not do so without a major event seizing the headlines at the end of the month to knock the financial meltdown to the sidelines .
Perhaps the question to ask is not whether a Bin Laden tape will crop up in the days before the vote , but whether such a tape would be enough to make up the difference – because the scenarios that will produce a guaranteed McCain win or even a cancellation of the election altogether are far scarier than Osama ’s reappearance on our TV screens .

Though not an issue in the 2008 campaign as it was in 2006 , a significant majority of Americans think political corruption is a problem in Washington , D.C. , according to a recent poll , and they point to it as major cause of the financial crisis .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Zogby International poll of 1,211 likely voters , commissioned by the conservative public interest group Judicial Watch , showed that 81.7 percent of Americans agree that political corruption played a “ major role ” in our nation ’s financial crisis .
Further , 86.4 percent said they think congressional corruption has increased or remained the same since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006 .
The corruption issue helped Democrats in that election .
But while most of those polled think corruption has not changed in Washington , they also think that neither presidential candidate is a clear leader to clean up the problems there .
The poll , with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percent , showed that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had a slight advantage over his Republican rival John McCain – 46.9 percent to 43.2 percent – on the question of who would best combat government corruption in Washington , but neither candidate surpassed the 50 percent mark .

This is something special .
This is n’t just the small matter of being one of the best games of the year , it ’s also the emergence of a stellar new talent in gaming .
World Of Goo is so stunningly designed , so beautifully illustrated , so precisely programmed , and so completely adorable that any of the greatest development companies in the world would be proud to release it .
That this is a tiny indie dev’s first release – it is beyond belief .
Small blobs of Goo , when put near one another , form rigid bonds .
Connect enough of them together and you can build towers and bridges along which unconnected Goo can saunter .
The goal in the majority of levels is to see particular balls of Goo reach a pipe opening , into which they are satisfactorily sucked .
There ’s your raw concept .
Now apply four hundred million gallons of imagination .
If you played the previously released Chapter One ( as part of the pre-order bonus ) , you ’ll have a good idea of the basics .
The core puzzles ( build a bridge to traverse a gap , climb your way to an overhanging pipe , avoid dangerous spinning cogs to reach an awkward spot , and so on ) are the frame on which vast amounts of joy is draped .
Building on top of the core – an engaging and engrossing puzzle game – they ’ve created something of elegance and elation like little else .
So I thought I knew what the game was about .
Both Tower Of Goo – the experimental semi- game that tested out the physics behind this all – and Chapter One gave me an idea what to expect .
Well , ten or fifteen ideas .
I would have been so delighted with four chapters of the same .
But this is more .
This is a game that constantly reinvents itself , reimagining the possibilities , evolving and throwing out surprise after surprise .
The most obvious of these elaborating factors is the art .
It is , just beyond belief , beautiful .
The cute , fuzzy design is reminiscent of something halfway between Tim Burton and Tim Schafer .
Its 2D appearance is deceptive , with multiple layers moving independently to create an organic world that ebbs and swells like a tide .
And like so much with the game , if you ’ve seen the first chapter , you have n’t seen a quarter of what it ’s going to do with its art design .
There ’s an internal logic to these developments , the game structured around a year of passing time , cycling through four seasons , and four technological ages .
Next most immediate is the music .
This is all the work of 2D Boy , and – look , I ’m well aware how much this already bulges with mad enthusiasm , but believe me , play it and you ’ll understand – it ’s just gorgeous .
It ’s the best in - game music I ’ve heard since …
I ’m struggling here .
It might be my favourite game music .
( Perhaps if you asked me to pick between this and Samarost 2 , I ’d be in trouble ) .
Minute - long pieces loop so neatly that the tunes never become repetitive or irritating .
On a number of occasions I ’ve task - switched out of the game to do other work and left pieces playing .
Then comes the rest of the audio .
The use of sound is impressively intelligent .
There are many different types of Goo Balls encountered throughout , each with distinct properties ( some can be plucked from structures and reused , others are rendered inert once used , others might be helium balloons , more still are explosive , and so on ) , and while visually distinctive , their unique sound effects play a big part in remembering which is which .
Clear - white Goo acts as water , forming only one bond , and dangling downward .
Move one and it makes the loveliest “ pa-lip ! ” noise .
The Goo Balls are chatty too .
Babbling mostly nonsense , I ’m convinced one cry is “ UNATCO ” in the strangest tribute to Deus Ex I ’ve encountered .
But I might be mad .
And of course , if you bought the pre-order , you ’ll get the package that switches all their cries to swearing – something of which we clearly approve .
I go into all this detail because , well , they did .
And it ’s important to get a sense of the passion and effort that went into every element , allowing this to be so much more than another cute puzzle game .
But obviously what ’s most essential is the puzzles .
And it ’s here that World Of Goo has its best surprises .
Of course , puzzle games are loved or lost based on the balance of challenge and infuriation .
This is where it becomes most overwhelming that this is 2D Boy ’s first game .
Each new screen immediately looks daunting , but then quickly reveals its opportunities .
The design is consistently smart , putting subtle clues in place , attracting your attention in the right direction .
This is a game that nudges you into having a great idea , rather than ever telling you what to do .
You get all the glory .
To go into too much detail at this point would be to rob you of the crucial surprises , so let ’s be vague .
The core concept – forming rigid bonds between Goo Balls – would be enough to entertain you for a long time .
But World Of Goo never rests on such laurels .
And had it , it might have succumbed to that all - to - easy route so many puzzles games take : to just make it more difficult .
While there is definitely a skill curve here , it ’s one based on what it ’s previously taught you .
That ’s the joy – each new level says , “ Okay , you ’ve proven you can do everything up until now .
So what if we do this ? ”
This might be removing something you thought was essential , or introducing a new , bemusing obstacle , but it ’s more likely to be a completely new Goo Ball type , or entirely original setting for a challenge .
You ’re more likely to encounter a difference that required the most effort for the developers , resulting in the largest amount of pleasure for you .
Why ask if you can make the Goo Balls reach slightly farther than before , when instead it could ask what you might do if the Goo Balls could fly .
This is best captured for me by one particular new Goo in Chapter 4 .
I wo n’t say what , obviously , but when I first clicked on it to move it , I genuinely gasped out loud with joy .
A real , audible gasp .
It was so beautifully tactile , so satisfying to interact with .
And I realised , wow , this is another stunningly executed mechanism that could have sustained its own puzzle game .
Accompanying you along the way , and acting as another prompt if you need a nudge , is the Sign Painter , a constant companion who offers messages in each level from wooden signposts .
Messages that are invariably incredibly silly , and one of the sources of the game ’s awesome humour .
Early on these act as a modest tutorial , letting you know what different Goo types are capable of .
But as the game progresses , the signposts become much more about exposition , hinting at the game ’s deeply peculiar story .
World Of Goo is funny at every opportunity .
From the Windows installation to the closing credits permeates a gleeful silliness .
The nonsense barks from the Goo balls , the ten second cut - scenes between some levels , the backgrounds ( hi MOM ! ) , the loading messages , and the World Of Goo Corporation all generate beaming smiles .
The World Of Goo Corporation .
Who is behind this mysterious , black - shrouded industry ?
And what has it to do with sending small blobs into pipes ?
I ’m not telling ( because the story is so utterly bizarre that I do n’t think I could if I wanted to ) .
It serves to offer betwixt - level entertainment .
Each level has a minimum amount of Goo that needs to be recovered , but there ’s always many more available .
Any extra you might recover appears in the Corporation area , which you use to build a tower .
As you do this , you ’ll see floating clouds in the sky above you showing the height other players have managed .
Ascend beyond , and your cloud will become the target for others to beat .
Which means I ’ve been going back to levels , desperate to do better , realising the game ’s immediate replayability .
Using tricks and techniques I ’ve picked up along the way , I can now do a lot better at Chapter One ’s challenges , recover more Goo , and build a taller tower ( up to 300 balls , where it cuts you off from adding more ) .
In fact , each level has an “ OCD ” challenge ( Obsessive Completion Distinction Criteria ) – an additional , optional challenge .
Perhaps to collect an exceedingly high number of Goo , or to complete a level in a certain time , or in a certain number of moves .
These are frequently stunningly high targets , and I ’m entirely bewildered at how some could ever be possible .
Until that moment of inspiration appears , and you realise yet another way you could approach a situation .
This is unbridled joy .
There must be stuff wrong .
Well , not really , no .
There ’s a couple of tweaks that would improve things .
The first is the very occasional frustration of not being able to select the Goo you ’re after , because of too many others getting in the way .
While you get the Whistle in Chapter Two that lets you call Goo toward your cursor , it ’s sometimes not enough to clear a gap , and it can occasionally be a pain .
A neat way to reach to the back would be a nice addition .
And it would be great if the button to restart a level did n’t disappear after you ’ve completed it .
That might sound odd , but if you ’re aiming for an OCD score , you might not know you ’ve missed it until the regular target is complete .
So to restart you have to go out the level and start it over again with the introductory sequence once more .
Exceedingly minor , but it would be a bonus to keep that button .
Really , that ’s it .
Two guys , sat in coffee shops all day long , made the best puzzle game in many years .
I ’ve given a great deal of thought before saying the following , to be sure I mean it .
It ’s not a statement to throw around :
It ’s hard not to think about David Jones at DMA , coming up with Lemmings .
There is a fierce intelligence at work here , from a two - man team overflowing with phenomenal talent .
It ’s a rare pleasure to find a game like this – one I ’ve come back to again and again a week after completing it .
2008 seems to have marked a rise for the remarkable independent developer .
Not only is the little guy influencing the megacorps , but he ’s making some money out of it too .
2D
Boy deserve to be at the front of this pack , their game a thing of astonishing joy .
I ’ve seen the broadest beams on the faces of colleagues trying to describe it .
I ’ve beamed throughout myself .
Moving through the four seasons of levels has made me feel just so happy .
Happy because of its wonderful atmosphere , and happy because it ’s just so extraordinarily good .
I adore World Of Goo , I want to show it to everyone I know , I want to use it to convince people that gaming is smart , and witty , and brilliantly original .
I ’ve run out of ways to say this :
It ’s beautiful .
John :
Oh , I should let the others say something .
What do you guys think ?
Kieron : AWESOME !
Jim : AWESOME !
Alec : AWESOME !
Our verdict : SALE !
World Of Goo is out in October , and we think sooner rather than later .
You can pre-order it here .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Now the Democrats are n't the only ones who can try to capitalize on the negative buzz growing around Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the prospective Republican VP candidate .
Intrade , an online prediction market based in Dublin , created a contract Tuesday morning on the likelihood that John McCain will drop Palin as his running mate .
After opening at a probability of just 3 % , the odds on Palin being cut from the ticket hovered around 14 % yesterday .
Predictions plateaued today at 10 % , perhaps in response to yesterday 's speeches by Fred Thompson and Joe Lieberman .
Both praised the governor for her reformist qualities .
Intrade is a place for betting enthusiasts to turn a small profit on everything from the latest auction of works by controversial British artist Damien Hirst to Britney Spears ' chances of landing in rehab .
Contracts on a possible future event are bought and sold by users of the site , like a stock on the NYSE .
Chad Rigetti , Intrade 's VP of Business Development , says traders on the site asked Intrade to create the newest market after stories about Palin , including her teenage daughter 's pregnancy and her involvement in a group that did corporate fundraising for controversial Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens , flooded the news .
The pool has been open for 24 hours , but has already attracted more than 4000 trades .
Intrade estimates that about $ 42,000 has been traded on the Palin withdrawal contract .
Placing a Palin withdrawal at even 12 % seems bullish ; no presidential candidate has withdrawn his VP selection since Thomas Eagleton left Democratic candidate George McGovern 's ticket in 1972 .
Intrade has demonstrated some success in predicting political choices ( forecasting the selection of Biden ) , but also volatility : Palin 's chances of landing the nomination vacillated wildly in the hours before McCain announced the pick .
Rigetti points out that while some traders are putting Palin on the chopping block , they 're still giving her 98 % odds in a separate market for the VP nomination , which she is scheduled to accept Wednesday night .
He thinks that many traders are playing both markets , which means they believe a withdrawal wo n't come until later in the election season .
Intrade monitors its traders ' demographics , but it 's too early to tell who 's betting on a Palin pullout .
Some of the naysayers could be Republicans : Rigetti says that , unlike polls , the election markets do n't always represent political beliefs .
" People have a real money incentive , " he says .
" They 're betting with their head and not their heart . "

The application GUI
This was my final year project at Loughborough University , a project that pretty much completes the previous 2 years work on attempts to get a racing car to successfully navigate a given track without human assistance .
I decided to work on getting reliable behaviour though the use of good image analysis to find the car , and it ’s facing , then a set of simple rules for navigation .
It was written in Java , since it was done in Java in the previous two years , used to make use of existing code .
Image Analysis
The track was assumed to be always in line with the camera horizontally , which allowed some simple algorithms to scan lines for unbroken non-track areas when the camera image was thresholded to find the track area .
To find the car , a check for the total number of frame differenced pixels were done through the image .
The front of the car was found by putting some red on it , and allowing a similar thresholding to find only red .
To navigate around the track , waypoints were used , added by a few measurements of track areas and locations to put them in the same location each time .
3630
The track area , found with waypoints
3668
The car ( red dot ) it ’s front ( blue dot ) and the next waypoint ( pink dot )
Navigation Rules
After all the information was made available , the rules needed to successfully navigate between waypoints were kept simple since the car had a poor turning circle and did n’t have much in the way of advanced driving techniques to use .
These were able to navigate from most “ crash positions ” ( where the car cannot continue towards it ’s next waypoint without turning ) , and was able to complete 10 laps of the track successfully .
A sample of the points taken is below :

You can download my final report here :
The final code is available too , although it will need a certain web camera , and UserPort installed do much :
Finally , since the code is unlikely to run , there is a gallery of pictures ( most which are in the report ) , and some videos available .
These have some “ commentary ” but sometimes is of pretty poor quality and hard to hear .
All of these are H264 MPEG - 4 videos with AAC audio .
Edit September 2009 : Ouch , I did n’t link the code properly on my site and never noticed , likely as not no one tried to download it anyway 🙂
Should be fixed now !
After the post - convention Palin bounce , McCain ’s poll numbers started dropping rapidly and are now at an all - time low according to polling site 538.com .
So what ’s a candidate to do other than go sharply negative ?
According to the Washington Post , McCain has virtually stopped running any positive ads in order to concentrate on slamming Obama .
According to the AP , he has even dispatched Palin to deliver “ racially tinged ” attacks .
Which is what makes this video clip from 2000 that much more hypocritical .
In it , McCain asserts that negative attack ads show you have no vision .
My question is , what does it mean when you only run negative attack ads ?
As the humor site 236.com points out , McCain has previously apologized for his opposition to the federal holiday for Martin Luther King , Jr. , and for refusing to call for the removal of a Confederate flag from the capital in South Carolina .
McCain will probably have to spend the rest of his life apologizing for what he will be doing during the next 30 days .
The Times ’s Peter Baker , Kitty Bennett , Julie Bosman , John Broder , Michael Luo , Larry Rohter and William Yardley are examining the policies and statements of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Gov. Sarah Palin in real time tonight .

An Afghan Surge ?
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Gov. Sarah Palin sharply disagreed on whether a rapid reinforcement of troops and the application of counterinsurgency strategy as developed in Iraq would work in neighboring Afghanistan .
Mr. Biden said that the American commanding general in Afghanistan had said today ( he actually spoke on Wednesday ) that a “ surge ” in troops would not work there because of major differences in military and civic challenges between Iraq and Afghanistan .
Mrs. Palin said that the general had called for more troops – in essence , a “ surge ” – and said the counterinsurgency strategy that had reduced the violence in Iraq could also work in Afghanistan .
In citing the general ’s remarks , Mr. Biden did not name him .
Mrs. Palin referred to him as “ McClellan . ”
The commander is Army Gen. David D. McKiernan .
Both Mr. Biden and Mrs. Palin were partly right .
General McKiernan declined to use the term “ surge , ” but also called for a quick infusion of troops to pursue counterinsurgency operations similar to those in Iraq but on a different scale and over a very different politico - military landscape .
General McKiernan said in a Pentagon briefing on Wednesday that he needed more troops quickly to accomplish his mission of defeating insurgents , drug lords and the Taliban .
“ The word I do n’t use for Afghanistan is ‘ surge , ’ ” General McKiernan told reporters in Washington , where he was attending high - level meetings to review United States policy in Afghanistan .
“ There needs to be a sustained commitment of a variety of military and non-military resources , I believe .
That ’s my advice to winning in Afghanistan .
It wo n’t be a short - term solution . ”
Mr. Biden and his Democratic running mate , Senator Barack Obama have called Afghanistan “ the central front in the war on terror ” and are calling for deployment of additional American combat brigades there .
They do not call such an increase a “ surge , ” however , as that term has been applied in Iraq .
Ms. Palin said that the general “ did not say definitively that the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan .
Certainly , accounting for different conditions in that different country — and conditions are certainly different . ”
She went on to list some .
We have NATO allies helping us , for one , and even the geographic differences are huge .
But the counterinsurgency principles also could work in Afghanistan .
McClellan did n’t say anything opposite of that . ”
The general did say that some aspects of the Iraq counterinsurgency strategy , such as the effort to engage tribal leaders in political dialogue , could yield fruit in Afghanistan , which has long been dominated by regional and tribal warlords .
He said there are significant differences between the two countries and the two conflicts , however .
“ But there are countless other differences between Iraq and Afghanistan , ” he said .
He then went on to list many of them .
“ In Afghanistan , it ’s such a poor country , by any set of metrics you can imagine .
A country that has very harsh geography .
It ’s very difficult to move around , getting back to our reliance on helicopters .
It ’s a country with very few natural resources , as opposed to the oil revenues that [ Iraq ] has .
There ’s very little money to be generated in terms of generated in Afghanistan .
The literacy rate you have a literate society in Iraq , you have a society that has a history of producing civil administrators , technocrats , middle class that are able to run the country in Iraq .
You do not have that in Afghanistan . ”
Cost of War ?
Mr. Biden said that “ we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country . ”
This appears to be exaggerated , although it is not exactly clear what Mr. Biden was including under “ building that country . ”
The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation a non-partisan group , estimates U.S. spending in Iraq at $ 2.4 billion a week , based on a report this year by the Congressional Research Service .
That would put a three - week total at $ 7.2 billion .
In June the U.S. State Department said security and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2008 amounted to $ 26 billion , including $ 7.7 billion for economic and social development , $ 17.2 billion for security and $ 1.3 billion on “ governance , rule of law and human rights . ”
Darfur
Ms. Palin said she and state lawmakers “ called for divestment ” from international companies that do business in Darfur .
She said that a bill that would have ended the state ’s investments in Darfur “ has n’t passed yet but it needs to because all of us , as individuals , and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world . ”
Les Gara , a Democratic member of the House who was one of the sponsors of the divestment measure in the House , said Ms. Palin opposed the bill before she supported it , and that she was never a vocal supporter .
He said the Palin administration opposed the House bill early in the legislative session this year .
Several weeks later , after Mr. Gara and others consulted with administration officials , the administration supported a similar Senate bill late in the session that did not make it out of committee .
He said he was not aware of major changes between the House and Senate bills .
“ I do appreciate that they listened and ultimately changed their position , but it was too late for the bill to pass , ” Mr. Gara said .
“ It ’s perfectly black and white that they killed the bill in the House . ”
McCain and Spain :
One of the more arcane exchanges of the evening came over the issue of negotiations with adversaries and friends .
Attempting to portray Mr. McCain as absurdly intransigent in the diplomatic arena , Mr. Biden accused him of shunning even some of America ’s friends .
“ John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago , he would n’t even sit down with the government of Spain , a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now , ” Mr. Biden said .
“ I find that incredible . ”
Mr. Biden ’s accusation stems from an interview Mr. McCain gave last month to a radio station in Miami .
After asking him about various Latin American leaders , the interviewer asked him if he was willing to meet with Spain ’s Prime Minister , Jose Luis Zapatero .
Mr. McCain ’s answer , given in four different variations in response to insistent questioning , was ambiguous , which triggered much speculation in Spain and among other NATO allies in Europe .
“ I am willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights , democracy and freedom , and I will stand up to those that do not , ” he said at the close of the exchange .
As Mr. Biden indicated , Spain does indeed have troops in Afghanistan , and like the United States has also been a victim of Islamic terrorism .
But Mr. McCain did not explicitly say he would not meet with Mr. Zapatero or other Spanish officials .
A day later , however , Mr. McCain ’s chief foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , seemed to eliminate much of the initial ambiguity .
“ Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview , ” he said in remarks to The Washington Post .
That still leaves open the possibility of a meeting with other Spanish officials ( or Mr. Zapatero himself ) in a setting other than the White House .
But diplomatic analysts nonetheless regard Mr. McCain ’s position as unusually cool towards an ally , perhaps because Mr. Zapatero withdrew Spanish troops from Iraq after he took office .
Clean Coal :
Governor Palin criticized Mr. Biden for an overheard comment he made on a rope line that appeared to contradict Mr. Obama ’s support of building clean coal plants .
“ I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there is n’t anything , such a thing as clean coal , and I think you said it in a rope line too , at one of the rallies , ” she said .
His comment on the rope line was in response to a young voter , who asked him why he and Mr. Obama support “ clean coal . ”
“ We ’re not supporting clean coal , ” Mr. Biden said in response .
He added , “ China ’s going to burn 300 years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up , because it ’s going to ruin your lungs , and there ’s nothing we can do about it .
No coal plants here in America .
Build ’em , if they ’re gonna build ’em , over there and make ’em clean because they ’re killing you . ”
After the McCain campaign jumped on his remarks last week , the Obama campaign responded by reiterating Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden ’s support of clean coal technology , but they were not able to fully explain the contradiction between that position and Mr. Biden ’s remarks to the voter on the rope line .
At the debate , Mr. Biden defended himself by asking Ms. Ifill to examine his record on clean coal .
“ My record , for 25 years , has supported clean - coal technology .
A comment made at a rope line was taken out of context , ” he said .
“ I was talking about exporting that technology to China so when they burn their dirty coal it wo n’t be as dirty , it will be clean . ”
Small Businesses and Taxes :
Ms. Palin said “ millions of small businesses ” would pay higher taxes under Mr. Obama ’s tax plan , pointing to the increases for “ those making $ 250,000 a year or more . ”
Mr. Obama ’s plan would affect couples making more than $ 250,000 or singles making more than $ 200,000 .
Many small - business owners actually pay taxes as individuals , not as corporations .
But Factcheck.org cited a projection by the Urban - Brookings Tax Policy Center that 663,608 taxpayers with business income would fall into the top two tax brackets in 2009 and , therefore , be affected by the Obama tax plan .
Not all of these , however , would be properly considered “ small business owners . ”
Some are simply those who get income in from real - estate partnerships or other investment arrangements .
In other words , the actual number of small businessmen who would be affected by Obama tax plan is likely even smaller than that number , not “ millions . ”
Withdrawing Troops :
Mr. Biden described Mr. Obama ’s plan for withdrawing troops from Iraq as “ ironically , the same plan that Maliki , the prime minister of Iraq , an George Bush are now negotiating .
The only odd man out here , only one left out , is John McCain . ”
Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama are closer today in their vision ahead for Iraq than they used to be , but there are still important differences .
Mr. Obama has promised to withdraw combat forces from Iraq within 16 months of taking office , which would mean mid-2010 .
Mr. Bush , after years of resisting timetables , has signaled willingness to set a goal for withdrawing by the end of 2011 .
Mr. Bush and Nouri al - Maliki , the Iraqi prime minister , are negotiating a strategic framework for U.S. - Iraqi relations and a status of forces agreement that would govern the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq after a U.N. mandate expires at the end of this year .
Mr. Bush still maintains that any withdrawals would be “ aspirational ” and contingent on conditions on the ground .
Troop Levels :
Criticizing the Democratic candidates for their opposition to “ the surge ” in Iraq that has been one of the bedrocks of Mr. McCain ’s national security policy , Ms. Palin asserted that “ we ’re down to pre-surge numbers ” of troops in Iraq .
That statement is incorrect .
In reality , there are about 146,000 troops still serving in Iraq .
That is roughly 11,000 more than the number deployed there before the start early last year of the troop build - up that came to be known as “ the surge ”
It is true that President Bush last month announced he intends to withdraw some 8,000 combat and support troops over the next few months .
But even that withdrawal , if it were to occur at the pace and in the amount the president wants , would still leave at least 138,000 troops in Iraq , slightly above the figure before the surge began .
Iraq :
There are many substantial differences between the two tickets on Iraq policy .
Mr. McCain has been the main advocate of “ the surge ” in Iraq and Mr. Obama opposed it .
But it is definitely a stretch to say that Mr. Obama “ voted for cutting off funding for the troops ” there .
In 2007 , Mr. Obama did vote against one funding bill submitted to Congress by the White House .
But he did so because the legislation did not include any mention of a schedule to withdraw American troops , something that Mr. Obama was pushing for .
“ We must fund our troops , ” Mr. Obama said at the time .
“ But we owe them something more .
We owe them a clear , prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else ’s civil war . ”
On nearly a dozen other occasions since entering the Senate in 2005 , however , Mr. Obama has voted for bills to fund the war in Iraq .
He has done so in spite of his opposition to the war , which he made public even before the United States invaded to overthrow Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
In April 2007 , in fact , Mr. Obama voted for one such bill , which Mr. Bush vetoed because Democrats had added a non-binding call to withdraw troops from Iraq .
By that same standard , Mr. Bush also could be said to have voted not to fund the troops .
Energy Bill :
The 2005 energy bill was an issue in the first presidential debate , and Ms. Palin brought it up again , suggesting that Mr. Obama ’s vote for the bill allowed millions of dollars in tax benefits for oil companies .
“ Senator Biden , you would remember that in that energy plan that Obama voted for , that ’s what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks .
Your running mate voted for that . ”
Mr. Obama did vote for the bill , and at the time said that he favored the tax credits it included for ethanol and clean - coal facilities .
But according to a report by the Congressional Research Service , the bill eventually raised taxes on the oil industry by about $ 300 million .
Palin and Taxes :
Governor Palin said she reduced taxes when she was mayor of Wasilla , from 1996 to 2002 .
The city did eliminate property taxes , but she also pushed through a half - cent sales tax increase to pay for a $ 15 million sports complex .
That increase followed a 2 - cent sales tax initiated by her predecessor that helped the city expand its police force and pay for other new services .
Ms. Palin also said she eliminated a business inventory tax .
She did , and that move is credited with bringing many large chain stores to Wasilla .
Ms. Palin ’s tax policies have had a mixed impact on the city and received mixed reviews .
The sales tax revenues brought in from the chain stores came at a time when the area around Wasilla was one of the fastest growing regions in Alaska .
The region includes about 80,000 people , but with stores centralized in Wasilla , the sales taxes those residents spent went into Wasilla ’s coffers , enabling the city to ease property taxes on its 7,000 residents .
Many residents view the new retail options as an indicator of Wasilla having achieved a certain sophistication .
They say the city is better off with the tax revenue and they note that they no longer have to drive 45 miles to shop in Anchorage .
Others complain that Wasilla has become congested with traffic from people coming in to shop at stores like Sears , Sportsman ’s Warehouse and several strip malls that have been built in the last decades or so .
Traffic congestion is a major issue in the current race for mayor , as are questions of how to bring in higher paying jobs , rather than the service jobs that have come with the new retail businesses .
Alternative Energy Votes :
Mr. Biden attacked Mr. McCain repeatedly for voting “ 20 times ” against alternative energy , repeating a claim that Mr. Obama leveled against Mr. McCain in his debate last week .
Factcheck.org , a non-partisan group , examined this charge , going over a list of 23 votes provided by the Obama campaign , but found that the claim was misleading because many of the votes involved Mr. McCain voting against mandatory use of alternative energy , or permitting exemptions from such mandates .
The group found fewer than half of the votes cited by the Obama campaign actually involved reducing or eliminating incentives for utilizing renewable energy sources .
Taxes and Patriotism :
Borrowing a line that Mr. McCain has deployed on the campaign trail recently , Ms. Palin asserted that Mr. Biden has said that raising taxes is patriotic .
But that statement is a distortion of Mr. Biden ’s words .
In the interview on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” on Sept. 18 , to which Ms. Palin was referring , Mr. Biden said that paying taxes is patriotic , not raising them .
Kate Snow , the ABC News correspondent , had begun to ask Mr. Biden about rolling back the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , and who would effectively pay more taxes once the tax cuts expire .
“ Anyone making over $ 250,000 .. ” Ms. Snow said , before Mr. Biden jumped in .
“ Is going to pay more , ” he said .
“ It ’s time to be patriotic , time to jump in , time to be part of the deal , time to help get America out of the rut . ”
Tax Increases
In addressing the issues of taxes , Governor Palin has made claims about Senator Obama ’s policies that are not correct .
She revived , for example , an accusation that he and Mr. Biden voted “ for the largest tax increases in U.S. history ” and also charged that he would raise taxes “ for those families making only $ 42,000 a year . ”
Mr. Obama voted twice this year in favor of a budget resolution that would have allowed the tax cuts that President Bush pushed through Congress in 2001 and 2003 to expire at the end of 2010 , as the original law mandated .
But that , by the definition of the Congressional Budget Office and other tax experts , does not constitute a tax increase .
The resolution , if not accompanied by other tax changes , envisages an increase in taxes for an individual earning $ 42,000 a year who has no dependents and owns no real estate .
But it would not apply to a family .
Indeed , estimates are that a family of four making as much as $ 90,000 would not see a tax increase .
In addition , the McCain campaign months ago abandoned its argument that Mr. Obama favored a historic tax increase .
It did so after tax analysts and other economists debunked the claim , saying that nothing contemplated by either party comes anywhere near the tax increases put into effect to fight World War II .
Ms. Palin , however , revived the charge .
How Much in Tax Cuts ?
Senator Biden said that Mr. McCain was proposing $ 300 billion a year in tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals .
Mr. Obama said the same thing in the presidential debate last Friday .
The figure is based on calculations from the Obama campaign and from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center .
They looked at McCain tax proposals beyond the extension of the tax cuts passed early in the Bush administration , which cost roughly $ 110 billion a year .
The policy center said that it could not put a precise dollar figure on the McCain proposals because his tax plan is not fully detailed and it was impossible to calculate how much of the tax relief would go to middle - class and low - income taxpayers .
The Obama campaign has used the $ 300 billion figure for months , but it is based on suppositions and projections , not fact .
‘ Universal ’ Heath Care :
Ms. Palin castigated Mr. Obama ’s health care plan as one that would mandate a “ universal government - run ” system in which health care is “ taken over ” by the federal government .
This is inaccurate on several levels .
Mr. Obama ’s proposal , which he hopes will result in “ universal ” coverage in which everyone has health insurance , includes an option for people to choose a new public plan with benefits similar to what members of Congress and other federal employees currently have .
It also includes an expansion of Medicaid and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , but it is not at all exclusively government - run .
It preserves the existing employer - based health insurance system , offering subsidies or tax credits to help those who cannot afford premiums .
Mr. Obama ’s plan also only mandates that children , not adults , have coverage .
Warning Bell :
Gov. Sarah Palin boasted that Mr. McCain “ sounded that warning bell ” about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , echoing some of Mr. McCain ’s recent comments in which he portrayed himself as being on the vanguard in warning about the impending financial crisis .
Ms. Palin was referring to Mr. McCain ’s decision in 2006 to sign on as a co-sponsor of a Senate bill that would have overhauled regulations governing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
But the legislation was introduced more than 16 months earlier and the debate over the issue had been going on for some time .
He also only added his name after an oversight agency issued a lengthy report condemning practices at Fannie Mae .
Republican donors and activists are understandably pissed off :
This sort of spending is without precedent -- the closest approximation for any campaign I 've ever covered is make - up expenses for television interviews and commercial shoots -- and Schmidt 's weakly defensive response tonight indicates that the campaign is deeply embarrassed by it and has nothing to say in their defense .
Spokespeople have clammed up , a sure sign that they 're trying to figure out who authorized the expenses and who knew about them .
Did Palin wear all of the clothing ?

Courts Rule Against Republican Schemes to Keep Voters from Voting in WI , OH , NV ...

Guest blogged by Steven Rosenfeld of AlterNet
Republican Party efforts to stop thousands of voters from casting meaningful ballots in 2008 because their registration information does not match government databases with high error rates was set back by legal rulings in Wisconsin , Ohio and Nevada on Thursday .
In Wisconsin , a judge threw out a lawsuit by the state Attorney General , who also is the McCain campaign co-chair .
In Ohio and Nevada , each state 's top election official issued an order or opinion rejecting such ' no - match ' voter challenges .
While Republican officials criticized these moves , it appears that momentum is building against GOP efforts to use ambiguities in voter registration laws to challenge large numbers of 2008 voters ...
The federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 instructs states to use Social Security and driver 's license databases to verify registrations , but leaves it up to states to decide how to specifically do that .
That ambiguity has been the backdrop of the GOP 's assertions that states must segregate problem voter registrations , treating them as a separate class of ballots .
But , so far , most state and federal courts have rejected the Republican 's legal arguments ...
Wisconsin
In Wisconsin , Dane County Circuit Judge Maryann Sumi ruled that Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen , a Republican and McCain - Palin campaign co-chair , did not have the legal authority to bring a suit demanding the state 's election board re-certify thousands of registrations before Election Day if they did not match other government databases .
Sumi said no violation of state or federal law was poised to occur .
Instead , she said the proper way for the no-match issue to be handled was to go through established state law - where the matter would have been taken up by the very state board that Van Hollen sued , Wisconsin 's Government Accountability Board .
Van Hollen issued a statement saying he would appeal .
" We can not lose sight of the goal of this lawsuit , " he said .
" Wisconsin needs an accurate statewide voter list .
Wisconsin needs to comply with state and federal laws designed to protect the right to vote .
Looking the other way is not an option . "
Ohio
In Ohio , Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat and former judge , Thursday issued a directive telling local election officials that they cannot stop a person from voting on Nov. 4 if their individual voter registration did not match these two government databases .
Brunner 's directive , which has the force of law , comes after Ohio Republicans lost on this issue in a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court , and also withdrew a similar lawsuit at the state Supreme Court .
Brunner instructed Ohio's 88 county election boards to reject any voter challenges based on database mismatches .
In September , she issued another directive narrowing the circumstances under which a political party could challenge voters at their polling places .
Brunner has said she wants to see as many voters as possible vote without incident on Election Day .
" This Directive clarifies that judges of elections ( poll workers ) may not challenge a voter on Election Day based solely on the fact that the person offering to vote has been the subject of a data discrepancy between computer records maintained by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles ( including data originally obtained from the Social Security Administration database ) and information provided by the person on his or her voter registration application , " the directive , 2008 - 99 , said .
Brunner 's order explained why the no-match standard could disenfranchise legal voters .
" The information used to " match " a registrant with preexisting databases often results in a data discrepancy or " non-match " based on circumstances as common as a data entry error or a blank field for last four digits of a social security number when a match has already been attained with the provided driver 's license number .
In addition , Ohio driver 's licenses contain a number located above the picture that is often mistaken for the driver 's license number . "
The Ohio secretary said there was no requirement in Ohio law that forced election officials to give voters with " no- match " problems a provisional ballot , which would have be verified before counting .
The Ohio Republican Party 's suit before the state Supreme Court sought that remedy .
" A copy of this directive must be included in the poll worker packets distributed to all poll workers , " her order said .
The Ohio Republican Party responded to Brunner 's directive by belittling her election administration efforts .
" This is the same mismatch information Brunner has so far failed to provide to county election administrators , " said Ohio Republican Party Deputy Chairman Kevin DeWine , in a press release .
" At this point she 's telling elections officials what to do with information she has n't even provided them .
Until she releases the 200,000 questionable registrations on file in her office , this directive is worthless . "
Nevada
In Nevada , Secretary of State Ross Miller has rejected an assertion by the state 's Republican Party Chair Sue Lowden that voters should not be able to correct voter registration information at polling places .
She argued in a letter to Miller that the close of voter registration before Election Day precluded that option , saying affected voters should be given provisional ballots .
Miller 's response rejected Lowden 's contention , saying " Nevada law provides the manner in which an in - person and mail - in applicant may update or correct the voter information , and may do so without losing his right to vote . "
While the developments in Wisconsin , Ohio and Nevada may bode well for accommodating voters in a high - turnout election , the fights concerning whose votes will count on Election Day are far from over .
Other States
On the database matching issue , the Pennsylvania Republican Party has also filed a suit seeking to have ' no - match ' registrations treated differently .
And in New Mexico , another swing state , the American Civil Liberties Union has asked the state Attorney General to investigate concerns that the Bernalillo County Clerk 's Office may have given private voter registration information to the Republican Party .
That information could " make its way into the hands of people who want to influence their vote or intimidate them into not voting at all , " the ACLU of New Mexico said in its press release .

The group formed in 1977 after Watson , one of the founders of Greenpeace , became frustrated with the seminal environmental group ’s hesitation to engage in direct action .
Since then the group has faced down whalers year - after - year by literally chasing their ships around the open seas .
Unlike most direct action activism , Watson insists that Sea Shepherd ’s anti-whaling campaigns are entirely legal .
He cites international treaties under the International Whaling Commission that state that any human has the right to interfere with illegal poaching or whaling .
While the laws exist , Watson says that Sea Shepherd are the only ones enforcing them .
He has been arrested numerous times across the globe but has never been convicted of any wrongdoing .[ social_buttons ]

RICHMOND , Virginia ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama said on Wednesday the United States must be vigilant against attack during the transition to a new president , no matter whether he or Republican rival John McCain wins the November 4 White House race .
With less than two weeks until the election , McCain focused on the economy , the No. 1 issue for most voters , and criticized Obama for having “ skewed ” economic priorities .
Both candidates welcomed a White House announcement that the United States will host an international summit to talk about global economic turmoil beginning on November 15 .
Although the economy has been driving the campaign , Obama took time out to rebut McCain ’s criticism of Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden for predicting an Obama administration would face a major international challenge as a test within six months of taking office .
At a news conference in which he admitted “ Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes , ” Obama cautioned that whoever replaces President George W. Bush will face threats and tests , in part because of Bush ’s “ bad set of policies ” that resulted in two unresolved wars and an “ economy in free fall . ”
“ A period of transition to a new administration is always one in which we have to be vigilant , ” Obama said .
“ We have to be careful , we have to be mindful that as we pass the baton in this democracy , that others do n’t take advantage of it .
That is true whether it ’s myself or Senator McCain . ”
But McCain ’s campaign , which repeatedly has blasted the 47 - year - old Obama as being unready to be president , rejected the explanation .
“ Joe Biden guaranteed a generated international crisis if Barack Obama is elected , and a smile - for - the - cameras press conference is n’t going to mitigate the risk of an Obama presidency , ” said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
MCCAIN TALKS TAXES , OBAMA EXPANDS LEAD
The foray into foreign policy was a change from Obama ’s emphasis on the economy , an issue that has helped him move ahead in the polls .
In a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Wednesday Obama expanded his lead over McCain to 10 points .
At a campaign event in New Hampshire , McCain hammered Obama ’s tax plan as simply a way to redistribute wealth .
“ Before government can redistribute wealth , it has to confiscate wealth from those who earned it , ” he said .
“ Whatever the right word is for that way of thinking , the redistribution of wealth is the last thing America needs right now . ”
“ What are really skewed in all of this are my opponent ’s priorities .
He talks about our economy in a detached and academic way , forgetting that the goal is not to redistribute wealth but to create it , ” he said to applause .

Obama defended his plan for a middle class tax cut .
“ The difference is , he wants to give a $ 700,000 tax cut to the average Fortune 500 CEO .
I want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of 95 % of workers and their families , ” Obama said at a rally in Richmond .
“ My opponent does n’t want you to know this , but under my plan , tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan , ” Obama added .
Slideshow ( 30 images )
Where the candidates were campaigning said a lot about the state of the race late into the campaign .
With less than two weeks to go , Obama was in Virginia with a chance to win that state for a Democrat for the first time since 1964 and McCain was in a New Hampshire , a small state but one the Republicans need as the number of winnable alternatives dwindles .
The Republican later joined his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , for a joint rally in Ohio , a hotly contested state .
Palin referred to Obama as “ Barack - the - wealth - spreader ” and said he was not being candid about his tax plans .
“ We want to keep more American money in America , ” she told a crowd of thousands in Green , Ohio , repeating McCain ’s promises to cut the capital gains tax and business tax rates .
Though McCain needled Obama for being overconfident , Obama warned supporters who packed a hockey arena to see him against premature celebration .
“ I need you to make it happen , ” he told the chanting crowd of more than 12,000 .
“ I ask you to knock on some doors , make some calls , talk to your neighbors , and give me your vote . ”
Researchers have shown that they can create entirely new strains of infectious proteins known as prions in the laboratory by simply mixing infectious prions from one species with the normal prion proteins of another species .
Prion diseases , also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) , are infectious neurodegenerative diseases affecting the brain of several species of mammals including humans .
Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) is the most common prion disease in humans , along with scrapie in sheep , bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE , aka mad cow ) in cattle , and chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) in deer and other cervids .
Unlike conventional infectious microorganisms , the infectious agent in the case of prion diseases consists exclusively of a misfolded form of the prion protein , earlier studies showed .
The researchers now find that prion strains produced by combining normal hamster proteins with infectious mouse proteins can infect hamsters and vice versa .
Although they are both rodents , prions from one of the two species normally do n't readily infect the other , a common phenomenon amongst prions known as a species barrier , the researchers explained .
The novel prions they produced not only look different , but they also produce symptoms in the animals that differ from any known strain found in nature , they report .
" We are forcing the system by putting everything together , but this suggests that the variety of possible prions is really very large , " said Claudio Soto of the University of Texas Medical Branch .
" We should n't be surprised if new barriers are crossed and new prions arise .
There is the potential for a large variety of new infectious prions — some of which may have dramatic effects . "
" The infectous agent is nothing like what we 're used to , " Soto said .
" It 's just a protein with a different shape from the normal protein we all have . "
Those misfolded and misshapen proteins can spread by causing normal protein to change their shape .
Those aberrant forms band together , forming fibrils .

The findings are reported in the September 5th issue of the journal Cell , a Cell Press publication .
Soto 's team recently reported the generation of infectious prions by amplification of prion misfolding in the test tube .
In those experiments , they used a technology called protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( PMCA ) that mimics some of the fundamental steps involved in the replication of infectious prions in living animals , but at an accelerated rate .
The method involves placing small quantities of infectious prions with large quantities of the normal protein from the same species together , allowing the infectious form to imprint on the normal form and thereby replicate itself .
Now , they show that the same method can generate new strains when infectious prions from one species are mixed with normal prion proteins from another species .
The finding provides conclusive evidence that the imprinting of disease - causing prions on normal forms can overcome species barriers , and does n't require any other infectious agent .
This new insight has profound implications for public health , according to the researchers .
" One of the scariest medical problems of the last decades has been the emergence of a new and fatal human prion disease -- variant CJD - - originated by cross-species transmission of BSE from cattle , " the researchers said .
BSE has also spread to other animals , including exotic cats , other primates and domestic cats , after they ate feed derived from diseased cows .
advertisement
The new method might provide insight into the risk that other prion diseases could spread from one species to another , Soto said .
For instance , scientists do n't know whether chronic wasting disease , a condition now on the rise amongst deer in some parts of the U.S. , can be transmitted to humans or not .
Test tube studies like this one might help answer that question , and -- in the case that the deer prions can make the leap — such studies may inform scientists about what those prions might look like , he said .
By studying any new prion strains created in mice with the human prion protein , scientists might also gain insight into the potential symptoms associated with those diseases .
" The data demonstrate that PMCA is a valuable tool for the investigation of the strength of the barrier between diverse species , its molecular determinants , and the expected features of the new infectious material produced , " the researchers concluded .
" Finally , our findings suggest that the universe of possible prions is not restricted to those currently known but that likely many unique infectious foldings of the prion protein may be produced and that one of the sources for this is cross-species transmission . "
The researchers include Joaquin Castilla , University of Texas Medical Branch , Galveston , TX ; Dennisse Gonzalez - Romero , University of Texas Medical Branch , Galveston , TX ; Paula Saa , University of Texas Medical Branch , Galveston , TX , Universidad Autonoma de Madrid , Madrid , Spain ; Rodrigo Morales , University of Texas Medical Branch , Galveston , TX , University of Chile , Santiago , Chile ; Jorge De Castro , University of Texas Medical Branch , Galveston , TX ; and Claudio Soto , University of Texas Medical Branch , Galveston , TX .
( CNN ) -- Public school officials in Chicago , Illinois , are recommending approval of a " gay- friendly " high school because harassment and violence are causing gay students to skip class and drop out at alarming rates .
School officials say the proposed school would offer a welcoming , harassment - free environment for gay students .
The School for Social Justice Pride Campus , which officials say will not be exclusive to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students , is aimed at being safe and welcoming for any student looking for another school option , said Josh Edelman , executive officer in the Chicago Public Schools ' Office of New Schools .
" It is not going to be a ' gay high school , ' but yes , in a way , it is meant to target kids who feel they have been victims of bullying for their sexual orientation or perceived orientation , " Edelman said .
Chicago Public Schools CEO
Arne Duncan announced his recommendation Wednesday .
Officials said Pride Campus would be separate physically but be attached administratively to the School for Social Justice .
School officials said the standards and curriculum for the school would be in line with other schools in the district .
The school would also offer counseling for students , though because of federal laws , officials cannot ask students about their sexual orientation .
The curriculum would not rely on , but would incorporate lessons about , sexual identity in history and literature classes , officials said .
" It 's about creating another option for kids , " Edelman said .
" When it comes down to it , though , it is all about having a choice and providing high - quality options for students , whether they are gay or not . "
The school could be a lifeline for students who are struggling for academic success .

Gay and lesbian students are three times more likely to miss school because they feel unsafe , according to a 2003 Chicago Public School District survey .
And a study released Wednesday by the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network showed similar trends across the country .
Is this the best solution ? »
The national study , which the group says is the most comprehensive report ever on the experiences of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students nationwide , found that 86.2 percent of those students reported being verbally harassed , 44.1 percent physically harassed and 22.1 percent physically assaulted at school in the past year because of their sexual orientation .
This harassment , the study concludes , has affected students ' ability to achieve success in school , causing their grade - point level to be , on average , half a point lower than that of heterosexual students nationwide .
Dropout levels are higher among lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students because of more frequent truancy , the study found .
Almost 32 percent of those students missed a class because of feeling unsafe , compared with only 5.5 percent of heterosexual students nationwide , the study said .
Truancy and lower grades are n't the only repercussions of anti-gay sentiments in schools , said Kevin Jennings , the founder and executive director of GLSEN .
He cited the killing of Lawrence King , a 15 - year - old student shot by a classmate in Oxnard , California , in February after King asked to be his valentine .
Jennings said the repercussions of harassment alone underscore the need for Pride Campus .
" If we keep doing nothing , we are going to keep getting these horrifying levels of harassment , greater rates of skipping , not going to college and more tragic violence like the murder of Lawrence King , " he said .
" Those are our choices .
We can continue to do nothing , and we know the results , or we can save young people 's lives and offer them an education and a future . "
A similar school in New York , the Harvey Milk High School in the East Village , was created because of similar fears .
The school , which had been around since 1985 , serving gay and lesbian students , expanded to a " gay - themed " school for 100 students in 2003 .
The Pride Campus is expected to serve 600 students , school officials said .
Harvey Milk High School , like the Pride Campus , is open to all students regardless of sexual orientation .
But unlike the proposed school in Chicago , Harvey Milk requires its attendees to be at risk of dropping out because of harassment .
Harvey Milk boasts a graduation rate of 95 percent of its students -- all of whom were at risk of or had dropped out -- well above the city average of 52 percent .
When the school opened its doors , protesters , led by anti-gay Kansas minister Fred Phelps , screamed at supporters gathered outside to repent for their " sodomite behavior . "
Edelman said that while some concerns have been raised about Pride Campus at community meetings , officials have not heard any large - scale opposition .
One Chicago resident said at a meeting that he could not support the school because of his religious beliefs , Edelman said .
Others told local media they did n't support the use of public money to create the school .
Some thought that if gay students went to the Pride Campus , students in other schools would not learn to accept the gay community .
Instead , they suggested , the focus should be working toward acceptance in all schools .
" Absolutely , we should work for [ acceptance ] across the board , " said Jennings , the GLSEN executive director .
" But it 's not going to change overnight , and in the meantime , these kids are n't going to graduate . "
Jennings said that GLSEN research shows acceptance among peers is helped by having a lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender support group at school .
The most important factor , according to the GLSEN study , is the existence of a state law that protects students from harassment based on their sexual orientation .
Thirty - nine states , including Illinois and New York , do not have laws offering that specific protection , Jennings said citing the GLSEN study .
Some have laws , but they do n't specify on what basis the protections apply , which Jennings said was essentially as effective as having no law at all .
California , Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Jersey , Vermont , Washington and Wisconsin are the only states with specific sexual orientation protections for students .
The Chicago School Board will vote October 22 to approve the School for Social Justice Pride Campus in addition to 17 other proposed schools .
As far as Jennings is concerned , the school board 's choice is an easy one .
" The choice they are making is not should we have this kind of school , " he said .
" The question is ' Are we going to do anything we can to get these kids an education ? '
And there 's only one right answer -- yes . "

Many people think that it is just plug and play system and you only have to just ask for a web hosting Australia service to offer an SSL and you are done and you will be seeing the HTTPS in your website address .
It is not like that .
In Australia , virtual private servers , or vps and dedicated servers offered by web hosting service providers .
They offer vps Australia or dedicated servers depending on the kind of service the website needs or the client 's request as well .
They offer the perfects services to make sure that there are no flaws and no problems when the site goes live online .
But the fact is that people may not know the most reliable and easiest way to complete the proper process in a way that the hosting and SSL is completed in no time .
You just have to follow up the following things :
You have to complete the first step as you will not be able to proceed until and unless you get your domain registered .
Get it registered to the service provider that offers SSL as well so that you will not have to worry about purchasing from the third party .
Make sure to select the most suitable hosting to allow your website function properly .
This is only possible when you get your website to the hosting plan that is capable to support your website functions and features and manage the traffic easily .
You will need to decide on the kind of SSL you need and the amount of security features provided to support the website .
It is important and should be selected very carefully .
Next comes the code and you have to do it carefully as well so that SSL is issues without any error .
After all these steps you site will be ready to work as an SSL secure website online .
Yet tolerance by itself is not what distinguishes the cosmopolitan from the neofundamentalist .
There are plenty of things that the heroes of radical Islam are happy to tolerate .
They do n't care if you eat kebabs or meatballs or kung pao chicken , as long as the meat is halal ; your hijab can be silk or linen or viscose .
At the same time , there are plenty of things that cosmopolitans will not tolerate .
We will sometimes want to intervene in other places because what is going on there violates our principles so deeply .
We , too , can see moral error .
And when it is serious enough -- genocide is the least - controversial case -- we will not stop with conversation .
Toleration has its limits .
Nor can you tell us apart by saying that the neofundamentalists believe in universal truth .
Cosmopolitans believe in universal truth , too , though we are less certain that we already have all of it .
It is not skepticism about the very idea of truth that guides us ; it is realism about how hard the truth is to find .
One tenet we hold to , however , is that every human being has obligations to every other .
Everybody matters : that is our central idea .
And again , it sharply limits the scope of our tolerance .
To say what , in principle , distinguishes the cosmopolitan from competing universalisms , we plainly need to go beyond talk of truth and tolerance .
One distinctively cosmopolitan commitment is to pluralism .
Cosmopolitans think that there are many values worth living by and that you cannot live by all of them .
So we hope and expect that different people and different societies will embody different values .
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is what philosophers call fallibilism -- the sense that our knowledge is imperfect , provisional , subject to revision in the face of new evidence .
The neofundamentalist conception of a global ummah , by contrast , admits of local variations -- but only in matters that do n't matter .
These counter - cosmopolitans , like many Christian fundamentalists , do think that there is one right way for all human beings to live ; that all the differences must be in the details .
If what concerns you is global homogeneity , then this utopia , not the world that capitalism is producing , is the one you should worry about .
Still , the universalisms in the name of religion are hardly the only ones that invert the cosmopolitan creed .
In the name of universal humanity , you can be the kind of Marxist , like Mao or Pol Pot , who wants to eradicate all religion , just as easily as you can be the Grand Inquisitor supervising an auto - da - fé .
All of these men want everyone on their side , so we can share with them the vision in their mirror .
" Indeed , I 'm a trustworthy adviser to you , " Osama bin Laden said in a 2002 " message to the American people . "
" I invite you to the happiness of this world and the hereafter and to escape your dry , miserable , materialistic life that is without soul .
I invite you to Islam , that calls to follow of the path of Allah alone
Who has no partners , the path which calls for justice and forbids oppression and crimes . "
Join us , the counter - cosmopolitans say , and we will all be sisters and brothers .
But each of them plans to trample on our differences -- to trample us to death , if necessary -- if we will not join them .
Their motto might as well be the sardonic German saying Und willst du nicht mein Bruder sein , So schlag ' ich Dir den Schädel ein .
( If you do n't want to be my brother , then I 'll smash your skull in . )
That liberal pluralists are hostile to certain authoritarian ways of life -- that they 're intolerant of radical intolerance -- is sometimes seen as kind of self - refutation .
That 's a mistake : you can care about individual freedom and still understand that the contours of that freedom will vary considerably from place to place .
But we might as well admit that a concern for individual freedom is n't something that will appeal to every individual .
In politics , including cultural politics , there are winners and losers -- which is worth remembering when we think about international human rights treaties .
When we seek to embody our concern for strangers in human rights law , and when we urge our government to enforce it , we are seeking to change the world of law in every nation on the planet .
We have declared slavery a violation of international law .
And , in so doing , we have committed ourselves , at a minimum , to the desirability of its eradication everywhere .
This is no longer controversial in the capitals of the world .
No one defends enslavement .
But international treaties define slavery in ways that arguably include debt bondage , and debt bondage is a significant economic institution in parts of South Asia .
I hold no brief for debt bondage .
Still , we should n't be surprised if people whose incomes and style of life depend upon it are angry .
It 's the same with the international movements to promote women 's equality .
We know that many Islamists are deeply disturbed by the way Western men and women behave .
We permit women to swim almost naked with strange men , which is our business , but it is hard to keep the news of these acts of immodesty from Muslim women and children or to protect Muslim men from the temptations they inevitably create .
As the Internet extends its reach , it will get even harder , and their children , especially their girls , will be tempted to ask for these freedoms , too .
Worse , they say , we are now trying to force our conception of how women and men should behave upon them .
We speak of women 's rights .
We make treaties enshrining these rights .
And then we want their governments to enforce them .
Like many people in every nation , I support those treaties ; I believe that women , like men , should have the vote , should be entitled to work outside their homes , should be protected from the physical abuse of men , including their fathers , brothers and husbands .
But I also know that the changes these freedoms would bring will change the balance of power between men and women in everyday life .
How do I know this ?
Because I have lived most of my adult life in the West as it has gone through just such a transition , and I know that the process is not yet complete .
In my previous post about Meta - Programming with Scala I suspected that there was no way to express partial function application in Scala ’s type system .
However Matt Hellige proofed me wrong in his comment .
His solution uses a trait for partially applying a function to some of its arguments .
An abstract type exposed by the trait represents the resulting function which takes the remaining arguments .
object Partial { // Partial application of f2 to x trait papply [ f2 [ _ , _ ] , x ] { type f1 [y ] = f2[ x , y ] } // apply f to x type apply [ f[ _ ] , x ] = f[x ] trait X trait Y trait F[ A1 , A2 ] //
Test whether applying the partial application of // F to X to Y equals in the type F [ X , Y ] case class Equals [ A >: B <: B , B ] Equals [ apply [ papply [ F , X ] # f1 , Y ] , F [ X , Y ] ] } [ / sourcecode ] < p >
Having this solved we can define a type which encodes < a href = " https://michid.wordpress.com/2008/07/30/meta-programming-with-scala-part-ii-multiplication/ ">multiplication on the Church Numerals </a >. </ p> trait curry [ n [ _[ _ ] , _ ] , s[_ ] ] { type f[z ] = n[s , z ] } // Multiplication for this encoding type mult [ m [ _[ _ ] , _ ] , n[ _[_ ] , _ ] , s[_ ] , z ] = m[ curry [n , s ] #f , z ]
A full working example is available from my code page .
Note , the code takes forever ( i.e. some minutes ) to compile .
Matt also noted an issue with squares .
With my version of the compiler ( Ecipse plugin 2.7.2.r15874-b20080821120313 ) the issue does not show up however .
Malcolm Fraser was ridiculed high and low for saying : " Life was n't meant to be easy . "
His comment summed up what Aboriginal people have always found most alien about European society : the Protestant work ethic ; the idea that life is supposed to be a struggle to survive to appease those dangerous fools above you in the socio-economic hierarchy .
The Kombumerri intellectual and elder , Aunty Mary Graham , says : " One of the worst things that whitefellas did … was n't murders and rapes and the theft of land , bad as those things were .
The worst thing was that they brought this terrible idea … that life was about survival ; about being a convict or a soldier , ' battling ' the land and just making it from day - to - day , and they have infected our people with this awful idea . "
From a coastal Aboriginal viewpoint , life is most definitely meant to be easy .
When barramundi and wallaby and oysters abound and the weather is warm , there is no logical reason to work more than two or three hours a day .
In coastal Australia , Aborigines enjoyed the good life for tens of thousands of years while the poor in Europe starved .
Vast numbers of current and former Goldman executives shared their stories with Ellis , a level of access that both helped and hurt .
The book is rich with insider lore , as well as the closed - door dramas of partnership clashes .
But outsiders ’ voices are disappointingly faint .
And some minor episodes , like the buildup of Goldman ’s corporate bond business in the ’ 70s , take far too long to unfold , as each participant gets to reminisce .
Ellis writes as a Wall Street loyalist .
He ran Greenwich Associates for 30 years , providing research and consulting to securities firms , including Goldman Sachs .
That experience graced him with a sure hand in writing about the world of traders , analysts and deal makers .
But it makes it harder for him to put Wall Street ’s great moneymaking abilities into a broader context — either as a key part of American progress or just an unwelcome form of profiteering .
The book nods briefly to the ways that Goldman officials shuttle into powerful government jobs .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson used to run Goldman ; so , too , did former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead .
More insights on this pathway would have been welcome .
Ellis does point out a fascinating quirk in tax law : wealthy political appointees who put their assets into blind trusts need n’t pay capital gains taxes on any sales .
So public service is n’t always a low - paying sacrifice ; it can also help outwit the tax man .
Ellis estimates Paulson could have saved as much as $ 200 million this way .
The financial crises of 2007 - 8 win only a few pages of notice at the end of the book .
Goldman ’s earnings and stock price have sagged , but the firm remains profitable , which is more than some of its now - ­extinct rivals can say .
Ellis suggests that ’s no accident .
As he tells it , Goldman largely cleared its portfolios of mortgage troubles in April 2007 , acting far faster than other firms , some of which keep struggling to extricate themselves from ill - advised loans .
Instead of suffering helplessly as mortgage values declined , Goldman switched tack and earned as much as $ 1 billion in a quarter by betting on a further drop in mortgage - index values .
Nimble trading , indeed .
Despite the wealth of gadgets that are " credit card sized " , there 's no reason an actual credit card has to have the same form factor , especially if you do n't need to swipe it through a machine to read it .
BMW has noticed this and is building contact - less payment systems into its car keys .
The prototype is " the world ’s first multifunctional car key " ( I guess they never used a key to open a beer ) and uses the SmartMX chip from NXP .
The obvious use is for paying road tolls as you drive , but BMW 's bofffins see the keys being loaded up with public transport tickets ( think Park and Ride schemes ) and re-registering the actual key part with other cars for rental purposes .
The irony is that , as the " key " does n't actually fit into a hole to start the car , it could in fact be shaped like a credit card .
The strength of BMW 's system is that it can be read from afar , making in - car payments easy .
But that is also the weakness .
We like the whole reprogrammable key idea , but do we need it to keep our money ( metaphorically ) inside ?
A real credit card sits safely in your pocket and can't be hacked from afar .
However " secure " the smart key is claimed to be , there will always be a way to hack the system .
Happily , it also puts a whole new slant on our favorite after party game .
Now , when we throw our keys into the middle of the room and pick another set at random , we wo n't just be going home to sleep with the owner 's wife .
We 'll also get to spend his money .
Press release [ NXP .

Peridot is usually pronounced as pair - uh - doe and it ’s an array of olivine ( not a certified mineral ) that is consisted of two minerals known as fayalite and forsterite .
Fayalite ( Fe2Si04 ) is iron rich while forsterite ( Mg2Sio4 ) is a manganese rich mineral .
To show the exchange of magnesium and iron ; olivine is chemically formulated as ( Mg , Fe ) 2Sio4 .
Though iron serves as a coloring agent for Peridot , yet in composition Peridot is often nearer to forsterite instead of fayalite .
A peridot , which has less than 15 % of iron and has some trace elements like nickel and chromium , is considered the best in color .
A large number of gemstones that have a mineral origin form in the crust of the earth .
But peridot and diamond are two such elements as form deeper in the earth and this deeper region is known as mantle .
Peridot crystals are found 20 to 55 miles deeper and they pop up on the surface due to tectonic or volcanic activity .
Similarly , diamonds form around 100 - 150 miles below the surface where temperatures and pressures are extreme .
There are only few gemstones that come in one color and Peridot is one of them .
The deep effects of green color depend on iron composition in crystal formation and it also fluctuates from yellow - green to olive and brownish - green .
Peridot is also called poor man ’s emerald .
No doubt , olivine is abundantly found mineral but still gemy peridot is rare in fact .
Peridots are abundantly found in Burma , Pakistan , China , Vietnam , and the U.S.
The finest quality of Peridot is found in Burma and Pakistan while the U.S is considered the largest producer of peridot in the world .
A large part of American peridot comes from the deposits of Arizona .
A locality known as Peridot Mesa , which is situated on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation east of Globe in Gila County , is considered the largest productive locality of peridot all around the globe .
Almost 80 to 90 percent of peridot in the world is produced by San Carlos Reservation .
The largest cut peridot has been found as weighed around 310 carats and placed in Washington D.C. at Smithsonian .
Similarly in the Diamond treasury Moscow there is a 192.75 carat peridot that belongs to czars .
A 146 carat peridot is found in the geological Museum in the city of London .
When it is small in sizes , it is considered relatively less expensive gemstone but its value considerably increases if the stone is over 5 carats .
Peridot with 10 - 15 carats weight is rare and that ’s why quite expensive .
Peridot is always counted an untreated gem as there is n’t any known treatment that is used to enhance color or clarity of peridot .
People born in the month of August must regard peridot as it ’s birthstone for this month .

One of the most surprising things I ’ve ever read about Scala came in the form of a ( mostly positive ) review article .
This article went to some lengths comparing Scala to Java , JRuby on Groovy , discussing many of its advantages and disadvantages relative to those languages .
Everyone seems to be writing articles to this effect these days , so the comparison in and of itself was not surprising .
What was interesting was an off - hand comment discussing Scala ’s “ dynamic typing ” and how it aids in the development of domain specific languages .
Now this article had just finished a long - winded presentation of type inference and compilation steps , so I ’m quite certain that the author was aware of Scala ’s type system .
The more likely target of the “ dynamic typing ” remark would be Scala ’s implicit conversions mechanism .
I have heard this language feature described many times as being a way of “ dynamically ” adding members to an existing class .
While it would be incorrect to say that this feature constitutes a dynamic type system , it is true that it may be used to satisfy many of the same design patterns .
Consider the facetious example of a string “ reduction ” method , one which produces an acronym based on the upper - case characters within the string :
val acronym = " Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer " .
reduce println ( acronym ) // MCSE
The immediate problem with this snippet is the fact that string literals are of type java.lang .
String , a class which comes pre-defined by the language .
The only way to ensure that the above syntax works properly is to “ add ” the reduce method to the String class separate from its definition .
In a language such as Ruby or Groovy which have dynamic type systems , we could simply open the class definition and add a new method at runtime .
However , in Scala we have to be a bit more tricky .
We ca n’t actually add methods to an existing class , but we can define a new class which contains the desired method .
Once we have that , we can define an implicit conversion from our target class to our new class .
The Scala compiler sees this and performs the appropriate magic behind the scenes .
In code , it looks like this :
class MyRichString ( str : String ) { def reduce = str. toCharArray .
foldLeft ( " " ) { ( t , c ) => t + ( if ( c. isUpperCase ) c. toString else " " ) } } implicit def str2MyRichString ( str : String ) = new MyRichString ( str )
This contrasts quite dramatically with the Ruby implementation of the same concept via open classes ( somewhat less - graciously known as “ Monkey Patching ” ) :
class
String def reduce arr = unpack ( ' c * ' ) . select { |c| ( 65 .. 90 ) . include ? c } arr. pack ' c * ' end end puts ' HyperText Transfer Protocol ' .
reduce # HTTP
No visible type conversion is taking place here , all we did is add a method to an existing class and trust that the runtime can figure out the rest .
Indeed , for this application , we do n’t really need anything else .
However , as anyone with experience implementing internal domain - specific languages will tell you , seldom is life as simple as adding a few methods to an existing class .
Consider a more complicated scenario where we need to overload the < operator on integers to operate on String values , returning true if the length of the string is less than the integer value , otherwise false .
In Scala , we would once again make use of the implicit conversion mechanism , this time with an even more concise syntax :
implicit def lessThanOverload ( i : Int ) = new { def < ( str : String ) = str. length < i }
In fact , we do n't even need to go this far .
It is possible to create an implicit conversion from String to Int defined on the length of the String .
This would allow existing method implementations within the Int class to operate upon String values :
implicit def str2Int ( str : String ) = str. length
As a matter of interest , this particular situation can be managed by one of the most convoluted and verbose languages on the market , C ++:
bool operator< ( const int &i , const std : : string &str ) { return str. length ( ) < i ; }
Despite the seemingly - dynamic nature of the problem , the statically typed language camp seems well represented in terms of solutions .
Ironically , this sort of problem is one which will be exceedingly difficult to solve in a language like Ruby .
This is primarily because method overloading is an innately static device .
That 's not to say that overloading is impossible in a dynamically typed language ( Groovy ) , but it 's not easy .
To see why , let 's consider the most natural implementation of our operator problem in Ruby :
class Fixnum def < ( str ) str. size < self end end
Intuitively , this may seem like the right way to approach the problem , but the results of such an implementation would be disastrous .
At the very least , the first time anyone attempted to perform a < comparison targeting an integer , the interpreter will overflow the call stack .
In fact , any time any code uses the less - than operator on an instance of Fixnum , the interpreter will crash .
The reason for this is the invocation of < upon str.size within our " overloaded " definition .
This call creates a very tight recursive loop which will very quickly eat through all available stack frames .
We can avoid this problem by reversing the comparison like so :
class Fixnum def < ( str ) self >= str. size end end
Now we do n't have to worry about stack overflow , but in the process we have accidentally redefined integer - to - integer comparison in a very strange way :
irb ( main ) : 006:0 > 123 < ' test ' => true irb( main ) : 007:0 >
123 < 123 => true
Clearly , more effort is going to be required if we are to put to rest our little dilemma .
As it turns out , the final solution is surprisingly ugly and verbose :
class Fixnum alias_method :__old_less_than__ , ' <' . to_sym def < ( target ) if target .
kind_of ?
String __old_less_than__ target . size else __old_less_than__ target end end end
Whatever happened to Ruby as a " more elegant " language ?
The unfortunate truth is that in order to emulate method overloading based on input type , we must hold onto the old method implementation while we implement a type - sensitive facade in its place .
The alias_method invocation literally copies the old less - than operator implementation and provides us with a way of referencing it within our later redefinition .
And what happens if someone else happens to monkey patch Fixnum and ( for whatever reason ) uses the identifier " __old_less_than__ " ?
Well , then we have problems .
It 's like the old days of Lisp macros and endless identifier collisions .
It is true that this was an example specifically contrived to make Ruby look bad .
I could have implemented the overload using Groovy 's meta-classes and been reasonably certain that everything would work out fine , but that 's not the point .
The point is that there are a surprising number of situations where static typing serves not only to check for errors but also to allow extension patterns which would be otherwise impossible ( or very , very difficult ) .
Dynamic typing is n't the panacea of extensibility that its proponents make it out to be , sometimes it is n't quite up to the task .
In fact ( and this is where we come to my Digg - friendly point ) , I would submit that Scala ( and to a lesser extent , C++ ) have created a mechanism for controlled extensibility which is more powerful than Ruby 's open classes design .
That 's not to say that there are n't situations which are easily solved using open classes and entirely intractable using only implicit conversions , but in my experience these scenarios are very rare .
In fact , I believe that it is far more common to run against a problem like my contrived overload which is greatly simplified through the use of static typing .
Ironically enough , some of Ruby 's greatest pundits are starting to come around to the belief that a more controlled and well - defined model of class extension is required .
ParseTree is a Ruby framework which provides mechanisms for dynamically manipulating the AST of an expression prior to evaluation .
Conceptually , it is very similar to Lisp 's macros and peripherally related to .
NET 's expression trees ( used in LINQ ) .
ParseTree is used by a number of complex Ruby domain - specific languages , including Ambition , a fact which is extremely telling of how great the need is for just such a tool .
Having myself attempted a domain - specific language for constructing queries , I can state categorically that to do such a thing solely on the basis of open classes would be nearly impossible .
Even if successful , such a framework would be extremely volatile , sensitive to the slightest change in the Ruby core library , either caused by update or by other packages injecting their own meddlesome implementations into runtime classes .
Lex Spoon ( co- author of Programming in Scala ) once said that any language which seriously targeted domain - specific languages would have to create some sort of implicit conversion mechanism .
At the time , I was skeptical , convinced that Ruby ( and similar ) would always have the upper - hand in the area of class extension due to their dynamic treatment of modules and classes .
However , after some serious dabbling in the field of internal domain - specific languages , I 'm beginning to come ' round to his point of view .
Implicit conversions are far from a weak imitation of Scala 's dynamically typed " betters " , they are a powerful and controlled way of extending types far beyond anything which can be easily accomplished through open classes .

FedEx ’s New Solar System Is Enough To Power 370 homes
FedEx Express , a subsidiary of FedEx Corp , broke ground on its first – and largest – international solar energy facility on Monday .
The facility near the Cologne , Germany airport will house over 16,000 square meters of solar panels .
The new solar panel installation is slated for completion by 2010 ; a 1.4 - megawatt ( MW ) solar power system that will generate 1.3 GWhs of electricity / year .
That is equivalent to the annual consumption of 370 homes !
The hub which is located in Cologne , Germany will about double FedEx ’s on - site solar energy production .
Back in 2005 , FedEx ’s Oakland solar hub was California ’s biggest rooftop solar system installation ; the panels provide 20 % of the facilities electrical needs .
In its first three years online it offset more than 1,000 tons of CO2 emissions !
FedEx also has solar facilities in Whittier and Fontana , California – together all three facilities offset 2.9 M pounds of C02 emissions every year .
In Geneva , Switzerland , a FedEx station uses a geothermal system to provide heating in the winter and cooling in the summer .
Looks like FedEx is trying to clean up its environmental record , starting with energy .

I forgot to put Sarah Palin ’s Iowa visit on my calendar of events coming up this weekend .
Fortunately , I received this e-mail from the Polk County Democrats to remind me :
My Fellow Americans ,
As the Iowa Chair of Veterans for Obama , I was thinking of ways to best welcome Sarah Palin when she visits Des Moines this Saturday .
Knowing that jobless rates are up and temperatures are going down , I heard about Sarah Palin needing extra help with clothing recently and thought there might be others who really need the help .
So , I thought we might do a clothing drive across the street from her event and donate to the Disabled American Veterans .
( By the way , they rate Obama ’s voting record at 90 % and McCain ’s at 20 % . )
Here is what is going on Saturday in brief :
First of all , Polk County volunteers are going to knock on over 10,000 doors in a canvas this Saturday , so contact your local organizer to get involved in that .
Secondly , there will be a greeting party across the street from Hy - Vee Hall at 777 Third Street ( corner of 3rd and Center ) .
We ’ll be visible , vocal and starting about 10:30 .
We ’ll be taking donations for the clothing drive in the parking lot at 777 Third Street , so stop by with your donations ( tax deductible ) and maybe knock on some doors or make some phone calls too .
I ’ll be standing next to my truck with the American Flag , Airborne and Obama stickers to take your donation .
Contact me with any questions or if you ’d like to help .
Tell your friends .
Best , Marc
I ’ve got clothes I can give to this drive on Saturday .
Disabled Veterans of America is a group worth supporting .
Note from the above e-mail that Obama rates higher on their scorecard than McCain .
Speaking of scorecards , the non-partisan Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America released their own scorecards for members of Congress recently .
John McCain earned a D , because he did not co-sponsor the post - 9/11 GI bill and voted for only three of the nine bills supported by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
McCain missed more than half of the Senate votes this year .
Barack Obama earned a B for co-sponsoring the GI Bill and voting with veterans five out of nine times .
Obama has also missed quite a few votes , though not as many as McCain .
( Side note :
If you ’re curious about the Iowa scores , Tom Harkin , Bruce Braley and Dave Loebsack received perfect A+ scores from Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , Leonard Boswell and Tom Latham got As , Steve King got a B and Chuck Grassley got a C. )
Getting back to the Polk County Democrats ’ clothing drive this Saturday , what a great idea for a visibility event .
Not only will the crowd attract attention , the clothing drive will spur more media commentary about Sarah Palin ’s $ 150,000 designer wardrobe .
I have n’t piled on to this story , because what is there to say ?
Every aspect of her image has been so stage - managed and phony .
I already found it amusing that she panders to “ Joe Six - pack ” while owning multiple pairs of designer eyeglasses ( the ones she ’s made famous cost at least $ 900 , not including the lenses ) .
Weeks ago , I read a comment on some blog by a wardrobe consultant who said Palin ’s suits were not only expensive high - couture items , but also very “ current , ” and so could n’t have been clothing she owned before McCain put her on the ticket .
This commenter estimated that Palin ’s wardrobe for the general election campaign would have cost $ 200,000 ( which turned out to be a pretty good guess ) .
The other thing I ’m enjoying about the Palin story is the outraged comments from major donors to the Republican National Committee .
They are angry that their money was used in such an extravagant ( and incompetent ) way .
With any luck they will hesitate to give at the same level next election cycle .
Speaking of sleaze , why was I not surprised to learn that the Republican operative who went shopping for Palin is also the McCain campaign ’s main robocaller ?
You can not make this stuff up .
UPDATE : Saw on Ben Smith ’s blog at Politico that the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed an FEC complaint relating to the Republican National Committee ’s clothing purchases for Palin .
It 's the Weld endorsement that 's making news , but there 's been another notable defection by a Massachusetts conservative : Charles Fried , a former Solicitor General under Ronald Reagan and one of Harvard Law School 's most respected conservatives , says he 's already voted for Obama via absentee ballot .
Fried is a conservative of a rather libertarian bent , who , despite his work for Reagan in support of that administration 's anti-abortion policies , now defends Roe v. Wade .
I profiled him when his most recent book was published .
PS .
It can not be a good sign for McCain that in this Boston.com gallery , " Crossing Party Lines , " the only person pictured who 's crossing lines for McCain is Joe Lieberman .
Everyone else is moving in the other direction .
Charles Krauthammer somehow makes it into the gallery even though he's a diehard conservative backing -- McCain .
In his column today for the Washington Post , Krauthammer condemns conservatives who are abandoning the ship .
Truly a Kuhnian moment .
John McCain is so honorable and straight - shooting that the only explanation for his campaign ’s headlong dive into sleaze , xenophobia and gonzo bamboozlement is that McCain is so out of it and controlled by his advisors that he does n’t actually know what they ’re doing in his name .
( Just the kind of guy who should be president , right ? )
That ’s the upshot of the brief exchange Andrea Mitchell , Roger Simon and Mike Barnicle just had on Hardball .
Special thanks to TPM Reader MC for flagging it for us .
We ’ll have the video for you shortly .
Late Update : Here ’s the video …
One of America 's biggest military contractors is being sued by a Nepali labourer and the families of a dozen other employees who say they were taken against their will to work in Iraq .
All but one of the Nepalese workers were subsequently kidnapped and murdered .
According to the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles , the Nepalese workers were recruited in 2004 in their home country by KBR and its Jordanian contractors , Daoud & Partners , to work as kitchen staff in a luxury hotel in Amman .
Once they reached the Jordanian capital , however , their passports were taken from them and they were sent to Iraq .
While travelling in an unprotected convoy , the Nepalis were kidnapped and later executed .
" It does n't appear that any of them knew they were going to Iraq , " said Matthew Handley , a lawyer representing the only survivor and the families of those who were killed .
" A few were told they were going to work at an American camp ...
They thought they were going to work in America . "

The lawsuit says that , after the 12 men were kidnapped , the sole survivor , Buddi Prasad Gurung , was forced to work for 15 months against his will in a warehouse at the al - Asad air base before his passport was finally returned .
The plaintiffs allege the " illicit trafficking scheme - from their recruitment in Nepal to their eventual employment in Iraq - was engineered by KBR and its subcontractor " .
The lawsuit was brought under a new human trafficking law that allows foreign citizens to sue the US government , military or corporations over human rights abuses committed in their countries .
Earlier this year , the US Department of Labour ordered Daoud to make a payment of $ 1 m ( £ 500,000 ) to be split between each spouse and set of parents of the murdered 12 Nepalis .
The company has so far failed to comment on the lawsuit .
The 12 Nepalis were seized by a group calling itself the Army of Ansar al - Sunna .
The men were taken hostage on 20 August 2004 and shortly afterwards the kidnappers released a video of one being beheaded and the other 11 shot .
KBR , formerly known as Kellogg , Brown and Root and once a subsidiary of Halliburton , the company of which the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , was once the chairman , said : " The safety of our employees remains KBR 's top priority .
The company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behaviour . "

October 22 , 2008 --
The prison sentence handed down to ex-Thai prime minister Thaksin is just one part of the present Thai political crisis .
I write this short piece because I have been contacted by both the BBC TV and radio to give a telephone interview , but on both occasions the telephone line went dead during the interview .
Times like this can make us paranoid .
It was probably a technical fault which just happened to occur twice .
Thaksin was found guilty of a ``conflict of interest '' because he was prime minister at the time when his wife bought a piece of land at a knock - down price from the Thai state .
The land originated from bankruptcies due to the 1997 economic crisis .
Earlier Prime Minister Samak was found guilty of appearing on a TV cooking program and forced to resign .
Samak was head of the Peoples Power Party ( PPP ) , the descendant of Thaksin 's Thai Rak Thai party ( TRT ) which was dissolved by the courts during the time of the military junta .
It is interesting to note that Thaksin 's wife was not found guilty of any corruption by the courts , nor was the organisation that held the land auction .
This means that there is no evidence that the price paid for the land was below market rates or artificially depressed .
We need to look at the context of the court rulings .
We are in the middle of a deep political crisis caused by an inter-elite conflict .
One side of this conflict -- Thaksin's TRT and PPP -- is made up of politicians who believe in parliamentary democracy , but do not respect human .
On the other side , are politicians of the Democrat Party , bureaucrats , army generals , the ultra- rightwing People ’s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) protesters and members of the royal family , especially the queen .
This side wants to decrease the democratic space in Thailand .
Their excuse is that they believe that the poor are too stupid to deserve the vote .
The poor majority , both urban and rural , have consistently voted for TRT 's universal health care scheme and the government 's grassroots Keynesian policies .
They reject the monetarism of the Democrat Party .
The Thai courts have never been independent .
Today they serve the elite faction which is against Thaksin .
During Thaksin 's time they served him .
It is easy to punish an ex-PM , exiled in the UK .
In the meantime , the widespread corruption among all politicians of all parties and among the military top brass , is untouched .
There are numerous land accusations against former ministers , prime ministers and military generals .
The junta that overthrew an elected government in 2006 and then appointed its members to the boards of lucrative state enterprises are not being brought to account for abuse of power or corruption .
Today , in Thailand , every public institution is compromised by double standards .
This includes the royal family , the courts , the media and most of academia .
That is why the PAD protesters are allowed to occupy Government House and organise armed protests , attacking police with weapons .
This is not about a strengthened civil society asserting its democratic rights .
The PAD have powerful backers which allow it to break the law .
Meanwhile , the king has remained silent .
Is this a sign of his longstanding weakness ?
Yes , I think it is .
But others believe that he supports the PAD .
There is no concrete evidence to back this up , however .
One cannot just assume that because the queen supports the PAD , that the Monarchy does too .
The Thai public who are outside the minority supporters of the PAD are angry and becoming more and more disenchanted with the elites .
Many royalists were shocked that the queen supported the PAD .
But this public does not have a voice .
They were passive voters for the government .
Nevertheless , some government politicians are trying to mobilise people .
These are the ``Red Shirts '' , as opposed to the PAD ``Yellow Shirts ' ' .
Yellow is the colour of the king .
But the Red Shirts are not socialists and only a fraction are republicans at the moment .
The courts are helping to do what perhaps the military cannot do .
They are pushing towards a civilian coup to topple the elected government .
They may dissolve the governing party .
Then there will be extra-constitutional moves to set up a ``Special National Government ' ' .
The constitution will be changed to decrease the voting rights of the poor , if these elites get their way .
The only hope for Thai democracy is if civil society groups and academics refuse to take sides in this damaging conflict .
We need to expand democracy and build a third alternative , independent from the TRT - PPP or the PAD authoritarians .
Unfortunately , most Thai academics have disgraced themselves by their double standards .
The hope must lie with some sections of the NGO movement , students , the left and the more advanced trade union activists .

John McCain's ' Straight Mess Express '
John McCain has been in Washington for 26 years and , as he says , he ’s voted with George W. Bush more than 90 percent of the time .
McCain also admits he knows little about economics , and he has surrounded himself with corporate lobbyists and other advisers who have pushed a determined anti-regulatory agenda .
( The written story continues below . )
But McCain now – in the face of a major economic crisis – insists he ’s the right agent for change to deal with it , even though much of the trouble can be traced to the slashing of regulations and to President Bush ’s policies .

Some Virginian GOP -ers are concerned McCain wo n't be able to take their state in the election — one that has traditionally been red .
Va. GOP fears McCain could lose state
Virginia Republicans are warning that John McCain 's prospects for winning a state that has been in the GOP column in every presidential election since 1964 could be in jeopardy .
With Barack Obama treating the Old Dominion like a battleground state and reliable polls showing a margin - of - error race there , some are cautioning that McCain is making a critical mistake by allowing the Democratic nominee to outpace him in terms of visits and resources committed .
The two best indicators of which states the campaigns are serious about – time and money – tell the story .
Advertisement
Since wrapping up the Democratic nomination in June , Obama , his wife , Michelle , and his running mate Joe Biden have visited the commonwealth a combined 12 times .
The candidate himself was in the Tidewater city of Newport News Saturday .
Obama is also plowing millions into Virginia , blanketing the airwaves with TV and radio ads , filling up mailboxes with leaflets and , along with the state party , operating 49 campaign offices .
Together , McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , have held just one campaign event in Virginia .
And the campaign has taken its ads off the pricey Washington , D.C. network affiliates that reach into the entire swath of the Northern Virginia , the commonwealth ’s most populous region .
“ I think [ McCain ] needs to get here , ” said Rep . Tom Davis , a longtime member of Congress who represents a Northern Virginia district .
“ I think they ’ve got to pay more attention . ”
Davis predicted McCain would ultimately take Virginia because he has appeal to the center - right independents that usually swing statewide races and because Obama is less moderate than such successful Democratic figures as former Gov. Mark Warner and Sen. James Webb .
“ Obama is not a Virginia Democrat , ” Davis said .
But the former National Republican Congressional Committee chair , who is retiring this year , said because of the party ’s troubled brand and Obama ’s effort to increase African - American turnout , the Virginia race now stands even .
“ The economy hurts us across the board and Obama is really running hard and putting more resources here than McCain – he ’s got the money . ”
Asked if he thought McCain was taking the state seriously enough , Davis paused before saying : “ I think they ’re going to . ”
“ It ’s very , very tight , ” agreed former governor and Senator George Allen .
“ Obviously Democrats have spent a lot of time here . ”
“ We are a true battleground state , ” Allen said twice .
Rep. Eric Cantor , a Richmond - area Republican and member of the House GOP leadership who won some veep chatter this summer , agreed that Virginia would be tight .
“ I think it is very competitive , ” Cantor said .
Asked if McCain needed to return , he was judicious : “ It ’s up to them to allocate his time .
We ’re going to do everything we can for him . ”
But discussing the boost Sarah Palin had given to the party ’s grassroots , Cantor offered a standing invitation without being asked : “ Anytime they want to send Gov. Palin in , we ’ll welcome her with open arms . ”
Longtime Virginia operatives are more outspoken , grumbling that McCain is now having to play catch up .
“ He did n't take threat seriously soon enough , ” said one Richmond - based GOP strategist in the state , noting that McCain had the nomination wrapped up in early March but did n’t have staff or infrastructure in Virginia until July .
“ One public visit since securing the nomination and I ca n’t tell you one significant surrogate who has come . ”
It ’s puzzling because McCain ’s campaign is based in Arlington , Va. , and the senator lives there when he’s at his headquarters or across the river in his Senate office .
Yet whenever he ’s back in the area he never ventures beyond the office and condo - filled Crystal City neighborhood to more politically competitive communities nearby where he could get extensive local media coverage by just dropping by a diner .
“ He , not she , needs to return to northern Virginia , ” said a veteran GOP operative from the region about the GOP ticket .
“ That 's where he needs to perform , and where he can .
He can get a lot of Mark Warner voters , but he needs to show the ticket - splitting centrists in voter - rich Fairfax and Loudoun [ counties ] some love and understanding . ”
McCain ’s top aide for the mid-Atlantic region , Trey Walker , held a conference call for party leaders on Friday and was pressed as to why McCain and Palin had n’t been back to Virginia since their joint visit to Fairfax City last month .
“ One of the hardest things we have to do is getting more folks to take a national view , ” Walker told Politico , when told about concerns that the campaign was n’t devoting enough attention to Virginia .
“ It ’s real simple – we ’re pushing Obama in Pennsylvania and they ’re pushing us in Virginia .
We are engaged in a game of electoral chicken right now and we ’ll see who blinks first . ”
When it comes to Virginia , McCain and the GOP appear to be blinking .
Walker would only tell Politico that the GOP ticket would be back in Virginia “ soon , ” but other Republican sources say an announcement about a return visit will come this week .
McCain is also opening 12 more offices in the commonwealth and bringing on more staff .
And the independent expenditure arm of the RNC -- which can't coordinate with the McCain campaign but which closely tracks state polling -- last week began to broadcast TV ads for the first time in Virginia .
The RNC 's move to go up on the air there tracks a similar move in Indiana , another state that has n't gone Democratic since Lyndon Johnson 's 1964 landslide win , and reflects the challenge facing the party : they 're having to invest money to broaden their defenses in states that have until recently been safely red .
Beyond the financial implications of that approach , the GOP ticket is confronting new demands on its time .
The McCain campaign would prefer to have the Arizona senator and Alaska governor campaign together , but they are now being forced to protect more states so they may have to spend more time apart .
It 's a akin to a campaign version of whack - a- mole , where finite time and money is being spread across the landscape to defend against sudden and unexpected Democratic surges on GOP turf .
" We 'd be happy if they spent the next 30 days in Virginia , " Allen said .
" But it 's a big country and there are a lot of battleground states . "
In the Old Dominion , though , the renewed attention can't come soon enough for Republicans , who are already despondent about the state of their party .
Part of McCain ’s challenge in the state is out of his hands .
The Virginia GOP is at a low ebb , lacking an obvious statewide leader as they had in the 1990s with former Governors Allen and Jim Gilmore .
The party has lost consecutive gubernatorial races in 2001 and 2005 followed by Allen ’s Senate seat in 2006 .
The other Senate seat , held by retiring Sen. John Warner , is almost certain to be won next month by former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner over Gilmore .
“ We do n’t have anybody with the kind of cache who can tell [ the McCain campaign ] that we need them here , ” lamented one prominent Virginia Republican who asked for anonymity to candidly discuss the presidential race .
The party ’s problems were on all - too - familiar display in a Saturday conference call organized by the campaign .
The plan was to have Sen .
Warner , the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee , counter - program Obama ’s visit to the shipbuilding city of Newport News .
But the news of the call came when Warner declined to endorse Gilmore ’s Senate bid , suggested he might back Warner and reminded reporters of his previous independence .
“ I ’m watching that race , following the positions of the two candidates , ” Warner said .
“ There have been occasions when I have supported Democratic candidates . …
But I ’m not there yet . ”
The popular five - term senator refused to endorse conservative Republicans running for statewide office in 1993 and 1994 , enabling Democrats to win both times .
Virginia Republicans are concerned that Mark Warner ’s winning margin – he leads Gilmore by well over 20 percentage points in every survey – could offer some reverse coattails to Obama .
Then there is Obama ’s effort to spike core Democratic turnout , about 20 % of the population in Virginia .
Over 300,000 new voters have been registered this year , with the highest percentage increase in heavily - black Richmond .
Other localities with increased registration are liberal - to - moderate Alexandria and Fairfax .
“ Obama wants to run up the margin in northern Virginia , increase black turnout and maximize the college towns , ” Davis explained .
Virginia Republicans all express public optimism that McCain will ultimately pull out a win there .
“ I ’m very confident that we will win Virginia , ” said Cantor , noting that presidential races bring out a larger turnout than the commonwealth ’s off - year gubernatorial races .
In this vein , Allen pointed out that the military - heavy state – home to the Pentagon and the world ’s largest naval base – behaves differently in presidential years .
“ They ’re voting for a commander - in - chief , not a governor , ” Allen said of the troops , many of whom are deployed and are missed in polling .
It ’s precisely that element which has kept Virginia in Republican hands every four years , even when Southern Democrats were on the top of the Democratic ticket .
“ The disproportionate presence of national security voters among independents in Virginia is what has kept the state in the GOP column in presidential contests even as party fortunes have ebbed and flowed between Republicans and Democrats in state elections , ” said Frank Atkinson , a longtime Virginia Republican and author of two books on the commonwealth ’s political history .
But Atkinson offered a cautionary note .
“ It is a marginal advantage , though , not an insurmountable one . ”
If Virginia does flip , Davis said , it will be an indicator of a commanding Democratic win .
" Virginia wo n't be Obama 's 270th electoral vote . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration on Saturday sent a $ 700 billion financial markets rescue plan to Congress aimed at stemming the financial crisis that grew out of the steepest U.S. housing slump since the Great Depression .
KEY POINTS : According to a draft of the proposed legislation obtained by Reuters : * The government could purchase as much as $ 700 billion in mortgage - related assets from U.S. - headquartered institutions .
* Decisions by the treasury secretary related to the buyback program could not be reviewed by any court .
*
In a related move , the U.S. government ’s debt limit would be raised to $ 11.315 trillion from $ 10.615 trillion .
COMMENTS :
CHRISTOPHER LOW , CHIEF ECONOMIST AT FTN FINANCIAL IN NEW
YORK :
On proposed federal mortgage bailout :
“ It ’s going to work .
This is what we need to do .
There is not enough liquidity in the market right now to put a price on a lot of these securities .
It ’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a buyer for them .
Once the government takes some of the supply out of the market , these securities will trade again .
This is a way to get the inventory down . ”
“ What this program does indirectly is that it will support home prices . ”
“ Taxpayers can make money off this program , albeit it would be a long time .
A lot of the mortgages are still good and they are performing .
Still no two mortgage pools are alike and how do you find the proper clearing prices for them ? ”
“ There ’s no such thing as an instant fix .
There is so much that ’s broken . ”
On the catalyst for the bailout plan :
“ What is too big to fail ?
It was Lehman . ”
The Primary Reserve fund “ broke the buck because of the Lehman bankruptcy .
Institutions started withdrawing money from money market funds .
The money market froze up .
Businesses can’t finance inventories because they can’t sell their commercial paper .
The FHLB ( Federal Home Loan Bank ) , which was selling $ 50 billion in discount notes a month , could n’t sell those notes . ”
“ On top of that , institutions pulled money from their prime brokerage accounts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs .
They did n’t have any more securities to lend out .
That drop in liquidity was a wake - up call . ”
On the Federal Reserve and other central banks :
“ I do n’t think it ’s necessary for foreign central banks to play this game ” - on other central banks needing to set up their own mop - up funds for bad mortgages .
RICH STEINBERG , PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF
STEINBERG GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT LTD , BOCA RATON , FLORIDA :
“ It looks like it was as expected .
“ As unthinkable as it is that we have to take these extraordinary measures , it was absolutely necessary to do so to stop global markets from freezing over .
“ While this is only for US banks , we live in a flat world and I would expect there would be coordination between the central banks and governments .
“ I do n’t know if this will do the trick ..
We are in unchartered waters and this is a live litmus test .
“ We do n’t know what stocks will do next week .. we would expect extreme volatility to continue .
“ I think there will still be political jawboning but I think both democrats and republicans will realize these measures are absolutely necessary and it is the obligation of the house and senate to trust in the leadership here .
This should not be politicized . ”
MICHAEL PENTO , SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST AT DELTA GLOBAL
ADVISORS WHICH HELPS MANAGE $ 1.6 BILLION OF ASSETS , IN
HUNTINGTON BEACH , SAN FRANCISCO :
“ The plan is pretty much what I thought it would be and it is a very poorly crafted plan .
When you go into negotiations the last thing you want to do is assure that you will purchase the assets -- now the bargaining power of the Treasury is left on the curb .
So the banks will be able to negotiate a much better deal than they would normally have got .
“ If you go into an agreement to purchase a house , and you are negotiating .
The one thing you do n’t want to say to the seller is “ I have to buy this house . ”
You ’ve lost your negotiating power .
“ Another poorly crafted bit of this : when you plan on issuing $ 700 billion that amount is accrued the already skyrocketing annual deficits .
Now these skyrocketing annual deficits will put pressure on the federal reserve to monetize the debt away .
If the Federal Reserve refused to monetize the debt , the sharply rising annual deficits will lead to sharply rising Treasury yields which will counteract and negate all what Treasury is trying to do to reignite the housing market .
When you have the national debt at $ 9.6 trillion and you are adding a trillion plus a year to the debt then the amount of debt outstanding outstrips the tax base .
“ What is the end game ?
You are trying to recapitalize the banks by exchanging non viable and non performing assets putting them on the balance sheet of the tax payer and recapitalizing the banks by sending them cash .
Here is where the plan has faults : you are trying to compel the banks to make more non performing loans at a time when the banks are over leveraged and consumers are overleveraged ..
Trying to get these banks to lend more money to a consumer who already is overleveraged , its like throwing gasoline on the fire and it is kicking the can down the road a few feet and the problem is going to be a lot more pernicious the next time .
“ These banks are getting a great deal .
The price of those loans flew on Friday , these banks now have the upper hand .
This bid is going to be much better than they are going to get from the free market .
“ Foreign central banks are going to rethink about whether they will reinvest in the US .
They already got burned with MBS and now buying the Treasury debt that is backing MBS , no thank you .
“ This is a very vague plan . ”
On stocks : “ Next week is not as important ..
Let ’s see what happens when they allow short selling again after October 2 .
“ In the long run this is an extremely poorly crafted plan and it will be much worse than it was .
You ’re just kicking the can down the road and we have to deal with the a much worse problem further down the road .
This is what lies in store for this country : higher inflation , slower growth , higher taxes , just because you did n’t allow the free market to work .
“ We are just rolling asset bubbles .
There ’s no magic here . ”

ANDREW BRENNER , SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT , MF GLOBAL IN NEW
YORK :
On concerns / questions raised from proposal plan :
“ I am concerned about them , but I ’m still a 100 percent behind it .
We have to get it done . ”
On the range of assets possibly being purchased :
“ They need to maximum flexibility to what they can buy . ”
On who will manage the fund :
Brenner thinks Blackrock , maybe Pimco , may be used as advisor (s ) to buy and manage these assets .
Blackrock has the expertise which the Treasury does n’t and is already do it for the Maiden Lane ( Bear Stearns ) assets on Fed ’s balance sheet .
On the Federal reserve :
“ What we need is liquidity .
If the Fed can achieve it without lowering rates , it ’s okay by me . ”
On the government ’s efforts in the past week :
“ I would give the government a solid B - plus .
However , I will give the Fed an A ; Treasury B-minus and the SEC up until the last few days a F . ”
On expected market reaction :
“ I could see this could have legs and we could have a powerful year - end rally . ”
MARK WAGGONER PRESIDENT AT EXCEL FUTURES INC , HUNTINGTON
BEACH , CALIFORNIA :
“ It ’s giving them a lot of breathing room to do a lot of stuff and it is extremely vague .
It ’s scary .
This administration has been doing this kind of thing for quite some time , like the Bush doctrine , that give them a lot of power .
“ My problem with it is that its not thought out .
They are flying by the seat of their pants .
“ This could be the medicine that kills the patient , who knows , or it could be the right thing to do .
I just do n’t know that just throwing money at something is the right thing to do .
“ This is probably doing to help a bit , but let ’s say they do this , then what is next ?
“ The stock market is not going to just come right back up it is going to go down again there is going to be more fallout .
And what are they going to do next ?
“ This news was absolutely baked into the stock market because you saw this stupendous rally on Friday .
The sad part about this is that the taxpayer will have to pay this money and this will lead to inflation .
If you look at the charts it looks like the stock market will sell off on money when the euphoria dissipates .
On political risk :
“ There is going to be resistance from some people but I have a feeling it will be rubber stamped through and that it will happen so quickly .
I expect it to be washed through in a couple of days .
“ You ’d think the republicans want it pushed through as fast as possible because they want to look like they saved the world .
It ’s a political hot potato .
“ Obviously we are not going to be bailing out other countries .
But if our government pulls this off you will see
stabilization in the market and overseas banks may not have to take write - downs .
“ But we ’ll see if they pull it off .
It also depends on what each of the other countries governments do . ”
JAN HATZIUS , CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST , GOLDMAN SACHS , NEW
YORK :
“ Basically , I see three main conditions for resolving the crisis ( a slicker marketer would call them “ The Three R’s ” ) :
a) Recognition .
We need to find out what the assets on the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions are really worth , and what the balance sheets of the most troubled institutions look like under a regime of realistic marks .
b) Recapitalization .
The US banking system needs a lot more capital .
Credit losses are depleting equity capital , and deleveraging increases the required equity capital per unit of balance sheet capacity .
So capital infusions are needed to avert a sharp contraction in lending .
c ) Relief .
In many cases , we need to restructure the loan terms of homeowners who lack the ability ( or economic incentive ) to service their mortgage .
This is n’t just in the interest of the homebuyers , but it ’s often also in the interest of the lender ( given the cost of foreclosure ) and certainly in the interest of the macroeconomy ( given the feedback effects between foreclosures , home prices , and economic performance ) .
“ We do n’t yet know exactly how the program addresses these issues , especially as far as recapitalization and relief are concerned .
At a minimum , however , it should promote recognition by generating ‘ market ’ prices for illiquid assets .
Here ’s how this could work .
Let ’s say $ 100 billion of the total $ 700 billion are devoted to the purchase of 2006 subprime RMBS ( residential mortgage - backed securities ) .
First , Treasury staff ( or an outside money manager ) determines a maximum price using a model of expected cumulative loss rates .
Then , banks are invited to submit offers .
Finally , the lowest $ 100 billion of offers are accepted at the stop - out price .
The stop - out price is then the ‘ market ’ price for 2006 subprime RMBS .
“ Such an auction scheme can lead to greater clarity on both the quality of balance sheets and the fair price of illiquid assets .
A bank that sells an illiquid asset marked at 80 ( cents on the dollar ) at an auction price of 50 has to write down its equity capital accordingly .
Moreover , a bank that continues to mark a similar asset at 80 will come under greater pressure to take a write - down ( for an ‘ available for sale ’ asset ) or ultimately a larger credit provisions ( for a ‘ held for investment ’ asset ) .
“ However , this particular auction method -- if that ’s what they adopt -- also raises some important questions :
a ) Credit quality can vary substantially even within relatively narrowly defined asset classes , depending on the originator , the regional concentration , and other factors .
This means that if the classes are defined broadly , the Treasury will end up with the lowest - quality assets , driving up its fiscal cost and reducing its usefulness in promoting recognition .
However , if the classes are defined narrowly , only a few institutions will own the asset in question and there may not be enough bidders for an auction .
So it might make sense to think about alternative , more sophisticated auction mechanisms .
b ) There is a conflict between using an auction to price standardized assets and getting the most illiquid assets off books .
For example , CDO - squared ( collateralized debt obligation ) vary a lot more than simple RMBS and are therefore much harder to price in a uniform manner .
So an auction scheme may have to be supplemented by bilateral negotiation in certain cases .
The latter , however , involves significant asymmetric information problems because the seller knows much more about the quality of the asset than the Treasury .
“ In any case , recognition is only a start .
In fact , recognition actually increases the need for recapitalization because it brings capital shortfalls out into the open .
So it will be important to see how the Treasury proposal addresses this .
Do they force banks to seek equity infusions from private investors in a specified time period ?
Do they simply ‘ pay over the odds ’ for the assets ( this would promote recapitalization but jeopardize recognition ) ?
Is part of the program earmarked for the purchase of preferred stock in banks ?
Or is there a public / private partnership scheme such as an issuance of publicly financed puts in exchange for warrants for would - be private investors ?
“ Regarding the third condition -- relief -- they needs to decide what to do with the newly purchased troubled loans .
Large - scale loan modifications are likely , but the devil is in the detail .
Do they just reduce the interest rate to enable homeowners to meet their monthly payments ?
Or do they also write down the principal to give homeowners an economic incentive to keep servicing their loans ?
The former is more cost effective and limits ‘ moral hazard ’ , but the latter may be more effective in maximizing recoveries given the cost of foreclosure and resale . ”

McCain wants to spend $ 300 billion more to buy up bad mortgages
Posted on by jddqr
I cant underscore enough what a rotten idea John McCains ACORN - like government mortgage buy - up is .
I said it during my liveblog .
And Ill say it again : HE WANTS TO EXPAND THE BAILOUT .
He wants to do what ACORN wants to do .
We re Screwed 08 . 
This was his supposed game - changer . 
This was the very first thing out of his mouth during the debate tonight  his big pitch right off the bat .
The McCain campaign immediately sent out this fact sheet on the proposal , which will cost at least $ 300 billion .
The proposal involves directing the Treasury Secretary to purchase mortgages directly from homeowners and mortgage servicers .
Thats on top of the trillion - dollar crap sandwich , the $ 85 billion to AIG , the $ 25 billion to automakers , the $ 200 billion in capital and credit lines to Fannie and Freddie , and who knows what else well be forking over to California , Massachusetts , etc. , etc. , etc .
He spent the entire debate assailing massive government spending  while his featured proposal of the night was to heap on more massive government spending to pursue home ownership / retention at all costs .
If Obama had proposed this , the Right would be screaming bloody murder about this socialist grab .

This is going to backfire because most Americans have to pay their mortgages and their taxes and only a small percentage of homeowners are in trouble .
If it looks like welfare , and it smells like welfare , it 's welfare .

Of course not but he is the ultimate proof that we are left with two liberal parties in the US .

Left 4 Dead DLC Will Include More Levels , Enemies ; Xbox 360 Version Uses Dedicated Servers
The company plans to add new scenarios to the game 's initial 4 , as well as new bosses and weapons .
" There were strong hints at a flamethrower coming not long after launch , " 1UP reported after talking to Faliszek .
The Valve writer also promised that the studio aims to make that DLC available more quickly than they have done with Team Fortress 2 .
It is unknown whether that content will be free on Xbox 360 , as Valve 's penchant for free content on its PC games has met with resistance from Microsoft when releasing new content on Xbox Live Marketplace .
For the Xbox 360 version , Valve plans to offer dedicated servers for Xbox Live players .
Most Xbox
Live games use peer - to - peer connections , which can impact performance depending on players ' internet connections .
While numbers for the servers were not given , Valve " did imply that they 'd have everyone covered . "
The console port of the game is being handled by Certain Affinity , the new studio headed by Bungie alum and Halo 2 multiplayer lead Max Hoberman .
The Xbox 360 version will get a number of concessions to handle playing the breakneck game on a controller , such as zombies that attack from behind less frequently and a " 180 button " to turn around quickly .
Both Xbox 360 and PC versions of Left 4 Dead will arrive on November 18 .

Apple next - generation Snow Leopard operating system will introduce a massive re-write of the Mac OS X Finder and debut a new feature called ImageBoot , AppleInsider has learned .
Cocoa - based Finder
People familiar with matter say the Finder , which currently stands as one of the oldest Carbon - based applications in the Mac OS portfolio , has been completely re-written in the company 's native object - oriented application program environment called Cocoa .
Apple has reportedly tapped select members of its developer community to begin testing the updated graphical file system manager as part of a new pre-release copy of Snow Leopard belonging to the build train 10 Ax xx .
In addition , many of the Apple - authored applications accompany the new build are also said to have been wrapped completely in Cocoa .
Microsoft Exchange Support
Other advances are also present in the new test software , such as broader support for Microsoft Exchange 2007 in Snow Leopard 's versions of iCal , Address Book and Mail .
The implementation of Exchange support remains a work in progress , according to those familiar with the matter .
As such , Apple has reportedly asked that developers focus their testing efforts on a subset of Exchange capabilities , such as scheduling events in iCal , adding contacts to Address Book 5.0 , and automated account configuration in Mail .
ImageBoot
When it makes its debut , likely at WWDC 2009 , Snow Leopard will also introduce a new , third option for disc image - based installation called ImageBoot .
Based on Apple 's existing NetBoot technology , which allows Macs to boot from a remote disk over the network , ImageBoot will allow users to set up any number of disk images on a secondary partition or external drive , and then selectively boot their system from any one of those disk images at startup .
This new feature will allow users to set up a series of test environments or uniquely configured Mac OS X systems , store the bootable systems as discrete disk images , and subsequently store multiple boot targets on the same disk or partition .
Currently , only one bootable Mac OS X installation can be stored on a given disk partition .
With ImageBoot , multiple NetBoot sets can be maintained locally on the same storage partition , and the user can select any one of the disk images available to boot from without having to restore or mount the disk image first .
The result is a system that works similar to virtualization software such as Parallels , which can create disk images for different PC operating systems and selectively boot from any of them .
The difference is that Mac OS X is n't booting up in a virtual environment ; it actually boots a fully native Mac OS X system .
Broader Availability Expected
A little over two weeks ago , AppleInsider noted that Apple was preparing to broaden evaluation of Snow Leopard through software seeds to a limited number of developers .
It 's now expected that the company 's vast developer community , or members of the Apple Developer Connection network , could be added to the mix as early as this weekend .
A woman in northern India has admitted chopping off the head of a man she says tried to rape her .
But she denies reports that she then carried the head to her local police station in Uttar Pradesh state .
The 35 - year - old said she had been working in her field cutting grass when the man tried to attack her .
She hit back using her sickle .
She told the BBC she had no regrets .
The man had reportedly been harassing and stalking her for some time .
" He tried to rape me and I hit back with the grass - cutting weapon to save my honour , " she told Ramdutt Tripathi of the BBC Hindi service .
She says she went to the police station in her blood - soaked clothes after the incident , but denied newspaper reports that she carried the head with her .
Ram Bharose , police chief of Lakhimpur Khiri district some 125 miles ( 200 km ) south of the state capital Lucknow , said they were investigating the incident .
He said the woman had a legal right to defend herself against rape and sexual attacks .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- The Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are working with the Federal Reserve and Fannie Mae to prevent millions of home foreclosures , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Tuesday in an exclusive interview on " Charlie Rose " on PBS airing Tuesday night , according to a transcript of the interview .
Paulson said the Treasury is readying plans to buy troubled mortgage assets from banks and other investors .
" There is clearly more that can be done , needs to be done , " he said .
" We are looking in the millions .
And we need to do everything we can to minimize that , " Paulson said .
The actions by the FDIC to guarantee bank debts are already working , he said .
" The credit freeze is beginning to melt . "
Hill only won three Grands Prix in his career
Phil Hill , the first American driver to win the Formula One world title , has died in California aged 81 .
Hill was crowned world champion in 1961 after the death of his Ferrari team - mate and championship rival Wolfgang Von Trips at the Italian Grand Prix .
Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said : " All employees of Ferrari are extremely saddened by the passing of a man who gave so much to Ferrari . "
Mario Andretti , in 1978 , is the only other American Formula One champion .
Hill won only three Grands Prix in his Formula One career , all with the Italian team , and only two in his championship season .
McLaren team chief Ron Dennis said : " For all who knew him , Phil will for ever be cherished as a perfect gentleman and a man who embodied the true sporting values of motor racing .
" We who were privileged to have met him will remember him fondly wherever we race , but most of all at Monza , on the tarmac of whose famous autodromo he became world champion 47 years ago . "
Russian archaeologists say they have found the long - lost capital of the Khazar kingdom in southern Russia , a breakthrough for research on the ancient Jewish state .
" This is a hugely important discovery , " expedition organiser Dmitry Vasilyev said from Astrakhan State University after returning from excavations near the village of Samosdelka , just north of the Caspian Sea .
" We can now shed light on one of the most intriguing mysteries of that period - how the Khazars actually lived .
We know very little about the Khazars - about their traditions , their funerary rites , their culture , " he said .
The city was the capital of the Khazars , a semi-nomadic Turkic peoples who adopted Judaism as a state religion , from between the 8th and the 10th centuries , when it was captured and sacked by the rulers of ancient Russia .
At its height , the Khazar state and its tributaries controlled much of what is now southern Russia , western Kazakhstan , eastern Ukraine , Azerbaijan and large parts of Russia 's North Caucasus region .
The capital is referred to as Itil in Arab chronicles but Mr Vasilyev said the word may actually have been used to refer to the Volga River on which the city was founded or to the surrounding river delta region .
Itil was said to be a multi-ethnic place with houses of worship and judges for Christians , Jews , Muslims and pagans .
Its remains have until now never been identified and were said to have been washed away by the Caspian Sea .
Archaeologists have been excavating in the area if Samosdelka for the past nine years but have only now collected enough material evidence to back their thesis , including the remains of an ancient brick fortress , he added .
" Within the fortress , we have found huts similar to yurts , which are characteristics of Khazar cities ....
The fortress had a triangular shape and was made with bricks .
It 's another argument that this was no ordinary city . "
Around 10 university archaeologists and some 50 students took part in excavations in the region this summer , which are partly financed by the Jewish University in Moscow and the Russian Jewish Congress .

McCain - Palin Bounce Primarily in the South
As everyone probably knows by now , McCain got a solid bounce from his convention .
Sarah Palin 's speech and to some extent his own speech were very well received by Republicans and some independents .
What has n't been reported until now is the geographic distribution of the bounce .
Here are the numbers by region for the relevant weeks ( click here for the story .
Region Aug. 18 -24 Aug. 25-31 Sept. 1 - 7 East Obama +15 Obama +17 Obama +11 South McCain +12 McCain +4 McCain +15 Midwest McCain +1 Obama +10 Obama +6 West Obama +5 Obama +7 Obama +7
The Democratic convention was Aug. 25 - 28 and the Republican convention was Sept. 1 - 4 , so the second column is the pre-convention baseline and the fourth one was taken during and after the Republican convention .
If we compare the third and fourth columns to see the effect of the Republican convention , the biggest effect was in the South , where McCain is likely to win most states anyway , and a bit in the East , where Obama is likely to win everything .
The effect in the crucial Midwest and West was smaller .
Electoral College Calendar Several people had questions about the mechanics of the electoral college .
Here is the timeline .
Nov. 4 - The people vote for electors in 50 states plus D.C .
Dec. 15 - The chosen electors meet in their respective states to cast their electoral votes
Dec. 24 - The electoral vote totals must have arrived at the Senate and the Archivist
Jan. 5 - The 111th Congress is sworn in
Jan. 6 - The electoral votes are counted in a joint session of Congress Democrats Choose Nominee to Replace Tubbs Jones The Ohio Democratic Party has chosen suburban mayor Marcia Fudge as its nominee to replace the late Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones ( D - OH ) in OH - 11 .
This is a majority black district with a PVI of D+33 so there is no doubt that Fudge will win .
The governor has called a special primary election for Oct. 14 and a special general election for Nov. 18 .
While this may seem stupid given that Fudge is certain to be elected to Congress in the general election on Nov. 4 , if she also wins the special election on Nov. 18 she will be seated immediately and thus have seniority over the incoming freshman class seated in January .
It is expected this will be a large class and even 6 weeks of seniority would raise her rank quite a bit .
Speculation over Lieberman 's Successor John McCain has n't been elected President yet and he certainly has n't appointed Sen .
Joe Lieberman to his cabinet yet , but Washington is rife with speculation about who Gov. Jodi Rell ( R - CT ) would appoint to fill Lieberman 's seat if it becomes vacant .
Potential candidates include Republicans Rep. Chris Shays , former representatives Rob Simmons and Nancy Johnson , and associate U.S. attorney general Kevin O'Connor .
Dirty Tricks Starting Already in Ohio The Cincinnati Enquirer has a story about dirty tricks in Ohio intended to influence the election there .
The McCain campaign printed a form on which a voter can request an absentee ballot and sent out about 1 million of them .
The form included an unnecessary box asking if the voter was eligible to vote .
If the voter did n't notice the box and did n't check it , he or she is in fact admitting that he or she is not eligible and the application has to be rejected by law .
Secretary of state Jennifer Brunner is hopping mad about this stunt but she is required by law to reject invalid applications .
Today ' Polls
We have 17 presidential polls today .
As you can see below , there is more red than blue today , but much of that is due to the states that happened to be polled .
One noteworthy results in a swing state is two polls in Florida that give McCain a 7 - 8 point lead there .
Key states like Colorado , Michigan , Nevada , Ohio , and Pennsylvania continue to be close .
State Obama McCain Start End Pollster Alabama 35 % 55 % Sep 03 Sep 09 Capital Research Colorado 49 % 46 % Sep 09 Sep 10 Insider Advantage Florida 42 % 50 % Sep 09 Sep 10 Insider Advantage Florida 43 % 50 % Sep 05 Sep 09 Quinnipiac U.

Pennsylvania 48 % 45 % Sep 05 Sep 09 Quinnipiac U. West Virginia 39 % 44 % Sep 05 Sep 08 Mark Blankenship Wyoming 39 % 58 % Sep 10 Sep 10 Rasmussen
For the first time this year John McCain has taken the lead in the electoral college , albeit by 2 EVs .
Today 's configuration shows McCain ahead in all the swing states except Colorado .
This means he can't afford to lose any of Nevada , New Mexico , Missouri , Ohio , Virginia , and Florida , all of which could go either way .
Today might later be remembered as the beginning of the end for Obama , or just a blip .
Obama now has 268 EVs .
In 2004 , John Kerry had 273 on this date .
However , there is still a long way to go .
The debates will be even more important than usual this year .
We have multiple polls in Florida , Michigan , and Ohio today .
No doubt that multiple polls in the same week will become common from here on .
To see the algorithm used to produce the map , click on " Map algorithm explained " on the map legend .
Basically , the most recent poll always counts and any other polls taken within a week of it count , too , and all are weighted equally .
Of course it would be possible to weight polls two weeks old by 0.5 ( or 0.25 or 0.75 and still older polls by other factors ) , but then the weighting model becomes crucial to understanding the result .
Average the last week 's worth of polls is close enough for government work .
We also have four Senate polls .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
An analysis of the two starkly different approaches to reforming the U.S. health care system offered by John McCain and Barack Obama suggests Obama ’s plan has the best chance of making health care more affordable , accessible , efficient and higher in quality .
Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama waves to supporters at the end of a campaign rally in La Crosse , Wisconsin , October 1 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
The report , released on Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund , sized up the presidential candidates ’ plans for dealing with a health care system which has left nearly 46 million people uninsured and many more underinsured .
According to the report , Democrat Obama ’s plan would cover 34 million of the nation ’s projected 67 million uninsured people in 10 years , compared with just 2 million covered under Republican John McCain ’s plan .
“ It ’s a plan that tries to deal in a serious way with the uninsured , ” Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , said of Obama ’s plan in a telephone interview .
“ That is clearly a top priority .
He does n’t eliminate it , but in my view he cuts it in half over a 10 - year period . ”
Obama ’s plan seeks to build on the current employer - based insurance system , which now provides coverage to 160 million people , or more than 60 percent of the population under 65 .
His plan would require all employers except small businesses to either offer health insurance or contribute to the cost of coverage .
It would replace the current individual insurance market with an insurance exchange in which small businesses and those without access to coverage could buy a private or public health plan with tax credits .

The plan also eases qualifications for low - income families to be covered under Medicaid , the state - federal insurance program for the poor , and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
Obama ’s plan is most like a plan put forth earlier this year by the Commonwealth Fund , which would also build on the current employer - based health system .
MARKET SOLUTION
McCain ’s plan seeks to put health insurance into the hands of individuals by removing tax breaks for employer - paid health benefits and offering tax credits of $ 2,500 for individuals and $ 5,000 for families instead .
“ I think Senator McCain ’s plan is more concerned with health care costs and doing something about that through a market solution .
It ’s basically saying let ’s have people buy their own insurance , ’ Davis said .
McCain would also ease state insurance restrictions and allow people to buy policies across state lines , and he would expand existing state high - risk pools for people who cannot get individual insurance because of health problems .
Researchers at the Urban Institute - Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center project McCain ’s plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 1.3 million in the first year at a cost $ 185 million .
About 20 million people would lose their employer - sponsored coverage under McCain ’s plan , but 21 million would gain coverage on the individual market .
Obama ’s plan in its first year would reduce the number of uninsured by 18.4 million at a cost of $ 86 billion .
Over 10 years , McCain ’s plan would cost $ 1.3 trillion and Obama ’s would cost $ 1.6 trillion , according to the report .
Neither plan would offer universal health coverage , but Obama ’s plan would mandate health insurance coverage for children .
Edward Liddy , the new chief executive of American International Group Inc. , said in an interview Thursday that he hopes to keep intact as many of the company 's largest insurance operations as possible in a publicly traded company , after selling assets to pay back a federal loan .
" There will be a company at the end of this , " he said .
" It 'll be smaller ; it 'll be a lot nimbler . "

This post will show you how to build an AJAX crop image tool using the image cropper control from YUI library and PHP .
If you are unsure of what PHP is , we touch upon it quickly in our Bluehost guide , click here to read more .
The ImageCropper Control from the YUI library gives you an interactive interface for getting the dimensions to crop an image and using these dimensions in PHP , we can do some cropping .
The script we are going to build will
allow users to upload an image via AJAX
then allow them to select an area for cropping
lastly , provide a download link for the cropped image .
There are 3 files we are going to use
index .php – will contain the form for image upload as well as the cropping interface
upload .php – provides uploading functionality
crop.php – provides cropping functionality
From a technical point of view , the flow will be like this :
user uploads jpg image ( index. php ) index.php then posts the image asynchronously to upload .
php which will do the upload on the server , returning JSON data containing the image file name , its width and its height .
with the JSON data and innerHTML we put the image in our page initialize the javascript cropping tool generate a download link ( crop.php )
Let ’s have a look at index .
php
The index . php is our main file where users will be able upload images and then download the cropped ones .
We ’ll need the following components from the YUI library :
yah oo - dom - event.js – for DOM manipulation and Event handling
dragdrop – dependency for the image cropper control
element – dependency for the image cropper control
resize – dependency for the image cropper control
connection – for AJAX requests , in our case for image uploads via AJAX
json – for parsing JSON data
imagecropper – our most important control
Of course we ’ll use Yahoo combo handling and add the js to our page along with the CSS needed for the above controls :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " href = "
http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/resize/assets/skins/sam/resize.css " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " href = "
http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.2/build/imagecropper/assets/skins/sam/imagecropper.css "
/> <!-- js --> < script type =" text / javascript " src= "
http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.5.2/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&2.5.2/build/dragdrop/dragdrop-min.js&2.5.2/build/element/element-beta-min.js&2.5.2/build/resize/resize-beta-min.js&2.5.2/build/imagecropper/imagecropper-beta-min.js&2. 5.2/build/connection/connection-min.js&2.5.2/build/json/json-min.js " ></ script>
Next users must be able to upload images via AJAX , so we add a form to our page :
< form action =" upload.php " enctype=" multipart/form-data " method= " post " name=" uploadForm " id=" uploadForm " >
Image : < input type = " file " name= " uploadImage " id=" uploadImage " /> < input type=" button " id=" uploadButton " value= " Upload " /> </ form >
We have an onclick event to the upload button to fire the uploading process .
// add listeners YAHOO.util.Event.on('uploadButton ' , ' click ' , uploader.carry ) ;
We ’ll also need 2 containers :
imageContainer – will contain our uploaded image
downloadLink – will contain the download link
< div id=" imageContainer " ></div > < div id =" downloadLink " ></div >
Both containers will be updated via innerHTML afterwards .
AJAX upload
For the AJAX upload , Code Central
has an excellent tutorial which I highly recommend .
I took the code sample and modified it a bit to fit my needs .
Finally I came up with a nice JSON object called uploader which has one method , carry .
The latter just posts form data to a specified URL .
uploader = { carry : function ( ) { // set form YAHOO.util.Connect.setForm('uploadForm ' , true ) ; // upload image YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest(' POST ' , ' upload.php ' , { upload : function ( o ) { // parse our json data var jsonData = YAHOO.lang.JSON.parse(o.responseText ) ; // put image in our image container YAHOO.util.Dom.get ('imageContainer').innerHTML
= '< img id =" yuiImg " src= " ' + jsonData.image + ' " width= " ' + jsonData.width + ' " height= " ' + jsonData.height + ' " alt= " " />'; // init our photoshop photoshop.init(jsonData.image ) ; // get first cropped image photoshop.getCroppedImage ( ) ; } } ) ; } } ;
When upload is complete , we get the JSON data we mentioned earlier on .
For e.g :
{ " image " : " images/myimage.jpg " , " width " : " 500 " , " height " : 400}
With this data and using innerHTML we update our imageContainer div to put our image which will have yuiImg as id :
YAHOO.util.Dom.get('imageContainer').innerHTML
= '< img id =" yuiImg " src= " ' + jsonData.image + ' " width= " ' + jsonData.width + ' " height= " ' + jsonData.height + ' " alt= " " />';
It ’s very important to specify the image width and height else the image cropper wo n’t work .
Next we initialize another JSON object , photoshop which we ’ll have a look now .
Our photoshop object
photoshop = { image : null , crop : null , init : function ( image ) { // set our image photoshop.image = image ; // our image cropper from the uploaded image photoshop.crop = new YAHOO.widget.ImageCropper('yuiImg ' ) ; photoshop.crop.on(' moveEvent ' , function ( ) { // get updated coordinates photoshop.getCroppedImage ( ) ; } ) ; } , getCroppedImage : function ( ) { var coordinates = photoshop.getCoordinates ( ) ; var url = ' crop.php?image= ' + photoshop.image + ' &cropStartX= ' + coordinates.left +'&cropStartY= ' + coordinates.top +'&cropWidth= ' + coordinates.width +'& cropHeight= ' + coordinates .height ; YAHOO.util.Dom.get ('downloadLink').innerHTML
= ' < a href= " ' + url + '" > download cropped image</a>' ; } , getCoordinates : function ( ) { return photoshop.crop.getCropCoords ( ) ; } } ;
The init function iniatializes the YUI image cropper from the uploaded image which has yuiImg as id .
photoshop.crop = new YAHOO.widget.ImageCropper('yuiImg ' ) ;
We also subscribe to the moveEvent for the cropper since we ’ll need to update the download link for the cropped image .
So whenever the image cropper is moved / resized , we call the getCroppedImage function .
photoshop.crop.on(' moveEvent ' , function ( ) { // get updated coordinates photoshop.getCroppedImage ( ) ; } ) ;
The getCroppedImage function will generate the download link for the cropped image .
To do image cropping in PHP we ’ll need
the image we want to crop
the X , Y coordinates
height and width of the to be cropped area
Fortunately the YUI cropper utility has a function which will give us what we want , it ’s the getCropCoords ( ) method .
So , whenever the getCroppedImage function is called , we get the coordinates of the cropped area , build a URL and finally put the download link in our downloadLink container .
// get coordinates var coordinates = photoshop.getCoordinates ( ) ; // build our url var url = ' crop.php?image= ' + photoshop.image + ' &cropStartX= ' + coordinates.left +'&cropStartY= ' + coordinates.top +'&cropWidth= ' + coordinates.width +'& cropHeight= ' + coordinates .height ; // put download link in our page YAHOO.util.Dom.get ('downloadLink').innerHTML
= ' < a href= " ' + url + '" > download cropped image </a>';
This is all we need for the index page .
upload.php
if(!empty ($_FILES [ " uploadImage " ] ) ) { // get file name $ filename = basename ( $_FILES ['uploadImage ' ] [ ' name ' ] ) ; // get extension $ ext = substr ( $ filename , strrpos ( $ filename , '. ' ) + 1 ) ; // check for jpg only if ( $ext == " jpg " ) { // generate unique file name $ newName = ' images /'.time ( ) .'.'. $ ext ; // upload files if ( ( move_uploaded_file ( $_FILES [ 'uploadImage ' ] [ ' tmp_name ' ] , $ newName ) ) ) { // get height and width for image uploaded list ( $ width , $ height ) = getimagesize ( $newName ) ; // return json data echo ' { " image " : " '.$newName . ' " , " height " : " '. $ height . ' " , " width " : " '.$ width . ' " } '; } else { echo ' { " error " : " An error occurred while moving the files " } ' ; } } else { echo ' { " error " : " Invalid image format " } ' ; } }
The upload . php file too is self explanatory , we check for a jpg image only , then generate an unique filename , put it in the images folder and finally build json data which we ’ll use for DOM manipulation .
Of course the images folder must be writable by the web server .
crop.php
// get variables $ imgfile = $ _GET [ ' image ' ] ; $ cropStartX = $ _GET [' cropStartX ' ] ; $ cropStartY = $ _GET [' cropStartY ' ] ; $ cropW = $ _GET [ ' cropWidth ' ] ; $ cropH = $ _GET [' cropHeight ' ] ; //
Create two images $ origimg = imagecreatefromjpeg ( $imgfile ) ; $ cropimg = imagecreatetruecolor ( $ cropW , $cropH ) ; //
Get the original size list ( $ width , $ height ) = getimagesize ( $imgfile ) ; // Crop imagecopyresized ( $cropimg , $origimg , 0 , 0 , $ cropStartX , $ cropStartY , $ width , $ height , $ width , $ height ) ; // force download nes image header ( " Content - type : image / jpeg " ) ; header ( ' Content - Disposition : attachment ; filename= " '.$imgfile . ' " ' ) ; imagejpeg ( $ cropimg ) ; // destroy the images imagedestroy ( $ cropimg ) ; imagedestroy ( $origimg ) ;
Crop.php allows us to crop our uploaded image .
First we get all the variables passed to us via the AJAX request ,
// get variables $ imgfile = $ _GET [ ' image ' ] ; $ cropStartX = $ _GET [' cropStartX ' ] ; $ cropStartY = $ _GET [' cropStartY ' ] ; $ cropW = $ _GET [ ' cropWidth ' ] ; $ cropH = $ _GET [ ' cropHeight ' ] ;
Then we create 2 images , the original one and the cropped one , and use the imagecopyresized function to generate the cropped image .
We add some header information to tell the world it ’s an image and prompt for a save dialog .
Emacs Shortcuts
In the table and descriptions below the modifier M refers to the escape key .
The M is used for Meta , a modifier on the computer keyboards used when emacs was first developed .
The modifier C refers to the control key .
For example , M-x replace - string means " press escape , then x " in the command mini - buffer the prompt M-x will appear , type replace - string in the mini-buffer .
As another example , C-x c means " press the control key and the x key at the same time , then press the c key " .
Note that M , or escape , is pressed before another key whereas C , or control , is pressed at the same time as a key .
You can press the escape key directly , but C - [ is an abbreviation for escape ( it does n't require stretching your pinky a long way to get to the escape key ) .
At any point you can find all the bindings in effect by typing
C-h b
Commands I use all the time
M-space
Set the mark
Move the cursor / point -- in xemacs a region is grayed out when you do this
Delete the current region ( betwen point and mark ) with C-w
Editing Commands
key combination functionality C-d delete character to right of cursor ( current char ) M-d delete one word to right of cursor C-w kill current region ( between point and mark ) M-w copy current region ( often yanked next ) C-x u undo M-f move forward one word at a time M - b move backward one word at a time M -< move to top of buffer M-> move to bottom of buffer C-x C-s save current buffer C-k kill from cursor to end of line C-y yank - back ( paste ) last killed thing M C-q
With the cursor on a left - curly brace automagically indent everything to the matching brace .
M-/ auto - complete the identifier you 've started to type

Cheney 's worst thing
The evening 's water torture :
COURIC ( to Biden ) :
What do you think is the best and worst thing that Dick Cheney has done as vice president ?
BIDEN : I 'm not being a wise guy here about I do n't know what he 's done .
I mean , there 's not many things I 'd pick that I thought he 's done that have been good .
But I admire his strength .
I admire his willingness to take positions that are completely contrary to popular opinion .
But I think that what he 's done has been just — I do n't think Dick Cheney trusts that the American people can make judgments that are in the interest of the country .
But I think the thing I think he 's really really think he 's done .
I think he 's done more harm than any other single elected official in memory in terms of shredding the constitution .
You know — condoning torture .
Pushing torture as a policy .
This idea of a unitary executive .
Meaning the Congress and the people have no power in a time of war .
And the president controls everything .
I do n't have any animus toward Dick Cheney , but I really do think his attitude about the Constitution and the prosecution of this war has been absolutely wrong .
PALIN : Worst thing , I guess that would have been the duck hunting accident — where , you know , that was an accident .
And I think that was made into a caricature of him .
And that was kind of unfortunate .
So the best thing , though , he 's shown support , along with George W. Bush , of our troops .
And I 've been there when George Bush has spoken to families of those who have suffered greatly , those who are serving in the military .
I 've been there when President Bush has embraced those families and expressed the concern and the sympathy speaking for all of America in those times .
And for Dick Cheney to have supported that effort of George Bush 's , I respect that .

" VICE PRESIDENTIAL QUESTIONS " ON TONIGHT'S
" CBS EVENING NEWS WITH KATIE COURIC "
Following is the transcript from tonight 's broadcast .
Mandatory credit : the CBS EVENING NEWS WITH KATIE COURIC
Tonight 's questions to Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Sarah Palin are :
· What do you think is the best thing and the worst thing that Dick Cheney has done as vice president ?
· What previous vice president most impresses you and why ?
· What is your favorite movie and why ?
COURIC : Back now from St. Louis .
Tonight 's Vice Presidential debate here will give voters an opportunity to find out where Joe Biden and Sarah Palin stand on a host of issues .
But we want to help you get to know the candidates as people with a series we call " Vice Presidential Questions . "
Tonight , I ask them about the office their seeking and the people who have held it .
COURIC : What previous Vice President impresses you the most and why ?
PALIN : Oh my goodness .
It would have to be -- Vice President -- just a candidate , and that would have to have been Geraldine Ferraro , of course .
That 's an easy one for me because she 's -- she 's the one who first shattered part of that glass ceiling anyway in American politics .
So it would be she as a candidate .
COURIC : What about as an actual Vice President if you had to name one ?
PALIN : My goodness .
I think those who have gone on to the Presidency -- George Bush Sr , having -- kind of learned the ropes in his position as VP and then moving on up .
BIDEN : Lyndon Johnson .
For all the foibles he had as President -- in people 's minds -- he really knew how the system worked .
He was able to be a significant facilitator of a -- new frontier .
New policy .
People in the Congress knew him , knew he knew a lot .
And so I hope one of my roles as Vice President will be as the person actually implementing Barack Obama 's policy .
You gotta get the Congress to go along with it .
And I -- presumptuous to say , but I know it pretty well .
And I think I am fairly respected on both sides of the aisle .
COURIC ( to Biden ) :
What do you think is the best and worst thing that Dick Cheney has done as Vice President ?
BIDEN : I 'm not being a wise guy here about I do n't know what he 's done .
I mean , there 's not many things I 'd pick that I thought he 's done that have been good .
But I admire his strength .
I admire his willingness to take positions that are completely contrary to popular opinion .
But I think that what he 's done has been just -- I do n't think Dick Cheney trusts that the American people can make judgments that are in the interest of the country .
But I think the thing I think he 's really really think he 's done .
I think he 's done more harm than any other single elected official in memory in terms of shredding the constitution .
You know -- condoning torture .
Pushing torture as a policy .
This idea of a unitary executive .
Meaning the Congress and the people have no power in a time of war .
And the President controls everything / / I do n't have any animus toward Dick Cheney but I really do think his attitude about the constitution and the prosecution of this war has been absolutely wrong .
PALIN : Worst thing I guess that would have been the duck hunting accident -- where you know , that was an accident .
And I think that was made into a caricature of him .
And that was kind of unfortunate .
So the best thing though , he 's shown support , along with George W. Bush , of our troops .
And I 've been there when George Bush has spoken to families of those who have suffered greatly , those who are serving in the military .
I 've been there when President Bush has embraced those families and expressed the concern and the sympathy speaking for all of America in those times .
And for Dick Cheney to have supported that effort of George Bush 's , I respect that .
COURIC : What 's your favorite movie and why ?
BIDEN : Chariots of Fire , is I think probably my favorite movie .
But the truth of the matter is the thing about it there it's a place where someone put personal fame and glory behind principles .
And you know , that to me , is the mark of real heroism , um when someone would do that .
COURIC : Do you remember your favorite scene from that movie ?
BIDEN : I think the favorite scene is when he is making the decision and talking to his about do I do this ?
What do I do ?
He so desperately wanted to run , but concluded he could n't .
BIDEN : It was that , you know , that moment of decision , I think that was my favorite scene .
I also like the scene on the beach where you know he 's just running
PALIN : I love those old sports movies , like Hoosiers , and Rudy , um , those that show that the underdog can make it and it's all about tenacity , and work ethic and determination , and just doing the right thing , so it would probably be one of those two old sports movies .
COURIC : Do you have a favorite scene from either of them ?
PALIN : At the very end , the victories !
Yeah !
Rudy , where he gets to run out on the field and he gets to participate and make a difference .
And then in Hoosiers , when they win .
Ms. Morris confronted Mr. Stevens with several e-mail messages and notes he had written or received that praised Mr. Allen ’s contributions to the renovation of the Stevens home .
She concluded each reading with a variation of this question : “ So , is it still your testimony to this jury that you did not know ” that Mr. Allen and his company were showering you with gifts ?
Mr. Stevens , 84 , insisted each time that although he had known that many of the workers at his home were employees of Veco , he had not known that Veco played any role in the renovation .
“ Veco was not involved in renovating my house , ” he said angrily .
He thought the workers were employed by a different contractor who had been paid by his wife , he said .
Although he was testy , even hostile , with Ms. Morris in their first encounter last week , he was more subdued Monday as he seemed to be laboring to keep his temper in check .
Lawyers for both sides will make closing arguments Tuesday , and the jury is set to begin considering its verdict Wednesday .
Mr. Stevens and his wife , Catherine , have testified that they paid $ 160,000 to contractors other than Veco for the renovation and thought that covered the entire cost .

Prosecutors had apparently decided not to play a tape of a telephone conversation recorded by the F.B.I. in which Mr. Stevens tells Mr. Allen that all the money Mr. Allen put into the house could land them in legal trouble .
Interviews with My Somewhat Racist Relatives
Or , How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Ignore the Bradley Effect
Jesse Earl Hyde Collection , Case Western Reserve University , Department of Geological Sciences
The state of Virginia , which has n't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964 , is leaning toward Barack Obama .
So is North Carolina , which has only voted for a Democratic president once : Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
The polls are cheering and news no one expected , but Obama supporters — at least the ones I know — are still chewing their tongues and sleeping poorly .
Racism , they mutter .
Americans will never elect a black man for president .
Then , without fail , they mention the Bradley effect .
In 1982 , a black Democrat named Tom Bradley lost the governorship of California to a white Republican even though , just days before the election , polls gave Bradley a double - digit lead .
During the 1980s , a negative gap between poll numbers and election results continued to afflict black candidates running in Chicago , New York , and Virginia .
If Obama loses this election , he 'll lose it to the Bradley effect .
( If he loses honestly , that is .
If he loses dishonestly , he 'll lose to the Diebold effect . )
Some good news :
In August , a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard released a statistical study showing that the Bradley effect vanished around 1996 , and last week , the University of Washington released a statistical study showing a reverse Bradley effect during the presidential primaries .
You can't really survey for the Bradley effect , since it's all about people saying one thing to pollsters and doing another thing in the voting booth .
And racism is not monolithic .
It has shades and nuances .
But lately I 've been wondering whether Obama 's particular heritage — being a descendant of voluntary African immigration rather than a descendant of American slavery — will help him with the borderline bigots .
Borderline bigots , the ones who are shy about being perceived as bigots , are the engine of the Bradley effect .
It just so happens that there are a bunch of them among my relatives , some of them openly racist ( though they prefer the term " prejudiced " ) , who live in Suffolk , Virginia , in a town just across from the North Carolina border and right next to the Great Dismal Swamp .
The Williamses — my mother 's family — are Southerners ' Southerners , the iconic kind .
They live among the pine trees , on family land , with falling - down tool sheds , caches of Civil War memorabilia , and ponds you can catch turtles in .
They came from England before the American Revolution , owned slaves , were financially ruined during the Civil War and Reconstruction , built themselves back up , and were ruined again by the Great Depression .
Everyone goes to church and a few have been to college .
They know the family legends up and down : how our ancestor Captain Thad was shot through the forehead in the summer of 1864 at the Battle of Petersburg ; how my granddad was so poor his family used to eat rotten meat , setting it up on a hot tin roof to drive the maggots out before cooking it ; how , in those days , great - granddad tanned granddad 's hide for forgetting to lock up the mule , which drank all the lemonade the family had made for a wedding ( lemons were expensive then ) ; and how the black neighborhood is called " Williamstown " because , they say , many of its residents are descendants of slaves that the family used to own .
Paradoxically , my mother thinks her generation is more segregated than my grandparents ' generation .
My granddad , for ex ample , worked alongside black folks on the family farm and later hired a couple of longtime black assistants when he was a bricklayer .
But the upheavals of the 1950s and 1960s created feelings of unease and distrust among whites .
White folks and black folks did n't know how to be together anymore , so they drifted apart .
My granddad lost a business to those fraught years .
He invested a lot of time and money turning a raw piece of land into a swimming pool with a snack bar and picnic area .
He and his family worked nights and weekends felling trees , excavating , killing copperheads , laying brick .
When the pool opened in the summer of 1964 , a century after Captain Thad was shot through the forehead , it was whites - only by default .
Three years later , just when the pool was starting to turn a profit , a black family showed up to swim .
My mother remembers watching granddad walk past the white bathers and talking quietly with the black family , telling them they were n't allowed in .
It hurt him , my mother says — he did n't want to turn them away , but knew that if he had n't , his white clientele would evaporate .
The way granddad saw it , he had three choices : integrate the pool , keep it segregated and risk a lawsuit , or turn his back on years of family labor and close it .
He was n't willing to do the first , was n't able to afford the second , so took the third — agonizing — choice .
My family 's bitterness about the 1960s is not an abstraction .
So when I called a few of them on the phone the other day to talk about Obama , their tone was less anxious that I 'd expected .
Most of them are conservatives — one uncle called this presidential contest " a race between two Democrats " — but they do n't seem particularly concerned that a black man is running for president .
I tested out my theory about Obama not being a descendant of slavery .
I asked one of my older female relatives whether she thought of Obama in the same category as Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson , and other black politicians she considers openly hostile to the interests of white folks .
" Well I reckon there 's a difference , " she said .
" Those [ descendants of slavery ] still want to blame you and I for what happened to 'em .
In reality , it was their own people who sold them into slavery for money .
Their people did it to 'em .
But if somebody came of their own accord , it might not bother him so much . "
Obama has been very careful to not seem like a bitter black man , and my Southern relatives are extremely sensitive to any hints of black anger or resentment ( one relative says the NAACP wants to turn black people " into gods on earth " ) .
If they do n't see bitterness in Obama , the strategy is working .
No matter what happens in November , Obama has smashed the mold for black political leaders .
( Which is probably why Tavis Smiley — who saw himself as the heir apparent of the Jackson / Sharpton / reparations school of black politics — reflexively opposed Obama .
He was jealous . )
Racism in the South is also changing , receding from the public sphere while staying in the private sphere .
Meaning :
You can keep your prejudice and still vote for a nonwhite politician .
" If Colin Powell were running , I 'd vote for him in a heartbeat , " one of my aunts said .
Then , later in the conversation , " I do n't want any of my kids marrying outside their race . "
What if one of your kids wanted to marry Colin Powell ?
" No .
I know it sounds un -Christian , but I have certain expectations .
Black people just are n't attractive to me .
I would n't want a little black grandbaby . "
So you think Colin Powell is intelligent , honest , and capable ?
" Oh yes . "
Good enough to be the most powerful man in the most powerful country on earth — but not good enough to marry your daughter ?
" I just do n't think the races should mix . "
It might not sound like it , but that 's progress .
Twenty - six years ago — back when Tom Bradley lost the California gubernatorial race — people like my aunt would n't have copped to voting for a black man for anything .
Since then , Virginia has elected the nation 's first black governor : Douglas Wilder in 1990 .
And the city of Suffolk , home of " Williamstown , " elected its first black mayor , Curtis Milteer .
In 2002 , Milteer jumped into national headlines by declaring April to be Confederate History Month .
His successors , all white , have refused to declare a Confederate History Month .
( " Buncha wusses , " another aunt said .
" Scared of their own heritage and history . " )
The racism abides , but is in its autumn — slowly changing colors and fading away .
That aunt who'd want Colin Powell for a president but not an in - law ?
She raised a few eyebrows in her day by marrying an Italian Catholic from Massachusetts .
While we talked on the telephone , she told me her daughter is raising a few eyebrows by dating a nice Jewish boy .
The average American child spends nearly 12,000 hours in school , from kindergarten through 12th grade .
That 's a big chunk of time during which he or she can develop good ( or bad ) health habits .
Happily , schools today are recognizing the many benefits of a healthy head start -- and Health magazine wants to recognize the ones that are doing an A+ job .
To find the health stars in America 's vast public school universe , we asked education officials in every state for their nominations ; we scored those based on how they measured up to some tough criteria ( see How we chose our winners , and the semifinalists were ranked by our panel of experts ( at right ) .
Congratulations to all of the inspiring winners !
West Babylon Senior High
West Babylon , New York
1,510 students in grades 9 through 12
What can you say about a high school where the assistant principal strolls the cafeteria with a basket of fruit ?
Top honors go to this outstanding school , which scored high across the board in every category -- from nutrition to employee wellness .
At West Babylon , all soda machines have been removed , so the only drinks available are water , milk , and fruit juice ; the revamped cafeteria features a menu that emphasizes healthy choices , like wraps and yogurt , and has replaced fryers with state - of - the - art ovens ; and participants in after - school activities are encouraged to stay on campus for healthy snacks and light meals in the cafeteria .
A districtwide commitment to fitness is paying big dividends , too :
The student obesity rate dropped 2 percent in just one school year -- and continues to decline .
And West Babylon is particularly proud of its new physical education curriculum that focuses on overall wellness , social skills , and lifetime and adventure activities .
This initiative appeals to even the least - athletic students and received praise from fitness judges Jennifer Caputo and Harley Pasternak .
" This approach shows how students of all skill and ability levels can be exposed to and benefit from being physically active , " Caputo says .
But perhaps the ultimate winning aspect of West Babylon is the commitment of its students , who drive the School Wellness Council and conduct only healthy fund - raisers .
No more candy sales !
Instead , kids sell baby carrots , sugar - free gelatin , raisins , and nuts .
Amory Middle
Amory , Mississippi
479 students in grades 6 through 8
A battle against its state 's obesity problem , combined with admirable creativity , make this middle school not only Mississippi 's shining star but also a national model .
The fitness push at Amory was off the charts :
The school collaborated with a home - improvement retailer to build a rock - climbing wall , set up an on - site fitness center that offers twice - weekly family - friendly activities from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. , and implemented a schoolwide mission to get ( and keep ) kids moving .
" We have become Dance , Dance Revolution , " principal Cheryl Moore says .
" We traverse the rock - climbing wall , play ping - pong , power walk , and much more . "
Amory also wowed panelists with its hydration policy , which allows students to bring water into the classroom , and its healthy - snack policy , which bridges the gap to lunch .
Plus , the school provides great nutritional education through its healthful lunch menus and special events like the Healthy Wok workshop .
The school 's faculty - driven push to incorporate health education throughout the curriculum earned a high mark from health -ed judge Areva Martin , who saw this as a way to give students " a solid foundation for healthy living . "
Rawhide Elementary
Gillette , Wyoming
170 students in grades K through 6
Our panelists raved about this small , rural school 's commitment to health and the way the sprawling 5,000 - square - mile district helps to make it happen .
" This is a model of excellence that should be copied around the nation , " judge Martin says .
" Collaborating with parents and community stakeholders is one of the most important aspects of promoting healthy living .
This ensures that healthy lifestyles are n't just talked about while in school but are actually practiced at home and in the community . "
With district financial support , Raw­hide employs a Building Fitness Coordinator in addition to its physical education instructor , a remarkable step for an elementary school ; as a result , students get 20 minutes of daily " wellness time " in addition to recess and PE .
The Cardiac Club , which gives students and faculty the opportunity to do a variety of fitness activities , meets every morning .
Plus , there 's a walking loop on campus .
Rawhide 's strong health component begins in kindergarten and covers nutrition , personal safety , drug - abuse prevention , and lifetime fitness .
And the staff is encouraged to stay healthy , too , thanks to TriFIT testing ( which is used to monitor and improve fitness levels ) , yoga classes , and discounted fitness - club and recreation - center memberships .
This commitment to teaching children how to be healthy kids and active adults , combined with Rawhide 's staff - wellness initiatives , demonstrates a consistency of message that impressed judge Pasternak .

Anthony Elementary
Leavenworth , Kansas
300 students in grades K through 5
" Bravo ! " cheers Pasternak , who gives his highest score to this urban elementary school .
Anthony created its " Eat , Exercise , Excel " program to turn itself from a school struggling with low academic performance to one that achieved excellence rankings and a 95 percent reduction in office referrals all in a year , largely by emphasizing fitness and nutrition .
On the fitness front , Anthony 's students get almost an hour of activity every day through three 30 - minute PE classes per week and a daily 45 - minute structured recess , during which students rotate between three different games ( participation is mandatory ) .
This active break is a hit among the kids .
And teachers have noted numerous benefits , including increased attentiveness after breaks and less bullying during recess .
" This program shows the full benefits that can be derived from increasing physical activity , " says Caputo , who gave the school her only 10 .

Another innovation : Lunch is eaten in classrooms amid a family atmosphere that emphasizes conversation .
" The noise level is low , making this the ideal time for teachers and students to build positive relationships , " principal Janine Kempker says .
This impressed judge Amy Lanou : " Anyone who has visited a school cafeteria knows that the loud and rushed atmosphere is n't conducive to healthy eating , good digestion , or nutrition education . "
Also , daily recommended dietary allowance ( RDA ) vitamins are available to students ( with parental permission ) , a program used by 70 percent of school families .
Richmond Elementary
Appleton , Wisconsin
277 students in grades K through 6
Instilling health and wellness values is definitely a team effort at this school .
Everyone -- PE and classroom teachers , counselors , administrators , food - service workers -- demonstrates and reinforces healthy lifestyle choices for the students , earning Richmond Elementary top scores in every area from our judges .
Health.com :
Where did all the school nurses go ?
Pasternak loved " Fit in 15 , " twice - weekly , 15 - minute - long activity breaks lead by classroom teachers .
And Caputo cited the positive reinforcement of Richmond 's Walk / Run for Life program , which rewards students for miles logged during recess .
The school also has reached out to area businesses for creative after - school initiatives that include martial arts and " Bus and Bowl , " a partnership with a local bowling alley that picks kids up from school and allows them to bowl until their parents pick them up .
A strong commitment to health - and - nutrition education is also yielding lifestyle changes outside Richmond 's cafeteria , which is already a healthy haven .
" We 've found that educating children about making healthy food choices has influenced the choices that are being made at home , " principal Bobbie Schmidt writes .
Nutrition panelist Rochelle Davis gave Richmond her highest score .
And judge Lanou says she 's impressed by how the staff sets examples for healthy eating .
Mountain Valley Middle
Mexico , Maine
320 students in grades 6 through 8
Morning at Mountain Valley Middle : Kids and teachers eat nutritious breakfasts in their classrooms .
Through this innovative approach , piloted last year , students begin their days more attentively and learn conversation skills and table manners from their role models .
This was n't the only creative idea our judges lauded at this far - north , rural school .
Mountain Valley takes full advantage of its outdoor ethos , getting kids moving in activities like mountain biking , canoeing , kayaking , and even moonlight snowshoe walks .
Special recognition goes to Mountain Valley for facing a growing problem among adolescents : suicide .
The school has addressed this issue head - on in its health curriculum .
" So often health education focuses exclusively on physical health , " judge Martin says .
" With all of the influences students are exposed to , ensuring good mental health should be a high priority for all schools . "
Miami Springs Middle
Miami Springs , Florida
1,818 students in grades 6 through 8
Healthy reform at this large , urban middle school started in the cafeteria , which eliminated all white - flour products , former principal Gail Quigley , EdD , says .
" We do n't serve dessert or fried food , and we offer a wide range of fresh fruits and vegetables . "
Sugary cereals have been banned from breakfast .
And all à la carte items meet the stringent criteria of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation , an organization devoted to ending childhood obesity .
" Excellent , and at first difficult , choices are being made about the foods served by the school , " nutrition panelist Lanou says .
Equally impressive is the effort at the staff level : Health education that 's blended into the science curriculum caught the eye of judge Martin , who called it " a creative way to instill healthy habits in students . "
Plus , the teachers have set up a gym in their lounge , and they attend on - site Weight Watchers classes and participate in a walking club .
Lakewood Elementary
Cecilia , Kentucky
631 students in grades pre-K through 5
It 's never too early to understand that each person is responsible for his or her own health .
And Lakewood 's students get this message loud and clear in all facets of the school 's Nutrition , Fitness , and Health curriculum .
Each student sets an individual fitness goal in PE and monitors his or her own progress .
Health.com : Healthiest schools , state by state
" Helping the children set personal goals and giving them valuable feedback about their progress can be a great motivational tool , " fitness panelist Caputo says .
Lakewood also prides itself on providing adaptive PE to every student , including those who have special needs .
Judges Caputo and Pasternak say this emphasis on making programs available to all students regardless of fitness levels is " essential . "
The cafeteria grants students choices , too , and backs this up with extensive nutritional education .
" This integrated model and focus on real - life problem - solving are outstanding ways to teach healthy lifestyles , " panelist Martin says .
" Learning at an early age to be self - sufficient and to take personal responsibility for your own health and life leads to solid decision - making skills . "
W.C. Britt Elementary
Snellville , Georgia
900 students in K through 5
Outstanding , culturally sensitive , creative health - curriculum solutions are among the hallmarks of this large elementary school , and they really got panelist Martin 's attention .
( She gave W.C. Britt her only perfect 10 . )
This school keeps its students engaged with taste tests , farm visits , school gardening , community - health - related plays , annual visits from local dentists , and more .
" I love the games , contests , and promotions .
We know that when kids are motivated , they do their best work -- and that learning goes beyond simply ' preparing for the test . '
This program is instilling values that will remain with these students for a lifetime , " Martin says .
Our fitness and nutrition panelists liked what they saw , too , but the integration of innovative health initiatives is what put this lively school into the top 10 .
Martin sums it up : " Community partners , other disciplines , sports , cooking -- I wish schools across the country would use this program . "

The memoirs of most pop stars follow a formula , describing in lurid detail their sexual exploits and battles with drug addiction .
Sir Cliff Richard 's autobiography is a little different , if no less illuminating .
The 67 - year - old singer has spoken for the first time about his close relationship with a former Roman Catholic priest , and calls on the Church of England to approve same - sex marriages .
Sir Cliff describes how he struck up an intimate friendship with an American former missionary , Fr John McElynn , after meeting him in New York seven years ago .
The famously clean - cut pop singer reveals that he hired Fr McElynn to look after his charitable projects and numerous houses , after it became clear the American would give up the priesthood .
The pair now live together .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the book , Sir Cliff calls the former clergyman his " companion " and " blessing " , going on to say he is " sick to death " of media speculation about his sexuality .
" Our arrangement has worked out really well , " he writes .
" John and I have over time struck up a close friendship .
He has also become a companion , which is great because I do n't like living alone , even now . "
Sir Cliff , a poster boy for the Christian faith , also defends his decision to remain a bachelor in the book , titled My Life , My Way .
" People often make the mistake of thinking that only marriage equals happiness , " he writes .
" I may suddenly meet someone and feel differently , but right now I am not sure marriage would enhance my happiness .
As for my sexuality , I am sick to death of the media 's speculation about it .
What business is it of anyone else 's what any of us are as individuals ?
I do n't think my fans would care either way . "
He calls on the Church of England to update its views on same - sex marriages , arguing that all judgements on sexuality should be left to God .
" I think the Church must come round and see people as they are now .
Gone are the days when we assumed loving relationships would be solely between men and women .
It seems to me that commitment is the issue , and if anyone comes to me and says : ' This is my partner ; we are committed to each other ' , then I do n't care what their sexuality is .
I 'm not going to judge ; I 'll leave that to God . "
Sir Cliff chose the Lakeside Shopping Centre in Essex to sign copies of his book yesterday .
More than 1,000 fans , mostly female , turned up .
In the book , Sir Cliff , who has sold more than 250 million records over six decades , reveals that the only two women he considered marrying were the dancer Jackie Irving and Sue Barker , the sports presenter .
He describes Ms Irving , with whom he had a relationship in the early 1960s , as " utterly beautiful " , and says for a time they were " inseparable " .
She married Adam Faith .
Sir Cliff met Sue Barker in 1982 .
They quickly formed a close attachment thanks to their shared passions for tennis and Christianity .
" I seriously contemplated asking her to marry me , " he writes , " but in the end I realised that I did n't love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her .
There were no broken hearts . "
He also describes the time he was famously seduced by Carol Costa , the estranged wife of Jet Harris , a member of his backing group , The Shadows .
" I was surprised but not unhappy to be seduced " , he writes , but stresses that " sex is not one of the things that drives me " .
In 1996 , he flatly denied he was gay .
" I 'm aware of the rumours , but I 'm not gay . "
Steve Turner , who wrote a biography of Sir Cliff in 1993 , said : " Of all the people I 've interviewed , from David Bowie to the Beatles , he 's the one most people ask me about .
With Cliff , there 's always that element of uncertainty and puzzlement , because there 's something unresolved about his image . "
Polls from four key swing states show no big national movement after this summer 's widely watched party conventions , and they offer signs that the candidates ' handling of economic questions in coming debates could be decisive in the presidential election .
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama holds slight leads over Republican Sen. John McCain in Michigan , Minnesota , Colorado and Wisconsin , where Quinnipiac University conducted new polls in conjunction with The Wall Street Journal and Washingtonpost.com .
But his leads are n't commanding , and all the states appear to be in play .
The best news for Sen .
Obama in the new surveys may come in Colorado , where he has moved to a lead of four percentage points , 49 % - 45 % , after being down by a percentage point in August .
That means he has a chance there to turn a traditionally Republican state in his direction .
Meanwhile , Sen. McCain seems to have a good shot at turning a blue state red in Minnesota , where Sen.
Obama leads 47 % - 45 % , which falls within the poll 's margin of error .
In Michigan , Sen. Obama holds a four - point edge , 48 % - 44 % .
His largest lead is in Wisconsin , where the race stands at 49 % - 42 % .
The economy was key to speeches by both Obama and McCain Barack Obama 's campaign has dismissed a $ 300 bn plan by John McCain to help struggling homeowners for being " costly and out of touch " .
Both men were back on the campaign trail after a TV debate on Tuesday .
With the ailing US economy a key issue for voters , Mr McCain fleshed out his plan for the government to buy up loans from troubled homeowners .
Mr Obama accused his rival of copying Bush administration policies that " led us into this mess in the first place " .
The candidates swiftly endorsed a coordinated action by the Federal Reserve and central banks in other countries to cut in interest rates by 0.5 % to stimulate world growth .
Senator Obama called for Congress to pass another economic stimulus package , and was boosted by a new poll showing him ahead on all main topics , with a substantial 13 % lead on the key issue of the economy .
See full list of issues being tracked Senator McCain urged the adoption of the plan to help home - owners that he proposed during the second of three debates in Nashville , Tennessee , on Tuesday .
Economic focus
On Wednesday , the Arizona senator held joint campaign appearances with running mate Sarah Palin in the key northern swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania .
The dream of owning a home should not be crushed under the weight of bad mortgages
John McCain
Republican presidential candidate
At a rally in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , Mr McCain called his home ownership resurgence plan " a critical first step our country must take to get through this time of crisis " .
He said the loans of homeowners who had seen their home 's value fall below their debt would be structured into affordable mortgages .
Mrs Palin , meanwhile , said Mr Obama 's efforts to tie Mr McCain to Mr Bush were " starting to wear pretty darn thin " .
" Last night Senator McCain talked about real and pragmatic solutions , " said Mrs Palin .
" Barack Obama talked about why he'd rather run against George Bush . "
The Obama campaign dismissed Mr McCain 's financial proposal as " more costly and out - of - touch than we ever imagined " .
" John McCain wants the government to massively overpay for mortgages in a plan that would guarantee taxpayers lose money , " said Jason Furman , Mr Obama 's senior economic advisor .
' No bamboozling '
Meanwhile , the Democratic candidate focused on his healthcare plans during a rally in Indiana , a state once regarded as safely Republican but which now seems within his reach as polls swing in the Democrats ' favour .
Polls suggest the Illinois senator has a bigger lead on health care than on any other issue .
Linking the economic proposals of Mr McCain to those of President George W Bush , Mr Obama said it was " a time for resolve and steady leadership " .
Palin 's criticism of Obama was blunter than her running partner 's
He added that his rival thought Americans would not notice the downsides of the McCain campaign health - care proposals .
" We 're not going to be hoodwinked , " said Mr Obama .
" We 're not going to be bamboozled .
We 're not going to let him get away with it . "
A new monthly poll from Rasmussen suggested that the Democrats were now more trusted than the Republicans on all 10 issues that they have been tracking for the past year .
The Democrats have the biggest lead on domestic issues , such as health care , education and social security , but they are also now more trusted on foreign policy issues such as the War on Terror , immigration and Iraq .
In earlier polls , Republicans had led on these issues .
A new Gallup poll also suggests that more voters are likely to vote for Mr Obama because of his economic tax plans , while on balance more voters have an unfavourable view of Mr McCain 's economic policies .
Polls suggest most Americans thought Mr Obama came out on top after the Nashville debate , with Mr McCain failing to land a knock - out punch .
Attack ads
With the 4 November election nearing , the campaigns have become more aggressive , launching new television adverts attacking their opponent 's credentials .
Joe Biden criticised attacks on Obama , his running partner Mr McCain 's team released an advertisement attacking Mr Obama 's character and suggesting he is simply not presidential .
For its part , the Obama camp's new advertisement attacks the Republican 's health care proposal for taxing employer - based insurance plans , the type held by the majority of US workers .
Meanwhile , Joe Biden , Senator Obama 's running mate , has attacked the negative tone of the McCain campaign .
He said that attempts by his vice - presidential rival , Sarah Palin , to link Mr Obama to a former domestic terrorist was an effort to inject fear and loathing into the campaign .
Mr Biden - who was on Wednesday campaigning in Florida , another key swing state that has been hard - hit by the economic crisis - called the Republican effort to tie Senator Obama to 1960s radical William Ayers , now a Chicago professor , " mildly dangerous " .

Stun gun manufacturer rolls out devices that promise to “ drop everyone in a given area to the ground ”
Steve Watson

Everyone ’s favourite stun gun manufacturer
Taser has unveiled it ’s latest loving piece of “ non lethal ” technology , The Taser Shockwave .
The new weapon is significantly different to the Tasers currently used by police in that it has six different electrified charges and is designed to target crowds rather than individuals .
The cartridges are tethered by 25 - foot wires , which can be fired from a distance of up to 100 meters in a 20 - degree arc .
The “ probes ” on the end of the cartridges can pierce through clothing and skin , emitting 50,000 volts of electricity in the process .
“ Full area coverage is provided to instantaneously incapacitate multiple personnel within that region ” Taser explains .
“ Multiple Shockwave units can be stacked together ( like building blocks ) either horizontally or vertically in order to extend area coverage or vertically to allow for multiple salvo engagements . ”
The product description states .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The weapons can also be vehicle mounted or “ daisy chained ” according to Taser .
Clearly it is anticipated that these things will be used on sizable crowds , meaning an increased likelihood of indiscriminate targeting .
Watch a presentation on the Shockwave from Taser :
The Shockwave is n’t the only new development on Taser ’s books either .
The Extended - Range Electronic Projectile ( XREP ) is touted as the first electric shock weapon that can be fired from a normal gun , in this case a 12 - gauge shotgun .
It delivers a 20 - second shock , compared with the default setting five - second shock of a traditional taser X26 .
“ To maximize incapacitation , the XREP engine incorporates a microprocessor controlled optimal electrode selection technology .
Twenty times per second , the XREP engine checks for the optimal electrode connection to maximize the contact spread and achieve greatest incapacitation . ”
Taser states .
Watch a demonstration :
Both the Taser Shockwave and the XREP are scheduled to go into full production by the end of this year .
Taser has been the subject of much controversy and outrage .
One year ago the UN ’s Committee Against Torture issued a statement on the TaserX26 , which read : “ The use of TaserX26 weapons , provoking extreme pain , constituted a form of torture , and that in certain cases it could also cause death , as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use . ”
We still await more loving developments from Taser including the much anticipated Taser saucer .

The proposal would protect women 's jobs during and after maternity leave
The European Commission has proposed extending fully - paid maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks .
The commission , the EU 's executive , also said the same maternity benefits should apply to self - employed women .
The commission said longer maternity leave would encourage women to return to work after having children .
Critics have said small businesses will struggle to meet the costs and that national governments should decide on such matters , not the EU .
Maternity leave currently varies from 14 weeks in Germany to 18 months in Sweden , with many countries offering less than 18 weeks .
The proposed new rules would guarantee that women in the 27 EU countries would not be sacked during or immediately after maternity leave .
Governments would be free to offer new mothers more time off , but would have to pay them at least as much as sick leave .
" Our proposals to improve maternity leave will help women to combine work and family life , improving their and their family 's quality of life , " said EU Social Affairs Commissioner Vladimir Spidla .
Mr Spidla also said encouraging mothers back into work would help offset Europe 's ageing work force .
But it is not up to " Brussels to tell British mothers and fathers how much leave they should take , " said Conservative MEP Philip Bushill - Matthews .
" Small businesses will struggle to afford this extra cost , " said Mr Bushill - Matthews , the Conservative employment spokesman in the European Parliament .
" Ultimately some of the smallest businesses may think twice about employing young women through fear of them going on maternity leave , " he said .

Now , hatred is by far the longest pleasure ; men love in haste , but they detest at leisure .
~ Lord Byron
For the past eight years , Republicans have diligently cultivated the doctrine of Fhrerprinzip and nurtured the Cult of the Imperial Presidency .
In two weeks the harvest will start to come in as the voters ratify the reign of His Ineffable Holiness , Obama the Blessed ( peace be upon him ) .
By no later than next Spring , the Republicans — who will deservedly be reduced not merely to the status of minority party , but that of an unpleasant political afterthought — will be force - fed the nettles that sprouted from the seeds of despotism they planted during Bush the Lesser ’s first term .
Between the passage of the post - 9/11 Authorization for Use of Military Force ( aka the Enabling Act ) in 2001 , and enactment of the Military Commissions
Act just before the 2006 mid-term elections , the Republican Party demolished every remaining restraint on executive power .
In the past few weeks , amid an economic disaster precipitated in large measure by Republican - approved public profligacy , Republicans ( with the honorable and consistent exception of Washington ’s sole statesman , Rep. Ron Paul , and a handful of others ) eagerly collaborated with Democrats in creating an economic dictatorship operating out of the Treasury Department .
They also authorized the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars to socialize the costs of fraud and criminal corruption on Wall Street .
Bush the Lesser thus ends his lamentable reign by presiding over the greatest redistribution of wealth in human history .
This accomplishment makes a very nice matched set with the Bush Regime ’s other significant achievement , a fully functioning system of totalitarian control that is only now beginning to make its presence felt in tangible ways .
It ’s entirely appropriate that Hugo Chavez , the repellent yet consistently quotable Marxist ruler of Venezuela , has gloatingly observed that “ Comrade Bush … is to the left of me now . ”
Republicans seeking to stave off their richly deserved electoral massacre have rummaged through their shelves in search of a credible re-election theme , only to find that the cupboard is bare , the pantry is empty , the garden has been razed , and nobody at the local grocery store is willing to take their check .
So they have surrendered unconditionally to what has always been the unifying element of the Bush - bot Coalition : Pure , unalloyed , tribal hatred of the Other Side , whether defined as “ terrists ” ( that ’s Bushian for “ terrorists ” ) , “ leftists , ” “ liberals , ” “ cultural progressives , ” or merely “ People with library cards who speak in complete sentences and do n’t merely recite the latest thought - stopping slogan retailed on the Sean Hannity program . ”
Conservatism , which was once flavored with an almost imperceptible touch of principle , has long since ceased to be anything other than a cynical movement devoted entirely to obtaining and retaining political power .
Once the Bush - centered conservative movement is deprived of power , it will undergo a process I ’m tempted to call reductio ad odium — that is , it will be reduced to nothing more than a shared hatred of the Obama - centered liberal faction .
The post - Bush conservative movement ’s lead demagogue will be the public figure best able to make a thick , unpalatable reduction sauce from all the charred bits of resentment and residual ambition that cling to the political frying pan .
I suspect that it will be ideologically brown in color and have a flavor similar to that of other bloody - minded nationalist movements whose deeds made 20th - Century history so stimulating .
In the meantime , Mr. Obama — who is hardly diffident in embracing what he takes to be his destiny to “ change the world ” — will inherit the world ’s largest , most expensive , and most powerful executive apparatus .
From those who built that apparatus or supported the project we can now hear angry , anguished warnings about the dangers of entrusting it to the likes of Obama .
Many of those people , carried away in flights of adolescent hubris , apparently believed that the Republicans would rule in perpetuity .
Others , who must be the kind of people surprised by the advent of winter each year , simply did n’t foresee the possibility that the GOP would fall out of political favor .
It ’s possible that at least some who had been captured by the Bushcult will rediscover the virtues of the separation of powers , checks and balances , and the other key concepts and practices of federalism that we were ordered to discard in the name of national unity in the “ war on terror . ”
This is a possibility in roughly the same sense that it ’s possible 50 Cent could secretly be an authority on Elizabethan poetry .
The Wall Street Journal spent the last eight years hymning the glories of unrestricted executive rule and heaping anathemas on those who opposed perpetual war and the destruction of the Anglo - Saxon concept of due process .
Its editorial board recently gave tremulous voice to concerns over the uses to which an Obama Regime would put the powers now concentrated in the presidency .
The elevation — or is the proper term “ condescension , ” given his quasi - divine status ? — of Obama to the presidency “ would be one of the most profound political and ideological shifts in U.S. history , ” insisted the Journal ’s editorial collective in words that practically shivered with anxiety .
This “ period of unchecked left - wing ascendancy ” would “ mark the restoration of the activist government that fell out of public favor in the 1970s . ”
No responsible adult possessing a scintilla of political knowledge and so much as a particle of honesty could write those words and expect them to be taken seriously .
The Journal seems to mock its own argument by complaining that the Obama - led liberals would actually reduce federal power in some ways .
For instance , they may demand “ the watering down of No Child Left Behind testing standards , ” or “ the end of Guantanamo and military commissions ” ; the former would scale back unconstitutional Bush - era centralization of education , the latter would end a civil liberties abomination that threatens the liberties of everybody .
The rest of the Journal ’s editorial offered several variations on a familiar theme , namely that under the reign of the “ Liberal Supermajority ” the State would confer its burgled bounty on a different set of beneficiaries , and wield its enforcement powers on behalf of a different set of prejudices .
All of this is inspired by the equation that defines all modern politics —
Lenin ’s axiom that the central political question is “ Who does what to whom . ”
Both branches of the Dominant Party are thoroughly Leninist , in that they appear to recognize no limit on the power of the State ( Lenin defined his governing model as “ power without limit , resting directly on force ” ) and seek to be the “ Who ” rather than the “ Whom ” in the ruling equation .
We are weeks away from the election , months from the actual vote in the Electoral College , and the Inauguration is on the other side of New Years ’ Day .
Nonetheless , Obama ’s handlers — from Joe Biden to Madeleine Albright to Colin Powell — are so anxious to institutionalize a new Leader Cult that they ’re skipping all of these intermediate steps .
Predicting an unspecified “ challenge ” to the Holy One during the first six months of his reign , Biden — speaking to an audience of donors during a stop in Seattle — seemed to be pleading that Obama ’s adherents display a religious devotion to his administration , irrespective of the decisions they make and the reaction they get from the untutored public .
“ Gird up your loins , ” admonished Biden .
“ I ’m asking you now , be prepared to stick with us .
Remember the faith you had at this point because you ’re going to have to reinforce us . ”
It ’s not clear whether the “ generated crisis ” Biden predicted with utter certainty would take the form of a military confrontation abroad , a new and devastating permutation of our ongoing political collapse , or perhaps the need to deal forcefully with internal opposition to the glorious new order .
What is clear , however , is that even as Bush - era True Believers will trade places with the Outcasts , the Cult of the Presidency will enjoy a growth spurt — and everyone will be ordered to set aside their reservations about the New Redeemer ’s decisions in the name of national unity .
I eagerly hope that , when that confected crisis comes , the embittered Republicans tell the Democrats to inseminate themselves .
I hope that this , in turn , leads Democrats to escalate their demands for Republican submission .
Among my fondest hopes is that eventually this political conflict becomes an irreconcilable split between the “ Red ” and “ Blue ” Americas , and that this rupture would provide opportunities for regional secession by those of us who want nothing more to do with the Empire , its wars , its corruption , and its collapsing economy .
There is a certain diabolical genius behind the division of the United States into “ Red ” and “ Blue ” factions .
Each of the constituencies cattle - penned into one of those categories covets the power of the central government to compel the other to do its bidding .
After dilating at length on the resentments that define contemporary Conservatism , I ’m obliged to point out that Liberalism is just as laden with animus toward those who do n’t share that creed .
In late 2000 , when the Bush / Gore election was going into extra innings , former Clinton Regime spokesliar Paul Begala took the opportunity to execrate “ Red State America ” as a land of irrational , violent bigots :
“ You see the state where James Byrd was lynch - dragged behind a pickup truck until his body came apart — it ’s red .
You see the state where Matthew Shepard was crucified on a split - rail fence for the crime of being gay — it ’s red .
You see the state where right - wing extremists blew up a federal office building and murdered scores of federal employees — it ’s red .
The state where an Army private who was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat , and the state where neo -Nazi skinheads murdered two African - Americans because of their skin color , and the state where Bob Jones University spews its anti-Catholic bigotry ; they ’re all red too . ”
Columnist William O’Rourke of the Chicago Sun-Times amplified this theme , designating the states who had rejected Al Gore as “ Yahoo Nation . ”
O’Rourke described “ Yahoo Nation ” as “ a large , lopsided horseshoe , a twisted W , made up of primarily the Deep South and the vast , lowly populated upper - far - west states that are filled with vestiges of gun-loving , Ku Klux Klan - sponsoring , formerly lynching - happy , survivalist - minded , hate crime - perpetrating , non-blue - blooded , rugged individualists . ”
“ Yahoo Nation , ” he continued , boasts not so much as “ one center of thinking America , the teeming centers of creative and intellectual life . ”
Gore ’s Blue State constituency , by way of contrast , included what O’Rourke was pleased to call “ America ’s great cities : New York , Boston , Washington , D.C. , Chicago , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Philadelphia , Seattle . ”
What neither Begala nor O’Rourke , nor anyone else of their ilk , has ever explained is this :
If “ Red State ” Americans are such irredeemable degenerates , why are they permitted to participate in the political process at all ?
One possible answer is that the current system is built around a cynical symbiosis between “ Red ” and “ Blue ” :
They are indispensable foils for each other , each anxious to be the “ Who ” rather than the “ Whom . ”
By mobilizing resentments through appeals to various hot - button issues that never grow cold through resolution , the Power Elite that created this artificial division herds people into the voting booth to perform a liturgy that has no demonstrable impact on public policy , but ensures the continued “ legitimacy ” of the Regime .
In this way , all of us — Red , Blue , or of neither of those synthetic political shades — are rendered part of the “ Whom , ” the undifferentiated “ people ” on the receiving end of whatever the ruling “ persons ” see fit to inflict on us .
But this arrangement may , at long last , be breaking down , just as the delusion - based fiat money financial system has entered its terminal phase .
As we descend into what will be a long and bitter depression , it ’s possible that , not all that far in the future , the “ Red ” and “ Blue ” Americas might decide that they really do n’t want to be part of the same polity .
Try as I might , I ca n’t see why this would be a bad thing .
Our current configuration is not a reflection of some divinely ordained design , after all .
There ’s no reason why several “ Americas ” would n’t be able to share the same continent , engaging in peaceful commerce and otherwise minding their own business .
And it ’s difficult to see how such an arrangement would be “ un- American ” ; those who truly love America would want the world to be blessed with not one , but many of them .
Given the unfortunate outcome last time a group of American states decided to quit the “ Union ” club , it ’s clear that the dangers of political fission are great .
But remaining artificially yoked together in a bankrupt , increasingly untenable Union would most likely be fatal to liberty .
Painful as it would be for the USA to disintegrate , this may well be the only way that we can avoid descending irretrievably into undisguised tyranny — and Obama might just be the figure to precipitate such a breakup .
And given the fact that Washington is entirely broke and likely to run out of credit , there ’s even a chance — a tiny one , mind you — that this breakup could happen without Red and Blue replicating the mass bloodshed that accompanied the attempted divorce between Blue and Gray .
Without the financial means to carry out an actual civil war , Red and Blue might simply have to say to each other , “ Fare thee well — and get ye lost . ”
It probably wo n’t happen that way .
But keep a good thought , anyhow .
Just in case you ’re interested , the grammatically dubious title of this essay was inspired by this .
The Best of William Norman Grigg
We may be living in the era of the email , but one young illustrator has proved that the art of correspondence is far from dead .
While working for her degree at Glasgow School of Art Harriet Russell decided to find out exactly what lengths the men and women of the Royal Mail were willing to go to to ensure the safe delivery of her missives .
To put them to the test she concealed the addresses of 130 letters to herself in a series of increasingly complex puzzles and ciphers .
Among the disguises she employed were dot - to - dot drawings , anagrams and cartoons .
The answer , it seems , was very far indeed .
Amazingly , only 10 failed to complete their journey back to her .
In another pleasing twist to the story , Ms Russell was unwittingly resurrecting a family tradition first begun by her great - great grandfather Henry Ponsonby , a private secretary to Queen Victoria and a veteran of the Crimean War .
This eminent forebear embellished letters to his children at Eton with a series of illustrations in which he concealed the school 's address .
It was a family quirk continued by his son , Arthur Ponsonby , a pacifist who went on to be Labour MP for Sheffield Brightside before his elevation to the House of Lords .

However , neither quite set about their task with the degree of invention employed by their 21st - century descendant who over the course of a year went to ever greater lengths to disguise her address .
These , it seemed gripped the imagination of Clydeside Royal Mail sorting workers as much as they did their author .
Now the results of this unique and anonymous collaboration form the basis of a new book , Envelopes : A Puzzling Journey Through the Royal Mail , published by Allison & Busby , and hotly tipped as a stocking - filler hit this Christmas .
Ms Russell , 31 , who now works from a studio in Wapping , east London , confesses that she had no idea her family had preceded her when it came to teasing the postman .
She also admits she is no great letter writer , preferring to communicate by email : all the envelopes she sent contained nothing but blank sheets of paper .
She said : " It is an odd coincidence .
We used to get a lot of wrongly addressed mail sent to our home , which was Shulbrede Priory in Surrey and that got me thinking about the postal system .
The first one started as an experiment to see if it could get through . "
Among the initial batch of envelopes was a letter with the address written in mirror writing .
But it was not until sorting office staff forwarded one in which her street name and number were the answer to a series of crossword clues that she realised someone was taking their job very seriously indeed .
Especially when the letter eventually flopped on to her mat with the boxes filled in and bearing the proud message : " Solved by the Glasgow Mail Centre . "
She admits there were times when she worried that she might be in trouble for wasting Royal Mail time but still the letters continued to find their way back .
" I was really quite amazed .
I did n't know who was doing it .
I imagined there was a small group of them and I think they must have caught on because a lot of them were to the same address . "
The identities of the sleuthing Royal Mail staff have never been established and Ms Russell , who also counts Hubert Parry , the composer of " Jerusalem " among her illustrious forebears , believes it is most likely they have moved on .
" I have never spoken to anyone and no one has come forward , " she said .
" But it is clear they were taking part and involving themselves in it . "
The book , with its periodic tables , colour - blindness test and eye - chart addresses has already caused something of a stir in the United States although it is expected to do even better in the UK .
The Bookseller has already described it as " a little treasure waiting to be discovered " .
Ms Russell said : " I started out not knowing anything about my relatives doing this so my family dug out some of their old letters to show me . "
For his part , Henry Ponsonby preferred whimsy to ciphers and cryptic clues .
His letters bore addresses appearing as doodled signposts in snowstorms or as huge envelopes shouldered by tiny people .
Confirmation of their impending deaths comes more than 18 months since they exhausted their last legitimate avenue of appeal and coincides with a vigorous debate about the merits of the death penalty in Australia .
Survivors and the families of those killed have reported considerable angst while waiting .
The executions are highly sensitive for the Indonesian Government and it appears they have been timed to occur during or near the time of the US presidential elections , thereby deflecting worldwide attention .
Amid chaotic scenes in Jakarta yesterday , Jasman Panjaitan , a spokesman for the Attorney - General , read out the verdicts against the men before saying the executions of all three will take place in " early November " .
He took no questions .
Indonesian police have selected three firing squads .
The members of the squad that is finally selected will aim for the men's hearts from close distance .
Some will fire blanks while others will fire live rounds .
Mukhlas and Imam Samudra were key figures in the plot by the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah that wreaked carnage in the Sari Club and Paddy 's Bar and brought the threat of mass casualty terrorism to Australia 's doorstep .
Amrozi , the younger brother of Mukhlas , played a less pivotal role but gained widespread notoriety as the " smiling bomber " .
All of the men are unrepentant and have repeatedly urged supporters to take revenge upon their deaths .
They attempted to forestall the executions by launching an appeal to the Constitutional Court , arguing that death by firing squad is torture .
More recently they threatened to launch further challenges through international courts and human rights groups .
Neither appeal had a direct legal bearing on their case .
But the legal manoeuvres have been seen as an attempt to whip up anger among segments of the Indonesian population and the Government is fearful that their well - publicised calls for vengeance could lead to civil unrest .
Indonesian police have been successful in cracking down on terrorist groups and there have been no bombings in the country since 2005 .
PHP 's segmentation faults GDB - fu
Skien , Norway
Sometimes PHP segfaults ( crashes ) in a production environment , where Xdebug is often not available ( and should n't be either of course ) .
In those cases trying to figure out where in your code PHP crashes can be hard to find out .
In some cases it 's a real bug in PHP , where you would need some more intricate knowledge of PHP 's internals — in many cases it 's rather a coding error that provides you with infinite recursion .
Trying to figure out the functions that were called in a loop is not trivial if you do not possess GDB - and PHP internals - fu .
However , because we as PHP developers are lazy , provide a few GDB tricks to make this easier .
First of all , it 's only really going to work if you have n't stripped the symbols from your PHP and Apache binaries .
Secondly , you still need to have the PHP source lying around somewhere — preferably from where you 've built PHP .
After you 're in GDB ( either by opening an already existing core dump , or when the process aborts after starting it from GDB ) you can " source " the macros that make your life easier .
Basically you have to run this on the GDB prompt :
( gdb ) source ~/dev/php/php-5.2dev/.gdbinit
If you then run the following on the GDB prompt , you get a nice stack trace — but without variable information that you 're used to from seeing Xdebug traces .
( gdb ) zbacktrace
The start of the output looks like :
[ 0xd03bb330 ] a( ) /tmp/recur.php:5 [ 0xd03bb530 ] d( ) /tmp/recur.php:4 [ 0xd03bb730 ] c( ) /tmp/recur.php:3 [ 0xd03bb930 ] b() /tmp/recur.php:2 ...
In PHP 5.3 and higher , PHP will not segfault when you do infinite recursion as the engine has been changed .
Instead , PHP would simply run out of memory and show an error not unlike :
Fatal error : Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted at /home / derick / dev/php/php-5.3dev/Zend/zend_execute.h:157 ( tried to allocate 523800 bytes ) in /tmp/recur.php on line 2
Update : Instead of " dump_bt executor_globals.current_execute_data " you can simply run " zbacktrace " .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Washington Mutual , the nation 's largest thrift , has put itself up for sale , the New York Times reported on Wednesday , citing unidentified people briefed on the matter .
Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % , which has been hired to advise WaMu WM , - 0.55 % , started an auction several days ago , the newspaper reported .
The most senior judge in Saudi Arabia has said it is permissible to kill the owners of satellite TV channels which broadcast immoral programmes .
Sheikh Salih Ibn al - Luhaydan said some " evil " entertainment programmes aired by the channels promoted debauchery .
Dozens of satellite television channels broadcast across the Middle East , where they are watched by millions of Arabs every day .
The judge made the comments on a state radio programme .
He was speaking in response to a listener who asked his opinion on the airing of programmes featuring scantily - dressed women during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
" There is no doubt that these programmes are a great evil , and the owners of these channels are as guilty as those who watch them , " said the sheikh .
" It is legitimate to kill those who call for corruption if their evil can not be stopped by other penalties . "
Royal dilemma
Given his position as the country 's most senior judge , the sheikh 's views can not be easily dismissed , says BBC Arab affairs analyst , Magdi Abdelhadi .
Clerics like Sheikh al - Luhaydan represent a huge dilemma for the Saudi royal family , our correspondent adds .
On the one hand , Saudi rulers need their support to claim that they rule in the name of Islam .
But on the other hand , fighting militant Islam can be difficult when the country 's top judge calls for the beheading - the standard judicial execution in the Saudi Arabia - of those he views as immoral broadcasters .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Why does it seem many people begin with political preferences and then try to find reasons justifying their inclinations ?
Why is it so difficult to sway people who care deeply about politics no matter how compelling the facts or persuasive the prose ?
University of Nebraska - Lincoln research may help to answer these questions .
By monitoring people 's physical sensitivities to things like sudden noises and threatening visual images , political scientists were able to conclude that physiological reactions help predict variations in political beliefs .
For the first time , political scientists show that people who are physiologically highly responsive to threat are likely to advocate policies that protect against threats to the social unit : favoring defense spending , capital punishment , patriotism and the Iraq War .
In contrast , people who are less startled by sudden noises and threatening visual images are more likely to support foreign aid , liberal immigration policies , pacifism and gun control .
Researchers report their discovery in the Sept. 19 issue of the weekly international journal Science .
Authors are UNL political science professors John Hibbing and Kevin Smith , UNL psychology professor Mario Scalora , Rice University political science professor John Alford , Virginia Commonwealth University postdoctoral fellow Peter Hatemi , and graduate students Doug Oxley and Jennifer Miller , of UNL , and Matthew Hibbing at University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign .
" What the findings suggest is a different view of the nature of political beliefs than the common understanding that political attitudes are exclusively the result of experiences and the environment , " said John Hibbing .
Hibbing 's team used physiological testing : skin conductance and eye movement sensors , to assess the body 's biological reaction to threatening stimuli .
Testing with these psychophysiological procedures is quite unusual in political science , he said .
This study involved a group of 46 people who admitted to caring about political issues .
Researchers showed participants threatening visual images -- pictures of a very large spider on a person 's face , a dazed person with a bloody face and an open wound with maggots in it -- and their skin was monitored for electrical conductivity .
Hibbing said skin conductance tests indicate emotion , arousal and attention .
By using the skin conductance tests , the researchers are able to track a person 's reactions to the threatening stimuli .
In another physiological measure , scientists tested the " orbicularis oculi startle blink response " to record the amplitude or intensity of blinks .
They surprised subjects with a sudden , jarring noise and measured how hard they blinked in response to being startled .
Researchers compared participants ' reactions to the physical testing with their self - reported political attitudes on protective policies .
They concluded that participants most disturbed by the threatening stimuli or by loud noises were also most likely to advocate socially protective policy positions .
" Now we can show that certain important political beliefs have a very deep basis , " Hibbing said .
" We do n't know for certain that it 's genetic but we do know that there 's a predilection biologically that leads some people to experience the world differently from others .
The relationships we found are far from deterministic -- environmental events still play a vital role -- but the fact that physical reactions to loud noises or to scary animals is at all predictive of political beliefs is remarkable . "
" Should extreme interrogation techniques be used on foreign nationals suspected of terrorist activities ?
Should the privacy of law - abiding citizens be sacrificed if doing so offers the potential for making the country safer ?
Our research suggests that the answers a person provides to questions such as these are in part traceable to how vividly they physically experience generic threats . "
" And if political beliefs do run as deep as we suggest , it becomes easier to understand why political conflict is so persistent .
It 's not that those who disagree with us politically are being intentionally stubborn but rather that the world seems very different to them .
Perhaps recognition of the deep physical nature of these differences will increase political tolerance and understanding , " Hibbing concluded .
The study , which was supported by National Science Foundation grants , builds on Hibbing 's and his colleague 's earlier research examining the role of genetics in shaping people 's political temperaments and attitudes .
His upcoming research , also funded by NSF , will focus on testing the varying brain activation patterns induced by the presentation of threatening images and locating the physiological predictors of political apathy .

Many people in the valley describe their home as a ' beautiful prison '
Despite the lessons from more than 60 years of troubled history , it feels like the past is repeating itself in Indian - administered Kashmir .
A row over transfer of land for a Hindu pilgrimage snowballed into a nationalist upsurge in the mainly Muslim Kashmir valley .
It has brought back memories of the tumultuous 1990s when Kashmiris raised the banner of freedom from India and militants backed by Pakistan fought a full - blown insurgency .
The cries of azadi ( freedom ) have again reverberated in the smoke - scented air of the summer capital , Srinagar .
In carpeted homes , youngsters join issue with elders to vent their spleen at India .
And in grim deja vu , Kashmir 's men and women have again been killed by the bullets of the Indian security forces .
When emotions subside , locals pose a simple question :
Why does the Indian government bungle every time when faced with a crisis in the region ?
' Occupying force ' Kashmir is India 's most dangerous flashpoint .
The conflict in this disputed region has triggered two wars with neighbouring Pakistan as well as an insurgency , the loss of more than 60,000 lives and seething resentment among its people .
Bill Clinton called it " the most dangerous place " in the world .
It is also a conflict that bleeds India as no other : the state is home to anything between 500,000 and 700,000 members of the security forces , which people in the Kashmir valley derisively refer to as the " occupying force " .
Kashmir is also an extremely complex problem - a region caught between the competing aspirations and national pride of India and Pakistan , both of whom claim it .
It also raises uncomfortable questions about the legitimacy of the two countries holding on to parts of the region without taking the consideration the aspirations of its people , many of whom want independence from both countries .
But when a crisis erupts in the region , the Indian government is mostly seen to approach it as a simple problem of law and order .
And the much - criticised actions of the security forces , end up stoking the fires more .
A row over land has snowballed into a nationalist upsurge People here also wonder what happened with the once much vaunted peace process with Pakistan which appears to be in limbo .
" The problem is , " says 38 - year - old Omar Abdullah , who heads the National Conference , one of the valley 's mainstream political parties , " that India refuses to learn from its mistakes in Kashmir . "
" When opportunities came knocking to [ solve the problem ] , the government slept on them or moved too slowly , " says Mr Abdullah .
One of them , for example , came just two years ago when former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf proposed a ' four - step ' formula for moving towards a solution on Kashmir .
' No response '
One of the things that he had suggested was the simultaneous withdrawal of Indian and Pakistani troops from the region , a beginning of sorts to demilitarise Kashmir , a long - standing demand of its people .
Mr Abdullah , who met Mr Musharraf in Islamabad two years ago , says that former president was willing to " set aside the UN resolutions [ on a settlement to the problem through a plebiscite ] and so much more " .
" India just did n't respond and act on his proposals , " he says .
People in the valley wonder aloud why India does n't move fast on opportunities and does not seem to keep working towards resolving the crisis .
Instead , they say , it adopted a " let sleeping dogs lie " approach in the past five years when the peace process between India and Pakistan contributed to a relative calm and economic upturn in the Kashmir valley .
Is India 's inaction a result of sheer inertia , a defining feature of its slumbering bureaucracy ?
Or is retaining the status quo in Kashmir a part of a deliberate strategy to wear out political aspirations here ?
Successive generations have grown up in the shadow of the gun People like Dr Noor Ahmad Baba , head of the political science department at Kashmir University , say the problem lies in the mindset of the Indian state which is " more assimilative than pluralist " .
" It refuses to understand that a big and heterogeneous country like India will have many kinds of diversities and you have to deal with them individually , " says Mr Baba .
Kashmiris also consider the recent clamour of Delhi's chatterati to hand over the valley to its people because the costs of keeping it within India are " too high " to be extremely condescending .
They say that with the partition of India in 1947 and Kashmir 's accession to India , the valley was anyway " pushed from the centre to the periphery " .
Its historical trading and geo-political links with China , Pakistan and Central Asia - Kashmir was on the silk route - were dismembered .
Kashmir had always been closer to what is now Pakistan in terms of trade , waterways and cultural links .
That 's not surprising given that Islamabad is only 300 km away , compared to Delhi which is some 1000 km away .
" Kashmiris sacrificed a great deal to come together with India .
The least we can expect is a new , different model of autonomy .
The Indian state refuses to acknowledge that , " says Mr Baba .
Dr Hameeda Nayeem , a feisty university teacher and women 's rights activist , echoes a similar sentiment .
" The Indian government has been very complacent .
It has pushed a peaceful people to the path of violence , " she says .
Shadow of guns
The palpable alienation of the people in the Kashmir has a number of roots .
There is the overwhelming presence of the security forces .
Entire generations have grown up under the shadow of guns and draconian laws which include the banning of human rights investigations in a region notorious for such abuses .
Then there is the unresolved issue of anything between 3,900 and 10,000 people - depending on who you talk to , officials or local people - who have disappeared since the outbreak of the armed insurgency in the late 1980s .
The discovery of of 1,000 unmarked graves near the town of Uri has never been explained despite demands by rights group .
Thousands have disappeared in Kashmir
So when the Indian army chief in charge of the valley told a seminar a few months ago that 93 % of the allegations relating to human rights abuses in the valley were wrong , few people here believed him .
" On what basis are these things said ?
Where is the proof ?
Where is the transparency ?
Why are independent human rights groups not allowed into the valley , " asks Omar Abdullah .
" Are you surprised after all this that there is a big trust deficit between the people here and the Indian government ?
Are you surprised that people here believe that the Indian state sweeps things under the carpet ? "
At the very minimum , India needs to begin with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Kashmir to clear this poisonous mistrust , some analysts argue .
And then , as local Communist leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami says , the government should resume dialogue on Kashmir with local leaders , including separatists , and Pakistan .
" This crisis is a warning shot to the government of India , " says the soft - spoken Mr Tarigami .
" Not talking on Kashmir is dangerous .
Very dangerous . "
Otherwise , the stunningly beautiful valley which one of its legendary political leaders , Sheikh Abdullah , had envisioned as a " Eastern Switzerland " will continue to remain a " beautiful prison " , as many locals prefer to call their home .

What are these ?
Medical myths are part of our everyday life .
Everyone knows them but only a few realise that they are myths and not real : Eating carrots will improve your eyesight .
Spinach makes you stronger .
Fresh is always better than frozen .
Computer screens can damage your eyes .
Cholesterol is bad for your health .
These are examples of medical and health myths that survived over the years .
Many people , including doctors believe in these myths although they are either not true or lack scientific evidence .
Some of these myths also have very amazing and unbelievable origins .
The following article presents 30 medical myths you definitely need to know .
All myths are busted by research from well - known and established institutions .
The myths are separated in the following categories :
Food & Drink Medical Myths
General Health Myths
Eyesight Medical Myths
Mobile Phone Related Myths
Metabolism Myths
Food & Drink Medical Myths
Myth 1 : Carrots can improve your eyesight
This is one of the best medical myths ever .
We have been told many times that eating carrots improves our eyesight because they contain a lot of vitamin A . Indeed carrots do contain vitamin A but consuming a lot of vitamin A has nothing to do with improving our vision .
The origins of this myth go back to the dates of World War II .
The British Intelligence service spread the rumour that their pilots ate a lot of carrots and that ’s why they were so successful in destroying German targets .
The truth for their success was the use of radars and not the consumption of huge amounts of carrots !!
In an effort to hide the existence of radars the British developed this myth that is sustained with great success until today .
Myth 2 : Eating spinach can make you stronger
I am sure that most of us have seen Popeye getting stronger and more powerful with a tin of spinach .
In fact Popeye is the first word that comes to mind when we hear about spinach .
The truth about this lovely myth is that spinach does not make you stronger .
On the contrary spinach is a vegetable that contains low levels of iron .
There are other green vegetables that contain more iron than spinach .
The myth that spinach is a full iron vegetable emerged from a typo mistake made in a report many years ago .
In the report spinach was noted to have 34mg of iron ( per half tin ) but in reality is has only 3.4mg .
This typo let people believe that spinach is a full iron vegetable and in addition to the low price of spinach it became very popular .
Another reason that this medical myth lasts for so many years , and will continue to exist for a number of years , is of course Popeye !
Myth 3 : Eating turkey makes us sleepy
This myth is based on the fact that turkey contains tryptophan , an amino acid located in protein that affects sleep and mood .
However , the quantity contained in turkey is not more than in other foods like chicken or veal and in some cases it is even less per gram than it is contained in pork or cheese .
The myth apparently stems from the fact that all of us feel drowsy after a big meal ( and eating turkey is a big meal ) , because the body consumes energy for digestion and thus the blood flow and oxygenation in the brain is reduced .
Myth 4 : We need to drink at least eight glasses of water a day
An article by the USA National Academy of Sciences ( 60 years ago ) noted that a good indication for water consumption for adults is 2.5 litres a day .
In the same article they also noted , in the last sentence , that this quantity is already contained in the food we eat .
In other words we consume the water our body needs in the food we eat .
Researchers suggested that if we ignore the last statement from the article then it could be interpreted as a directive for the consumption of eight glasses of water a day .
Other research suggests though that we get sufficient levels of water in our body from the typical daily consumption of juices , milk and even caffeine drinks .
From all the studies carried out so far researchers did not find any scientific evidence to support this medical myth .
Myth 5 : Coffee is harmful for our health
Coffee is consumed on a daily basis by millions of people .
It is the world ’s morning favourite drink .
It is a fact that the excessive consumption of coffee may be hitting the nerves and this can cause increased excitability .
Normal consumption of coffee though can be good for our health .
A study by Harvard University with more than 125,000 people drinking coffee showed that women were 30 % less likely to suffer ‘ type 2 diabetes ’ .
Other studies have shown that coffee reduces the risk of developing Parkinson ’s and cancer of the colon .
In addition , coffee rejuvenates the spirit and despite the impact in the energy levels of our body , coffee has absolutely no effect on the heart .
Two to three cups of coffee a day is beneficial to our health .
However if we notice symptoms of anxiety and insomnia , then it is better to reduce coffee or switch to decaffeinate drinks .
Myth 6 : Eat when you ’re cold and diet when you have fever
This myth was created as a result of statements from medical dictionaries and reports made hundreds of years ago .
An example is a reference made in a medical dictionary , which stated that “ fasting is the best medicine for fever ” .
Cold and fever are usually due to viruses making cycles that last 7 to 10 days , regardless of what we do to combat them .
Research did not prove sufficient evidence that diet affects cold or fever .
Myth 7 : Fresh is always better than frozen
Since scientists pointed out the benefits of antioxidants , people started to believe that eating more fresh fruits and vegetables is a better choice than eating frozen .
In fact we tend to believe that frozen is second - class food .
Frozen food can be as beneficial as fresh food because fresh fruits and vegetables are cut when they are at the top of their nutritional value and transferred to factories where they are frozen .
This process locks down their nutritional ingredients and so frozen food has all the nutrients .
Fresh fruit and vegetables when placed on the shelves – they lose some of their nutritional ingredients because of heat , air and moisture .
Myth 8 : Eggs increase cholesterol
During the 60’s and 70’s , scientists have associated blood cholesterol with heart diseases .
Eggs that are rich in cholesterol eventually came out of our daily diet .
Recent studies showed that saturated and trans fat in the diet of a person are more likely to increase the risk of heart disease than eggs .
One egg has only 1.6 grams of saturated fatty acids , while a glass of milk with 2 % fat contains 3 grams of saturated fat .
Eggs provide protein in the body as well as vitamins A and D without making you gain extra weight .
If you eat an egg for breakfast , you simply need to be careful with the amount of cholesterol that will take from other foods during the day .
Myth 9 : Bananas are high in Fat
Many people think that bananas are high in fat .
The truth about this myth is that bananas are actually low in fat .
Bananas are made up of 95 calories and ½ gram of fat .
Myth 10 : Chocolates causes acne
There is no evidence that chocolate ; sugar , oil , milk or any other food causes acne .
Some people believe that certain foods may be the cause of acne .
No clinical research has proven that food is associated with acne .
Myth 11 : Natural products are safer than artificial .
Mother Nature has produce some of the most dangerous substances known to mankind - among them arsenic and botulin .
Humans have created laboratories to produce medicines that can control or treat many life - threatening diseases .
Many important medicines also come from plants that are not only acting as medicines , but also have the side effects of medicines .
The safety of a product , whether natural or synthetic , can be assessed only in carefully designed clinical ( in humans ) studies – and there are few natural substances that have been tested this way .
Therefore it is not justified in any way that natural products are always safer than artificial .
Exceptions to this myth are cases where it has been clinically proven .
General Health Medical Myths
Myth 12 : Take pain relief drugs only if you are in high pain
The abuse of drugs is a very well known problem .
Some people tend to take medicines with the slightest pain while others avoid medicines and drugs completely .
The pain relief drugs are more effective when taken at the start of a pain episode and not when the pain has fully developed .
Actually it is recommended to use pain relief drugs in advance when you know that some activities will cause you pain .
For example if you have problems with arthritis and you plan to make some manual work that usually gives you pain , you better take a pain relief medicine before starting the activity .
Myth 13 : Cholesterol is bad for you .
There is ‘ bad ’ cholesterol and ‘ good cholesterol ’ .
Bad cholesterol is created by saturated fats found in food like meat and cheese .
This type of cholesterol can be the cause of heart diseases .
Good cholesterol is found in unsaturated fats such as nuts , seeds and oily fish .
Good cholesterol helps transporting bad cholesterol away from the arteries , back to the liver .
Myth 14 : We use only 10 % of our brains
The theory for using only 10 % of our brainpower is there for almost a century .
Sometimes this belief is charged to Albert Einstein but this has not been recorded to any report or statement .
It is believed that the reason for maintaining this myth for so many years is to teach people the importance of self - improvement .
Nevertheless , figurative and metabolic brain research and other studies from investigations of people with learning disabilities showed that people use more than 10 % of their brains .
The different iconographic investigations proved that no part of the brain is absolutely quiet or inactive .
A detailed study of the brain failed to indicate the non-active 90 % .
Myth 15 : The hair and nails continue to grow after death
This claim is repeated in movies but it is not true .
The hair and nails require a « complex hormonal coordination » to grow that stops after death .
Myth 16 : Shaving the hair makes them grow faster or darker
This myth is repeated by the media and reinforced when a short beard appears after shaving .
A clinical study conducted in 1928 showed that shaving does not have an impact on the growing of hair , a finding that is also confirmed by more modern studies .
When hair is re-grown after shaving they seem more rugged because they do not have the smooth head of the non -shaved hair .
They also seem darker because they were not exposed to the sun like the non -shaved hair .
Myth 17 : Stress is the reason for having grey hair
This myth has been maintained over the time due to the complexities modern life has to offer .
People tend to think that stress caused by our daily hassles can make our hair go grey .
The truth about this myth is that excessive stress can actually make us older both internally and externally .
Stress increases the number of free radical molecules that attack healthy cells and this increases the production of stress hormones in the body .
Nevertheless , until now , there is no scientific evidence that one bad day can make our hair grey .
The reason for having grey hair is due to the genetic characteristics of each individual .

Myth 18 : If we feel cold we will end up sick
Cold does not affect our immune system unless we are so much cold and the defences of our body are destroyed – and this only happens in a state of hypothermia .
We can not get sick from cold , unless we catch a virus that will make us sick .
The reason we get sick easier during the cold winter is not the low temperature but because we stay indoors and droplets of viruses give us the cold .
When we keep our body warm this does not mean that we are protecting ourselves from getting sick .
A study by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh showed that optimistic people exposed to the cold virus are 13 % less likely to catch a cold compared to those who are more depressed !
Myth 19 : Lipsticks are harmful to your health
In 2007 , an environmental group named Campaign for Safe Cosmetics checked 33 different lipsticks for lead .
Despite the fact that there is no allowable limit of lead in lipsticks , 1 / 3 of the samples checked they contained a greater quantity of lead than that allowed in sweets .
These findings created the myth that lipsticks can be harmful to your health because of the amount of lead they carry .
The American Cancel Society after studying the results of this research decided that the risk from lead in lipsticks is extremely small .
Lead poisoning is usually caused by other environmental factors , such as pipes and paint in old houses for example .
In conclusion , there is no reason to believe that the use of lipsticks can poison you .
Myth 20 : Do not swim immediately after your eat
This is a very common myth that has been around for many years .
This myth is indeed correct if one has to participate in a swimming race , swim for a long distance or struggle with the waves or a strong current shortly after eating .
The intense physical weariness with full stomach is never a good idea , because it can lead to muscle or stomach cramps .
However , experts did not find a problem with taking a relaxing swim or going into the water shortly after a meal .
What could prove extremely dangerous is swimming after alcohol consumption , because drinking may disrupt your judgement and encourage unnecessarily risky behaviour .
Myth 21 : Not washing properly can cause acne
Stress and the effects of hormones on sebaceous glands are the main causes of acne .
It is not in any way proved that not washing our hands properly will create acne .
On the contrary cleaning your face too often can actually increase acne as the body compensates to replace the body oil washed away .
Myth 22 : Do n’t use batonettes to clean your ears .
Batonetes might induce the cell ( « candle » ) deep inside the ear , and thus reducing hearing .
If the accumulation of cell creates a problem for you , try medicated drops that soften them or make sure you visit a specialist doctor to clean it for you .
Eyesight Medical Myths
Myth 23 : Reading with low light ruins eyesight
The idea that low light ruins eyesight has its roots in the pain of the eye .
Low lighting makes it difficult for the eye to focus , leading to fewer eye - closings and hence this leads to dry eyes .
So reading with low lighting is « inconvenient » but does not create permanent damage to the eyes .
Myth 24 : Computer screens can damage your eyes
The excessive use of computers both in the office but also at home has created the idea that computers are machines harmful to our eyes .
Many people visit the eye doctors and others are making complaints about discomfort and fatigue in the eyes after prolonged and continuous use of the computer .
A number of investigations and researches made for this myth have shown that computer monitors are not detrimental to our eyes .
This is because it has been proven that the monitors emit very little or no harmful radiation such as X - rays or ultraviolet radiation .
Therefore , with simple words , our eyes are not in a long - term risk from a computer screen .
Mobile Phone Related Medical Myths
Myth 25 : Mobile phones pose significant electromagnetic interference in hospitals
Various references suggest that mobile phones cause erroneous alarms to screen machines and the malfunctioning of medical electric pumps .
After the publication of a medical report that included more than 100 cases of possible electromagnetic interference with medical equipment , the Wall Street Journal published an article on the subject , which led to the ban of mobile phones from several hospitals .
So far research did not show any evidence that supports this myth .
In 2005 the Mayo Clinic conducted 510 tests with 16 medical equipment and six mobile phones .
The study showed a rate of only 1.2 % that can be considered as a clinically significant interference .
Another study made in 2007 with 300 tests conducted at 75 treatment rooms did not also prove any kind of interference .
On the contrary a major investigation showed that the use of mobile telephones by doctors is associated with a 22 % reduction in medical errors due to delays .
Myth 26 : The Use of mobile phones can affect male fertility
A team of researchers from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine carried out a study with 364 men .
The purpose of this study was to see if the use of mobile phones could affect male fertility .
The study showed that men who used their mobile phones for more than 4 hours per day showed around 23 % lower concentration of sperm compared with those not using any mobile phone .
Although the researchers raised the theory that the decline in sperm quality can be either the effects of electromagnetic radiation or heat in the testes , this is just a theory based on a survey .
Therefore it remains a simple observation and is not based on concrete facts that can prove that mobile phones can indeed affect male fertility .
It excludes , for example , other important factors such as stress or a sedentary lifestyle .
Metabolism Medical Myths
Myth 27 : Metabolism is the same for men and women
This myth suggests that the body metabolism i.e. daily energy consumption is the same for both men and women .
The proportion of fat and muscles in the body is what determines the amount of energy required .
Men , who typically have less fat and more muscles tend to spend more energy than women , therefore they have a better metabolism than women .
Myth 28 : Overweight people have a lower metabolism than normal weight people
This myth is completely wrong .
Overweight or obese people have a better metabolism than normal weight people .
This is because a fat person burns more calories for movement because it needs more energy ( due to the extra weight ) compared to a normal weight person .
Myth 29 : As we get older our metabolism is increasing
As we get older our basic metabolism is actually decreasing .
This because over the years our body muscles are reduced and fat is increased .
More specifically , the basic metabolism of the individual from the age of ten is falling about 1 % to 2 % per decade .
Myth 30 : Reducing the number of meals per day will improve metabolism
Digestion is a function of our body that burns many calories .
So greatly reducing the quantity of food we eat , our body will also reduce the rate of metabolism to save energy .
If we want to increase our metabolism we must not reduce the meals we eat but to choose food with fat - free protein and a lot of fibre .
Furthermore , consumption of small meals at regular intervals ( every 3 to 4 hours ) promotes the better distribution of energy in our body and as a result this increases the basic metabolism .

According to a new study , Milky Way presumably has in its center stars that are able to absorb the mysterious dark matter , thus extending their life by not less than a billion years .
In case scientists find proof that such stars exist , they will be able to understand what the dark matter is really made of .
Despite the fact that 90 percent of the mass of Milky Way galaxy is composed of dark matter , the latter is too disperse to have a significant impact on stars in the galaxy .
However , being close to the huge black hole found at the galactic center , the dark matter could be quite dense , in fact , it could be so dense that stars are able to capture it at high rates .
Having the goal of studying the effects of such stars on dark matter , Pat Scott of Stockholm University in Sweden together with his colleagues came up with the model that shows the development of stars while they gravitationally amassed a group of dark matter particles called WIMP ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .
Researchers found that stars orbiting 0.3 light years away from the center of the galaxy are able to capture weakly interacting massive particles in great quantities .
When the particles of dark matter are caught they crash with gas found in the star .
After the collision , the particles lose their energy and settle at the center of the star , where they hit each other and wipe out .
After the annihilation , the particles of dark matter generate a blast of energy that inflates the star .
Due to this expansion , a star burns its energy at a lower rate .
In case the stars had about the mass of our Sun , they would be able to gather enough dark matter to increase their lifetime by a billion years or more .
According to Fabio Iocco of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Firenze , Italy , this particular study features the most detailed estimations on how normal stars capture particles of dark matter .
Igor Moskalenko of Stanford University in California , outlined that in case researchers were able to look through the gas and dust in our galaxy to show that such stars existed , they could discover the first direct proof that dark matter is real .
" If there is even a single star with the predicted properties found there , it will be direct evidence that astrophysical dark matter consists of WIMPs and not something else - a major breakthrough , " said Moskalenko .

When Hubble telescope was finally brought back online it went down to business immediately , making some terrific photos of the gravitationally interacting galaxies , dubbed Arp 147 .
The telescope was able to take the amazing images thanks to its Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 ( WFPC2 ) .
After analyzing the image , specialists concluded that the telescope , which is an international project of NASA and ESA , has its camera working the same way it did before Hubble went offline .
Scientists gave the picture a " perfect 10 " for the performance , as well as for its beauty .
The image shows that the left - most galaxy is somewhat intact , apart from the ring of starlight .
The galaxy is called the " one , " while the " zero " is the second right - most galaxy , which shows a blue ring of star formation .
The blue ring appeared after the left - most galaxy went through the right - most one .
When the two galaxies met , their impact generated the ring just like a stone which was thrown into a pond , creating outwardly circular rings , reports the European Website for NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
As the surplus of density smashed with outer material , which was heading inwards because of the gravitational pull of the left and right galaxies , this generated shocks and dense gas , which in its turn stimulated the formation of a star .
At the lower left side of the blue ring you can see a ruddy knot , which is probably the place of the original nucleus of the stricken galaxy .
Hubble Space Telescope took picture of the Arp 147 on October 27 - 28 , 2008 .
The galaxy pair lies in the constellation of Cetus , found over 400 million light - years away from our planet .

Summary
The subtitle of this episode is " The dangers of the benchmarks " .
Advertisement
Benchmarks are useful in papers and blog posts , as a good trick to attract readers , but you should never make the mistake of believing them : as Mark Twain would say , there are lies , damned lies , and benchmarks .
The problem is not only that reality is different from benchmarks ; the problem is that it is extremely easy to write a wrong benchmark or to give a wrong interpretation of it .
In this episode I will show some of the dangers hidden under the factorial benchmark shown in the previous episode , which on the surface looks trivial and unquestionable .
If a benchmark so simple is so delicate , I leave to your imagination to figure out what may happen for complex benchmarks .
The major advantage of benchmarks is that they make clear how wrong we are when we think that a solution is faster or slower than another solution .
Beware of wasted cycles
An obvious danger of benchmarks is the issue of vasted cycles .
Since usually benchmarks involve calling a function N times , the time spent in the loop must be subtracted from the real computation time .
If the the computation is complex enough , usually the time spent in the loop is negligible with respect to the time spent in the computation .
However , there are situations where this assumption is not true .
In the factorial example you can measure the wasted cycles by subtracting from the total time the the time spent in the loop performing no operations ( for instance by computing the factorial of zero , which contains no multiplications ) .
On my MacBook the total time spent in order to compute the factorial of 7 for ten millions of times is 3.08 seconds , whereas the time spent to compute the factorial of zero is 0.23 seconds , i.e. fairly small but sensible .
In the case of fast operations , the time spent in the loop can change completely the results of the benchmark .
For instance , add1 it is a function which increments a number by one and it is extremely fast .
The time to sum 1+1 ten millions of times is 0.307 seconds : > ( time ( call 10000000 add1 1 ) ) running stats for ( call 10000000 add1 1 ) : no collections 307 ms elapsed cpu time , including 0 ms collecting 308 ms elapsed real time , including 0 ms collecting 24 bytes allocated
If you measure the time spent in the loop and in calling the auxiliary function call , by timing a do - nothing function , you will find a value of 0.214 seconds , i.e. 2/3 of the total time is wasted : > ( define ( do - nothing x ) x ) > ( time ( call 10000000 do - nothing 1 ) ) running stats for ( call 10000000 do - nothing ) : no collections 214 ms elapsed cpu time , including 0 ms collecting 216 ms elapsed real time , including 0 ms collecting 16 bytes allocated Serious benchmarks must be careful in subtracting the wasted time correctly , if it is significant .
The best thing is to reduce the wasted time .
In a future episode we will consider this example again and we will see how to remove the time wasted in call by replacing it with a macro .
Beware of cheats
The issue of wasted cycles is obvious enough ; on the other hand , benchmarks are subject to less obvious effects .
Here I will show a trick to improve dramatically the performance by cheating .
Let us consider the factorial example , but using the Chicken Scheme compiler .
Chicken works by compiling Scheme code into C code which is then compiled to machine code .
Therefore , Chicken may leverage on all the dirty tricks on the underlying C compiler .
In particular , Chicken exposes a benchmark mode where consistency checks are disabled and the - O3 optiomization of gcc is enabled .
By compiling the factorial benchmark in in this way you can get incredible performances : $ csc - Ob fact.scm # csc = Chicken Scheme Compiler $ ./ fact 7 ./ fact 7 0.176 seconds elapsed 0 seconds in ( major ) GC 0 mutations 1 minor GCs 0 major GCs result :5040
We are 16 times faster than Ikarus and 173 times faster than Python !
The only disadvantage is that the script does not work : when the factorial gets large enough ( biggen than 2^31 ) Chicken ( or better gcc ) starts yielding meaningless values .
Everything is fine until 12 ! : $ ./ fact 12 # this is smaller than 2^31 , perfectly correct 0.332 seconds elapsed 0 seconds in ( major ) GC 0 mutations 1 minor GCs 0 major GCs result :479001600 Starting from 13 !
you get a surprise : $ ./ fact 13 # the correct value is 6227020800 , larger than 2^31 0.352 seconds elapsed 0 seconds in ( major ) GC 0 mutations 1 minor GCs 0 major GCs result :-215430144
You see what happens when you cheat ? ;)
Beware of naive optimization
In this last section I will show a positive aspect of benchmarks : they may be usefully employed to avoid useless optimizations .
Generally speaking , one should not try to optimize too much , since one could waste work and get the opposite effect , especially with modern compilers which are pretty smart .
In order to give an example , suppose we want to optimize by hand the factorial benchmark , by replacing the closure ( call 10000000 ( lambda ( ) ( fac n ) ) ) with the expression ( call 10000000 fac n ) .
In theory we would expect a performance improvement since we can skip an indirection level by calling directly fac instead of a closure calling fac .
Actually , this is what happens with : for n=7 , the program runs in 3.07 secondi with the closure and in 2.95 seconds without .
In Chicken - I am using Chicken 2.732 here - instead , a disaster happens when the benchmark mode is turned on : $ csc - Ob fact.scm $ ./ fact 7 1.631 seconds elapsed 0.011 seconds in ( major ) GC 0 mutations 1881 minor GCs 23 major GCs result :5040
The program is nearly ten times slower !
All the time is spent in the garbage collector .
Notice that this behavior is proper of the benchmark mode : by compiling with the default options you will not see significant differences in the execution time , even if they are in any case much larger ( 7.07 seconds with the closure versus 6.88 seconds without ) .
In other words , with the default option to use the closure has a little penalty , as you would expect , but in benchmark mode the closure improves the performance by ten times !
I asked for an explation to Chicken 's author , Felix Winkelmann , and here is what he said :
In the first case , the compiler can see that all references to fac are call sites : the value of " fac " is only used in positions where the compiler can be absolutely sure it is a call .
In the second case the value of fac is passed to " call " ( and the compiler is not clever enough to trace the value through the execution of " call " - this would need flow analysis ) .
So in the first case , a specialized representation of fac can be used ( " direct " lambdas , i.e. direct - style calls which are very fast ) .
Compiling with " - debug o " and / or " - debug 7 " can also be very instructive .
That should make clear that benchmarks are extremely delicate beasts , where ( apparently ) insignificant changes may completely change the numbers you get .
So , beware of benchmarks , unless you are a compiler expert ( and in that case you must be twice as careful ! ;)
Recursion vs iteration Usually imperative languages do not support recursion too well , in the sense that they may have a recursion limit , as well as inefficiencies in the management of the stack .
In such a languages it is often convenient to convert ricorsive problems into iterative problems .
To this aim , it is convenient to rewrite first the recursive problem in tail call form , possibly by adding auxiliary variables working as accumulators .
At this point , the rewritin as a while loop is trivial .
For instance , implementing the factorial iteratively in Python has serious advantages : if you run the script # fact_it.py import sys , timeit def fact ( x ) : acc = 1 while x > 0 : acc *= x x -= 1 return acc if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : n = int( sys.argv [ - 1 ] ) t = timeit .
Timer ( ' fact ( %d ) ' % n , ' from fact_it import fact ' ) print t.repeat ( 1 , number=10000000 ) print fact ( n ) you will see a speed - up of circa 50 % with respect to the recursive version for " small " numbers .
Alternatively , you can get an iterative version of the factorial as reduce ( operator.mul , range ( 1 , n+1 ) .
This was suggested by Miki Tebeka in a comment to the previous episode and also gives a sensible speedup .
However notice that reduce is not considered Pythonic and that Guido removed it from the builtins in Python 3.0 - you can find it in functools now .
If you execute the equivalent Scheme code , ( import ( rnrs ) ( only ( ikarus ) time ) ( only ( repeat ) call ) ) ( define ( fac x acc ) ( if ( = x 0 ) acc ( fac (- x 1 ) (* x acc ) ) ) ) ( define n ( string - > number ( car ( reverse ( command - line ) ) ) ) ) ( time ( call 10000000 ( lambda ( ) ( fac n 1 ) ) ) ) ( display " result : " ) ( display ( fac n 1 ) ) ( newline ) you will discover that it is slightly slower than the non tail - call version ( the tail - call requires less memory to run , anyway ) .
In any case we are an order of magnituder over Python efficiency .
If we consider benchmarks strongly dependent on function call efficiency , like the Fibonacci benchmark of Antonio Cangiano , the difference between Python and Scheme is even greater : on my tests Ikarus is thirty times faster than Python .
Other implementations of Scheme or other functional languages ( ML , Haskell ) can be even faster ( I tried the SML / NJ implementation , which is forty times faster than Python 2.5 ) .
Of course those benchmarks have no meaning .
With benchmarks one can prove that Python is faster than Python is faster than Fortran and C++ in matrix computations .
If you do not believe it , please read this ;)
That 's all folks , see you next episode !

A Washington , DC voter registration and turnout group on Tuesday agreed to pay a fine of $ 100,000 for the anonymous robocalls that it placed to North Carolina voters prior to the Democratic primary , which took place May 6 .
Page Gardner , Women 's Voices , Women Vote 's president has apologized for any confusion caused by her group 's anonymous robocalls to North Carolina voters .
North Carolina 's Attorney General Roy Cooper has also banned the group , Women 's Voices Women Vote , from engaging in any further voter registration , education or get - out - the - vote activities prior to the election .
The AG started investigating the group after receiving complaints from North Carolina voters living in predominantly black districts , and from the NAACP , and local election reform advocacy group Democracy North Carolina .
The group had come under fire because of its anonymous phone calls and voter registration mailings , some of which reached voters already registered .
The calls played a 20 - second message voiced by a man who called himself " Lamont Williams . "
" In the next few days , you will receive a voter - registration packet in the mail , " the Williams recording said .
" All you need to do is sign it , date it and return your application .
Then you will be able to vote and make your voice heard .
Please return the voter - registration form when it arrives .
Thank you . "
North Carolina law requires the originators of such calls to identify themselves and to provide their contact information to the voters .
Women 's Voices Women Vote had done neither .
A statement issued by the group Tuesday said that its failure to identify itself was " an inadvertent error , " and it defended its voter registration efforts .
" It was not our intention that the robocalls or our mailings cause any confusion as to whether any individual was already registered to vote , said the group 's President Page Gardner in a statement .
" To the contrary , our effort was squarely aimed at encouraging registration of underrepresented voters in North
Carolina for the upcoming general election .
We took every step available to us to make our intent clear in this regard . "
Shaun Dakin , Founder and CEO of the National Political Do Not Call Registry , said that the state AG 's enforcement of the civil penalty is unusual .
" That 's the first time I 've heard of it , and it 's really unique , " he said .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has told U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the most populous U.S. state may need the federal government to buy $ 7 billion of debt the state is unable to sell due to weak credit markets - and that California may not be alone .

The $ 7 billion issue of revenue anticipation notes would raise cash to tide California over the near term until it gets expected revenues , but the plan to sell the debt is in peril because the municipal debt market is frozen , State Treasurer Bill Lockyer said earlier this week .
“ This is not a normal year , ” said Lockyer spokesman Tom Dresslar on Friday , adding that the state was preparing the issue but that markets were in turmoil : “ The paralysis lingers . ”
The municipal bond market , where California hopes to sell its short - term notes , has all but frozen up over the past three weeks as buyers have been scarce and tax - exempt yields have skyrocketed .
Few deals have been priced , while scores of issuers such as states , hospitals , school districts and others , have postponed their bond sales awaiting a market turn around .
However , the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a landmark $ 700 billion financial industry bailout bill , which has been seen as a key to calming market fears around the world .
After the bailout bill ’s passage , municipal bond yields began to retreat , indicating improved demand for public debt , which should help issuers .
If the state could not sell the notes , it would have to adopt measures to cut spending , such as delaying salaries of teachers and other state employees .
Lockyer , a Democrat , and Schwarzenegger , a Republican , have warned that California may have to delay payments for essential state services such as law enforcement , and in his letter to Paulson the celebrity governor said his state is not alone .
“ Absent a clear resolution to this financial crisis that restores confidence and liquidity to the credit markets , California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the Federal Treasury for short - term financing , ” Schwarzenegger said in a letter to Paulson dated October 2 and provided to Reuters on Friday .
“ The economic fallout from this national credit crisis continues to drain state tax coffers , making it even more difficult to weather the continuation of frozen credit markets for any length of time , ” Schwarzenegger said .
Lockyer said on Wednesday the planned note sale was at risk from the uncertainty gripping financial markets .
“ Basically no credit is available -- zero today , ” the treasurer of the biggest U.S. issuer of municipal debt told Reuters in a telephone interview .
He and Schwarzenegger both supported a federal recovery plan ahead of the House vote on Friday .
Many California state officials fear state financial assistance to local governments may be cut while local sales tax and property tax revenues are sagging .
Additionally , many are concerned about the financial condition of public pension funds .
The state ’s liquidity squeeze weighed on its Congressional delegation .
“ I ca n’t recall when that has happened before , ” Rep. Dan Lungren , a California Republican said on the floor of the U.S. House .
“ That ought to give us some pause here . ”
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said the Republican governor and Democratic state treasurer are in agreement on California approaching the U.S. government to buy its notes if necessary .
“ If we ca n’t secure these loans through traditional means , which is the RAN market on Wall Street , we may need to try something else , which is essentially asking the federal government , ” McLear said .
“ We ca n’t pay our bills if we do n’t have money ...
It would affect all the bills the state is required to pay . ”
“ If the Congress is unable to act , it ’s going to make liquidity in the financial market much more difficult to access , ” McLear added .

Well , he could always try suspending the election ...
With exactly five weeks to go before voting day , who knows what the McCain campaign is going to try next ?
August and September have been anything but boring .
And with a poll showing Barack Obama won last Friday 's debate , the prospect for an even more interesting October seems likely .
Two months of surprises
The American electorate has been on a roller coaster of surprises from Team McCain , including the selection of a complete unknown as John McCain 's running mate , portraying Barack Obama as the next Messiah , featuring Paris Hilton and Britney Spears in campaign ads , high - profile media cancellations , suspending his campaign , and calling for the postponement of the debate .
These were planned strategies tactics .
The list does n't mention the dramatics of a hacked email account , a senior campaign official questioning her own candidate 's credentials ( twice ) , and a disastrous television interview which could singlehandedly resurrect Saturday Night Live .
If this was all in the Republican nominee 's Fall playbook , one wonders if the campaign secretly dumped campaign managers Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and elevated Charles Barkley to steer the ship .
Gave it a shot
McCain 's latest gamble , inserting himself into the high profile financial bailout deliberations , did n't work out with the failure of the package yesterday .
You could argue that McCain pulled a Leon Lett yesterday .
Lett was the Dallas Cowboys defender who infamously threw a touchdown celebration on the ten yard line only to have the ball stripped away .
" I 've never been afraid of stepping in to solve problems for the American people , and I 'm not going to stop now , " he told a cheering crowd in Ohio .
" Sen . Obama took a very different approach to the crisis our country faced .
At first he did n't want to get involved .
Then he was monitoring the situation . "
" That 's not leadership , that 's watching from the sidelines , " he said .
No one is to blame ( except you )
Speaking at a campaign event following the failure of the bill , however , the celebratory tone was gone and McCain blamed Obama before calling for the suspension of blame .
" Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process , ” McCain said .
" Now is not the time to fix the blame .
It ’s time to fix the problem . "
Look the other way
Meanwhile , over at the Obama camp , things are pretty quiet .
Even Joe Biden - who 's trying very hard - can't screw things up .
Sensing that they 've got the clear momentum , the Obama campaign released a tell - tale statement this morning on the financial crisis that leaves out one important thing -- any mention of John McCain .
" Yesterday , within the course of a few hours , the failure to pass the economic rescue plan in Washington led to the single largest decline of the stock market in two decades , " the statement reads .
" While I , like others , am outraged that the reign of irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has created the current crisis , I also know that continued inaction in the face of the gathering storm in our financial markets would be catastrophic for our economy and our families . "
Next ?
Everyone would agree it's been a rough two weeks for the Republican .
But McCain 's been down before .
Many times .
And he keeps coming back .
ESPN's Chris Berman had a nickname for a former Detroit Lions coach who kept mystically coming back , despite the many losses and frequent calls for his firing .
Berman nicknamed that coach " Rasputin " and John McCain is one candidate who has proven time and time again - just like Rasputin - that he knows how to come back .
The trial was one of the most protracted and complex ever held for a terrorism case in Britain , after what Scotland Yard described as one of the largest - scale criminal investigations ever mounted here .
After three months of evidence , the case against the eight men  all British Muslims aged 24 to 30 , and six with family roots in Pakistan  went to the jury in late July .
A two - week holiday break ordered by the judge was followed by what appeared to have been an impasse of more than three weeks among jurors on the most serious charges , even after the judge , David Calvert - Smith , allowed the jury to reach verdicts with at least 10 of the 12 jurors in agreement .
By exactly that margin , the jurors on Monday returned guilty verdicts on the murder conspiracy charges against three men who prosecutors said had been at the heart of the plot : Abdulla Ahmed Ali , 27 , a husband and father who studied computer systems engineering ; Assad Sarwar , 28 , a college dropout who learned how to make the liquid hydrogen peroxide bomb in Pakistan ; and Tanvir Hussain , 27 , who helped in the purchase of materials and in making the suicide videos .
The defendants planned to drain 17 - ounce plastic sports drink bottles by puncturing a tiny hole in the bottom , prosecutors said , then refilling the bottles with an explosive mix of concentrated hydrogen peroxide and food coloring to give the appearance of the original beverage .
The prosecution said the bottles were to have been resealed with instant glue , and then , once the bombers were aboard the flights , connected with detonators made of AA batteries filled with the explosive HMTD and disposable cameras acting as triggers .
Scotland Yard said at the time of the arrests that it had found plastic drink bottles and large quantities of hydrogen peroxide on premises used by the defendants , along with “ martyrdom ” videos taped by six defendants , in the manner common among Islamic suicide bombers .
Also found was a computer memory stick belonging to Mr. Ali , who described himself in court as the leader of the plot , that had files with highlighted schedules for seven flights to New York , Washington , Chicago , San Francisco , Montreal and Toronto between July and October 2006 aboard aircraft operated by American Airlines , United Airlines and Air Canada .
The computer files included information on baggage rules , guidance as to what could be carried as hand luggage and information about Heathrow Airport in London , Scotland Yard said .
But the jury failed to reach verdicts against seven of the eight men on the most serious charge , that of conspiring “ to murder persons unknown by the detonation of improvised explosive devices on board trans -Atlantic passenger aircraft . ”
By finding three of the men guilty of plotting murder , but not of an airliner bombing conspiracy , the jury appeared to have concluded that they had the means and the intention of detonating bombs , but that the prosecution had failed to prove conclusively that they had planned to attack airliners .
Some may be asking how all of this is tied to oil and energy .
There are quite a number of relationships :
Today , the financial markets are struggling with Lehman Brothers ' Chapter 11 bankruptcy , AIG 's problems , and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America .
There is also the problem of the unwind of the credit - default swaps tied to hundreds of billions of dollars of Fannie and Freddie debt .
This thread is intended for folks who want to discuss what is now happening .
(1) Some of the organizations with problems were no doubt speculating in oil futures .
Once the prices started to drop , the balance sheets of the organizations were affected , and they suddenly needed more capital .
(2) As the companies who speculated in the oil market ( all of them , not just the particular ones having problems today ) try to unwind their positions because of margin calls , they drive down the price of oil in the futures market .
That is likely why we are seeing declining oil prices , at a time when fundamentals would say they should be rising .
(3) As the price of oil and food rises , people have less money to pay debt of all kinds .
This has contributed to the rising mortgages defaults , and is helping to drive down home prices .
This is very closely tied to problems of banks and other financial institutions .
(4) Structured securities based on sliced and diced mortgages and other debt depend on assumptions regarding " independence of defaults " .
Once a shortage of oil and higher food and energy prices start causing mortgage defaults , the defaults are no longer independent ( as they would be if they were caused by an illness of a particular homeowner , for example ) .
Instead , there is a systematic bias in the pricing the risk , and the structuring does n't work as planned .
(5) Energy companies need well - functioning credit markets to expand their exploration and production , and to pursue alternative energy approaches .
For example , expanding the use of wind energy , or electric - powered vehicles , is likely to need a huge amount of debt financing .
I have warned in the past about the possibility of a debt implosion .
There is a significant possibility that what we are seeing now is beginning of such an implosion .
There are a number of institutions that have problems .
Systemic risk ( caused in part by counter - party failures ) can cause these problems to spread to other institutions .

In that article , I say :

There is a chance that some type of discontinuity will make financial conditions suddenly take a turn for the worse .
With the events of last weekend and this weekend , there is a significant chance we are hitting such a point .
In that article , I say :
As we go forward , I expect that there will be more and more individuals , businesses and governments that will be unable to repay their debt , because of indirect impacts of higher oil prices flowing through the economy .
Eventually , the US government will have to make a decision as to what to do about all these defaults .
The most obvious options would seem to be : ( 1 ) Prop up as many as possible
(2) Let the chips fall where they may
We are now getting to see what happens when the US government lets the chips fall where they may .
Another article that is of interest is an article by Jerome a Paris ( Jerome Guillet ) :

Finally , Energy , Hurricanes , and Hedge Funds explains why short term financial movements have the ability to overpower the energy supply / demand fundamentals - especially their impact on energy prices .

Allen Tom has an interesting post on the Yahoo !
Developer blog entitled Yahoo !
Releases OpenID
Research where he shares the results of some usability studies the folks at Yahoo ! have been doing around OpenID .
The concluding paragraphs of his post are particularly interesting and are excerpted below
I 'm happy to announce that Yahoo ! is releasing the results of a usability study that we did for OpenID .
Our test subjects were several experienced Yahoo ! users ( representative of our mainstream audience ) who were observed as they tried to sign into a product review site using the Yahoo OpenID service .
...
On the Yahoo ! side of things , we streamlined our OP ( OpenID Provider ) last week , and removed as much as we could .
We removed the CAPTCHA and slimmed down the OP to just a single screen , and focused the UI to get the user back to the RP .
We expect that RPs will enjoy a much higher success rate for users signing in with their Yahoo OpenID .
On the RP ( Relying Party ) side of things , our recommendation is that they emphasize to users that they can sign in with an existing account , specifically their YahooID .
We believe that the YahooID , as well has IDs from other providers , have a higher brand awareness than OpenID .
We also believe that first time users signing in with an OpenID should be able to go directly to their intended destination after signing in , instead of having to complete additional registration .
Hopefully , as SimpleReg / AttributeExchange are more widely supported ( Yahoo does not currently support them ) , relying parties will no longer feel the need to force the user through an additional registration form after signing in with an OpenID .
It 's nice to see how much of this dovetails with my post on Things to Keep in Mind when Implementing OpenID on Your Website .
In that post , I pointed out that the key risk of using OpenID on your Web site ( i.e. being a Relying Party ) is that there is a high risk of losing users if the OpenID sign - in flow is more complicated than simply having the user sign - up for your site .
The Yahoo !
usability study points to the fact that this seems to be the common case in typical OpenID deployments .
Actually there are two problems .
The first being that most people do n't know what OpenID is so simply stating that people can use OpenIDs to log - in to your site or using the logo may work for geeks but does n't work for the typical Web user .
The risk here is that the work of deploying ID on your site ends up being wasted .
The second problem is the risk of losing the user after they decide to use OpenID to sign - in either due to an unintuitive user experience on your site ( e.g. having to enter an OpenID URL ) or on the site of the OpenID provider ( e.g. lots of jargon with no clear call to action ) .
I did find it interesting that Yahoo !
is recommending that services should prefer to using the brand of the target services whose credentials you plan to accept [ especially if you white list OpenID providers you support ] instead of using the OpenID brand since it is n't recognizable to the typical Web user .
I tend to agree with this , OpenID is a means to an end and not an end in itself so it is weird to be putting it front and center in an end user facing user experience .
Talking explicitly about OpenID should probably be at the developer to developer level .
I feel the same way about RSS and other Web technologies for connecting services together .
The other interesting point is that a lot of services still require users to go through a sign - up flow after logging in with an OpenID thus the only thing they 've saved is having the user pick a username ( which would probably have been their email address ) and password .
That saving does n't seem worth the extra complexity in the user experience of going through an OpenID provider .
I agree with Tom that if more OpenID providers supported OpenID Attribute Exchange then the need for a post - login account creation would likely disappear since the Relying Party would get the basic information they need from the OpenID provider .
In conclusion , the typical way OpenID is being implemented on the Web today leads to more costs than benefits .
Hopefully , services will take to heart the lessons from Yahoo's usability study and we 'll start seeing smarter usage of OpenID that benefits both users and the services that are adopting the technology .
Now Playing : Leona Lewis - Better In Time
Well , the rumor going around that IBM is doubling up the processor core counts on its Power Systems servers turns out to be true .
Today , IBM announced that it has doubled up the cores in the Power 570 to a maximum of 32 , and it's now offering a 16 - core box called the Power 560 that slides in underneath it in the product line .
As expected , IBM also doubled the core count on entry Power 520 and midrange Power 550 machines when running the i 6.1 ( formerly OS / 400 and i 5 / OS ) operating system to four and eight cores respectively , bringing the i variants to parity with AIX and Linux boxes that shipped in April .
The move to double up the Power6 core counts in some of the Power Systems machines is not just about giving customers headroom .
It is also about making the Power6 boxes more competitive against current and future X64 , RISC , and Itanium midrange gear from Hewlett - Packard , Sun Microsystems , Fujitsu - Siemens , Dell , NEC , and Unisys - and even IBM 's own System x line of x64 servers .
The Power 560 is interesting in that , for many customers , it has just replaced the Power 570 , offering up to 16 cores .
But it does so in half the space - two linked chassis instead of four .
The Power 560 can be equipped with four , eight , or 16 cores running at 3.6 GHz , which is slower than the top - end 5 GHz Power6 parts .
Each core has 4 MB of L2 cache , just like in other Power6 machines , and each pair of cores has a 32 MB L3 cache in the chip package .
The Power6 chips include AltiVec math units and decimal floating point units , the latter accelerating calculations having to do with money .
Main memory in the Power 560 box expands from 8 GB to 384 GB ( it 's DDR2 SDRAM ) , and each chassis has room for six 3.5 - inch SAS drives that link into an on - board SAS controller .
The base system comes with two Gigabit Ethernet ports per chassis , with 10 Gigabit Ethernet as an option .
The machine supports AIX 5.3 or 6.1 , i 6.1 ( but not i5 / OS V5R4 , which is supported on other Power6 - based rack machinery ) , and Linux with the 2.6 kernel ( Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP1 and SP2 and Red Hat 's Enterprise Linux 4.5 or later and 5.1 or later releases are certified on the machine ) .
IBM provided list pricing for Power 560 machines configured running AIX and Linux , but did not offer pricing for those running the i 6.1 operating system .
A four - core Power 560 with 16 GB of main memory and two 146 GB SAS drives costs $ 47,216 in a so - called Express configuration , which means it is pre-configured and comes with a modest discount .
AIX costs $ 1,540 per core on top of that , and Linux costs whatever Red Hat and Novell want to charge or what IBM will give you as a Linux reseller .
Specifically , that is $ 719 for RHEL 5 with an unlimited number of sockets and up to 25 logical partitions using IBM 's PowerVM hypervisor and IBM 's own Linux support and $ 1,349 for the same thing with Red Hat 's support .
And SLES is even cheaper , at $ 315 for a one - year license when backed up by IBM support and $ 892 with Novell support .
A license to i 6.1 appears to cost $ 40,000 per core , which is the same price it cost on earlier 550 - class midrange machines and a lot less than the $ 53,000 IBM is charging on Power 570 machines .
With the modified Power 570s , there are now two ways to build a system .
The Power 570 , like its System i and System p predecessors , is really one to four servers lashed together into a single system image by IBM 's own Power chipsets .
( In this regard , it is like the System x " Hurricane " x3950 and its predecessors or the new " Monster Xeon " X64 server created by NEC and Unisys ) .
The old way of building a Power 570 is to scale from one to four boxes and use Power6 cores running at 3.5 GHz , 4.2 GHz , or 4.7 GHz .
With today 's announcements , a 4.4 GHz and a 5 GHz option is now available in the earlier Power 570 boards .
The new way to build a Power 570 is to use double - density motherboards that have eight processor sockets per board , for a total of 16 sockets across two chassis , giving the maximum of 32 cores in a single system image .
IBM is only offering 4.2 GHz Power6 cores in this new Power 570 box , and that 's due to heating , cooling , and power draw issues , according to Ross Mauri , general manager of IBM's Power Systems division .
The two variants of the Power 570 run all the same operating systems as the Power 560 , except that IBM is also throwing in support for the older i5 / OS V5R4 .
The memory capacity of the Power 570 depends on what speed memory customers use and how many chassis customers use .
With 667 MHz memory , the maximum capacity per chassis is only 48 GB , but it rises to 192 GB using cooler - and slower - 400 MHz DIMMs .
Pricing was not available for the doubled - up Power 570 at press time .
But you can bet a bunch of AIX and i customers are trying to figure out if they can get away with this new Power 570 instead of having to move to a much more expensive ( and yet , more scalable ) Power 595 server , the biggest box Big Blue builds .
The Power 560 and the updated Power 570 machines are available on November 21 worldwide .
It is a bit of a mystery why IBM did n't offer the Power 520 i Edition machines with the full core count back in April , but it is probably just a matter of the company wanting to sell Power 550 boxes to those customers eager to get more oomph than the crimped Power 520s offered , and thereby extracting a bit more dough out of them .
( Processing capacity and i 6.1 and i5 / OS V5R4 operating system licenses are more expensive on the Power 550 than on the Power 520 , and that can tide a server maker over in a tough quarter or two ) .
The decision may have had something to do with yields on Power6 chips , allowing IBM to get AIX customers the full capacity first and then System i shops ( who often do n't need more than one or two cores anyway ) the extra headroom later .

From the Financial Times :
Opec on Thursday brought forward to next week an emergency meeting to consider a cut in production after oil prices dropped to less than $ 70 a barrel for the first time in more than a year on worries about a global recession .
The move coincided with fresh calls from those countries within the oil producing cartel that are heavily dependent on oil revenues for their budgets â€ “ most notably Iran , the organisationâ€™s perennial hawk â€ “ to cut output .
Ecuador and Qatar also supported slashing production .
Even Saudi Arabia , the cartelâ€™s most powerful member , which initially opposed the 500,000 barrel a day cut announced last month and is close to the US , appears to be in agreement that the group needs to reduce its production .
The kingdom , which boosted its output by far more than any other Opec member when prices were high and supply was struggling to keep up with demand , has already cut some shipments , according to ship tracking data .
Opec had said that it would need to pump about 31.3 m barrels a day in the first quarter of next year to balance the market , well below its current output of 32.2 m b/d , suggesting that the cartel sees a need to cut output by almost 1 m b/d .
Ben Dell , of Sanford C. Bernstein a New York research firm , said Opec would need to make an additional cut of 1 m barrels a day in order to avoid a glut in the market in 2009 .
â€ œSuch a large cut in production is only likely to come from Saudi Arabia as the other Opec members are levered to higher oil prices in order to maintain their spending programmes , â€ said Mr Dell in a report .
The meeting will be the biggest test in more than a decade of Opecâ€™s resolve and power to form a cohesive unit to stop tumbling oil prices .
The group will have to act decisively in its round of cuts because otherwise it runs the risk of pushing down prices even further as traders write it off as toothless .
Opecâ€™s decision to meet next Friday came after investors sold commodities en masse amid worries that the credit crunch had mutated into a global toxic economic crisis that would damp demand for raw materials .
In its monthly report , the cartel said that even if governments were successful in unfreezing credit markets in the near future , â€ œthe fallout on the real economy from the financial market headwinds is expected to be Â­considerableâ€ .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
When a newly developed technology for producing hydrogen gas from biowaste is brought to commercial use – as researchers believe it can be – then it appears the world will have plenty of energy if it can just solve the stubborn shortage of sewage .
A new approach has been developed to use several types of biowaste , including ordinary municipal sewage , to produce hydrogen at a much lower cost than the traditional “ electrolysis ” technology , and make it more viable for use in the hydrogen fuel cells that many believe will power automobiles of the future .
The findings have just been reported in Water Research , a professional journal , by researchers in the College of Engineering at Oregon State University .
Studies suggest that this approach could reduce the amount of energy needed to produce hydrogen by as much as 75 percent , compared with hydrogen production by water electrolysis .
More work needs to be done to reduce the cost for electrode materials and more advances in efficiency are possible , experts say .
" In the laboratory we 're already quite close to the Department of Energy hydrogen cost goal of $ 2 to $ 3 per gasoline gallon equivalent , or GGE , " said Hong Liu , an OSU assistant professor of biological and ecological engineering .
" And with some additional research it should be possible to scale these systems up to levels needed for commercial use . "
But that 's not even the best news , Liu said .
While it 's producing significant amounts of hydrogen from sewage , this system also cleans the water .
Conceptually , treatment plants could be developed that take in sewage on one end and send clean water and hydrogen fuel out the other .
Their production potential may only be limited by the amount of raw waste they have available – and sewage in the future may no longer be a waste disposal problem but rather a valued commodity , another important component of the nation 's sustainable energy equation .
Other forms of biowaste could also be used , scientists say .
The use of woody biomass is possible .
The large amounts of waste from food processing factories would be a good candidate , as well as agricultural waste such as the huge amounts of manure produced in cattle , hog , and other livestock operations .
In that context , it may be quite possible to make a silk purse out of a sow's rear .
All of this was achieved through fundamental research on " microbial electrolysis cells , " or MECs , that use a new " membrane free " approach that costs less and is significantly more efficient than existing approaches .
" The removal of membrane not only can simplify the construction , operation and maintenance of MECs , but it also can decrease the internal resistance , thus increase the hydrogen production rate , " the researchers said in their report .
In these systems , naturally occurring microorganisms from sewage attach to the surface of an anode and degrade the waste in the sewage , in a device that is something like a battery .
The waste decomposes , eventually leaving protons that migrate to the cathode , combine with electrons and generate hydrogen .
These systems can be adapted to generate electricity directly or used to produce hydrogen , which in turn can be used to produce electricity from hydrogen fuel cells – an existing and widely proven technology .
" Hydrogen has often been thought of as the ideal fuel to run fuel - cell powered automobiles , " Liu said .
" Hydrogen fuel cells are about 60 percent efficient , roughly double that of a gasoline internal combustion engine .
And there is no air pollution ; the only byproduct from operation of the fuel cell is water . "
One of the biggest steps still needed to make this type of fuel cell vehicle a reality is solving hydrogen production issues – and the new technology developed in Liu 's laboratory might produce hydrogen at a cost close to the DOE goal .
Those cost figures do not include the potential savings of billions of dollars spent in treating the nation 's wastewater , which further increase the economical viability of the technology .
" Another interesting application of this approach might be in developing countries or remote areas , " Liu said .
" Often these places have few or no waste treatment plants , and no practical way in a remote location to produce electricity .
Small systems used there might solve both problems .
" There 's no doubt this could help contribute to a more sustainable future , " Liu said .
" We could clean up our sewage and produce fuel at the same time .
That 's very promising . "

A couple of weeks back I noticed that the figure being reported by Google Analytics representing our page views was less than our ad impressions .
There is room for variance , for example the top leaderboard also appears on QBase , which is n’t in our overall traffic count , although I have access to figures for the site .
Although QBase occasionally has some strong traffic , the gap was n’t accounted for ; it was clear that either our ad service was overcounting impressions , or Google Analytics was wrong .
Then it got weirder .
We run Adsense units as remnant inventory , and on a couple of days Adsense was showing a higher page count than Analytics was .
Something was clearly wrong .
I did some digging and while there has been issues with Google Analytics in the past , nothing explained what I was seeing .
Then I worked it out .
We may not have the quickest page load at The Inquisitr , but I ’ve always been wary of not making the site bloated to load , like Mashable ( which was up at one stage to 2 mb on the front page ) and TechCrunch ( which has slimmed back , but was traditionally a heavy load ) .
There are external factors I can’t control , the ad serving for one , and then services like Lijit and Outbrain do slow the site down , sometimes more than others .
But still , the load is n’t horrible .
And yet when I started the site , I was focused on delivering the content first , with the rest to follow .
The header naturally leads with the content following , but the rest of the sidebar then eventually footer loads after that .
Some times the load time can be seconds , other times ( and depending on your connection and whether you ’ve visited the site before ) it can be out to 30 seconds or more .
I realized that the difference , even between the post footer ad and the sidebar ad were that people were hitting the site and leaving it before the other things had loaded .
And where was the Google Analytics code you ask ?
Last thing loaded in the footer .
Google recommends that you put the code for Google Analytics in the footer , and I ’m not about to tell you to disagree with them , but a couple of days back I swapped the code from the footer to the header , and 2 days in all of a sudden my ads views are a close match to my Google Analytics page views .
There ’s no rorting of the system in what I ’ve done .
In the early days , Google actually suggested you place the code up front .
The down side is that running javascript up front can decrease your load times , but so far I ’ve found the difference minor at best .
If you ’re running a WordPress blog and thinking of trying the code up front , it must reside after the body tag , but if it ’s in your header and that ’s the first part of a page load , it ’s a 99 % bet that every page view will be counted .
As a delegate to the Democratic National Convention , I pledged my support for Barack Obama , and when I go to vote on Election Day , I ’m also voting “ yes ” on Amendment 46 , known as the Colorado Civil Rights Initiative .
It ’s the right thing to do .
I came to this position after months of deep thought and personal reflection .
As a person of color , I had concerns about the unintended consequences that the opponents of this measure claim .
After careful analysis of the ballot and constitutional language and introspection of my life experiences and Colorado , I am confident that the state that I love and am deeply proud of is prepared to take this step towards a more perfect union .
Amendment 46 specifically prohibits our government from using race or gender as factors in public hiring , public contracting or public education .
Similar initiatives , met with overwhelming voter support in other states , have seen minorities and women thrive .
In California , minority students enrolled in the University of California system are much less likely to drop out .
Black and Latino student enrollment is up at seven of nine UC campuses and women now constitute nearly 60 percent of the systemwide student population .
Race and gender - based affirmative action sets low expectations for minorities and women .
Do we really want to continue policy that allows us to as a society say , “ No , we ca n’t do better ” ?
I understand the cycle of inequity firsthand .
Good parents , including my mother , know that the only way to break the cycle of inequity would be for her children to do something comparatively extraordinary .
She offered the personal sacrifice required to move from the projects to the suburbs and to put her children through Juilliard and the University of Colorado .
In return , she expected excellence from us , teaching us that reliance on assistance programs is not the same as success , and that to be truly free you must be judged worthy exclusively on your merits absent of pity .
These teachings , the remnants of Dr. King and the leaders of “ Black America ’s greatest generation ” have been lost to entitlement and confusing mediocrity with prosperity .
The assumption that a person who is a minority can only achieve greatness with accommodations breeds a culture that expects us to fail .
Policy cannot cure bias ; the only treatment for this social disease is the example of successful , undeniably qualified women and people of color .
Good parenting that instills the values of pride , self worth , and personal responsibility is what allows people of all ethnicities to rise out of poverty .
These values are no more a guarantee of success than affirmative action , but unlike affirmative action , those values are a prerequisite for enduring prosperity .
Good public policy is forged when we begin with where we agree .
We all agree that the biggest obstacle to educational and employment opportunities is a person ’s economic status .
This is true in urban and rural Colorado and is consistent regardless of race or gender .
Affirmative action also allows us to take the easy way out by focusing on race and gender rather than the real and more serious and challenging problem of economic inequity .
The biggest barrier to higher education is money .
And the biggest barrier to long - term employment success is education .
To be clear , Amendment 46 prohibits only state institutions from employing preferential treatment programs .
Targeted affirmative action programs will still be allowed by private and non-profit organizations provided they are not using public money to implement them .
Colorado , like America , is imperfect , but we have made tremendous strides .
Let us ratify our successes and focus on our century ’s emerging social inequity crisis .
Let ’s fix our low - income schools .
Let ’s ensure that all of our students , regardless of their biology , are being prepared to be competitive for admittance to our nation ’s institutions of higher learning .
Let ’s be sure that through education , hard work and excellence that their merits , and their merits alone , will determine employment opportunities they have .
Join me in supporting Amendment 46 , a true civil rights initiative that makes our state government treat us all equally .

“ I wish there was a network that 24 hours [ a day ] played Daily Show - esque clips of ‘ Bush said this and a month ago he said this and it ’s completely the opposite .

Same - sex couples in Connecticut need not be satisfied with civil unions and may marry , the state Supreme Court of Connecticut ruled in a just - released decision .
Writing for the majority in the 4 - 3 decision , Justice Richard Palmer found :
We conclude that , in light of the history of pernicious discrimination faced by gay men and lesbians , and because the institution of marriage carries with it a status and significance that the newly created classification of civil unions does not embody , the segregation of heterosexual and homosexual couples into separate institutions constitutes a cognizable harm .
The case found in favour of eight same - sex couples who in 2004 were denied marriage licenses by officials in Madison , Connecticut .
The couples sued , arguing the ban on same - sex marriage violates the state constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination ( because a woman may not marry a woman , though a man may ) .
They also argued the ban discriminates against gays , who are a separate class under state equal - protection law .
The defendants , who included the state public health commissioner and the Madison town clerk , argued the same - sex couples had suffered no harm because the state 's civil union statute affords them all the rights and privileges of heterosexual married couples .
Also , " The defendants contended that , in light of the universally understood definition of marriage as the union of a man
and a woman , the right that the plaintiffs were asserting , namely , the right to marry ' any person of one 's choosing , ' is not a fundamental right . "
In another election year , say 2004 or 2006 , I would fear this would gain traction as a wedge issue for the Republicans , and we would see Republican candidates railing against " activist judges " and riling up social conservatives to drive them to the polls .
But my sense this year is voters are far too focused on their dwindling retirement portfolios to care whether gays in Connecticut can marry instead of merely civilly uniting .
Also , Connecticut is now the third state , after Massachusetts and California , to grant full marriage to same - sex couples . , so
The right may by now have expended all of its demagoguing energy on those states and on the 2004 anti-gay marriage amendments in more conservative states .
The Israel Lobby ?
Noam Chomsky
ZNet , March 28 , 2006
I ’ve received many requests to comment on the article by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt ( henceforth M - W ) , published in the London Review of Books , which has been circulating extensively on the internet and has elicited a storm of controversy .
A few thoughts on the matter follow .
It was , as noted , published in the London Review of Books , which is far more open to discussion on these issues than US journals — a matter of relevance ( to which I ’ll return ) to the alleged influence of what M - W call “ the Lobby . ”
An article in the Jewish journal Forward quotes M as saying that the article was commissioned by a US journal , but rejected , and that “ the pro-Israel lobby is so powerful that he and co-author Stephen Walt would never have been able to place their report in a American - based scientific publication . ”
But despite the fact that it appeared in England , the M - W article aroused the anticipated hysterical reaction from the usual supporters of state violence here , from the Wall St Journal to Alan Dershowitz , sometimes in ways that would instantly expose the authors to ridicule if they were not lining up ( as usual ) with power .
M - W deserve credit for taking a position that is sure to elicit tantrums and fanatical lies and denunciations , but it ’s worth noting that there is nothing unusual about that .
Take any topic that has risen to the level of Holy Writ among “ the herd of independent minds ” ( to borrow Harold Rosenberg ’s famous description of intellectuals ) : for example , anything having to do with the Balkan wars , which played a huge role in the extraordinary campaigns of self - adulation that disfigured intellectual discourse towards the end of the millennium , going well beyond even historical precedents , which are ugly enough .
Naturally , it is of extraordinary importance to the herd to protect that self - image , much of it based on deceit and fabrication .
Therefore , any attempt even to bring up plain ( undisputed , surely relevant ) facts is either ignored ( M - W ca n’t be ignored ) , or sets off most impressive tantrums , slanders , fabrications and deceit , and the other standard reactions .
Very easy to demonstrate , and by no means limited to these cases .
Those without experience in critical analysis of conventional doctrine can be very seriously misled by the particular case of the Middle East ( ME ) .
But recognizing that M - W took a courageous stand , which merits praise , we still have to ask how convincing their thesis is .
Not very , in my opinion .
I ’ve reviewed elsewhere what the record ( historical and documentary ) seems to me to show about the main sources of US ME policy , in books and articles for the past 40 years , and ca n’t try to repeat here .
M- W make as good a case as one can , I suppose , for the power of the Lobby , but I do n’t think it provides any reason to modify what has always seemed to me a more plausible interpretation .
Notice incidentally that what is at stake is a rather subtle matter : weighing the impact of several factors which ( all agree ) interact in determining state policy : in particular , ( A ) strategic - economic interests of concentrations of domestic power in the tight state - corporate linkage , and ( B ) the Lobby .
The M - W thesis is that ( B ) overwhelmingly predominates .
To evaluate the thesis , we have to distinguish between two quite different matters , which they tend to conflate : ( 1 ) the alleged failures of US ME policy ; ( 2 ) the role of The Lobby in bringing about these consequences .
Insofar as the stands of the Lobby conform to ( A ) , the two factors are very difficult to disentagle .
And there is plenty of conformity .
Let ’s look at ( 1 ) , and ask the obvious question : for whom has policy been a failure for the past 60 years ?
The energy corporations ?
Hardly .
They have made “ profits beyond the dreams of avarice ” ( quoting John Blair , who directed the most important government inquiries into the industry , in the ’ 70s ) , and still do , and the ME is their leading cash cow .
Has it been a failure for US grand strategy based on control of what the State Department described 60 years ago as the “ stupendous source of strategic power ” of ME oil and the immense wealth from this unparalleled “ material prize ” ?
Hardly .
The US has substantially maintained control — and the significant reverses , such as the overthrow of the Shah , were not the result of the initiatives of the Lobby .
And as noted , the energy corporations prospered .
Furthermore , those extraordinary successes had to overcome plenty of barriers : primarily , as elsewhere in the world , what internal documents call “ radical nationalism , ” meaning independent nationalism .
As elsewhere in the world , it ’s been convenient to phrase these concerns in terms of “ defense against the USSR , ” but the pretext usually collapses quickly on inquiry , in the ME as elsewhere .
And in fact the claim was conceded to be false , officially , shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall , when Bush ’s National Security Strategy ( 1990 ) called for maintaining the forces aimed at the ME , where the serious “ threats to our interests … could not be laid at the Kremlin ’s door ” — now lost as a pretext for pursuing about the same policies as before .
And the same was true pretty much throughout the world .
That at once raises another question about the M - W thesis .
What were “ the Lobbies ” that led to pursuing very similar policies throughout the world ?
Consider the year 1958 , a very critical year in world affairs .
In 1958 , the Eisenhower administration identified the three leading challenges to the US as the ME , North Africa , and Indonesia — all oil producers , all Islamic .
North Africa was taken care of by Algerian ( formal ) independence .
Indonesia and the ME were taken care of by Suharto ’s murderous slaughter ( 1965 ) and Israel ’s destruction of Arab secular nationalism ( Nasser , 1967 ) .
In the ME , that established the close US - Israeli alliance and confirmed the judgment of US intelligence in 1958 that a “ logical corollary ” of opposition to “ radical nationalism ” ( meaning , secular independent nationalism ) is “ support for Israel ” as the one reliable US base in the region ( along with Turkey , which entered into close relations with Israel in the same year ) .
Suharto ’s coup aroused virtual euphoria , and he remained “ our kind of guy ” ( as the Clinton administration called him ) until he could no longer keep control in 1998 , through a hideous record that compares well with Saddam Hussein — who was also “ our kind of guy ” until he disobeyed orders in 1990 .
What was the Indonesia Lobby ?
The Saddam Lobby ?
And the question generalizes around the world .
Unless these questions are faced , the issue ( 1 ) cannot be seriously addressed .
When we do investigate ( 1 ) , we find that US policies in the ME are quite similar to those pursued elsewhere in the world , and have been a remarkable success , in the face of many difficulties : 60 years is a long time for planning success .
It ’s true that Bush II has weakened the US position , not only in the ME , but that ’s an entirely separate matter .
That leads to ( 2 ) .
As noted , the US - Israeli alliance was firmed up precisely when Israel performed a huge service to the US - Saudis - Energy corporations by smashing secular Arab nationalism , which threatened to divert resources to domestic needs .
That ’s also when the Lobby takes off ( apart from the Christian evangelical component , by far the most numerous and arguably the most influential part , but that ’s mostly the 90s ) .
And it ’s also when the intellectual - political class began their love affair with Israel , previously of little interest to them .
They are a very influential part of the Lobby because of their role in media , scholarship , etc .
From that point on it ’s hard to distinguish “ national interest ” ( in the usual perverse sense of the phrase ) from the effects of the Lobby .
I ’ve run through the record of Israeli services to the US , to the present , elsewhere , and wo n’t review it again here .
M - W focus on AIPAC and the evangelicals , but they recognize that the Lobby includes most of the political - intellectual class — at which point the thesis loses much of its content .
They also have a highly selective use of evidence ( and much of the evidence is assertion ) .
Take , as one example , arms sales to China , which they bring up as undercutting US interests .
But they fail to mention that when the US objected , Israel was compelled to back down : under Clinton in 2000 , and again in 2005 , in this case with the Washington neocon regime going out of its way to humiliate Israel .
Without a peep from The Lobby , in either case , though it was a serious blow to Israel .
There ’s a lot more like that .
Take the worst crime in Israel ’s history , its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 with the goal of destroying the secular nationalist PLO and ending its embarrassing calls for political settlement , and imposing a client Maronite regime .
The Reagan administration strongly supported the invasion through its worst atrocities , but a few months later ( August ) , when the atrocities were becoming so severe that even NYT Beirut correspondent Thomas Friedman was complaining about them , and they were beginning to harm the US “ national interest , ” Reagan ordered Israel to call off the invasion , then entered to complete the removal of the PLO from Lebanon , an outcome very welcome to both Israel and the US ( and consistent with general US opposition to independent nationalism ) .
The outcome was not entirely what the US - Israel wanted , but the relevant observation here is that the Reaganites supported the aggression and atrocities when that stand was conducive to the “ national interest , ” and terminated them when it no longer was ( then entering to finish the main job ) .
That ’s pretty normal .
Another problem that M - W do not address is the role of the energy corporations .
They are hardly marginal in US political life — transparently in the Bush administration , but in fact always .
How can they be so impotent in the face of the Lobby ?
As ME scholar Stephen Zunes has rightly pointed out , “ there are far more powerful interests that have a stake in what happens in the Persian Gulf region than does AIPAC [ or the Lobby generally ] , such as the oil companies , the arms industry and other special interests whose lobbying influence and campaign contributions far surpass that of the much - vaunted Zionist lobby and its allied donors to congressional races . ”
Do the energy corporations fail to understand their interests , or are they part of the Lobby too ?
By now , what ’s the distinction between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , apart from the margins ?
Also to be explained , again , is why US ME policy is so similar to its policies elsewhere — to which , incidentally , Israel has made important contributions , e.g. , in helping the executive branch to evade congressional barriers to carrying out massive terror in Central America , to evade embargoes against South Africa and Rhodesia , and much else .
All of which again makes it even more difficult to separate ( 2 ) from ( 1 ) — the latter , pretty much uniform , in essentials , throughout the world .
I wo n’t run through the other arguments , but I do n’t feel that they have much force , on examination .
The thesis M - W propose does however have plenty of appeal .
The reason , I think , is that it leaves the US government untouched on its high pinnacle of nobility , “ Wilsonian idealism , ” etc. , merely in the grip of an all - powerful force that it cannot escape .
It ’s rather like attributing the crimes of the past 60 years to “ exaggerated Cold War illusions , ” etc. Convenient , but not too convincing .
In either case .
Today is historic as openly gay Mr. Jared Polis has won the democratic primary in Colorado 's District 2 against his opponents Ms. Joan Fitz - Gerald and Mr. Will Shafroth .
The upcoming election in November is merely a gesture in this heavily democratic district .
Mr. Jared Polis goes on to become the first openly gay person to be elected to congress and the third out representative efter Barney Frank ( MA ) and Tammy Baldwin ( WI ) .
Sexual orientation was a non-issue in this race , and Mr. Polis ran openly , honestly and on a platform of equal rights for LGBT people .
Congrats to him and his partner Marlin Reiss of 4 1/ 2 years , a self proclaimed animal activist and supporter of Friends of Jared for congress .

The end of twentieth Century brought a boom in the usage of Internet , while many sites began to emerge on the web , which now are at their peak of popularity and success .
Its pretty amazing and interesting to know what these sites would have appeared if we would have visited them back in 1998 .
Since technology and web designing was in its embryonic stages and was developing slowing by leaps and bounds , we could easily imagine how they would have looked like ; where an animated GIF created such an incredible visual impact !
Here is a list of 8 websites as they appeared in 1998 compared with how they look in the present days .

If the Red Sox fail to win the East this season — and let 's face it , it 's looking more and more doubtful — we can probably blame this .
One is never really prepared for a video of Jonathan Papelbon at a high school talent show performing Dirty Dancing routines in drag ; it 's just a shock to the system any way you look at it .
Imagine how the Red Sox felt when David Ortiz called a team meeting and showed the video in the clubhouse .
This could put the Curse back into effect .
All kinds of video following the jump .
Nobody puts Papelbon in a corner !
We have Papelbon Dirty Dancing , and performing in drag , all at a high school talent show .
Also , Papelbon in a fashion show .
The video ( shown in its entirety here ) was provided to Comcast 's Gary Tanguay by Sheila Papelbon , Jon 's mother .
" Thanks ... my mother , folks . "
The best part for me was Ortiz interviewing Papelbon following the presentation .
Ortiz seems genuinely confounded by the exhibition , and a bit concerned , as if he will never fully unravel this mystery .
I kind of feel the same way myself .

Scientists have dubbed this newly - discovered ant Martialis heureka , implying that it 's so weird it could have come from Mars .
Found in the Brazliian rainforest , it has no eyes , and its " mouth " is like a pair of long forceps .
According to University of Texas at Austin evolutionary biologist Christian Rabeling , Martialis heureka is from the oldest ant lineage still living .
From Science
News :
Its DNA may be even more interesting .
Genetic analysis puts the new ant so far from other species that it deserves its own subfamily , Martialinae , Rabeling and his colleagues report in an upcoming Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It 's the first new subfamily described for a living ant since 1923 , the discoverers say …
" The fact that a single ant ' rediscovered ' in the rainforests of Brazil can tell us so much about the evolution of the ants highlights how little we know about the diversity of life on the planet , " says ( Corrie Moreau , ant specialist at Chicago 's Field Museum . )
" .... News of the classified ( FBI ) bulletin ( about FBI crack - downs on dissent ) also comes on the heels of an ACLU lawsuit against the Secret Service for the continuing practice of allowing pro-Bush protesters to remain visible to cameras during presidential appearances , and corralling anti-Bush protesters into pens or designated areas far from the media . "
See the link above for much more detailed facts .
Given that background information from five years ago , in which the police actually crack down on citizen photography of police abuse as " illegal " and " intimidation tactics " , it should be clear why Amy Goodman and her Democracy Now !
photographers were arrested at the Republican National Convention , for the " crime " of giving news coverage to the peaceful protests at the scene :
http://www.prisonplanet.com/update-democracy-now%e2%80%99s-amy-goodman-sharif-abdel-kouddous-and-nicole-salazar-released-after-illegal-arrest-at-rnc.html
And while the author intends no partisan statement , it also is fact that such unlawful arrests targeting free speech are more likely to occur at the Republican National Convention , such as where Amy Goodman 's arrest occurred , than at Democratic ones .
The reason for this has nothing to do with defending Democrats in Congress who , after all and alongside Republicans , voted twice for the police - empowering Patriot Act .
It does , however , have everything to do with the fact that it is typically those " who are against us " ( the Bush Administration 's policies ) who are targeted as " terrorists " than those who are " for us " ( the Bush Administration ) :
Among the ACLU 's " terrorist " clients are Amnesty International , Food not Bombs , United for Peace and Justice , the anti-war American Service Committee ( a peaceful Quaker anti-war group ) , Greenpeace , Arab and Muslim groups as subjects of racial profiling , and more .
Of course , the ACLU itself has also uncovered more than one thousand pages of FBI spying on the ACLU .
The great concern here is that Americans at large , not only Amy Goodman and her photographers , are bound to become discouraged and not know what to do to stop such violations .
Here are a few ways we can make a beginning to change things back to America , the Land of the Free as we once knew it and to take OUR country back ---- for which , after all , we PAY with our tax dollars and are fully entitled to !

Why would Modern Man believe in angels ?
He does , of course , but only in a “ poetical ” way .
He will not let his reason ( and he does have some ) close to this topic , and will go to the wall before he will confront it .
This , paradoxically , might be seen as a favour to the saintly angels , who have this much in common with the fallen ones , that they do n’t like to make a scene in public .
They are content to be “ influencers , ” as it were .
This Modern Man can believe in devils , in a less poetical way , but needs to be in a spitting rage first .
In fits of harmlessness , he will believe in God .
This is because anyone ’s reason , once indulged , will tell him that the “ existence of God ” is irrefutable .
But we draw the line at angels .
From the moment they appear , we fear that we are being corruptly lured into “ organized religion . ”
We might have to do inconvenient things , such as kneel .
And this is a paradox , for we are comfortable with everything else being organized .
The bureaucracies we form are entirely angel - free .
Consider Michael , Raphael , Gabriel ; and Uriel although he is n’t named in the Bible .
Their presence is n’t vague .
The prophets of the New Testament have no trouble with them , but neither did the prophets of the Old.
Jews and Muslims greet them freely , and Christians too , of course ; but Modern Man has issues .
Yes , he will take them , but only as “ figures of speech . ”
As Wallace Stevens said , “ Philosophy is the official view of being .
Poetry is the unofficial view . ”
My father , who was my model for the “ good pagan ” ( a phrase I lift from Rosalind Murray , 1939 ) , did not object to angels in the least .
But he did not accept them in the way Thomas Aquinas did — as beings who will have to be carefully thought through .
Papa did accept them as beings , however , until , I think , on his deathbed , he accepted them whole .
For he was clutching a Benedict Cross , and that helps .
Today , we celebrate the Feast of Saint Michael , “ and all angels . ” Gabriel and Raphael used to have their own prominent Feasts , but the Church for Modern Man never tries to push it .
We get them all over with in the one Mass .
Convention , at least English - speaking convention , still almost accepts today ’s Michaelmas as the beginning of term .
I think it still is , in places like Oxford .
For all we know , we ’ll need some angels going forward .
( “ Wokeness ” is n’t working out for us . )
At least , I ’ll say that , but I am a notorious reactionary .
The Sword of Saint Michael is figurative , at some level , and at another level it is not .
It is not something to praise , so much as something that Michael wields , with us figuratively cheering him on , or maybe sometimes cooperating .
It is wielded against the evil spirits who prowl about the world , seeking the ruin of souls .
Amen .

A few days ago I wrote a post that referenced a story in POLICE : The Law Enforcement Magazine .
POLICE is a glossy journal of blue thug culture , which includes charming pieces like America Needs a Surge Against Gangs , How to Justify Officer Safety Searches , Working Informants .
Here is a collage of cover photos from the past two years of POLICE .
This is a selective collage–but the selection includes the majority of the covers POLICE has printed over the past two years .
That ’s the way that a magazine staffed and written almost entirely by current or former police , and written for an audience of professional police , on the subject of policing , has chosen to brand itself and its contents for its prospective audience .
What do you think that says about the way government cops see themselves these days ?
What sort of model do you suppose images like these suggest for police to use to understand the ethics and the attitude that they need to adopt in their professional lives ?
What do you think that a publication like this encourages them to think of when they think of what their job is all about , and what kind of posture they should adopt when they deal with non-police — with people like you and me and our neighbors — on the street or in our homes ?
Do you feel safer now ?

SO MUCH for decoupling .
In the wake of Lehman Brothers ' failure , emerging markets have suffered one of their biggest sell - offs in years .
On September 18th Russia 's main bourses suspended trading in shares and bonds for a third day in a row after the largest one - day stockmarket fall for a decade ; the central bank poured billions into big banks and the money market in a forlorn bid to calm fears .
JPMorgan 's emerging - markets bond index fell by more than 5 % in the week to September 16th , giving up in a few days all the gains it had made this year .
Prices of Argentina 's credit - default swaps , a gauge of credit risk , rose to their highest - ever level .
Unexpectedly , the People 's Bank of China cut its benchmark lending rate by 27 basis points on September 15th , to 7.2 % , the first cut for six years .
These actions reflected a variety of concerns , such as a darkening economic mood in China and political worries in Russia .
But they all have something in common : investors may be changing their minds about emerging markets .
For the past few years , China , Brazil and others , with their high growth rates and large current - account surpluses , began to seem like desirable alternatives to developed markets .
For part of last year , the MSCI emerging - markets index was even trading at a higher multiple of earnings than the index of rich - world shares .
That is changing as investors lose their appetite for risk .
Merrill Lynch 's most recent survey of fund managers found that they are now holding more bonds than normal for the first time in a decade ( indicating a flight to safety ) .
They also have smaller positions in emerging - market equities than at any time since 2001 .
In the past three months , says Michael Hartnett of Merrill Lynch , emerging - market funds have seen an outflow of $ 26 billion , compared with an inflow of $ 100 billion in the previous five years .

The rouble in the rubble
Falling oil and commodity prices are partly to blame .
When these were rising , money poured into Brazil and Russia , which became targets of the “ carry trade ” ( investors borrow in low - yielding currencies and buy high - yielding ones ) .
Now oil prices are falling ( dipping almost to $ 90 a barrel this week ) , they are undermining the carry trade and forcing Russia to prop up the rouble .
Indebted investors are also being forced by their banks to sell as falling prices reduce the value of their collateral .
Lower oil and commodity prices ought to benefit China and India , by lowering import bills and assuaging worries about inflation .
Yet India 's foreign - exchange reserves fell by $ 6.5 billion in the first week of September as the central bank sold dollars to slow the fall of the rupee .
In China , worries are growing about weakening export demand ( growth in export volumes has fallen by almost half over the past year to 11 % ) and falling property prices , which seem to play a role similar to equity prices elsewhere .
In the past three months , property sales in big cities were 40 - 50 % lower than a year ago , according to figures tracked by Paul Cavey of Macquarie Securities .
An agent for one of Hong Kong 's largest property companies says “ confidence ended this week with the fall of Lehman . ”
All these countries have the comfort of huge foreign - exchange reserves .
On September 16th the new governor of India 's central bank said he would continue to cushion the rupee 's fall ; he also raised the interest rate Indian expatriates can earn on deposits at home and let banks borrow a bit more from the central bank .
China 's interest - rate cut shows that its government , too , has room for manoeuvre .
But the cut will have little direct impact on the economy because lending is limited by quotas .
It was intended to boost confidence at a time of falling share and house prices .
Too bad that among emerging - market investors , confidence is in short supply .

The Minnesota Senate race is likely the most contentious battle this election cycle , and will likely end up being the most heavily financed when all is said in done .
The race features Incumbent Republican Norm Coleman , Democratic challenger Al Franken and Independent Party of Minnesota candidate Fmr. Sen. Dean Barkley .
Coleman and Franken remain the front runners , but Barkley has consistently polled in the high teens ; while down , Barkley is not out .
A new round of Minnesota polling was concluded on October 18th from two local media pollsters based in Minneapolis ; the Star Tribune Newspaper , and KSTP - TV ( the ABC affiliate ) .
Each pollster performed Presidential and Senate polls sixteen days prior to their most recent release .
I 've included the results of their new polls , their old polls , and our projections for both time frames below :

The bolded row at the bottom of each pollster 's result represents the correlation between that pollster 's Presidential and Senate race findings .
If you look at all six results , the bolded numbers for each column reasonably agree with the other five .
This result shows that within the meta sample of all four polls and our projections the correlation remains consistent .
Using this consistency and our projections on October 18th , I have derived a set of simple formulas that correlate Senate and Presidential performance :
An Obama victory in Minnesota with just 50.97 % of the vote correlates to a razor thin victory by Al Franken using the above formulas ( see note at bottom ) .
Given that the Minnesota Senate race is a three way ordeal and the fact that our projection neglects to allocate independents or uncommitted voters I 'll dive deeper into the meta sample .
If we assume that Barkley receives eighteen percent of the vote , as he has in the last four polls , the independents cannot save Norm .
As it stands , under this assumption , Barkley is receiving roughly 63 % ( 11.37 / 18 ) of his backing from Obama supporters , just 20 % ( 3.56 / 18 ) from McCain supporters and 17 % from Independents .
Again under the eighteen percent assumption , just 3.24 % of population is left undecided .
If we just arbitrarily allocate this demographic to Norm Coleman , Obama must increase his popular vote percentage by 4.19 % ( 3.24 / .7725 ) to 55.17 % in order to guarantee a correlated victory for Franken .
Although the current polling does n't show this kind of lead for Obama ; if I were Norm Coleman I would be looking to fundamentally alter the " coattail coefficients " to better situate myself for reelection .
Looking at the MN Senate graph below it appears that the scorched earth strategy does n't seem like an option .
Coleman needs a game changer , but with just 14 days to go his options seem limited .
Although Norm has the lead in the interim , his support is deteriorating at a much greater rate than his opposition .
Note :
The threshold of victory for a Senate race is found by averaging the projection of the two leading candidates and dividing by two .
In the case of Minnesota , a popular vote greater than 39.98 % should result in a Senate election victory .
We now find out that the Republican party cut ads , and sent them to TV stations around the country , opposing the bailout bill even BEFORE Pelosi spoke before the vote yesterday .
The Republican National Committee , the official “ party , ” was planning on the bill passing , and then was going to attack Democrats who voted FOR the bill .
Talk about calloused .
So in fact , the Republican party was playing games , playing politics , with our economy .
Did the RNC tell individual members of Congress that they were going to be running ads attacking anyone who voted for the bill ?
Is this why Republican members voted against the bill 2 to 1 ( while Dems voted for the bill almost 2 to 1 ) , sending Wall Street into a nose dive ?
And what about John McCain ?
What does it say about him when his own party is secretly undercutting the proposal that he claimed to “ save the day ” on ?
A Nederland man who gained international fame in 2003 after claiming he was glued to a toilet seat at Home Depot was found dead in his home this week .
According to Nederland police , officers found Robert “ Bob ” Dougherty , 60 , on Tuesday afternoon after a friend became concerned the man had n’t called in several days .
Dougherty had been in declining health for years and the death is not considered suspicious , police said .
Boulder County Coroner Tom Faure said Dougherty ’s autopsy was not complete Thursday .
Dougherty became the subject of water cooler talk and late - night television jokes around the world after filing a lawsuit against the Louisville Home Depot , alleging that he entered a bathroom stall and could n’t stand up because someone had put glue on the seat .
When Dougherty called out to employees for help , they thought his pleas were a hoax , according to the lawsuit .
Eventually , fire and ambulance crews had to unbolt the toilet seat while it was still attached to Dougherty ’s rear end .
A judge later dismissed the lawsuit , citing a lack of evidence that Home Depot was at fault for the glue .
Dougherty ’s sister , Westminster resident Laurie Radcliffe , said her brother was always disappointed his case was n’t taken more seriously — but he also appreciated the attention it brought .
“ When you entered him into Yahoo ! , for like one week , he was more famous than George Bush , ” said Radcliffe , 50 .
“ I could n’t believe how that story got everywhere , across the whole world . ”
Her brother would end up on comedy CDs , in newspapers and on television and radio , Radcliffe said , but she hopes people who knew Dougherty will remember him instead for his love of magic , electronics , fishing and the outdoors .
“ He loved magic and he just loved making people happy , ” Radcliffe said .
“ He was a true mountain man . ”
Born in Munich , Germany , Dougherty was the oldest of three siblings and the son of an Irish mother and an American father stationed with the military oversees .
Dougherty worked with microwave communications for the Navy , his sister said , and later as a safety inspector for the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder .
Dougherty lived in Nederland for more than 30 years , his sister said , but he never married or had children .
His ashes will be buried at Ft. Logan National Cemetery in Denver , next to those of his father , Radcliffe said .
Arrangements for a memorial service are pending .
While serving in the U.S. Navy from 1967 to 1971 , Dougherty once received a commendation for jumping into the waters off the Marshall Islands with a knife to save a man being attacked by a shark , according to military records provided by Mark Cohen , Dougherty ’s attorney and friend .
“ I just thought he was a good guy , ” Cohen said .
“ He was an outgoing man , he was very friendly and he always had a smile on his face . ”
Cohen said he last saw his friend two weeks ago during a stop at Dougherty ’s house .
“ He started crying and said , ‘ Mark , you ’ve been a really good friend , ' ” Cohen said .
Dougherty had long maintained that the stress of the Home Depot incident caused him lasting health problems .
“ He felt that the stress from that had contributed to his diabetes , ” Cohen said .
“ He was pretty bitter about that toward the end . ”
Cohen said his friend “ knew he was dying , and never wavered in his belief that Home Depot was the cause of it . ”

In Monday ’s New York Times editorial section , Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute and Peter Passel of the Milken Institute wrote that drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) and on the outer continental shelf ( OCS ) would make so much money for the U.S. treasury that it would enable huge swaths of other territory to be set aside as wilderness .
In essence , let ’s sacrifice ANWR and the OCS in order to save other sensitive areas around the country .
And in support of this argument , Hahn and Passel used some basic economic calculations : at $ 100 per barrel , the total 18.5 billion barrels estimated to be in ANWR and in the OCS are worth $ 2.1 trillion ( including some peripheral benefits in addition to the actual per-barrel price ) , and with $ 400 billion set aside for environmental recovery , that ’s still $ 1.7 trillion that Congress could allocate for other environmental projects , such as the aformentioned wilderness areas .
There ’s only one problem – the $ 400 billion they allocated only includes “ the expected costs of developing all that oil , including cleaning up environmental damage … . ”
There does n’t appear to be any costs estimated for the carbon dioxide that will be put into the air in the process of combusting all that oil and the resultant damage to the global climate .
Let ’s do those calculations .
The Energy Information Administration keeps data on all the petroleum inputs and products produced on a monthly basis .
According to this data , 564,629,000 barrels of refinery and blender products were produced in June , 2008 ( the latest year the EIA has available ) .
The EIA also has a list of definitions that you can use to determine what of those various products are used as fuels of one kind or another , and an estimate of how much carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) each of those fuels produces per barrel combusted .
Using that data , I was able to put together the table below ( click on it for a full - size and more readable image ) :
The graph also has , based on the EIA data , how much carbon we can reasonably estimate as being put into the atmosphere if all the oil in ANWR and the OCS is combusted .
It ’s just over 8 billion tons of CO 2 .
For comparision , the EIA estimates that the entire world put only 28.2 billion tons of CO 2 into the air in it ’s most recent year , 2005 .
Now , if we apply cost estimates , in dollars per ton of CO 2 , to the total number of tons of CO 2 acquired from the first table , we get the following table of costs :
By all means , check my numbers .
Chicago Climate Exchange
Carbon Tax Center 10/10 hybrid plan
Social Cost of Carbon ( SCC ) estimate
UK DEFRA estimate
Lower Stern estimate
Upper Stern estimates ( price for 2 % is from DEFRA above , modified for 5 % and 20 % as “ cost of doing nothing ” )
Now , it ’s a fair question why the price per ton of CO 2 varies so greatly .
It ’s a function of different policies , different assumptions in different economic models , and , in the case of the Chicago Climate Exchange , a market failure as a result of an oversupply of trading credits .
I personally feel that the arguments put forth by Stern , as supported by Jim Hansen and others , are more likely estimates of the damage as a result of the “ cost of doing nothing ” than the lower estimates produced by the Carbon Tax Center , the lower end of the SCC , or skeptics like Bjorn Lomborg .
For that reason , I expect that the likely cost of the carbon in ANWR and the OCS will be somewhere between the $ 681 billion and $ 6.81 trillion .
In either case , however , it ’s clear that the overall costs of extracting the oil from ANWR and the OCS is much more than the $ 400 billion estimated by Hahn and Passel .
Instead , the total costs will be between $ 950 billion and $ 5.85 trillion .
In the first case , the U.S. might make a total of about $ 1.2 trillion ( $ 2.1 income minus $ 950 billion costs ) , and then we have to ask ourselves agian whether that amount of money is enough to justify drilling if a lot of it is used for wilderness protection elsewhere in the U.S. – maybe it is , but maybe it is n’t .
But if the CO 2 costs are as high as $ 1.4 trillion ( the 5 % GDP level from the Stern review , not the 20 % worst case ) , then the straight economic costs of drilling in ANWR and the OCS very nearly outweighs the income generated by the oil sales ( there would be only $ 300 billion in profits ) .
And that ’s not even trying to put a price on so - called “ the loss of the intangible benefits Americans get from knowing that the Alaskan refuge and outer continental shelf have been left untouched . ”
It was a throwaway line meant to be a crowd - pleaser .
But it fell flat .
On Thursday at a rally in Erie , Pa. , Sarah Palin touted the victors in the World Series to thousands of supporters .
“ I am thrilled to be here in the home state of the world - champion Philadelphia Phillies , ” Palin said .
The crowd booed .
Philadelphia is a seven - hour drive from Erie , which is in the state ’s far west .
Erie ’s baseball devotions are split between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cleveland Indians .
( Pittsburgh and Cleveland are about two hours away . )

Palin has been booed by Pennsylvania sports fans before .
Earlier this month , the Republican vice presidential candidate was loudly heckled at a Philadelphia Flyers game .
In the first clip we see Palin address the AIP convention earlier this year :
This next clip is the 1st of 2 parts from the convention itself .
About half way through the speech ( at 6:00 ) , the Vice Chairman of the AIP , Dexter Clark , says this of Palin : " Our current governor who I mentioned at the last conference , the one we were hoping would get elected , Sarah Palin , did get elected . . . . and there was a lot of talk about her moving up .
She was an AIP member before she got the job as mayor . . . "
This last clip is a continuation of the speech from Dexter Clark , the Vice Chairman from the AIP .
In it , he talks about the necessity of infiltrating the major national parties in order to further the goals of the AIP .
The AIP ’s main aim is to secede from the United States , becoming either a territory or a sovereign nation .
They aim to be entirely " self - sufficient " using profits from the oil and gas resources of the state .
On
their website , you ’ll see this :
The Alaskan Independence Party can be summed up in just two words :
ALASKA FIRST !
And their 2008 platform :
To seek the complete repatriation of the public lands , held by the federal government , to the state and people of Alaska in conformance with Article 1 , Section 8 , Clause 17 , of the federal constitution .
Governor Palin ’s connections with the AIP are also furthered by her connection to Wally Hickel , a former Alaskan governor .
Hickel was elected on the AIP ticket .
He served as the co-chairman of Governor Palin ’s campaign in 2006
Here is a quote from an interview Hickel did with the Alaska Dispatch :
When Palin was running for governor in 2006 , Hickel appeared in advertisements supporting her and the Alaska pipeline .
" I made her governor , " Hickel told me .
When asked earlier this year on CNBC about whether she ’d be picked for McCain ’s VP , Palin said , " We wanna make sure that that VP slot would be a fruitful type of position , especially for Alaskans , and for the things we ’re trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the US , before I can even start addressing that question . "
So , besides the fact that she does n’t know what the VP does everyday , Palin wants to be VP only if it ’s a good thing for Alaska ?
Sarah Palin has a lot of questions to answer about whether she supports Alaska ’s right to secede , whether she ’s figured out what her job as VP will be , and whether she ’s in it to send money or profits to her state .

Sarah Palin 's transcript
I ’m Governor Sarah Palin and I am delighted to welcome you to the 2008 Alaskan Independence Party Convention in the golden heart city of Fairbanks .
Your party plays an important role in our state ’s politics .
I ’ve always said that competition is so good , and that applies to political parties as well .
I share your party ’s vision of upholding the constitution of our great state .
My administration remains focused on reining in government growth so individual liberty and opportunity can expand .
I know you agree with that .
We have a great promise to be a self - sufficient state , made up of the hardest - working , most grateful Americans in our nation .
So as your convention gets underway I hope that you all are inspired by remembering that all those years ago , it was in this same city that Alaska ’s constitution was born .
And it was founded on hope and trust and liberty and opportunity .
I carry that message of opportunity forward in my administration , as we continue to move our state ahead and create positive change .
So I say good luck on a successful and inspiring convention .
Keep up the good work , and God bless you .
2nd clip - Dexter Clark ( 38 + / 0 -)
..... My name is Dexter Clark , I am the vice chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party , in ??? , which is slightly bigger than Texas all by itself .
We like to joke that if you guys do n’t behave yourselves there ’ll be two states in Alaska , and you ’ll be the third largest state .
If you were to interpose the map of Alaska on the US it would overlap both northern and southern borders and almost reach to both coasts .
( Intro of his wife and where they ’re from ) .
The Alaskan Independence Party was established by Joe and Dora Colbert (? ) and officially recognized as a political party by the state of Alaska rule 25 years ago .
Within 10 years of that recognition , the party nominated a governor and a lieutenant governor and they were elected .
Before their term was over , Mrs. Goldberg ?
passed away and Mr. ?? was assassinated .
After the tragedy of losing our leader , almost all political observers in Alaska said that ’s the end of the AIP , we do n’t have to worry about them any more .
But the basic argument of the Alaskan Independence Party has always been , the number one plank in our platform , is the question of our vote to become a state .
The most glaring disparity in that vote was the definition of an eligible voter .
Among those qualified to cast a ballot were 41,000 American soldiers and their 36,000 dependents .
Now to the native population of Alaska , to me , these were occupation troops , and they were made eligible , in fact encouraged to vote , there were educational meetings held on the military bases .
I ca n’t imagine them telling anyone that anything but that statehood would be very good for the military , in fact they still have 6 - 7 big bases and numerous smaller holdings in this state .
Statehood would be good for the military .
Now can you imagine the international uproar if the American troops had all went and got their purple fingers in Iraq ?
There would have been ... that ’s not an election , that ’s imposing your rule .
Another thing that research revealed had to do with the United Nations .
President Truman signed the UN Charter making it the law of the land whether you like it or not .
And among their provisions , they had a provision or a committee that deals with what they call a non-self - governing territory , which Guam and Puerto Rico to this day are still reported by the United States , Virgin Islands is another one , American Samoa , they report every year to this committee that these are our territories that are not governing themselves , and the committee that came up with the rules of how you would change that relationship imposed certain restrictions , and among those was that when a poll was held there should be more than one choice on the ballot .
Specifically , they state three of the four following choices should be on that ballot , and that is to remain a territory - just keep your relationship the same , become a commonwealth which has all of its own advantages and disadvantages , to become a state , or to become an independent nation .
When the ballot appeared before Alaskans it had statehood yes or no , and under the voters rights
Act at that time , you had to be able to read and write English to vote , which pretty much took care of any of the native population having any vote in the election whatsoever .
Now a letter that Joe ( ? ) received , showed me , Mr. Vogler ( ? ) had finally gotten a sponsor before this committee , this committee in charge of non-self - governing territories , to take a look at these discrepancies .
Of course that door was closed with his death , that was a personal letter to him , and we ’ve seen a copy of it , and it was dated within the week of his death .
The AIP now has 13,689 registered voters as members , that ’s not our count , that ’s the State of Alaska , they count them for us , we do n’t have to keep track of them .
That ’s a little more than 300 up from last year ’s conference .
Our current governor , we mentioned at the last conference , the one we were hoping would get elected , Sarah Palin , did get elected .
There ’s a joke , she ’s a pretty good looking gal , there ’s a joke goes around we ’re the coldest state with the hottest governor .
And there was a lot of talk about her moving up .
She was an AIP member before she got the job as a mayor of a small town – that was a non-partisan job .
But you get along to go along – she eventually joined the Republican Party , where she had all kinds of problems with their ethics , and well , I wo n’t go into that .
She also had about an 80 % approval rating , and is pretty well sympathetic to her former membership .
Both of our senators to the American Congress are under investigation and there are pretty good stories going around .
One is under sealed indictment and this is the result of the oil lobby ( ? ) , there is bribery and fraud charges and oil money is buying what they want in Alaska .
The royalty share in Alaska of oil , I do n’t know if you have the numbers in front of you what your own state gets like Texas ... , in Alaska the royalty share is 12.5 % !
I mean ??
sharecropper did better than that .
The people of Alaska from what I ’ve heard in this room and several other areas are fed up .
And if ever there was a time that is ripe for change , this is it .
On our own situation , we ’ve discussed several options .
Do we try to get our case into the International Court of Justice ?
Or to the World Court ?
Several of the native Alaskan organizations are taking that route independent of us .
They want to do it on their terms .
They have n’t realized in my mind what the potential of their own political party which there are pitfalls of an organized political party .
You do n’t have any control over who joins that party .
They put the X next to it on the registration form , and if they go to the primary and win that primary , they ’re your candidate , like it or not .
I think Ron Paul has kinda proven that – he ’s a dyed - in - the wool libertarian , he came to Alaska and spoke as a libertarian , and put the Republican label on it to get elected , that ’s all there is to it .
And any one of your organizations should be using that same tactic .
You should infiltrate – I know the Christian Exodus ( ? ) is in favor of it , the Free State movement is in favor of it – I do n’t think they even care which party it is .
Whichever party in that area you can get something done , get into that political party , even though it does have its problems .
Right now that is one of the only avenues .
And you get a few people on a city council or a ???
you can have some effect .
I kind of digressed there a little bit .

3 Out -Of - This - World Home Theaters
Star Wars ‘ Death Star ’
The Matrix
Star Trek ‘ Next Generation ’
Do THX subwoofers and 15 - inch floor standing speakers make your heart race ?
Does the thought of watching T’Pol or 7 of 9 on a 50 - inch wide screen HDTV give you shivers ?
Is there anything better than watching the death star blow up while being nestled between a surround sound system powered by 8 amplifiers ?
What if it were in your very own home theater ?
Well , anyone can dream but these people are living proof that money can buy hi-tech , super sci - fi home theater happiness .
Try not to drool too much .
Arguably the best Sci-Fi film series , Star Wars , inspired this awesome home theater that looks like the control deck of the Death Star .
Any Star Wars fan will tell you it looks pretty accurate and that ’s probably because it was designed by Doug Chiang , the lead designer of Episodes I and II .
Also helping to add some authentic touches were the owners , Vic Wertz and Lisa Stevens , who used to run the Official Star Wars Fan Club .
And it was n’t hard for them to get their hands on some Star Wars memorabilia , considering they have a 3,000 square foot museum filled with items like the Millennium Falcon model used in ‘ The Empire Strikes Back ’ and the lightsaber used by Ewan McGregor in Episode I . Yeah , we ’re jealous too .
Follow the force for more juicy details Morpheus said you must see it to believe it , and in this 33 x 19 x 11 feet home theater , seeing it will be no problem .
Genesis president , Bill Anderson ( Mr. Anderson … coincidence ? ) and interior designer Lezlie Trujillo created this futuristic Matrix home theater and it ’s packed full of acoustical products to achieve optimum performance .
This theater was also the winning entry for Cedia ’s Electronic Lifestyles Award for Best Home Theater Level V : over $ 900,000.00 .
That ’s right , this baby cost nearly 1 million dollars to make , but you and I know it ’s totally worth it .
If you can handle it , take the red pill to see more 4 years of planning and six months of work resulted in this impressive Star Trek home theater complete with ready room and private bar .
Yeah , you heard right - private bar .
The main attraction , the theater , was modeled after the NCC - 1701D Enterprise from the ‘ Next Generations ’ series and is chalk full of realistic sound effects , motion - activated air - lock doors and can even simulate a Romulan attack .
It was also named the Top Theme Theater in 2007 ( we ’re not surprised ) .
If that is n’t enough to get your pointy ears tingling then beam on over for more unbelievable photos or check out the video !

Transdimensional Particles
A tantalizing idea considered since the early part of the last century is that the universe might have more than the three spatial dimensions of common experience .
In addition to the familiar left / right , back / forth and up / down , physicists have contemplated additional directions that are curled up to such a small size that they ’ve so far eluded discovery .
For many years Einstein was a strong proponent of this idea .
He had already shown that gravity was nothing but warps and curves in the familiar dimensions of space ( and time ) ; the new idea posited that nature ’s other forces ( for example , the electromagnetic force ) amounted to warps and curves in additional , as yet unknown , spatial dimensions .
Difficulties in applying the idea mathematically resulted in Einstein ultimately losing interest .
But decades later , string theory revived it : the mathematics of string theory not only requires extra dimensions but has shown how to resolve the issues that flummoxed Einstein .
And now , remarkably , there ’s a chance  albeit a small one  that the collider may find evidence for the extra dimensions .
Calculations show that some of the debris produced by the proton collisions may be ejected out of our familiar spatial dimensions and crammed into the others , a process we ’d detect by an apparent loss of the energy the debris would carry .
The unknown is just how powerful the collisions need to be for this process to happen , a number itself determined by another unknown : just how small the extra dimensions , if they exist , actually are .
The more tightly they ’re curled , the harder it would be to cram anything in them and so the more energetic the required collisions .
Should the Large Hadron Collider have the power necessary to reveal extra dimensions of space  to overturn our belief that length , width and height are all there is  that would rank as one of the greatest upheavals in our understanding of the universe .
Micro Black Holes
Now for the possibility that ’s generated the fuss .
Recent work in string theory has suggested that the collider might produce black holes , providing physicists with a spectacular opportunity to study them in a laboratory .
i Tunes 9 feels snappier , the Column Browser is a much - needed improvement and the Home Sharing feature works very well .
We 're not convinced by iTunes LP or Extras - although we 're sure the former would look just great on a Tablet - and it's still a bit slow , but the improved device management makes this a worthwhile upgrade .
Apple iTunes 9 deals View Similar Amazon US Amazon
No price information
We have mixed feelings about iTunes : it can be slow - especially if you 're using external drives , which it forgets about far too often for our liking - and it 's desperately due a redesign .
Hurrah , then , for iTunes 9 : it 's got a new look , it 's got some new features , and in the form of iTunes LP - 21st Century sleeve notes - and iTunes Extras - DVD extras without the DVD - it 's got new things to flog you .
So is it any good ?
i Tunes 9 certainly looks better .
The glassy status area looks more glassy , the grey metal looks shinier and the playback buttons look more buttony .
There 's also a new Column Browser , which makes scrolling through large libraries much , much faster , and a new Genius Mixes feature that attempts to create music mixes you 'll like .
It looks good and works well , although turning it on is n't obvious : you need to go into the Store menu and then click on Update Genius .
COLUMN BROWSER : iTunes has never been particularly great at navigating large libraries , so the new Column Browser is a very welcome time saver
It 's also got a strange interface : while it creates a playlist based on grouping particular kinds of music together , so for example it'll lump Elbow , Doves and Supergrass into one mix and stick Lady Gaga , Pet Shop Boys , Girls Aloud and Robyn into another , it does n't let you see what 's in the playlist .
If you want the playlists on your iPod or iPhone you 'll need to switch them on , too : you 'll find them in the Music tab under Playlists .
There 's another not -very - well - advertised new feature : HE encoding .
If you go to iTunes > Preferences >
Import Settings and select AAC as your import format of choice , you 'll see a checkbox for " Use High Efficiency Encoding ( HE ) " .
HE - AAC is for very low bitrate audio , which means it wo n't be useful to the average iTunes user .
The Windows version has had a bit of interface polish too , but we still think it looks a bit strange .
If you 're running Windows 7 you can skip and stop tracks from the taskbar thumbnail preview , and there 's a basic Jump List that enables you to launch the iTunes Store or iTunes itself .
GENIUS ?
Perhaps not , but the new Mixes - which attempt to group similar kinds of music together - are very clever .
Pity you can't see what 's in the Mixes playlists
The town , 25 miles from Alicante in south - eastern Spain , has a population of 11,000 , some 80 percent of which are foreigners .
The vast majority of those are British who live in a part of town dubbed the " English ghetto " by locals who complain that little effort is made by many of the expatriates to adopt the local culture and learn Spanish .
Babies as young as 5 months can distinguish an upbeat tune , such as " Ode to Joy " from Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony , from a lineup of gloomy tunes .
Researchers displayed an emotionally - neutral face for the baby while sad music played .
When the baby looked away from the face , the music stopped and a new sad song would start .
When the happier " Ode to Joy " played , the babies stared at the face three to four seconds longer , suggesting they were interested in the shift .
By 9 months old , babies can do the opposite , picking out the sorrowful sound of Beethoven 's Seventh Symphony from a pack of happy pieces .
The finding is another example of how babies make sense of the world long before they can talk , said Brigham Young University psychology professor and study author Ross Flom .
" One of the first things babies understand communicatively is emotion , so for them the melody is the message , " Flom said .
" Our study showed that by nine months , babies are categorizing songs as happy or sad the same way that preschoolers and adults do . "
The results of the musical study will be published in the upcoming issue of the journal Infant Behavior and Development .
So what makes a happy song ?
BYU music professor Susan Kenney , who was not involved with the study , noted some of the technical differences between the happy and sad songs the babies heard .
" The happy songs were all in major keys with fairly short phrases or motives that repeated , " Kenney said .
" The tempo and melodic rhythms were faster than any of the sad selections , and the melodies had a general upward direction .
Four of the sad songs were in minor keys and all had a slower beat and long melodic rhythms .
For an infant to notice those differences is fascinating . "

You know the old cliche , a picture is worth a thousand words ?
Turns out that pictures have been deeply undervalued : A single photo can cost you your reputation , your job , even your freedom - - if you post it online .
Teachers , principals , firefighters , mayors , university presidents , and everyday people have all discovered the dark side of putting the wrong photos and videos on social networking sites .
Sometimes they paid the price in embarrassment .
An unlucky handful lost their jobs or landed in jail .
The results are n't pretty , but they are sometimes hilarious .
Here 's our dirty dozen -- 12 pictures their owners probably wish they could take back .
1. Hey Kevin , Tinker Bell Wants Her Outfit Back
It 's bad enough to dress up like you 're about to slip a dollar under some toothless child 's pillow .
But former intern Kevin Colvin made it much worse by asking his boss at Anglo Irish Bank if he could take time off for a " family emergency in New York , " then flitting off to a Halloween party dressed like a refugee from Peter Pan .
Putting the faerie pix on his Facebook profile was the finishing touch .
After his boss found the pictures , he responded by attaching the photo in question and blind - copied the entire office .
Colvin lost his internship and what was left of his reputation when the e-mail messages went flying across the Internet ; at least he got to keep the wand .
2. Quick , Call 911-- My Pants Are on Fire
Now that an ex-beauty queen is running for the VP slot , life may be easier for hot mommas who also happen to be office holders .
It will be too late to help Carmen Kontur - Gronquist , though .
The former mayor of Arlington , Oregon , got in hot water with her constituents after a family member posted photos to her MySpace profile showing off her , umm , political assets in the town firehouse ( where she worked as an executive secretary ) .
Amazingly , the town of 500 voted to recall her from office shortly after the photos went public .
Maybe they were afraid people would start setting fires , just to see what she was wearing when she showed up .
3. Muscle Bound or Muscle Brained ?
What is it about firehouses that makes people want to take off their clothes ?
In this case , Boston fireman Alberto Arroyo got in trouble for stripping down to take part in a body - building competition last May .
( He finished eighth in the 2008 Pro Natural American Championships , by the way . )
There 's nothing wrong with fire fighters showing off their muscles , but Arroyo made the mistake of competing two weeks after he'd filed for permanent disability status due to back injuries .
Apparently his injuries enabled him to lift barbells but prevented him from inspecting buildings for code violations .
After his bosses saw video of Arroyo competing on YouTube , they decided to give him plenty of spare time to work on his pecs .
4. Vending Machine Leads Tennis Teen , 40 - Love
British tennis phenoms Naomi Broady and David Rice are no longer feeling the love from the UK's Lawn Tennis Association .
The LTA nixed its sponsorship of the teens in October 2007 after discovering photos of Broady and Rice on social networking site Bebo showing them drunk , getting intimate with condom dispensers in public restrooms , and otherwise displaying " a lack of discipline . "
According to the Yorkshire Evening Post , " Naomi's Bebo profile showed her out on the town , with her legs wrapped round a toilet vending machine . "
No doubt trying to coax it to return the correct change .
5. Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum
What do you do with a drunken pirate ?
Throw her in the brig -- or , if you 're Millersville University , deny her a teaching degree .
That 's what happened to Stacey Snyder , a then - 27 - year - old student teacher who posted a self portrait to her MySpace page under the caption " drunk pirate , " even though it was not clear from the photo exactly what liquid was in her plastic cup .
The Pennsylvania - based university decided the picture was " unprofessional " enough to rescind Snyder 's degree , just days before it was to be awarded in May 2006 .
Snyder sued the university in federal court , claiming it violated her First Amendment rights ( not to mention , of course , her Right to Paaaaar - tay ) .
As of publication date of this story , that suit is still active .
6. Moronic at Any Speed
Quick , what 's more stupid -- driving 140 mph or filming yourself while driving 140 mph ?
How about filming yourself driving 140 mph and then posting the evidence on YouTube ?
That was only the tip of the dunce - berg for 23 - year - old Andrew Kellett of Leeds , England .
He posted more than 80 videos of himself driving recklessly , stealing gasoline , using drugs , and engaging in sundry other illegal activities under the name " Mrchimp2007 . "
Last July , a city magistrate who'd had enough of this monkey business gave Kellett two years probation and ordered him to stop posting videos of his dirty deeds ( though some are still available online ) .
" Kellett must be in the running to be Britain 's Dumbest Criminal , " said Leeds City Councilor Les Carter .
" If more criminals were as obliging , the city would be even safer . "
Cat owner 's purr- fectly happy ending after being reunited with ' dead ' pet - NINE years after she disappeared from home
An overjoyed cat owner has been reunited with her missing moggy - nine years after she wandered off from her family home .
Gilly Delaney was left distraught after hearing her beloved pet Dixie had been killed by a car in 1999 .
So it came as a big surprise when RSPCA officers turned up on Mrs Delaney 's doorstep - with her missing pet in tow .
The officers , who scanned Dixie 's microchip , returned her to her rightful owner after they found her wandering less than half a mile away from Mrs Delaney 's home .
Miracle : Dixie looked somewhat the worse for wear when she returned home after being missing for nine years
The delighted owner said she never gave up hope of finding her beloved cat , even after hearing she had died .
She said : ' Words can not express how overjoyed we are to have Dixie back .
' When she went missing I put up posters , knocked on people ’s doors and contacted the local papers . '
Husband Alan revealed the couple were thinking of moving from their house in Erdington , Birmingham but his wife had been reluctant in case missing Dixie ever returned .
He said : ' A few years ago we were going to move house to Malta , but Gilly was n't keen .
' When Dixie came back she admitted she did n't want to move house because she always thought he might turn up because that 's her home and that 's where she knows . '
Re-united : Gilly Delaney was overjoyed when her cat returned from its travels
Home comforts :
Dixie slips straight back into life with her owner who never gave up hope of finding her
The RSPCA said returning missing cats to the owners was rarely successful as the majority are not microchipped and their owners could not be traced .
RSPCA Animal Collection Officer , Alan Pittaway , said : ' I was delighted that the cat was chipped as we pick up so many animals where we have no way of knowing who they belong to .
' In 29 years of working for the RSPCA I have never seen anyone so excited and happy as Mrs Delaney .
' I hope this story will encourage more people to have their pets microchipped as if your pet is chipped then you can never give up hope of being reunited with a missing pet . '
Mrs Delaney insists their time apart has not broken the bond between her and her pet and said her cat was still the same as she ever was .
She said : ' Dixie ’s personality , behaviour and little mannerisms have not changed at all .
She is still a happy , contented cat who just wants to sit next to you on the sofa and have a fuss .
' She has n't stopped purring since she came back through the door . '
Has your life become a little stale ?
Do you need some excitement in your neighborhood , but are n’t quite sure what to do ?
Do you want to discover a quick and easy way to gain recognition in your community ?
Well look no further , as I have the perfect solution : get yourself arrested !
Now , in order to get arrested properly it will require some planning and forethought .
While there certainly are many ways in which you can go about getting arrested , I strongly recommend an attempted burglary .
But you ca n’t go breaking in to homes all willy - nilly ; that ’s an easy way to get yourself injured or killed ; so please , before you start , make sure you do your homework .
First , do n’t bother casing a house ; just wait until they leave to go to the grocery store .
Make sure you walk down there in the early afternoon .
If you really want to increase your chances of making a big scene , attempt the robbery on a weekend or holiday , so it ’s more likely all the neighbors will be home .
Also , rob a house in your neighborhood , so everyone recognizes you , and many people might even know where you live .
Once you have decided which house to rob , just follow these simple steps to ensure you ’ll be in handcuffs by the end of the day :
Rob house .
This one is simple .
Wander down to a house where it looks like no one is home , and loudly try to kick the door in .
Remember , if you want to get arrested , silence is your enemy .
If you do it just right , you ’ll leave a clear shoe - print on the door , which is perfect for the police investigation .
For maximum payoff , attempt to kick in the front door so that you ’re clearly visible to passers - by and neighbors .
Steal something large and cumbersome .
While other robbers are stealing valuable items that can easily fit in their pockets , you ’ll make more of a commotion if you steal something really big and awkward , like a barbecue grill or a lawnmower .
And do n’t bother with a getaway car , just push the thing down sidewalk to your house .
The more unusual the stolen item is , the more likely someone will notice and remember you .
And when you get home , just leave the stolen item in your yard and wait for the guy to return to his house and call the police .
Return to the scene of the crime .
This is extremely important .
While the police officer is talking to the homeowner , walk back to the house and interrupt the investigation by loudly asking the officer what is going on .
When he tells you there was a robbery , get all indignant and upset .
Whatever you do , do n’t act casual or normal in any way .
Lay it on thick .
Cry if you have to .
This will ensure the officer gets really suspicious .
And if the officer starts questioning you , stammer around a lot and make up some half - assed story that does n’t make sense .
Get Arrested .
This is your time to put on a show .
Now that you ’ve made a big scene and acted suspiciously , the police will figure it out in short order and come to your house .
When they arrive , act like a complete jackass and try to escape by sneaking out the back door .
Of course , they will undoubtedly see you trying to escape and chase you down and tackle you in the street .
While the officer is reading you your Miranda rights , just think about the great show your neighbors are getting .
You ’ve just become a neighborhood celebrity !
If you do n’t get caught , repeat steps 1 through 4 until you do .
And for the best story , never throw away or sell anything you stole .
While other criminals hold a garage sale or place an ad on Craigslist in an attempt to get rid of all the stolen items , I recommend you keep it all in a pile in the garage .
Having all that stolen merchandise in your garage will really help you get busted when the cops finally figure it out , and trust me , they will .
So there you go , loyal reader (s ) .
If you follow my simple five - point guide to getting arrested , you ’ll be in handcuffs in no time , your face will be permanently etched in the minds of all your neighbors , and your name will be on all kinds on important paperwork at the court house and city hall .
Just think of how great you ’ll feel when everyone on the block knows that you ’re a thief , and gives you dirty looks every time they see your slovenly ass sitting on the front porch .
Of course , you ’ll have to do some jail time first , but that ’s the price you pay when you ’re famous .
This has been

Scientists discovered that specific aromas can " sweeten " your dreams .
Boris Stuck of University Hospital Mannheim , Germany , tried to discover whether smells are able to influence what a person dreams about .
The scientist analyzed the effect of aromas on 15 sleeping volunteers who were exposed to chemicals that had the smell of either rotten eggs or roses .
Mr Stuck said that the majority of everyday smells feature two components : the real smell and an element that can irritate your nose .
" By exposing the patients to chemicals chosen to only incorporate the smelly component , we were able to stimulate them with really high doses of the smell without them waking up , " he said .
Together with his colleagues Mr Stuck waited until the participants entered the REM phase of sleep , which represents a stage at which most dreams occur .
Then the team exposed the subjects to a high dose of malodorous air for ten seconds and one minute later they woke the volunteers up .
After the experiment the subjects were asked about the dreams they had and how a dream made on feel .
Those who were exposed to the rose smell reported having a positive dream experience .
A negative effect was reported from people who were exposed to rotten eggs .
According to scientists , smells are able to influence the emotional coloration of the dream .
Now scientists look forward to observe the effect of smells on people suffering from nightmares .
Irshaad Ebrahim of The London Sleep Centre said : " The relationship between external stimuli and dreaming is something we are all at some level aware of .
This initial research is a step in the direction towards clarifying these questions and may well lead to therapeutic benefits . "
The scientific work of Mr Stuck was presented at the annual meeting of American Academy of Otolaryngology in Chicago .

This may be the week when the Department for Transport learns about the risks of making a case for road safety based on figures that every expert in the field knows to be untrue .
Swindon Council got a good old - fashioned clip around the ear on Thursday from David Ainsworth , Deputy Chief Constable of Wiltshire , who declared himself decidedly unamused at its announcement that it would remove funding from fixed speed cameras in the Swindon area .
Responding to this decision , he said : " Wiltshire Police will not compromise on public safety .
Together with other partners in the road safety partnership Wiltshire Police remain committed to the support of a variety of methods including the use of cameras in speed enforcement . "
In other words , the local police force will carry on regardless .
Just in case we had n’t got the message , he added : " Nationally 13 per cent of all fatal casualties in 2007 were due to exceeding the speed limit . "
This figure is rather different from the one quoted by Peter Greenhalgh , the Tory councillor behind the idea , who said annual figures from the Department for Transport published in September showed just six per cent of collisions had been caused by people breaking speed limits .
As we explain below , the police figure is almost certainly nonsense , but when we asked them to substantiate it they simply refused to do so .
So much for debating the issues .
No wonder organisations such as SafeSpeed , a national anti-speeding camera organisation , continue to gain support in challenging the official view on cameras .
One problem with speed cameras is that the government is crying wolf in overestimating their effectiveness .
Faced with criticism of its speed camera strategy , the government has insisted on using figures that it knows to be inflated , thereby handing ammunition and possibly also the moral high ground to the sceptics .
As we reported earlier in the year , the level of road deaths and fatal injuries at any given camera site can be allocated to three separate and independent factors .
First , there is the effect of the speed camera itself .
Second is the " trend effect " – the rate at which the casualty rate is moving downward over time anyway .
Third there is the " regression to the mean " effect ( rtm ) .
That one is a little more complicated – but is a statistical quantification of the common - sense view that where a speed camera has been set up due to above - average casualties in a previous time period , some of that " before - the - camera " increase was little more than random fluctuation .
Therefore any item placed by the roadside would be associated with a subsequent fall in deaths .
By this means , bad statistics could " prove " that locating bananas at crash sites would reduce the level of road deaths .
This view is reinforced by Dr Linda Mountain , Senior Lecturer in the Department of Engineering at Liverpool University , who has been involved in two in - depth studies of the effects of speed cameras .
She concludes that speed cameras reduce fatal and serious accidents by around 20 per cent .
It is a real effect – but it is not as big an effect as the 42 per cent claimed by government .
As Mountain says : " This failure to take account of rtm effects leaves the door open for criticism . "
Despite this , she is convinced that the Swindon decision is the wrong one .
She adds : " Speed cameras are one of many measures that have been shown to increase road safety .
They have a role to play , along with a number of other techniques , such as road layout and traffic calming measures .
What really matters is the combination . "
Mountain is not sure that there exists any reliable study of cost - effectiveness .
However , she believes that the costs associated with road deaths , as well as the fact that most cameras return far more than their operating costs in terms of revenue mean that this is one of these questions where conclusions can be reached without recourse to detailed analysis .
A further muddying of the waters comes with a 2006 study by the DfT using STATS19 data – Traffic Police estimates of whether crash victims were " exceeding the speed limit " or " going too fast for conditions " – as a means to categorise the causes of road accidents .
This gave exceeding the speed limt as a factor in 12 per cent of fatal road accidents and 5 per cent of all road accidents .
An independent UK - based controlled study then used STATS19 data to show that speed cameras are effective at reducing accidents and injuries .
This finding was subsequently challenged by a paper ( pdf ) in the British Medical Journal , which highlighted discrepancies between Police reporting of casualty figures and hospital admissions for road accidents over the same period , and concluded that " the overall fall seen in police statistics for non-fatal road traffic injuries probably represents a fall in completeness of reporting of these injuries " .
So much for the statistics .
Unfortunately , politics and political accounting also play a part .
Swindon Borough Council complains that the £ 320,000 it pays annually towards just three fixed cameras could be better spent on warning signs and better lighting .
The council might have a point , in the sense that that much money can pay for a lot of other measures .
Worse , from the government 's point of view , is that accidents in the Swindon area have been on the increase over the last couple of years .
Remember that pesky rtm effect ?
The one that the DfT prefers to overlook ?
Well , if the upward trend in Swindon is itself little more than random fluctuation , then removing the cameras could end up being associated with a fall in accidents over the next year or so .
Which would " prove " that cameras actually cause accidents ?
Not exactly .
But in order to counter that assertion , the time might come when the DfT itself would have to invoke the dread rtm effect .
Did we hear someone mutter " hoisted by their own petard " ? ®
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The Bush administration has intensified efforts to send more security detainees from Guantanamo Bay to their own countries but hopes are very dim of closing the prison by year - end , senior U.S. officials say .
U.S. Navy guards walk inside fencing of Camp VI , the maximum security detention facility for terrorism suspects at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , July 23 , 2008 .
The U.S. military invited news media members to view the facility on Wednesday .

A host of legal and practical problems have stalled moves to close the controversial prison at a U.S. naval base in Cuba , which opened in January 2002 to house terrorism suspects caught in President George W. Bush ’s declared war against terrorism .
Of about 255 detainees now in Guantanamo , government agencies say 60 to 80 face special military tribunals .
About 60 are in the process of being sent back to their own countries .
The future of the remaining 115 or so is uncertain as there is not enough evidence to charge them and they are deemed too dangerous to send home .
“ No one wants to release the next Mohamed Atta , ” said one U.S. defense official , referring to one of the hijackers of a plane flown into the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 .
Senior officials from the Pentagon , the State Department , the White House and Justice Department all said despite a wish to close it , Guantanamo would likely be an issue for the next president following the November U.S. presidential election .
Both candidates -- Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama -- want it closed .
The creation of the remote prison tarnished America ’s image and human rights groups say it has damaged U.S. credibility .
More than 500 prisoners have been released but most of the remainder have been confined for years without charges .
Bush ’s National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the president wanted to see Guantanamo shuttered but keeping America safe was his key concern .
“ The number one priority is to make sure the worst terrorists of the world are given justice and that is a process that is not going to be completed by the end of the year . ”
“ For others cleared for release we want to make sure their home countries will put proper mechanisms in place to ensure they do n’t return to terrorism and that no one is returned to a country that would potentially torture then , ” Johndroe said .
DASH TO FINISH
In recent months , the State Department has been racing to get deals with more than half a dozen countries for the return of scores of detainees , seeking security assurances as well as guarantees the prisoners would be treated humanely .
During a visit to four North African countries this month -- Libya , Tunisia , Algeria and Morocco -- Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice made clear the only way to close Guantanamo was to start emptying it and nations must cooperate .
“ We have really kicked our efforts into overdrive , ” said a senior U.S. official of the State Department ’s efforts .
More than one - third of the prisoners left are from Yemen and the State Department is trying to reach an arrangement with that government , but talks are progressing slowly .
“ It is very easy for critics to say , ‘ Close Guantanamo . ’
But what do you do with these 100 Yemenis ? ” said the official .
The senior official , who spoke on condition he was not named , rejected claims by some human rights groups that the Bush administration was prepared to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in order to get rid of some detainees .
The Bush administration has received a flood of lawsuits from detainees following a Supreme Court decision in June that allowed prisoners to fight their imprisonment , or lodge “ habeas corpus ” cases in the U.S. federal courts .
“ It is just an enormous amount of litigation and the real concern is that one of the habeas judges will order someone released , ” said the senior U.S. official .
There is no resolution on what to do with Guantanamo detainees who are neither charged nor returned home .
Matthew Waxman , a former senior Defense and State Department official who dealt with detainee policy , said options included finding a way to prosecute them either via the military commissions or U.S. courts , or just to continue to detain them at Guantanamo .
Another was to send them to a third country , to their own country or to transfer them to the United States .
“ But there is certainly a ‘ not in my backyard ’ problem here .
No community is likely to volunteer to be the detention center for these people , ” said Waxman .
