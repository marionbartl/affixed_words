The physiognomy of Betty and Veronica is timeless : two large doe eyes surrounding a crescent tipped and nostril - less nose , under which a strawberry mouth containing one gigantic , undivided tooth plumply rests .
The design of Archie 's girlfriends has n't significantly changed in almost half a century , ever since cartoonist Dan DeCarlo created the modern look for Archie and the Riverdale gang in the 1950s .
Now , it 's changing again ... all thanks to artist Steven Butler , whose clumsy line work should be familiar to anyone who has ever seen a children 's coloring panel on the back of an IHOP place mat .
Look , I 'll be blunt : I 'm not a big fan of the Archie look for the last fifty years or so .
Compare the image on the far right above to the one to the right of this paragraph : look how sassy Betty and Veronica were back in the 1940's !
Look at the personality of the characters , Archie in particular .
Compared to that impressive bit of cartooning , the last fifty years in Archie Comics have been a complete stylistic wash .
DeCarlo's reimagining of the Archie universe was done for one and only one reason : to make it possible for the publishers to employ cheaper , uncredited artists and cycle through them easily without any stylistic difference .
One thing that can be said for the new style is that artists will no longer have no discernible stylistic difference in Archie Comics : the new character designs are too elaborate for that .
Yet weirdly enough , Butler 's " re-imagined " Archie manages to drain the last glimmer of style from what has become comics ' most pathetic franchise .
The old DeCarlo designs may have been simple and easily reproducible , but they were also memorable .
Almost any American presented with a drawing of an Archie Comics character could tell it was meant to be part of the Riverdale gang just as easily as they could identify a character that was supposed to be from the Simpsons .
Butler 's work loses that completely : try to imagine the Simpsons drawn in another style and remaining half as memorable .
But more importantly , Butler 's work also misses the plot by making Betty and Veronica look totally different .
Not only does this rob Archie 's romantic quandary of its delicious irony ( what does it matter which girl Archie picks ?
They are both the same girl . ) but let 's face it : one of the reasons the entire Betty / Veronica / Archie love - triangle is so alluring is because Betty and Veronica look exactly like one other , with the exception of hair color .
When it comes right down to it , Archie is the personification of every American teenager , and as a pubertal Everyman , his relationship with Betty and Veronica indicates every teenage boy 's own deeply seated desire to date two identical twins and eventually convince them to make out with one another while he watches .
Right , fellas ?
Boo to Archie Comics .
Against all odds , a lame comics franchise somehow manages to make itself even lamer .

“ A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm ”
First neocon report calling for Iraq invasion .
Delivered to Israel in 1996 .
The Iraq War was not about oil .
It was main pushed for by a group of neocons that were tightly linked with conservative Israelis .
This report help launch their efforts and it was addressed to Israel , not the US .
It has contributions from Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , and David Wurmser all members of the “ Study Group on a New Israeli Strategy , ” and all key Iraq - war players in the Bush administration .
Published by this institute : IASPS ( download report ) .
Israel has a large problem .
Labor Zionism , which for 70 years has dominated the Zionist movement , has generated a stalled and shackled economy .
Efforts to salvage Israel ’s socialist institutions — which include pursuing supranational over national sovereignty and pursuing a peace process that embraces the slogan , “ New Middle East ” — undermine the legitimacy of the nation and lead Israel into strategic paralysis and the previous government ’s “ peace process . ”
That peace process obscured the evidence of eroding national critical mass — including a palpable sense of national exhaustion — and forfeited strategic initiative .
The loss of national critical mass was illustrated best by Israel ’s efforts to draw in the United States to sell unpopular policies domestically , to agree to negotiate sovereignty over its capital , and to respond with resignation to a spate of terror so intense and tragic that it deterred Israelis from engaging in normal daily functions , such as commuting to work in buses .
Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government comes in with a new set of ideas .
While there are those who will counsel continuity , Israel has the opportunity to make a clean break ; it can forge a peace process and strategy based on an entirely new intellectual foundation , one that restores strategic initiative and provides the nation the room to engage every possible energy on rebuilding Zionism , the starting point of which must be economic reform .
To secure the nation ’s streets and borders in the immediate future , Israel can :
Work closely with Turkey and Jordan to contain , destabilize , and roll - back some of its most dangerous threats .
This implies clean break from the slogan , “ comprehensive peace ” to a traditional concept of strategy based on balance of power .
Change the nature of its relations with the Palestinians , including upholding the right of hot pursuit for self defense into all Palestinian areas and nurturing alternatives to Arafat ’s exclusive grip on Palestinian society .
Forge a new basis for relations with the United States — stressing self - reliance , maturity , strategic cooperation on areas of mutual concern , and furthering values inherent to the West .
This can only be done if Israel takes serious steps to terminate aid , which prevents economic reform .
This report is written with key passages of a possible speech marked TEXT , that highlight the clean break which the new government has an opportunity to make .
The body of the report is the commentary explaining the purpose and laying out the strategic context of the passages .
A New Approach to Peace
Early adoption of a bold , new perspective on peace and security is imperative for the new prime minister .
While the previous government , and many abroad , may emphasize “ land for peace ” — which placed Israel in the position of cultural , economic , political , diplomatic , and military retreat — the new government can promote Western values and traditions .
Such an approach , which will be well received in the United States , includes “ peace for peace , ” “ peace through strength ” and self - reliance : the balance of power .
A new strategy to seize the initiative can be introduced :
TEXT :
We have for four years pursued peace based on a New Middle East .
We in Israel cannot play innocents abroad in a world that is not innocent .
Peace depends on the character and behavior of our foes .
We live in a dangerous neighborhood , with fragile states and bitter rivalries .
Displaying moral ambivalence between the effort to build a Jewish state and the desire to annihilate it by trading “ land for peace ” will not secure “ peace now . ”
Our claim to the land — to which we have clung for hope for 2000 years –is legitimate and noble .
It is not within our own power , no matter how much we concede , to make peace unilaterally .
Only the unconditional acceptance by Arabs of our rights , especially in their territorial dimension , “ peace for peace , ” is a solid basis for the future .
Israel ’s quest for peace emerges from , and does not replace , the pursuit of its ideals .
The Jewish people ’s hunger for human rights — burned into their identity by a 2000 - year old dream to live free in their own land — informs the concept of peace and reflects continuity of values with Western and Jewish tradition .
Israel can now embrace negotiations , but as means , not ends , to pursue those ideals and demonstrate national steadfastness .
It can challenge police states ; enforce compliance of agreements ; and insist on minimal standards of accountability .
Securing the Northern Border
Syria challenges Israel on Lebanese soil .
An effective approach , and one with which American can sympathize , would be if Israel seized the strategic initiative along its northern borders by engaging Hizballah , Syria , and Iran , as the principal agents of aggression in Lebanon , including by :
striking Syria ’s drug- money and counterfeiting infrastructure in Lebanon , all of which focuses on Razi Qanan .
paralleling Syria ’s behavior by establishing the precedent that Syrian territory is not immune to attacks emanating from Lebanon by Israeli proxy forces .
striking Syrian military targets in Lebanon , and should that prove insufficient , striking at select targets in Syria proper .
Israel also can take this opportunity to remind the world of the nature of the Syrian regime .
Syria repeatedly breaks its word .
It violated numerous agreements with the Turks , and has betrayed the United States by continuing to occupy Lebanon in violation of the Taef agreement in 1989 .
Instead , Syria staged a sham election , installed a quisling regime , and forced Lebanon to sign a “ Brotherhood Agreement ” in 1991 , that terminated Lebanese sovereignty .
And Syria has begun colonizing Lebanon with hundreds of thousands of Syrians , while killing tens of thousands of its own citizens at a time , as it did in only three days in 1983 in Hama .
Under Syrian tutelage , the Lebanese drug trade , for which local Syrian military officers receive protection payments , flourishes .
Syria ’s regime supports the terrorist groups operationally and financially in Lebanon and on its soil .
Indeed , the Syrian - controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon has become for terror what the Silicon Valley has become for computers .
The Bekaa Valley has become one of the main distribution sources , if not production points , of the “ supernote ” — counterfeit US currency so well done that it is impossible to detect .( source : ex24x7 )
Text :
Negotiations with repressive regimes like Syria ’s require cautious realism .
One cannot sensibly assume the other side ’s good faith .
It is dangerous for Israel to deal naively with a regime murderous of its own people , openly aggressive toward its neighbors , criminally involved with international drug traffickers and counterfeiters , and supportive of the most deadly terrorist organizations .
Given the nature of the regime in Damascus , it is both natural and moral that Israel abandon the slogan “ comprehensive peace ” and move to contain Syria , drawing attention to its weapons of mass destruction program , and rejecting “ land for peace ” deals on the Golan Heights .
Moving to a Traditional Balance of Power Strategy
TEXT :
We must distinguish soberly and clearly friend from foe .
We must make sure that our friends across the Middle East never doubt the solidity or value of our friendship .
Israel can shape its strategic environment , in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan , by weakening , containing , and even rolling back Syria .
This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq — an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right — as a means of foiling Syria ’s regional ambitions .
Jordan has challenged Syria ’s regional ambitions recently by suggesting the restoration of the Hashemites in Iraq .
This has triggered a Jordanian - Syrian rivalry to which Asad has responded by stepping up efforts to destabilize the Hashemite Kingdom , including using infiltrations .
Syria recently signaled that it and Iran might prefer a weak , but barely surviving Saddam , if only to undermine and humiliate Jordan in its efforts to remove Saddam .
But Syria enters this conflict with potential weaknesses : Damascus is too preoccupied with dealing with the threatened new regional equation to permit distractions of the Lebanese flank .
And Damascus fears that the ‘ natural axis ’ with Israel on one side , central Iraq and Turkey on the other , and Jordan , in the center would squeeze and detach Syria from the Saudi Peninsula .
For Syria , this could be the prelude to a redrawing of the map of the Middle East which would threaten Syria ’s territorial integrity .
Since Iraq ’s future could affect the strategic balance in the Middle East profoundly , it would be understandable that Israel has an interest in supporting the Hashemites in their efforts to redefine Iraq , including such measures as : visiting Jordan as the first official state visit , even before a visit to the United States , of the new Netanyahu government ; supporting King Hussein by providing him with some tangible security measures to protect his regime against Syrian subversion ; encouraging — through influence in the U.S. business community — investment in Jordan to structurally shift Jordan ’s economy away from dependence on Iraq ; and diverting Syria ’s attention by using Lebanese opposition elements to destabilize Syrian control of Lebanon .
Most important , it is understandable that Israel has an interest supporting diplomatically , militarily and operationally Turkey ’s and Jordan ’s actions against Syria , such as securing tribal alliances with Arab tribes that cross into Syrian territory and are hostile to the Syrian ruling elite .
King Hussein may have ideas for Israel in bringing its Lebanon problem under control .
The predominantly Shia population of southern Lebanon has been tied for centuries to the Shia leadership in Najf , Iraq rather than Iran .
Were the Hashemites to control Iraq , they could use their influence over Najf to help Israel wean the south Lebanese Shia away from Hizballah , Iran , and Syria .
Shia retain strong ties to the Hashemites : the Shia venerate foremost the Prophet ’s family , the direct descendants of which — and in whose veins the blood of the Prophet flows — is King Hussein .
Changing the Nature of Relations with the Palestinians
Israel has a chance to forge a new relationship between itself and the Palestinians .
First and foremost , Israel ’s efforts to secure its streets may require hot pursuit into Palestinian - controlled areas , a justifiable practice with which Americans can sympathize .
A key element of peace is compliance with agreements already signed .
Therefore , Israel has the right to insist on compliance , including closing Orient House and disbanding Jibril Rujoub ’s operatives in Jerusalem .
Moreover , Israel and the United States can establish a Joint Compliance Monitoring Committee to study periodically whether the PLO meets minimum standards of compliance , authority and responsibility , human rights , and judicial and fiduciary accountability .
TEXT :
We believe that the Palestinian Authority must be held to the same minimal standards of accountability as other recipients of U.S. foreign aid .
A firm peace cannot tolerate repression and injustice .
A regime that cannot fulfill the most rudimentary obligations to its own people cannot be counted upon to fulfill its obligations to its neighbors .
Israel has no obligations under the Oslo agreements if the PLO does not fulfill its obligations .
If the PLO cannot comply with these minimal standards , then it can be neither a hope for the future nor a proper interlocutor for present .
To prepare for this , Israel may want to cultivate alternatives to Arafat ’s base of power .
Jordan has ideas on this .
To emphasize the point that Israel regards the actions of the PLO problematic , but not the Arab people , Israel might want to consider making a special effort to reward friends and advance human rights among Arabs .
Many Arabs are willing to work with Israel ; identifying and helping them are important .
Israel may also find that many of her neighbors , such as Jordan , have problems with Arafat and may want to cooperate .
Israel may also want to better integrate its own Arabs .
Forging A New U.S. - Israeli Relationship
In recent years , Israel invited active U.S. intervention in Israel ’s domestic and foreign policy for two reasons : to overcome domestic opposition to “ land for peace ” concessions the Israeli public could not digest , and to lure Arabs — through money , forgiveness of past sins , and access to U.S. weapons — to negotiate .
This strategy , which required funneling American money to repressive and aggressive regimes , was risky , expensive , and very costly for both the U.S. and Israel , and placed the United States in roles is should neither have nor want .
Israel can make a clean break from the past and establish a new vision for the U.S. - Israeli partnership based on self - reliance , maturity and mutuality — not one focused narrowly on territorial disputes .
Israel ’s new strategy — based on a shared philosophy of peace through strength — reflects continuity with Western values by stressing that Israel is self - reliant , does not need U.S. troops in any capacity to defend it , including on the Golan Heights , and can manage its own affairs .
Such self - reliance will grant Israel greater freedom of action and remove a significant lever of pressure used against it in the past .
To reinforce this point , the Prime Minister can use his forthcoming visit to announce that Israel is now mature enough to cut itself free immediately from at least U.S. economic aid and loan guarantees at least , which prevent economic reform .
[ Military aid is separated for the moment until adequate arrangements can be made to ensure that Israel will not encounter supply problems in the means to defend itself ] .
As outlined in another Institute report , Israel can become self - reliant only by , in a bold stroke rather than in increments , liberalizing its economy , cutting taxes , relegislating a free - processing zone , and selling - off public lands and enterprises — moves which will electrify and find support from a broad bipartisan spectrum of key pro-Israeli Congressional leaders , including Speaker of the House , Newt Gingrich .
Israel can under these conditions better cooperate with the U.S. to counter real threats to the region and the West ’s security .
Mr. Netanyahu can highlight his desire to cooperate more closely with the United States on anti-missile defense in order to remove the threat of blackmail which even a weak and distant army can pose to either state .
Not only would such cooperation on missile defense counter a tangible physical threat to Israel ’s survival , but it would broaden Israel ’s base of support among many in the United States Congress who may know little about Israel , but care very much about missile defense .
Such broad support could be helpful in the effort to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem .
To anticipate U.S. reactions and plan ways to manage and constrain those reactions , Prime Minister Netanyahu can formulate the policies and stress themes he favors in language familiar to the Americans by tapping into themes of American administrations during the Cold War which apply well to Israel .
If Israel wants to test certain propositions that require a benign American reaction , then the best time to do so is before November , 1996 .
Conclusions : Transcending the Arab - Israeli Conflict
TEXT : Israel will not only contain its foes ; it will transcend them .
Notable Arab intellectuals have written extensively on their perception of Israel ’s floundering and loss of national identity .
This perception has invited attack , blocked Israel from achieving true peace , and offered hope for those who would destroy Israel .
The previous strategy , therefore , was leading the Middle East toward another Arab - Israeli war .
Israel ’s new agenda can signal a clean break by abandoning a policy which assumed exhaustion and allowed strategic retreat by reestablishing the principle of preemption , rather than retaliation alone and by ceasing to absorb blows to the nation without response .
Israel ’s new strategic agenda can shape the regional environment in ways that grant Israel the room to refocus its energies back to where they are most needed : to rejuvenate its national idea , which can only come through replacing Israel ’s socialist foundations with a more sound footing ; and to overcome its “ exhaustion , ” which threatens the survival of the nation .
Ultimately , Israel can do more than simply manage the Arab - Israeli conflict though war .
No amount of weapons or victories will grant Israel the peace its seeks .
When Israel is on a sound economic footing , and is free , powerful , and healthy internally , it will no longer simply manage the Arab - Israeli conflict ; it will transcend it .
As a senior Iraqi opposition leader said recently : “ Israel must rejuvenate and revitalize its moral and intellectual leadership .
It is an important — if not the most important–element in the history of the Middle East . ”
Israel — proud , wealthy , solid , and strong — would be the basis of a truly new and peaceful Middle East .

These figures are staggering .
Yet there was hardly a mention of them in a major story last week : the announcement by Britain 's two main political parties of how they will tackle what is commonly agreed to be the biggest threat facing the planet , global warming and ensuing climate change .
Labour unveiled their Climate Change Bill promising to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for global warming by 60 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050 .
Suggested policies to achieve this ranged from banning standby buttons on electrical equipment and old - fashioned , inefficient light bulbs to ' capture and storage ' of pollution from coal - fired power stations .
Conservatives grabbed headlines with a plan to limit air travel - a small but fast - growing source of greenhouse gases .
These have been well - intentioned , if not always convincing , ideas .
At an Oxford conference , scientists argued against the ' Hollywoodisation ' of the problem , that it is being promoted beyond the science .
And still , everybody is talking only about one half of the equation : the emissions we generate , not how we generate them .
All the standby buttons and low - energy light bulbs are dwarfed by the pressure of a global population rising by the equivalent of Britain every year .
Put simply , if governments want to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent , and the world 's population rises to the mid-range forecast of 9.2 billion , each person would in fact have to slash their emissions by 72 per cent .
More efficient technology , renewable energy and lifestyle changes will help do that , but growing prosperity and consumption in developing countries will also make it harder .
That all our low - energy light bulbs , home insulation , efficient cars , boilers and washing machines have so far failed to stop emissions growing illustrates how difficult cutting them will be to achieve .
Some population activists argue the world can only support a population of two to three billion , even as few as 500 million in future .
But even if reducing the world 's population is unlikely or distasteful , it is incredible that there is not even a debate about limiting and maybe one day reversing growth .
There are many understandable reasons for the prevailing reluctance to talk about population .
Some question whether there is a problem at all .
Blair says Britain does n't need a population policy , and he has a point : Britain 's population grows only because of immigration .
But greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem , so it should not matter which countries people live in ( some say developed countries have higher standards of living so moving people into them increases overall emissions , but it is hard to argue we should deny others our quality of life ) .
At a global level , optimists say advances in science and technology will provide the solution ; more aggressive estimates suggest we could double consumption and halve our impact on the planet .
But other evidence suggests it is too soon to relax .
Even if huge advances can be made on slashing greenhouse gases , there is an argument that densely populated countries cannot cope with local environmental stresses such as home - building , fresh water use , waste , traffic , light pollution and noise .
More worryingly , the evidence that technology can solve the problem is not yet convincing : the recent failure of European car - makers to meet voluntary emissions reductions is a reminder that a decade after the international community made a serious pledge to tackle global warming , emissions are still rising .
Another deterrent to discussing population is the uncomfortable suspicion that environmentalism is a soft cover for more objectionable population agendas to stop or reduce immigration or growth in developing countries .
Sometimes it might be .
But that does n't take away the underlying fact : that more people use more resources and create more pollution .
This is why some braver voices - Sir David Attenborough , Jonathan Porritt and Professor Chris Rapley , director of the British Antarctic Survey , to name a few - have begun to raise the issue .
The biggest obstacle to debate is the matter of possible solutions .
Propositions such as ignoring disease or limiting life - saving medical treatment can be ruled out as unacceptable , and birth control is objectionable to many on moral , religious and libertarian grounds .
It is not surprising that green groups and politicians , worried about offending supporters , stay silent .
There remains a fourth barrier to raising the population issue : even when people acknowledge the problem and brave the debate , it seems too big to solve .
But there are things that can be done at least to reduce population growth .
Last week the UN Population Fund said its latest projections ' underline the urgency of family planning needs ' .
It says 200 million women in the world do n't have access to ' safe and effective ' contraceptive services , and calls for a big increase in funding for family planning , especially in developing nations .
Britain 's Optimum Population
Trust also calls for 45 countries to drop policies to increase birthrates - mostly because of worries about paying pensions for an aging population .
Is this enough to tackle such a big issue ?
Even with the most optimistic assumptions about falling birth rates , the UN forecasts a population increase to 7.8 billion by 2050 .
But that is still considerably less than a population of 9.2 billion .
And the OPT says the success of campaigns in countries such as Iran and Thailand suggests the best family planning services , especially combined with women 's education and human rights , could go even further .
It is understandable then that people are worried about discussing population , but fear of misrepresentation , offence or failure are not good enough reasons to ignore one half of the world 's biggest problem : the population effect on climate change .
Jon Stewart and the Daily Show team really went to town on the scandal - ridden GOP tonight .
From the cancellation of the " Annual GOP Barebeque and Nude Cub Scout Wrestle " to the passing of the Foley buck among the House Leadersip , Jon puts a hysterical spin on a truly disastrous scandal that 's getting worse by the minute .
Reynolds : I did what most people would do in a work place .
I heard something , I took it to my supervisor .
Stewart : " I took it to my supervisor ? "
Tom Reynolds ... Congressman ? or Assistant Manager at Applebees ?
Jon also catches Hastert in the bald - faced lie of saying he openly took questions after his press conference , Hannitys fudging of Monica Lewinskys age and O'Reilly 's " mistaken " on - screen graphic .
Napster has put a new twist on the notion of being a loss leader .
It has actually managed to sell more songs for rival online music services than for its own product , according to a survey conducted by a university customer .
Not a single University of Rochester student admitted to buying a song via Napster during the Fall 2004 semester .
Instead , eight per cent of the students turned to the likes of iTunes and Musicmatch to buy songs they enjoy .
That 's an ominous sign for a company spending millions to seed the university market with music in the hopes of unseating Apple as the clear leader in online music .
Most troubling for Napster , things do n't appear to be improving on the music purchase front .
During the Spring 2004 semester , a whopping 1 per cent of students did buy tracks off the Nap .
Now no one does .
The situation worsens with Napster 's small number of specialty " buy only " songs not included with its standard service .
Two per cent of students purchased such tracks from Napster , while 39 per cent turned to rival services to secure their songs .
The University of Rochester has boasted about being one of the Napsterized schools that force music rental services on students in the hopes of curbing P2P file - trading .
In almost every case , Napster offers such schools a massive discount off its $ 9.95 per month fee , making it easier for the schools to stomach the cost of opening music shops .
The schools also typically receive hardware donations from unnamed sponsors .
Napster has spent tens of millions on a massive marketing campaign , attacking the " $ 10,000 " cost it takes to fill an iPod .
( This is a meaningless statistic when you consider that iPod owners are free to add their existing CD collections and those of friends to their device at no cost . )
In addition , Napster has subsidized device makers , attempting to create interest in the non-iPod music player market .
This strategy left Napster reporting a $ 24 m fourth quarter loss .
A host of companies , most notably Napster and Real , appear convinced that consumers will buy into the concept of renting their music .
This strategy requires a massive cultural change in which people must accept restrictions on when and how they can listen to music that is of lower quality than a CD .
If you pay a monthly fee forever , you receive all the music one could desire .
A decent idea until you realize that most people nurture their music collections to reflect their tastes and do n't want access to all the blather ever created .
For the rental model to succeed , Napster and others would , er , have to turn a profit at some point .
The companies appear to believe that a critical mass of consumers would deliver black ink .
But in today 's reality , hardware makers - mostly Apple - are the ones making serious cash off online music .
Slot this in the " cry me a river " category :
Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers do not relish the idea of someone bringing up her 2002 Senate vote at every campaign stop .
Clinton cast a vote that has led to one of the biggest foreign policy disasters in this nation 's history -- a vote that even cursory skepticism would 've counseled against .
Most of the presidential candidates have gotten the " I fracked up the vote " stuff out of the way last year .
It 's not the most compelling tack to take -- if their judgment was so poor as to vote for the darn thing , why should we promote them .
We talk about DC being a place where people fail upward .
Do we really want to encourage that within our own party ?
But in any case , pro-war Dems who have unequivocally admitted their mistake do n't have to offer tortured justifications for their war .
They can honestly take Clinton pollster Mark Penn 's advice :
It ’s important for all Democrats to keep the word ‘ mistake ’ firmly on the Republicans and on President Bush .
Senator Clinton has been very clear that we , as a party , should keep the focus on Bush — these were his mistakes .
Ultimately that ’s very important , not just for her , but for the entire Democratic party .
Too bad for Penn that just ai n't gonna happen .
I have no interest in giving a pass to those Democrats who aided and abetted Bush 's mistakes , and I especially have no interest in giving a pass to those who demonstrate Bushian inability to offer self - reflection and admit that mistake .
It 's not a question of offering an " apology " .
I want acknowledgment of past mistakes .
These Democrats did n't just enable Bush 's war , they sat by and let the Right Wing smear machine attack those of us who waged our lonely battles to prevent this disaster from happening .
And while most of the candidates in the field have come around , Hillary remains the notable exception .
Those who have admitted their mistakes are now free to train their sights on the GOP .
It does n't absolve them from their terrible judgment , but it mitigates it .
While it 's best to not make a mistake in the first place , it 's even worse to compound that mistake by refusing to come to terms with it .
Clinton does n't have that .
And what 's worse , she has pretty much lost the window of opportunity to do so .
After resisting for so long , she finds herself in the thick of the presidential primary ( yes , even a year out ) with no room to maneuver .
If she suddenly reverses course and decides that yes , she 'll take personal responsibility for her vote , it'll feed into the strongest anti-Hillary narrative -- that she 's a panderer and will say what is most politically expedient at the moment .
It 's a sad state of affairs , but Hillary has made her bed .
And while her advisors may cringe that voters demand she account for Iraq at every campaign stop , I hope she continues to get grilled on it .
She deserves nothing less .
Update : Ahh , now it 's Hillary advisor James Carville trying to tie Iraq into 9/11 to justify Hillary 's war vote :
There was James Carville on CNN's Situation Room , desperately trying to explain why Sen.
Clinton voted for the war , even though other senators who had been given the same faulty intel she had , voted against it : " But they were n't from New York , " he said .
" Their state was n't hit .
They did n't have to deal with the grief of these 3,000 people . "
As you recall , Hillary has already tried to make Cheney 's favorite connection in trying to justify her vote :
As a senator from New York , I lived through 9/11 and am still dealing with the aftereffects .
Arguing that since New York was hit , we had to bomb the fuck out of a country that had nothing to do with it , then invade it and lose what will eventually be a trillion dollars and countless lives is really not an endearing argument .
When Jeff Jordan learned last May that Web - search leader Google Inc. was building its own Internet - payment service , he reacted swiftly .

When you accept a new job , you do n’t know who you are going to work with , what you are going to be doing , and how much ( or little ) you ’re going to like it .
Call everyone you want .
Ask their opinions .
Trust the fact that a good friend referred you for the gig .
Revel in the idea that the company has a good pedigree , but do n’t delude yourself that in a smattering of interview hours that you ’re going to have anything more than a vague hint of your new life .
Try this .
Tell me about your best friend .
Give me a bulleted list of five noteworthy things you think I should know about your best friend .
Got it ?
Read it out loud .
Does this do justice to your best friend ?
I hear you when you say , “ He ’d do anything for me ” , but why is that ?
Why is he protective of you ?
What ’s the story behind the bullet ?
That ’s what I want to know .
Each person in your new team has a story they want to tell you and it ’s never a bulleted list .
Some are going to freely give this story whereas others will carefully protect the fact they even have a story , but until each person you need to work with has shared this story with you ( and vice versa ) , the interview is n’t over .
The jury is out and you wo n’t know if this new job that you ’ve begun is actually your job .
Deliberation
Your first job is to relax .
Like the first day of school , you ’re going to overcompensate in your first day , your first week .
Most people do not lay their clothes out the night before they go to work .
You ’re doing this to calm yourself .
Those clothes neatly laid out at the end of your bed are a visual reminder that you have control over this thing that you ca n’t control .
Relax .
There ’s an industry standard regarding the amount of time it takes to make a hire and it ’s ninety days .
New managers hate when I tell them this because they ’re so giddy they ’ve got a new requisition and BOY WATCH HOW FAST I CAN HIRE .
Yes , yes .
I appreciate your velocity , but I ’m not going to worry about your hire for ninety days .
This chunk of time applies to your new job as well .
You ’ve got ninety days — three months — to finish your job interview .
Draw an a X on a calendar ninety days from now .
Make it a physical act that reminds you to relax and to listen rather than fret about what you do n’t know .
The new team is n’t going to trust you until you stop laying out your clothes , until you stop being deliberate .
I know you ’ve done this before : you ’ve had five other jobs and you have well refined people assessment instincts .
Except , well , they ’re biased .
These instincts are based on where you ’ve been and you have never been here before .
My suggestion is that the less you trust your instincts , the more you ’ll learn about your new job and that ’s why I wrote you a ninety days list :
#1) Stay late .
Show up early .
You need a map of the people you work with and I find the best way to start scribbling this map is to understand people and their relation to the day .
When do they get there ?
How long until they engage in what they do ?
Coffee run ?
Wait , no .
Late arriver .
Does n’t leave until he gets something done .
Makes his coffee run at 4:30 pm .
Does n’t drink coffee ?
Really ?
Why ?
These long days of watching give you insight and they give you tools for understanding what each of your team members want .
# 2) Accept every lunch invitation you get .
People are stretching themselves for you the first few weeks you show up .
They ’re going to go out of their way to include you and no matter who they are , you ’ve got to take the time to reciprocate .
The lunch invite from that guy in the group you pretty sure you ’ll never interact with will result in stories and you have a stunning lack of stories right now .
# 3) Always ask about acronyms .
It ’s great that we ’re all speaking English , but why is it that you ’re sitting in your first staff meeting and not understanding a word ?
It ’s because every team develops acronyms , metaphors , and clever ways to describing their uniqueness which you must understand .
Cracking the language nut is absolutely essential to assessing the hand you ’ve been dealt and you ’re going to need to ask a couple of times .
# 4) Say something really stupid .
Good news , you ’re going to do this whether it ’s on this list or not .
I ’m saying it ’s ok .
This stupid thing that you ’re going to say is going to demonstrate your nascent engagement in your job and when they stop giggling , the team is going to know you ’re desperately trying to figure it all out .
#5) Have a drink .
Similar to the lunch task , but more valuable .
No barrier is crossed when someone invites you to lunch , but when you get the drink invite , someone is saying , “ C’mon .
Let ’s go try a different version of honesty . ”
Stories are revealed over drinks , not lunch .
Warning : the next three on the list are at the bottom for a reason .
These are advanced moves that you do n’t want to attempt until you ’ve built some confidence that if they go horribly wrong , you have some confidence that you wo n’t permanently damage your still developing reputation .
Read on .
# 6) Tell someone what to do .
Everything above this list is about listening and this task involves you saying something .
More importantly , it involves you telling someone what to do .
I do n’t know who you are telling or what you ’re saying , but the goal is to exert your influence , to test your influence .
More importantly , to test your knowledge of the organization and see if this thing you have to say is true .
Telling is the sound of your instincts aligning to this particular organization and this thing you are saying is your first bit of inspiration .
Trust it .
Tell the right person and realize that everyone was waiting for you to say it .
# 7 ) Have an argument .
This is the riskiest item on the list , but potentially the most revealing .
There ’s a good chance when you pull a # 6 that this is going to happen anyway .
Again , what you are willing to argue about and who is going to be on the other side of the argument is a function of your situation .
What you want to understand is how does the organization value conflict ?
Is it ok that you ’re digging your heels in ?
Do others engage in the argument ?
Who swoops in to save the day ?
Can these people argue without losing their shit ?
Does this team argue out in the open or do they use devious passive aggressive subtlety ?
You ’re going to learn two valuable things during this professional battle .
First , how does this group of people make a decision ?
Second , you ’re going to have a better taste of their passion and their velocity .
#8) Find your inner circle .
In your arguments , lunches , drinks , and late nights , you ’re going to find kindred spirits .
This is the short list of people who share your instincts .
These are the ones who complete your sentences and they know your stories .
These are the ones who welcome the argument because they know great decisions are made by many .
Your inner circle is not exclusive because you ’ll go nowhere drawing relationship boundaries among the team .
This is the list of people with whom you share your raw inspiration and your stories because you know they ’ll gleefully help refine them .
The discovery of your inner circle wo n’t happen until time has passed .
You ’ll instinctively be attracted to people who feel comfortable , who feel right , but they ca n’t be in the inner circle until they ’ve passed the test of time .
They ’ve got to pass through the ninety day list a few times before you ’ve heard enough stories to let them in .
Finishing the Interview
It ’s not just that you forgot to ask key questions during your initial interview process ; it ’s that the person that you were walking into that interview is n’t who you are .
You ’re a resume , you ’re a referral , and you ’re a reputation .
Your job interview is n’t over until you ’ve asked all the questions and heard all of the stories .
Your job interview is n’t over until you understand the unique structure that has formed around this particular group of people .
It ’s not just the organizational chart , it ’s the intricate personalities which have settled into a comfortable , complex , communication structure .
Your job interview is n’t over until you have a framework for how you are going interact with these people and that means understanding not only their goals , but also their invaluable personal quirks .
What they tell you the first week has more to do with the fact that you ’re new than what they actually feel .
What they tell you after ninety days is the truth .
Your job interview is n’t over until you ’ve changed to become part of a new team .
Happy New Year .
Four companies to pull ads from Ann Coulter 's website
Ann Coulter may soon be feeling the effects of her remarks at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in the pocketbook .
At least four companies have decided to pull advertisements from Coulter 's website in the wake of the controversy that erupted after the conservative columnist called presidential candidate John Edwards a " faggot " last Friday , reports CNN .
Verizon , Netbank , and Sallie Mae have all removed ads from the website .
The ads were pulled in part due to a grassroots effort by a DailyKos diarist , who is reporting that Washington Mutual has also pulled ads from the website .
RAW STORY 's previous coverage of Ann Coulter 's remarks toward John Edwards can be found here .

Corporate front groups can cause a " boomerang effect " to their sponsors , damaging the reputations of companies like ExxonMobil , Merck , and PepsiCo , when the sponsor 's role in misrepresenting issues is widely revealed .
Moreover , advance information or instruction can inoculate the public against deception , according to a new study published in the February 2007 issue of Communications Research .
CMD has exposed corporate and PR front groups for years -- see John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton 's six books , not to mention Spin of the Day and SourceWatch .
Now , and evidently for the first time , scholars have undertaken an experiment to show how people respond to and resent corporate manipulation .
The study , " The Influence of Corporate Front - Group Stealth Campaigns , " should offer a message to companies : quit the fronting and put your name where you put your information .
Otherwise it 's disinformation .
And to media : do n't just give voice to commentators who are merely paid shills for industry .
( Here 's a recent example : Stateline.org , a publication of the Pew Charitable Trusts , wrote an article about efforts to promote healthier snack foods for kids that credulously described the Center for Consumer Freedom -- a front group for the restaurant / beverage industry -- as a " nonprofit coalition that seeks to protect consumer choice . " )
Instead of simply parroting front - group propaganda , journalists should explore and reveal their backing and affiliations .
In the Communications Research study , four professors from the University of Oklahoma - Norman -- Michael Pfau , Michel Haigh , Jeanetta Sims and Shelley Wrigley -- described the evolution of corporate public relations towards stealth and then ran that behavior through a track meet 's worth of trials .
They collected 204 impressionable students from introductory communications classes .
The students possessed what the researchers regarded as " low involvement " on public policy matters -- similar to the general public .
They positively cared about one or more of three selected issues -- wetlands development , controls on prescription drug prices under Medicare , and government efforts to reduce litter .
But the students did n't know a whole lot about the issues .
The researchers considered the students " moderates " and found that they changed their views in favor of the front groups upon exposure to their campaign names and messages : " Front group stealth campaigns are effective in eroding public attitudes favoring federal efforts to restrict wetlands development , federal legislation to control prescription prices under Medicare , or government regulatory efforts to reduce litter . "
The front groups carried deceptive names including , " National Wetlands Coalition , " " Citizens for Better Medicare , " and " Keep America Beautiful . "
Communications theorists have long argued that when people pay relatively little attention to issues , trust - provoking names can themselves manipulate the individual 's beliefs .
The study showed that " inoculation , " or forewarning subjects about front group presence , can create a more skeptical public .
The study subjects were even more distrusting when they were informed ( after the fact ) that the information they had been receiving was sponsored by specific companies whose interests did not reflect the cheery , supportive titles of the front groups .
" The results indicate that exposure , which reveals the corporate sponsors and true motives of corporate front - group stealth campaigns , backfires , not only against efforts to shape the attitude object but also against the image , reputation , credibility and citizenship assessments of front groups and their corporate sponsors .
In short , there is significant risk associated with front - group stealth campaigns , which sponsors ignore at their peril , " the authors write .
What the study does n't answer is why so many front groups continue to act " at their peril . "
One reason , Pfau surmised in an interview , may be that the news media rarely exposes front groups and their sponsors .
( He noted that Stauber and Rampton 's Toxic Sludge is Good for You ( Common Courage Press , 1995 ) , which exposes front group after group , helped inspire the study . )
Pfau acknowledged that the study could not predict whether the " boomerang " effect would actually affect consumer behavior or predict how long negative perceptions will last .
All the more reason for readers to jump onto SourceWatch to start writing about their own local front groups and community response to the groups ' campaigns .
The mass extinction that wiped out dinosaurs and other life 65 million years ago apparently did not , contrary to conventional wisdom , immediately clear the way for the rise of today ’s mammals .
In fact , the ancestral branches of most mammals , including primates , rodents and hoofed animals , emerged long before the global extinction and survived it more or less intact .
But it was not until at least 10 million to 15 million years afterward that the lineages of living mammals began to flourish in number and diversity .
Some mammals did benefit from the extinction , but these were not closely related to extant lineages and most of them soon died off .
These are the surprising conclusions of a comprehensive study of molecular and fossil data on 4,510 of the 4,554 mammal species known to exist today .
The researchers reporting the findings in today ’s issue of the journal Nature said it was the first virtually complete species - level study of existing mammals .
A couple of months ago , in response to someone else 's speed claims , I posted a comment that CherryPy's built in WSGI server could serve 1200 simple requests per second .
The demo used Apache 's " ab " tool to test ( " - k -n 3000 - c %s " ) .
In the last few days before the release of CherryPy 3.0 final , I 've done some further optimization of cherrypy .
wsgiserver , and now get 2000 + req/sec on my modest laptop .
threads | Completed | Failed | req/sec | msec/req | KB/sec | 10 | 3000 | 0 | 2170.79 | 0.461 | 358.18 | 20 | 3000 | 0 | 2080.34 | 0.481 | 343.26 | 30 | 3000 | 0 | 1920.31 | 0.521 | 316.85 | 40 | 3000 | 0 | 2051.84 | 0.487 | 338.55 | 50 | 3000 | 0 | 2051.84 | 0.487 | 338.55 |
The improvements are due to a variety of optimizations , including :
Replacing mimetools / rfc822 .
Message with custom code for reading headers .
Using socket . sendall instead of a socket fileobject for writes .
Generic hand - tuning of code loops .
I want to make it clear that the benchmark does not exercise any part of Cherry Py other than the WSGI server .
I used a very simple WSGI application ( not the full Cherry Py stack ) :
def simple_app ( environ , start_response ) : " " " Simplest possible application object " " " status = ' 200 OK ' response_headers = [ ( ' Content - type ' , 'text / plain ' ) , ( ' Content - Length ' , '19 ' ) ] start_response( status , response_headers ) return [ ' My Own Hello World ! ' ]
The full stack of CherryPy includes the WSGI application side as well , and consequently takes more time .
But that has risen from about 380 requests per second in October to :
Client Thread Report ( 1000 requests , 14 byte response body , 10 server threads ) : threads | Completed | Failed | req/sec | msec/req | KB/sec | 10 | 1000 | 0 | 536.86 | 1.863 | 85.36 | 20 | 1000 | 0 | 509.47 | 1.963 | 81.01 | 30 | 1000 | 0 | 499.28 | 2.003 | 79.39 | 40 | 1000 | 0 | 491.90 | 2.033 | 78.21 | 50 | 1000 | 0 | 504.32 | 1.983 | 80.19 | Average | 1000.0 | 0.0 | 508.366 | 1.969 | 80.832 |
If you want to benchmark the full Cherry Py stack on your own , just install CherryPy and run the script at cherrypy / test / benchmark.py .
Here 's the other script for the " bare server " benchmarks :

When you really think about it , kissing is pretty gross .
It involves saliva and mucous membranes , and it may have historical roots in chewed - up food .
Experts estimate that hundreds or even millions of bacterial colonies move from one mouth to another during a kiss .
Doctors have also linked kissing to the spread of diseases like meningitis , herpes and mononucleosis .
Yet anthropologists report that 90 percent of the people in the world kiss .
Most people look forward to their first romantic kiss and remember it for the rest of their lives .
Parents kiss children , worshippers kiss religious artifacts and couples kiss each other .
Some people even kiss the ground when they get off an airplane .

So how does one gesture come to signify affection , celebration , grief , comfort and respect , all over the world ?
No one knows for sure , but anthropologists think kissing might have originated with human mothers feeding their babies much the way birds do .
Mothers would chew the food and then pass it from their mouths to their babies ' mouths .
After the babies learned to eat solid food , their mothers may have kissed them to comfort them or to show affection .
In this scenario , kissing is a learned behavior , passed from generation to generation .
We do it because we learned how to from our parents and from the society around us .
There 's a problem with this theory , though : women in a few modern indigenous cultures feed their babies by passing chewed food mouth - to - mouth .
But in some of these cultures , no one kissed until Westerners introduced the practice .
" " Research suggests that mothers kiss their babies because of the way prehistoric mothers fed their children .

Other researchers believe instead that kissing is instinctive .
They use bonobo apes , which are closely related to humans , to support this idea .
Bonobos kiss one another frequently .
Regardless of sex or status within their social groups , bonobos kiss to reduce tension after disputes , to reassure one another , to develop social bonds and sometimes for no clear reason at all .
Some researchers believe that kissing primates prove that the desire to kiss is instinctive .
" " Many animal species exhibit kissing - like behaviors .

­ Several other animal species have behaviors that resemble kissing .
Many mammals lick one another 's faces , birds touch one another 's bills and snails caress one another 's antennae .
In some cases , the animals are grooming one another rather than kissing .
In others , they 're smelling scent glands that are located on faces or in mouths .
Regardless , when animals touch each other in this way , they 're often showing signs of trust and affection or developing social bonds .
­ Scientists do n't entirely agree on whether kissing is learned or instinctive .
There 's support for both arguments , just as there 's support for the different theories of why people started doing it in the first place .

Warning that Americans face a grave risk of losing their prosperity and high quality of life to better educated workers overseas , a panel of education , labor and other public policy experts yesterday proposed a far - reaching redesign of the United States education system that would include having schools operated by independent contractors and giving states , rather than local districts , control over school financing .
The panel , the New Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce , included two former federal education secretaries , Rod Paige , a Republican , and Richard W. Riley , a Democrat ; two former labor secretaries , William E. Brock , a Republican , and Ray Marshall , a Democrat ; and an array of other luminaries , including former Gov. John Engler of Michigan , and the New York City schools chancellor , Joel I. Klein .
The commission ’s report , released at a news conference in Washington , rethinks American schooling from top to bottom , going beyond the achievement goals of the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind , and farther than many initiatives being pursued by the Bush administration or by experimental state and local school authorities .
Among other things , the report proposes starting school for most children at age 3 , and requiring all students to pass board exams to graduate from high school , which for many would end after 10th grade .
Students could then go to a community or technical college , or spend two years preparing for selective colleges and universities .
“ We have run out the string on a whole series of initiatives that were viewed as hopeful , ” said Lewis H. Spence , commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Social Services and a member of the panel .
“ This puts a whole new set of ideas on the table . ”
Here are some ways to make sure your Summer of Code application fails .
All are inspired by actual applications to the Mozilla project this year .
Do n’t :
Fail to state your project idea .
This may seem obvious , but if you do n’t tell us what you want to do , we are n’t going to choose you to do it .
Cut - and - paste your CV .
If you say you have a Class Q driving licence , what it tells me is you have n’t really thought about the content of your application .
Suggest hard work is a substitute for experience .
If you are applying to do a complicated technical task , “ I ’ve got no experience of your codebase or project but I ’ll work really hard ” does n’t cut much ice .
Give us a vague timeline .
Project plans like : “ Week 1 - 2 : Ramp up on code .
Week 3 - 7 : Implement project .
Week 8 - 10 : Testing and debugging ” do n’t inspire confidence .
Use enthusiasm as a substitute for competence .
“ This feature would be really cool ! ” is n’t a good reason to choose you to implement it if you ’ve never written a line of C++ in your life .
Assume using the software means you can hack on it .
“ I use Firefox every day ” is not going to make it more likely for us to choose you to improve its networking layer .
Leave template residue in your application .
We had a number of applications which ended “ ( Thanks to Fyodor from Nmap for his help in creating this template . ) ”
This shouts “ zero - effort application spam ” .
Put all your info in an external web page .
Mentors are lazy .
Anyway , if you need more than 7500 characters , you should probably trim your text .
When asked about experience with a technology , put “ Good ” .
‘ Nuff said .
Tell us you are applying because you need the money .
However true it is .
Having said all that , there were many good applications which we were unable to fund .
Please do n’t think that if you were n’t chosen , your application was therefore rubbish .
I ’ll write a more constructive Summer - of - Code - related post soon .
Cluster bombs are causing injuries and deaths daily , the UN says
UN clearance experts had so far found 100,000 unexploded cluster bomblets at 359 separate sites , Jan Egeland said .
Israel has repeated its previous insistence that munitions it uses in conflict comply with international law .
Earlier , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert rebuffed UN chief Kofi Annan 's calls for a swift end to Israel 's air and sea blockade of Lebanon .
After talks with Mr Annan , Mr Olmert said the siege would only be lifted once the ceasefire terms were fully implemented .
This included the release of two Israeli soldiers whose capture by Hezbollah militants sparked the conflict .
But a Lebanese Hezbollah cabinet minister said there would be no unconditional release of the soldiers - the pair would only be freed as a result of a prisoner exchange with Israel .
Every day , people are maimed , wounded and killed by these weapons - it should n't have happened
Jan Egeland
UN humanitarian chief
UN efforts to rid Lebanon of cluster bombs have been under way since the conflict ended .
Earlier estimates from UN experts had suggested a total of about 100 cluster bomb sites .
Mr Egeland described the fresh statistics as " shocking new information " .
" What 's shocking and completely immoral is : 90 % of the cluster bomb strikes occurred in the last 72 hours of the conflict , when we knew there would be a resolution , " he said .
The UN ceasefire resolution which ended the month - long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was agreed by the Security Council on Friday , 11 August , and came into effect on Monday , 14 August .
Mr Egeland added : " Cluster bombs have affected large areas - lots of homes , lots of farmland .
They will be with us for many months , possibly years .
" Every day , people are maimed , wounded and killed by these weapons .
It should n't have happened . "
Mr Egeland said his information had come from the UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre , which had undertaken assessments of nearly 85 % of the bombed areas in Lebanon .
Earlier this week the US state department launched an inquiry into whether Israel misused US - made cluster bombs in Lebanon during the conflict .
A senior White House official told the BBC that the investigation would focus on whether US - made weapons were used against non-military targets .
Blockade defended
At their talks in Jerusalem , Mr Annan and Mr Olmert discussed the deployment of UN troops in Lebanon as well as the continuing blockade .
The UN chief said he hoped Israel would withdraw from southern Lebanon once 5,000 UN peacekeepers were on the ground " in the coming days and weeks " .
The BBC's Jill McGivering , in Jerusalem , said Mr Annan and Mr Olmert emerged from their meeting with little sign of the gap between them having narrowed .
Ehud Olmert rebuffed Kofi Annan 's call
Olmert and Annan
Mr Annan 's Jerusalem talks followed a visit to Lebanon as part of a regional tour aimed at bolstering the truce between Israel and Hezbollah .
After his talks in Israel , Mr Annan flew to the West Bank for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
At a joint press conference in Ramallah , Mr Annan said that more than 200 Palestinians had been killed since the end of June , and the violence had to stop .
Mr Annan has now arrived in Jordan for talks with King Abdullah II , after which he is expected to proceed to Syria .
Analysis
If this movie looks familiar - it 's because it is .
A royalty increase for songs played over Internet radio stations is declared , followed by doomsday predictions that the increase will bring about a cataclysmic collapse of the entire industry .
It 's like 2002 all over again .
That was when Copyright Royalty Board first set royalties for music played on internet radio stations .
Webcasters would pay royalties to a new collection agency , SoundExchange , established by the Recording Industry Ass. of America ( RIAA ) .
Many aspects of the predictions from five years ago have in fact taken place , though not quite on the scale that webcasting advocates feared at the time .
Several small webcasters were forced to shutter their operations , and the remaining webcasters had to change their revenue models significantly .
During the 2002 fracas , many friends of net radio argued that the royalty changes would destroy the diversity of choice that makes webcasting so appealing to the hardcore music fan .
Take a look around at the webcasting scene today , however , and you will find a thriving bazaar of commercial and non-profit webcasters providing everything from Top 40 hits to classical oboe music .
Taking this into account , it 's easy to dismiss the current pessimistic prognostications by webcasting insiders as yet another temper tantrum by a young , adolescent industry that has just suffered a major regulatory setback .
But many things have changed since those tumultuous days of 2002 , and the Copyright Royalty Board has revealed itself to have either an insidious grudge against , or a dangerous misunderstanding about , small and non-profit Net Radio stations .
Royalty hike
This time around , the CRB rejected the " percentage - of - revenue " suggestion coming from all parties to the royalty review ( except SoundExchange , of course ) and increased the royalty for music streamed under a statutory license by 170 per cent over five years , from $ .0007 in 2005 to $ .0019 in 2010 .
The CRB also tacked on an " administrative fee " of $ 500 per channel payable to SoundExchange each year .
Considering the fact that several small webcasters have hundreds or thousands of channels , this could easily cause a massive red tide for the webcasting industry , or at the very least result in a serious drop in the number of channels offered up to the public .
This time around , therefore , the doomsdayers could be right .
A quick look at the numbers shows why .
Assuming that most streaming radio stations play about 16 songs per hour , the royalty charge per listener hour in 2006 becomes 1.28 cents ( 16 songs * $ .0008 ) .
By 2010 ( assuming that Net Radio lasts that long ) , that number has jumped to 3.04 cents per listener hour .
That much pretty much everyone can agree on .
Here 's where things get a little more contentious .
One commentator has argued that a properly - run web station can pull in two radio spots an hour at about a $ 3 CPM ( cost - per - thousand - views ) .
The Executive Director of SoundExchange , John Simson , on the other hand , believes that webcasters can sell six ads per hour , at a CPM of $ 20 .
Under the former view , webcasters can pull in $ .006 per listener hour .
Given the presence of other revenue streams - banner ads and the like - the overall revenue for a typical webcaster would be about 1 to 1.2 cents per listener hour .
Thus , the royalty payment for 2006 would constitute anywhere from 107 per cent to 128 per cent of the normal webcaster 's total revenue .
Taking Simson 's approach to the numbers , webcasters can generate a whopping 12 cents per listener hour .
Adding in additional revenue ( which we will keep at the same level as the previous example ) gives an overall revenue of 12.4 to 12.8 cents per listener hour .
Thus , the 1.28 cents going to SoundExchange does n't look so bad , amounting to only about 10 per cent of webcasters ' overall revenue .
As with all disputes , the answer probably lies somewhere in the middle - but almost certainly far , far away from Simson 's numbers .
Without any solid industry information on advertising rate cards and revenues for webcast stations , it 's impossible to know for sure what percentage of revenue the new royalty charge will take from the industry as a whole .
Any webcasters care to tell us the real story ?
One thing that is clear , regardless of which set of aggregate numbers you choose to follow , is that the new payments will hit the little guy hardest of all , especially once you take the $ 500 per channel admin fee into account .
Non-profits get a bit of a break since they only have to pay the royalties once they exceed an arbitrary " aggregate tuning hour " threshold set by the CRB .
Since they also have very little revenue , however , the new royalties constitute an especially onerous burden for them .
The CRB 's ruling gives small commercial and non-profit webcasters the choice of the damned : they can either cough up the extra money necessary to use the statutory license for streaming music , or they can negotiate with the RIAA directly for a contractual license .
In 2002 , a group comprised of several small webcasters broke away from the rest of the web community and brokered a deal with the RIAA to do just that .
This backroom divide - and - conquer trick by the RIAA split the webcasting community and resulted in the Small Webcasters Settlement Act , which allowed for a negotiated license based on a percentage of revenue or expenses - whichever was greater , of course .
For this go 'round , however , more of the small webcasters and non-profits have grown some marbles and actually decided to fight .
Idea :
Use a DSL to preserve existing code investments and simplify deployment and tech support .
Six years of code already written in VBScript Needs to run on customers ' Windows and Unix servers Minimize tech support costs
Many customers refuse to install new runtimes on their servers , either because of IT policies or out of stubborness
We could port the VBScript to PHP /. NET / Java by hand , or we could spend two months writing a compiler .
The latter decision took less work ( a couple of months ) and produced better working code that runs on all our customers ' machines without modification .

Idea : Design Patterns are a sign of language deficiency .
Instead of seeing the use of design patterns as valuable in itself , it should be widely recognized that each design pattern is an expression of the failure of the source language .
Patterns might be a sign of weakness , but they might be a sign of simplicity .
There is a trade - off between putting something in your programming language and making it be a convention , or perhaps putting it in the library ...
Many of the patterns will get subsumed by future languages , but probably not all of them .
Patterns should be subsumed into languages when doing so makes programs simpler and more reliable .
Idea : DSLs are a bad idea because they do not do a good job controlling change over time
change
What I discovered during my time of inventing and re-inventing DSLs over and over is that I could n't handle change well .
Often the smallest change would lead to me changing the very language of my solution ; essentially a total rewrite .
This was the reality of software maitenance ...
And so I began to question the wisdom of creating DSLs .
change :
Because of change nobody ever really understands the [ business ] problem in the first place ...
Programs always seem to require ongoing human guidance or maintenance ... because of the nature of change and it's counterpart in the human psyche -- choice , the idea that programming languages merely solve problems is flawed ....
a programming language is not simply a means of solving some particular problem .
A programming language does n't define the solution to the problem , it defines how the solution will change over time .
This is the categorical mistake that so many make when criticizing languages : the expressive power of a language is not the measure of a language 's ability to model a problem domain , it 's rather the ability of the language to control changes in the problem domain .
This is ultimately why DSLs and their ilk may be more expressive than a general solution , and still possess less expressive power than a general solution .
A number of parallel discussions in blogspace have introduced some new distinctions useful for understanding the proper use cases for domain specific languages .
Joel Spolsky explained how the use of a DSL avoided large porting costs and simplified deployment / maintenance of their infrastructure into client data centers .
Mark Dominus made the case that design patterns are a sign of language deficiency and that we should seek to improve the language , not build pattern frameworks .
Buko
Obele introduces the variable of " change " into the context of discussion , and explains how DSLs are a bad idea because they do not do a good job controlling change over time .
The rest of this entry summarizes some of the key points from these sources .
Joel Spolsky 's company sells FogBugz , a bug tracking and feature scheduling software system built in VBScript over a 6 year period .
The software is now written in Wasabi , an internally built language that is backwards compatible with VBScript but supports many higher level features such as " closures , active records , lambdas , embedded SQL a la LINQ . "
Joel 's firm implemented a custom compiler to support their customers target platforms .
Joel 's customers want to deploy locally instead of trust a hosted model , leading Joels firm to build their own language and compiler instead of program to existing platforms such as PHP , Java , or .NET .
This set off a number of criticisms in blogspace , with the most active discussion over at codinghorror.com where Joel himself defended his decision by presenting the technical requirements that lead to the decision : Spolsky concludes :
On the DSL con-side , .NET Guru Dare Obesanjo also responded to Joel 's blog with a criticism of DSLs , stating that they they present larger problems when you considerin the face of constant evolution of other major languages , as well asof developers andof your main compiler gurus .
Mark Dominus examined the evolution of software languages since the 70's , and taking a number of common definitions of what a design pattern is , and used them to show that subroutines , Structs , Objects , and Iterators were at one point patterns themselves which later became implemented directly into modern programming languages .
Mark argues that : Continuing to program with patterns and re-implementing patterns is inefficient and time wasting .
Once a pattern is identified , " the correct place to implement a common solution to a recurring design problem is in the programming language " [ not in multiple implementations of pattern frameworks ] .
Mark was also careful to suggest in his conclusion that improving the language should be a " long term goal . "
Update ( Sept 19 ) : Ralph Johnson , original member of the GoF ( Gang of Four ) who wrote the most popular patterns book , responded that " this is wrong " .
Buko Obele was an early DSL convert who says he has implemented dozens of languages and is now against the idea of writing DSLs .
Buko interpretted Mark Dominus ' blog as suggesting that DSLs should be built instead of using patterns , but says it can be very time consuming ; " everytime I found myself writing some " boilerplate " code ... I went back to redesigning the whole language . "
Buko introduces the concept ofand explains how DSLs do n't respond well to it : Buko goes on to suggest that if you have a " mechanical view " of programming languages ( just syntax and semantics ; a simplistic tool that was good only for solving a set of problems " ) , then DSLs make sense , they suggest using the right tool for the right job .
However , the missing variable isLooking further at the impact of change , Buko suggests that programming languages are really a framework for dealing with change , and change is " a structural problem of software development . "
Making his main point : Buko concludes , based on his own experiences , that DSLs are " pretty much never a good idea except for trivial , static problem domains .
" As modern dynamic languages ( which make writing DSLs easier ) become more popular in the Java and .NET communities ( and of course Ruby is it 's own ) , the idea of DSLs will certainly become a topic of greater discussion .
Where do you stand ?
How far you might be asking , and how fast ?
How about 100 miles with a 10 minute recharge .

From the manufacturer :
Q : Where are the vehicles manufactured ?
A : Vehicle assembly will take place in Ontario , California .
Q : What is the driving range of these vehicles ?
A : The range is approximately 130 miles .
We are currently working on an expansion pack extending the range to 250 miles , available in 2007 .
Q : How do you charge the vehicle ?
A : They charge with an on - board 6.6 kW charger that plugs into a 220V outlet , the same as an electric dryer outlet in your home .
Off - board charging can be accomplished with a special charger in as little as 10 minutes .
Q : Does the vehicle have air - conditioning ?
A : Yes , it also has heating and power windows and locks .
Q : How much power does the motor have ?
A : 480 foot pounds of torque .
The motor is manufactured by UQM Technologies .
Q : What is the capacity of the batteries allowing a range of 100+ miles ?
A : It is a 35 kWh NanoSafeâ „ ¢ battery pack .
Q : What is the voltage of your modules and the 35kWh packs ?
A : 12V and 420V respectively .
Q : Doesnâ€™t a 10 - minute charge cause a neighborhood black out ?
A : The grid is quite capable of taking this load .
The key is a power refill pump and we are working with infrastructure suppliers to achieve a distributed network .
Also , remember the NanoSafeâ „ ¢ batteries can also be trickle charged either in your garage at night or at work .
It 's Up to Your Readiness
It is up to you whether you are able to benefit from the beyond - dualistic teachings of the Diamond Way or not .
You must have some intuitive trust in space and its perfect and limitless qualities .
Furthermore , you must find a teacher you feel you can trust , and you have to be ready to open up to the transmission .
Morpheus : I do n't know if you are ready to see what I want to show you .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
One 's readiness to not block out painful teachings concerning one 's own situation , such as those of cause and effect , means that doubts will fall away in droves .
From this point on , life only becomes more meaningful . [---]
One needs neither to die to inhabit a pure land nor to go somewhere else to meet Buddhas ; perfecting one 's view is enough .
What one needs is a readiness to see ever more clearly what really is supported by the intelligent determination to remove the veils of disturbing feelings and ignorance from mind .
Soon the realization dawns that everything has ultimate meaning simply because it happens or does n't happen and that every thought is wisdom simply because it can appear .
With the deepest of thankfulness , one realizes that every particle vibrates with happiness and is kept together by love .
— The Great Seal The Secret Transmission Especially higher practices are self - secret and only become relevant when their foundation has been accomplished in this or an earlier life .
Oracle :
You 've got the gift but it looks like you are waiting for something .
Neo :
What ?
Oracle :
Your next life maybe , who knows ?
That 's the way these things go .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Higher practices are [...] self - secret and only become relevant when their foundation has been accomplished in this or an earlier life .
— The Way Things Are
The Conditioned Existence Due to the mind 's ignorance of its true nature , all sentient beings are caught in the conditioned existence .
Morpheus :
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes , to blind you from the truth .
Neo :
What truth ?
Morpheus :
That you are a slave , Neo .
Like everyone else , you were born into bondage , born into a prison that you cannot smell , or taste , or touch ... a prison for your mind .
Agent Smith : I must get free , and in this mind is the key , my key .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Conditioned existence or confusion arises because unenlightened mind works like an eye ; it sees only the outer world and not itself .
As the experiencer does not recognize itself behind the experiences , one then has no center , charges after one ’s passing impressions , assumes subjective experience to be real , and in the end suffers because everything is impermanent .
It produces life 's vast cattle market where everyone is searching for something but nobody is ultimately satisfied .
Birth , old age , sickness , loss , and death are the most classic concerns of humans ; but they also try to get what they want , avoid what they do not like , hold onto what they have and make do with whatever they cannot avoid . [---]
The tricky point with disturbing emotions is that for a long time one considers their transient plays to be real and acts upon them .
This is the case right up until liberation .
If not purified , the unwholesome seeds they sow in body , speech , and mind will later bring about outer and inner difficulties .
When they do appear — and they will if not removed by meditation or other conscious means — one will not recognize their unreal nature .
Once again one will act from a state of delusion .
One will harm others or oneself through clumsy words and actions and will lack the power to break out of the conditioned cycle .
— The Great Seal The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
Self - manifestation , which has never existed as such , is erroneously seen as an object .
Through ignorance , self - awareness is mistakenly experienced as an I .
Through attachment to this duality we are caught in the conditioned world .
May the root of confusion be found .
[---]
The nature of beings is always Buddha .
Yet , not realizing this , they wander in the endless cycle of conditioned existence .
May the limitless pain of all beings awaken an overwhelming compassion in our minds .
— Great Seal Wishes Tilopa :
The fool in his ignorance , disdaining Mahamudra ,
Knows nothing but struggle in the flood of samsara .
Have compassion for those who suffer constant anxiety !
Sick of unrelenting pain and desiring release , adhere to a master ,
For when his blessing touches your heart , the mind is liberated .
— Tilopa 's Mahamudra Instructions to Naropa Ignorance
In their ignorance of mind 's true nature , beings seek happiness in conditioned things , but since everything composite will eventually fall apart , these sources of happiness are not lasting .
Cypher :
You know , I know this steak does n't exist .
I know that when I put it in my mouth , the Matrix is telling my brain ... that it is juicy ... and delicious .
After nine years , you know what I realize ?
Ignorance is bliss .
Agent Smith :
Then we have a deal ?
Cypher : I do n't want to remember nothing .
Nothing .
You understand ?
And I wanna be rich ... you know , someone important .
Like an actor .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
As beyond - personal awareness shines ever stronger , it becomes painfully evident how all beings chase joy and try to avoid suffering but usually seek their bliss in conditioned situations where no lasting happiness can be found .
Realizing how strongly all are hostage to them , one will naturally protect them .
— The Way Things Are Attachment
The problem is that the karmic habitual energies of beings are of a sticky quality , and therefore the mind has trouble letting go .
The mind 's tendency to cling to its constantly changing impressions leads to clumsy words and actions .
The feedback from one 's store - consciousness and the outer world then produces more unpleasant experiences , which strengthen one 's tendency towards further unskillful acts .
In this viscous cycle , beings have no freedom to choose what they wish to experience .
Morpheus :
The mind has trouble letting go .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
What especially hinders us is the mind 's tendency to cling to its constantly changing impressions .
For example , though we may not have experienced any anger five minutes earlier , and it will most likely be gone five minutes later , our mind still treats the feeling as if it were substantial and real .
It then acts on this basis , setting things in motion in outer world as well as planting seeds in its store - consciousness , which will bring about suffering in the future .
This cycle , which is largely out of one 's control , is the normal state of most beings ; people are not free to choose what they wish to experience .
— Ngöndro : The Four Foundational Practices of Tibetan Buddhism Lama Ole Nydahl : Mind will remain attached to what is actually its own free play until it recognizes itself to be unborn clear light .

But I can only show you the door .
You 're the one that has to walk through it .

Sharmar Rinpoche : The Buddha said that he can show the way , but it is through personal efforts alone that enlightenment is attained .
— The Three Main Approaches in Buddhism : An introduction Khenpo Chodrak Rinpoche : Tilopa brought a snake and he tied a knot in the snake and put in on the ground .
On its own the snake untied the knot .
He asked Naropa , what he understood .
Naropa answered he understood it to mean that , even though our mind is the Dharmakaya , the Truth body itself , it is tied up through the illusion of the perceiving mind and the perceived object as being different .
By the mind untying itself , it is possible to be liberated from this impure concept .
In fact , that is the only way to do it .
It can not be done from the outside .
It has to be done by the mind itself .
— The Lifestory of Naropa ( Part II ) Lama Ole Nydahl : The Buddha 's goal , then , is to enable us to know that freedom which we 've always had , to help beings experience the open , clear , unobstructed nature of mind .
— Ngöndro : The Four Preliminary Practices of Tibetan Buddhism A Critical Analysis of the Situation
If we want to apply the appropriate remedy for our maladies , we need to start from a critical analysis of our current situation .
Neo : Shit !
Morpheus : Yes .
Jigmela Rinpoche :
We need to be aware and gain understanding of our situation .
We will then be able to apply the appropriate remedy for our maladies .
— Jigmela Rinpoche : Architect of One's Life Lama Ole Nydahl : Every development in Buddhism starts from a critical analysis of the current situation .
This allows one to understand in an unshakeable way that the present moment offers the most precious and amazingly rare conditions and that one can actually steer one 's life consciously towards liberation and enlightenment .
These insights are generally known as the ' Four Basic Thoughts . '
— Introduction to Mahamudra Lama Ole Nydahl : Always , we start by examining our situation .
Here we discover four important things :
That this life offers the precious conditions for practicing and becoming enlightened for the benefit of all .
That we should use the chance now .
We do n't know how long we will live , and only the mind will always remain .
That cause and effect function .
That everything we do , think and say will become our future .
And finally , why meditate : Enlightenment is highest , unceasing joy , and we can do little for others while confused ourselves .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom
The Precious Human Life First , we recognize our precious opportunity in this life , that we can benefit countless beings through the methods of a Buddha .
Few people ever meet beyond - dualistic teachings and even fewer are able to use them .
Morpheus :
What you see ?
Businessmen , teachers , lawyers , carpenters ...
The very minds of the people we are trying to save . [---]
You have to understand , most of these people are not ready to be unplugged .
And many of them are so inured , so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Even in the rich , free , and educated countries , which offer the opportunity , people 's priorities are mostly immature .
Few seek anything ultimate , and it is considered one 's best investment to spend twenty years from the age of six at schools and universities .
Unfortunately , is does n't guarantee happiness ; and earning more money during the following thirty to forty years helps nobody beyond the grave .
Only a tiny fraction of the brightest people pick up the scent of the strongest and only lasting fulfillment , which has been inherent in all beings since beginningless time : the experience of mind .
The conscious use of such conditions to find values that give meaning through old age , sickness , death and rebirth is what makes a life precious .
— The Great Seal Meditation on the 16th Karmapa :
We recognize our precious opportunity in this life , that we can benefit countless beings through the methods of a Buddha .
Few people ever meet Diamond Way teachings and even fewer are able to use them .
Gampopa :
It is extremely deluded to try to tame the minds of other incorrigible and childish people rather than taming your own entrenched habit of delusion .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path Impermanence Secondly , we remember the impermanence of everything composite .
Only the unlimited clear space of mind is lasting and it is uncertain how long conditions will remain for recognizing it .
Therefore , we have no time to waste .
We have to practice right now !
Morpheus :
We do n't have time , Neo .
Morpheus :
Time is always against us .
Gampopa :
At first , you have to acknowledge that you have no time to waste , like someone who has been hit in the chest by an arrow .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path The 9th Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje :
The universe and all its inhabitants are impermanent .
In particular , the lives of beings are like bubbles of water .
The moment of death is uncertain and our body will become a corpse .
At this time only the Dharma can help us and therefore we must make every effort to use it now .
Lopön Tsechu Rinpoche :
How we live this life is what decides how we will manage in the bardos [ i.e. intermediate states ] which follow after we die .
Right now it is in our hands , right now we have the chance , the freedom , the possibility to learn and practice .
If we do it now , we will know what to do when we die .
But if we do n't use our life now , then we wo n't manage at the time of death ; it will be too late .
We cannot suddenly at that time start to ask what we should do and start practicing .
It will be too late .
We will be too confused and will not be able to manage .
Guru Rinpoche explained : " If one now thinks that one has enough time and that dharma practice belongs to the time of death , that one can learn it later when one is about to die , then one is wrong .
When death approaches , it is too late .
At that time there is no way to learn what we need to know . "
— Bardo Teachings : The Bardo of Life Lama Ole Nydahl : Time is our only enemy .
( For explanation , see Lama Ole 's travel plan . )
Causality
Thirdly , we understand causality , that it is up to us what will happen .
Former thoughts , words and actions became our present state and right now we are sowing the seeds for our future .
Morpheus :
Do you believe in fate , Neo ?
Neo : No .
Morpheus :
Why not ?
Neo : Because I do n't like the idea that I 'm not in control of my life .
Oracle :
You 'll remember you do n't believe in any of this fate crap .
You 're in control of your own life , remember ?
Lama Ole Nydahl : Karma means cause and effect , not fate .
The understanding that each of us is responsible for our own lives makes it possible to consciously generate positive impressions which bring happiness while avoiding the causes of future suffering .
Positive states of mind may be effectively strengthened through the methods of the Diamond Way , while negative impressions waiting to mature , can be transformed into wisdom .
— What is karma ?
The 9th Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje :
At the time of death we have no control over what happens , but will experience the results of our previous actions .
Therefore we should give up negative actions , devote all our time to positive actions and watch our minds every day .
What Is Important Finally , we have to be aware of what is really important and what is not .
Attachment to impermanent things such as friends , pleasures , places , possessions , ideas , or one 's body , eventually leads to suffering , while realizing mind 's true nature is timeless highest bliss , and we cannot benefit others while confused or disturbed ourselves .
Rhineheart :
The time has come to make a choice , Mr. Anderson .
Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth , or you choose to find yourself another job .
Lopön Tsechu Rinpoche :
We need to practice Dharma as much as we can , trying not to spend all our energy on worldly activities that yield no lasting results anyway .
We need to find some kind of balance since we have a lot to do , but we should not do more than is necessary . [...]
We need to remember what is really important and what is not .
Then we will put our energy into what is really important , and we will not become entangled in what is not .
True significance of this is to give up our attachment to this life .
— Bardo Teachings : The Bardo of Dying Gampopa :
This fleeting human life , already short in this dark age , is wasted when spent on pointless activities .
[---]
It is extremely deluded to struggle with endless worldly affairs as though you were going to live forever , instead of being carefree concerning the temporary events of this life . [---]
It is extremely deluded to let your life run out in petty pursuits , chasing this and that , rather than familiarizing yourself with realization of the natural state . [---]
It is extremely deluded to pursue ambitions of grandeur in this life , rather than cultivating the experience and realization you have already glimpsed .
[---]
Understand that many engagements are obstacles for merit because they hinder spiritual practice .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path The 9th Karmapa : Everything we experience in conditioned existence , including our friends , pleasures and possessions , always contain the three kinds of suffering — just like the last meal prepared for somebody who is going to be executed .
Therefore we should cut through attachment and joyfully strive for enlightenment .
S witch :
We do n't have time for twenty questions .
Right now , there 's only one rule :
Our way ... or the highway .
Neo : Fine .
Trinity : Please Neo , you have to trust me .
Neo :
Why ?
Trinity :
Because you have been down there , Neo .
You know that road .
You know exactly where it ends .
And I know that 's not where you want to be .
The Direct Experience
If we want to realize the true nature of mind , it is important not to mistake intellectual knowledge for the direct experience .
Oracle : Being the One is like being in love .
No -one can tell you 're in love .
You just know it , through and through , balls to bone .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Many give marvelous explanations on the Mahamudra .
If you ask them how it feels , however , they have little to say .
Their intellectual studies did n't tell them that .
Actually , is is the most powerful and total of experiences .
It is not being able to rationalize a lot of things , but the most intense joy , courage and love — like holding our fingers in the main socket and pulling the town 's electricity through our bones . [---]
Nothing goes beyond the vibrant energy of direct experience ; that is what makes love and excitement so wonderful .
Here we forget separation , concepts , past and future , and experience the naked power of mind .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom Lama Ole Nydahl :
If you visit monasteries or libraries which contain the Tibetan Kanjur , you will probably find the teachings arranged in four groups of 21,000 each depending on their content .
One group is called Vinaya and works with attachment .
It contains especially the rules for monks and nuns , and aims to help people not get caught up in the world .
The Sutra part changes anger and ill - will , and the Abhidharma transforms confusion and unclear thinking .
Obtaining these three teachings is like going to school , and only gradually does the information move from head to heart and change us .
The fourth group is different : it 's like riding a fast motorcycle or falling deeply in love .
It is called Vajrayana or Diamond Way .
— Teachings on the Nature of Mind Being an Example to Others
You can't tell by the outer appearance whether someone has that experience or not .
And yet , only those who are authentic holders of the transmission , of the living stream of experience , can fully convince others through their example .
Tank : I knew it !
He 's the One ... Lama Ole Nydahl : However satisfying a deep intellectual knowledge of Buddha 's teaching may be , only those who realize mind on the level of experience — and retain its freshness and bliss in the marrow of their bones — can fully convince others through their example .
— The Great Seal Lopön Tsechu Rinpoche :
When the dharma was still flourishing in India , there were great masters like Garab Dorje or Shri Singha .
At this time , the human beings practiced the three Yogas very seriously and achieved results , many becoming realized and dissolving into rainbows . [---]
The human beings around them did not know that they were great masters because they practiced in secret and therefore were not famous . [---]
The twenty four main students of Guru Rinpoche , and in later times others who were serious practitioners , did not make a show of their practice and meditated a lot with corresponding results .
— The Intermediate States : The Bardo of Clear Light Taking
It into Heart
It is meaningless to have intellectual knowledge of the nature of mind , if you do n't take it into your heart through meditation and put it into practice .
Morpheus :
There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path .
Gampopa :
Having prepared your mind through learning and reflection , do n't use it embrace mere platitudes , but train in the meaning of what you understand .
[---]
A spiritual practitioner is in error when he comprehends the meaning and still does n't put it into practice .
[---]
Like a parrot reciting verses , it is meaningless to have a tongue expert in Dharma terms that are not taken to heart . [---]
Like a doctor struck by an incurable disease , it is meaningless to have studied a lot and yet remain a shallow person .
Like a rich man without the key to his treasury , it is meaningless to be learned in the oral instructions but not to apply them in practice .
Like the blind leading the blind , it is meaningless to teach others the significance of a spiritual practice you have n't realized yourself .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path Lama Ole Nydahl :
Even the wisest and most convincing thought are like bubbles in the air when we die ; they can not help us .
On the other hand , strong dharmic habits influencing our totality will not only help us in this life , but also at and after death .
— Ngöndro : The Four Foundational Practices of Tibetan Buddhism Beyond All Concepts
The ultimate nature of mind is beyond all concepts , and cannot be conveyed by words .
Morpheus : Unfortunately , no one can be told what the Matrix is .
You have to see it for yourself .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
The mind is not a thing , but it manifests all things .
The closer we come to the ultimate insight , the less precise are words .
They can only express concepts while the experience of mind is all - knowingness and timeless ecstasy .
The certainty that this is so is what sets us on the way and makes everything possible .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
May we find certainty in the ultimate true meaning .
One cannot prove it by saying " it is this " .
One cannot deny it by saying " it is not that " .
Truth - nature , beyond concepts , is non-composite .
— Great Seal Wishes Skillful Use of Concepts
However , that is not to say that intellectual understanding is totally without importance .
It can be used as a springboard to deeper , more intuitive experience .
Agent Smith :
And tell me , Mr. Anderson , what good is a phone call ... if you are unable to speak .
Kalu Rinpoche :
We need to remember that when we that when we are using these terms , we are attempting to describe something that is indescribable .
However , that does not mean that it cannot be directly experienced .
The person who is mute is still able to experience the sweetness of sugar without being able to describe it to anyone else .
Just as the mute person has trouble describing the taste of sugar , we have trouble describing the nature of mind , but we try our best .
We search for examples and metaphors that will give us some idea of what is being experienced .
— Mahamudra Free from Extremes
The extreme views of a permanent reality and of nihilism only lead to suffering .
The true nature of phenomena is free from all extremes .
Agent Smith : I believe that , as a species , human beings define their reality through misery and suffering .
Nagarjuna : Believing in existence is the view of eternalism .
Believing in nonexistence is the view of nihilism .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
All buddhist methods aim at this total experience of awareness and phenomena which lies beyond concepts .
They remove the roots of expectations and fear , making one centered and strong .
The importance of such a teaching cannot be overestimated as it is people 's values that steer the world .
Still today , neither the views of eternalism nor nihilism have ever managed to satisfy their advocates .
If during some point in history a culture decided to see everything as real , it at first brought about a great deal of expansion and many direct experiences .
This view however also made suffering more real , as the facts of old age , sickness , and death were still inescapable .
In some more educated situations where the opposite view was chosen , stating that nothing has any reality , then every experience appeared gray .
One was then without any joyful tools to handle the outer and inner worlds , while suffering was still present .
— The Great Seal Lama Ole Nydahl :
If things truly exist , also illness , old age and death are real .
So is ultimate suffering and loss .
The other extreme , nihilism , also does n't hold , and in two ways .
On the inner level all things lose their fun and freshness , and on the outer nothing functions if we do n't honor cause and effect . [---]
As always , the Buddha has the answer : Everything outer and inner is like a dream .
It arises , changes and dissolves again .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom Emptiness
Since body , thoughts , and feelings are in a constant state of flux , they are unable to provide a basis for a real existing ego .
On the relative level , all outer and inner events arise , change , and cease interdependently and are thus empty of independent existence .
Agent Smith :
You are empty .
Neo :
So are you .
Kalu Rinpoche : All conditioned lives , all conditioned phenomena , result from a multiplicity of interactions which belong to the twelve links of dependent origination .
[---]
The empty nature of what exists at the relative level is what we call ultimate truth . [---]
When you completely understand dependent arising , you also understand emptiness .
And that is freedom . [---]
The correct understanding of emptiness lies between the two extremes of eternalism ( believing things to be inherently or truly existing ) and nihilism ( believing them not to exist at all ) .
— Luminous Mind : The Way of the Buddha Manfred Seegres :
At the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma , Buddha taught how to accumulate merit , how to give up negative actions , etc. , in order to attain liberation .
In this context he talked about existence in such a way as if karma would truly exist .
If one does a certain kind of action , accordingly one will experience a certain kind of result .
At the second turning , he explained the emptiness of all phenomena in order for beings to overcome the attachment towards true existence .
Here he spoke about non-existence , the fact that all phenomena only arise interdependently and at the same time are empty by nature .
In order to avoid people falling into the extremes of either existence or non-existence , he gave the third turning of the Wheel of Dharma .
Here he explained the ultimate meaning , free from all extremes , the primordial wisdom beyond concepts .
— Buddhist Terms Gampopa :
The ultimate Buddhahood is Dharmakaya , Dharmakaya is all - pervading emptiness , and emptiness pervades all sentient beings .
Therefore , all sentient beings are of the Buddha - nature .
— The Jewel Ornament of Liberation Unborn , Uncreated
On the absolute level , one realizes that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence and thus ultimately unborn .
Choi :
This never happened .
You do n't exist .
Gampopa :
Fully realizing that phenomena are without any inherent existence is the practice of the supreme perfection of wisdom awareness .
[---]
That which is called wisdom awareness has been thoroughly explained as coming from the realization of the emptiness of inherent existence , which is the realization that aggregates , constituent elements , and sources are without birth .
[---]
The realization that all phenomena are unborn — that is the perfection of wisdom awareness .
— The Jewel Ornament of Liberation Lama Ole Nydahl : A detailed examination of phenomena shows that they do not exist independently and that they have no lasting nature .
This does not only relate to one ’s own perception , which clearly appears , changes , and disappears .
But it is equally valid , although less easily noticed , for the outer world which one shares with others .
— The Great Seal Shamar Rinpoche :
So what is the world ?
The Buddha taught that it is made up of interdependent relationships .
One thing is based on another thing , which is itself dependent on something else .
Nothing can be said to truly exist , because for something to exist it must be self - contained and independent phenomenon .
There is therefore no point in searching for the cause of the world , because it has no existence of its own .
— A Change of Expression The World as a Dream Both inner and outer phenomena are like the appearances in a dream .
Being inseparable from mind , they appear and develop in its space , are known through its clarity - awareness , and disappear again in its unlimited essence .
One cannot say they are really existent , nor can one say they are non-existent .
They are not both existent and non-existent , nor are they something else .
Neo :
Have you ever had that feeling where you 're not sure you 're awake or still dreaming ?
Morpheus :
Have you ever had a dream , Neo , that you were so sure was real ?
What if you were unable to wake from that dream ?
How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world ?
Morpheus :
You 've been living in a dream world , Neo .
Neo :
This ... this is n't real ?
Morpheus :
What is real ?
How do you define real ?
Maitripa : Phenomena are like a dream , empty of true nature .
Lopön Tsechu Rinpoche :
The most useful and most meaningful practice we can do is to understand that this life is only an illusion .
Everything is like in a dream with no independent reality .
To thus develop some understanding of Mahamudra is truly very important .
— The Intermediate States : The Bardo of Becoming Gendyn Rinpoche :
It also helps to remember that the world we know is a world of illusion .
It is a vision , a visible appearance that is the expression of confusion .
Everything we perceive as the world around us , including ourselves , is only the product of all the tendencies associated with the five disturbing emotions .
Dreams have exactly the same nature and in fact , the world and dreams are the same source of illusions or confused manifestation .
The dream does n't really exist , it is neither permanent nor real , and it can disappear at any time .
If we believe that the dream is real , if we are attached to the idea that it is something that is really happening , we are tempted to manipulate what happens in the dream .
We might want to obtain something , want to be happy , or want to avoid suffering .
This is how we create suffering in the dream state .
It is exactly the same in the case of waking world .
If we recognize that it is only the natural expression of our past actions , we free ourselves of any attachment to the reality of the world .
The experience we encounter while awake is called the Bardo of Birth and of Existence , an intermediate and temporary state made up of all the experiences of our life while awake .
If we can purify our attachment to the reality of this world , we then have the possibility of detaching ourselves from the experiences met in the bardo of the dream .
This training prepares us for the experience of death and everything that happens afterward when our consciousness moves toward the next rebirth .
This training can free us from the experience of rebirth and can open us to perfect awakening .
Discussing the meaning of the content of dreams is a waste of time since they are unreal .
— The World as a Dream Lama Ole Nydahl :
Therefore , knowledge about mind 's absolute and relative nature is essential .
We need to understand that every experience is like a individual dream inside a collective one and only the experiencer really exists .
— Kagyü Practice Your Mind Makes
It Real
What an unenlightened mind experiences as solid reality is actually a magical display of superficial appearances arising out of latent karmic imprints .
While adopting the view that this life is only an illusion , it is , however , essential to remain aware of the relative interplay of cause and effect .
Neo : I thought it was n't real .
Morpheus :
Your mind makes it real .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
While the outer frame or world condenses from the collective consciousness of beings , their individual karmas manifest as their experiences , bodies , environments , and tendencies .
Therefore , the teaching that everything is mind is a central pillar of Buddhism .
Not only are one ’s filtered experiences of the world mind , but the world itself is mind . [---]
Due to basic ignorance , mind ’s continuous activity , which manifests outwardly as worlds and situations , is experienced as real and existent .
— The Great Seal Thrangu Rinpohce :
Even though there is nothing that inherently exists , things do obviously appear .
Wee see a car and we open the door and climb in and drive along the highway .
A vast variety of appearances do appear and do have an effect on us .
We would n't , for example , deliberately drive our car into a wall .
These appearances are part of relative or conventional reality and they appear to mind because mind has luminosity .
When this luminous aspect of mind which is knowing awareness is impure , we have consciousnesses .
When this luminosity is pure , we have wisdom . [---]
Why is it that we are not always happy ?
It is that through countless lifetimes we have become thoroughly habituated to the false belief or delusion that external appearances are inherently existent or " real " and and are distinctly separate from our mind .
— Transcending Ego : Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom Tsele Natsok Rangdröl :
Tendencies of all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana remain in this all - ground in the manner of seeds .
The various objects of gross materiality and the pure and impure parts of nadi , prana , and bindu of the inner body , as well as all the various phenomena of samsara and nirvana , the worlds and beings of the three realms , appear externally in an interdependent manner .
All of these , however , like objects appearing in a dream , are a magical display of superficial appearances , which do not actually exist .
Growing more and more used to fixating on them as being permanent , solidifying and clinging to them as being real , you experience the various kinds of pleasure , pain and indifference of three realms and six classes of beings .
You spin perpetually through the causes and effects of samsara as though on the rim of a water wheel .
— The Lamp of Mahamudra The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
All phenomena are manifestations of mind . [---]
Observing phenomena , none is found .
One sees mind .
— Great Seal Wishes Gampopa :
You need to avoid letting phenomena stray into concrete materiality by means of discriminating knowledge and understanding .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path No Mind Can Be Found
All phenomena are manifestations of mind , and yet , looking for mind , no mind is seen .
The mind is empty of any limiting characteristics such as size , color , weight , form , taste , or voltage .
In fact , no own , separate mind can be found !
Since mind is non-composite , it can not fall apart .
Being unborn , it can not die or disappear .
Morpheus :
You were born into [...] a prison that you cannot smell , or taste , or touch .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Looking for mind , that also can not be found .
It has no size , color , weight , form , taste , or voltage .
It is also not composed of some ' subtle ' material , as those with little confidence in space would like to imagine .
Mind possesses no characteristic through which it can be substantiated .
In essence it is empty and not a thing .
The fact that consciousness is inherent in this space , which non-meditators may also suspect during moments of sudden inspiration , is mind 's truth - state .
— The Great Seal Lama Ole Nydahl : Mind cannot be established as being material ; it can not be experienced as a something .
In north India 2550 years ago , the young prince Siddharta Gautama reached enlightenment by recognizing that no own , separate mind can be found .
Thus any obstacles through ignorance or disturbing feelings like expectation , fear , attachment , and aversion simply fell away ; and the unhindered unfolding of his mind made him a Buddha .
As any investigation shows mind to be without weight , form , color , taste , or size , Buddha described it as being essentially ' empty ' — i.e. , empty of any such characteristics .
— The Great Seal Kalu Rinpoche : However exhaustive our investigations , we will never be able to find any formal characteristics of mind : it has neither dimension , color , form , no any tangible quality .
It is in this sense that it is called open , because it is essentially indeterminate , unqualifiable , beyond concept , and thus comparable to space . [---]
But we must be careful here !
Because to say mind is open like space is not reduce it something nonexistent in the sense of being nonfunctional .
Like space , pure mind cannot be located , but is omnipresent and all - penetrating ; it embraces and pervades all things .
Moreover , it is beyond change , and its open nature is indestructible and atemporal .
— The Luminous Mind —
The Way of the Buddha Lama Ole Nydahl : Mind can not be found because it is not a thing .
No part of it can be made visible or examined .
As it is without size , weight or color , without middle and in every way empty of anything limiting , it also cannot observe itself from somewhere else .
What sees and what is seen — both are mind .
— The Great Seal The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
Mind is not ' a ' mind ; it is empty in essence .
Although empty , all things arise in every way without hindrance .
— Great Seal Wishes Mind's Limitless Potential
While mind is empty in its essence , at the same time it is the basis of everything .
It is r ich in nature , clear , and conscious .
All sentient beings are pervaded by this omniscient union of clarity and space , the buddha - nature .
What keeps beings from experiencing this unborn clear light of mind are the transitory impurities which cloud their minds .
Rhineheart :
Do I make myself clear ?
Neo : Yes , Mr. Rhineheart .
Tilopa :
The darkness of a thousand aeons is powerless
To dim the crystal clarity of the sun 's heart ;
And likewise , aeons of samsara have no power
To veil the clear light of the mind 's essence .
— Tilopa 's Mahamudra Instructions to Naropa The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
The basis of purification is mind itself , its union of clarity and emptiness .
The method of purification is the Great Seal , the diamond - like practice .
The object of purification is the fleeting illusory impurities .
May we accomplish the fruit of purification , the perfectly pure state of truth .
— Great Seal Wishes Tsele Natsok Rangdröl :
This mind - essence devoid of ground and root is the basis of all phenomena .
This essence is not something that exists within the mind - stream of just one individual person or just one buddha .
It is the actual basis of all that appears and exists , the whole samsara and nirvana . [---]
This all - ground , not a mere nihilistic and void nothingness , is self - luminous cognizance that occurs unceasingly .
— The Lamp of Mahamudra Lama Ole Nydahl :
Thus in its essence mind is empty , no thing ; but at the same time it is rich in nature , clear , and conscious .
If it were not basically pure , then how could one clean it ?
Washing a piece of coal would simply make it smaller .
However , the same process applied to a diamond makes it shine ever more .
Like an effective detergent , the Foundational Practices and other Diamond Way methods will also discolor the washwater for a while .
Then however , it will show clearly that mind ’s final state is indestructible and radiant , like this king of stones . [...]
It is [...] neither necessary to die in order to experience a pure land nor to go elsewhere to meet Buddhas ; purifying one 's mind and keeping maximum consciousness is enough . [---]
And just why is it that mind 's clarity can have its timeless veils removed ?
Because the liberating power of the Great Seal is so convincing .
— The Great Seal Lama Ole Nydahl : Full clarity appears when the emptiness of all things inner and outer has been realized .
Then past , present and future are simultaneously there .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom The Mind - Body
To purify one 's mind , one needs to remove the veils of disturbing emotions and stiff ideas .
One stiff idea to be dissolved is the materialistic belief that the mind is produced by the body .
Since nothing , such as indivisible atoms and so on , really exist externally , no material objects , to say nothing of mind , can ultimately emerge from them .
On the relative level , one should understand that mind is not produced by the impermanent brain but transformed by it .
Morpheus :
The body cannot live without the mind .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
Few have the necessary basis for even starting on a path — which is the certainty that they possess a mind and can work with it to obtain lasting results .
Today this means understanding that mind is not produced by the impermanent brain but transformed by it ; that its stream of information moves since beginningless time from one conditioned existence to the next , picking up the experiences which mature as one 's next life ... that this goes on until one recognizes the mirror behind the pictures , mind 's unconditioned state .
The veils covering one 's consciousness exist since beginningless time and are no weak opponent .
Even with the strongest of blessing and meditations , their removal must happen step by step .
— The Way Things Are Lama Ole Nydahl :
If the brain is understood as not producing but transforming mind ; as the radio and not the radio station , many parapsychological phenomena would be understandable .
On the relative level , beings ' minds would then be programs of conditioned experiences held together by the illusion of being a separate self like the streams in an ocean and working through certain nervous systems and bodies until they die .
Due to the lack of sense - impressions , mind 's dominant subconscious imprints will then surface , bringing it into new lives and environments and this beginningless process continues until mind recognizes its absolute state , the ocean where the streams appear , play around , are known , and disappear again .
— Reply to an article of Washington Post , published on June 18th , 2001 Lopön Tsechu Rinpoche :
The moment when the consciousness leaves the body is very crucial .
We can only maintain control if we have been practicing well in this life .
If we have developed a very stable practice and have achieved some understanding , we will manage to keep the mind under control .
Otherwise , this moment will be very painful ; most people suffer immensely .
— Bardo Teachings : The Bardo of Dying D ozer :
It 's a single celled protein combined with synthetic aminos , vitamins , and minerals .
Everything the body needs .
Mouse :
It does n't have everything the body needs .
Kalu Rinpoche : Tied in with the conception process , then , is not only the sperm from the father and the egg cell from the mother joining together to create a physical basis ; there is also the consciousness of the bardo being , in its disembodied state , as an involved third element .
There are thus two physical elements and one mental element that come together for the complete conception of the human individual .
— Eye of the Storm : Teachings of Bardos of Death and Dying The Totality One should understand that everything is part of the same totality .
Rhineheart : Every single employee understands that they are part of a whole .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Space is much more than a black hole or a nothingness .
Often one knows who is calling before one hears the voice on the phone .
Often letters arrive from people whom one has recently thought strongly about .
This is not due to improved eye - sight or hearing , but to moments where we forget about being separated from the totality .
When we are simply there , naked , open and resting in whatever is happening , things happen .
During such moments we not only experience through our senses but through the vibration of every atom in our body .
Because space and energy inside and out , are expressions of the same totality , and cannot be separated , we are always connected with everything .
In Buddhism this is called the ' state of truth '...
It means that everything is part of the same totality .
On another level it expresses that space is like a container — that we are inside it ...
It is very important to see space as something which connects beings and is alive , as a container which also conveys information between beings .
However , space has more to it than awareness , and that is what makes it interesting ; it is joyful by nature .
The radiance of mind itself is much richer than the conditioned experiences of joy we all strive for .
The best moments in life are actually gifts and appear when beings forget themselves .
There are situations where feelings of separation disappear , like being in the arms of our loved ones — the timeless moment of ' being one ' .
Here mind 's innate , timeless joy can manifest , and it will become permanent when one stays beyond hope and fear in the richness of immediate experience .
This state is inseparable from space , expresses its limitless qualities and is most convincing .
Highest joy is thus inseparable from mind 's spontaneous insight and is a transmission of wisdom .
It is mentally joyful ; it is the basis of everything outer and inner and may even recognize itself through the process .
Finally , because space is unlimited , it expresses itself as love ...
When subject , object and experience are a totality and one cannot separate one 's own wishes for happiness from the wishes of others , one is in the absolute state .
Observing the world , this feels exceedingly natural .
There can be no doubt that all beings want to have happiness and avoid suffering .
This full unfolding of mind is prepared by the Great Way or Mahayana Buddhism and obtained quickly through the countless skillful methods of the Diamond Way ...
In the Karma Kagyu lineage , which I represent , the mirror and its radiance are never separated .
Space and bliss are understood as one .
What looks through one 's eyes and listens trough one 's ears is clear light .
It is nothing exterior .
However , it is not a shiny light like from a projector .
Instead , it is a constant state of freshness , an exciting here and now , and momentary insights appear in direct connection with the experience itself ...
This is true joy and the goal .
— Happiness There Is No Separation
So , there is no real separation between subject , object and action .
They arise interdependently and are all part of the same totality .
Spoon boy :
Do not try and bend the spoon .
That 's impossible .
Instead ... only try to realize the truth .
Neo :
What truth ?
Spoon boy :
There is no spoon .
Neo :
There is no spoon ?
Spoon boy :
Then you 'll see , that it is not the spoon that bends , it is only yourself .
3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
Through the examination of external objects we see the mind , not the objects .
Through the examination of the mind we see its empty essence , but not the mind .
Through the examination of both , attachment to duality disappears by itself .
May the clear light , the true essence of mind , be recognized .
— Wishing Prayer for the Attainment of the Ultimate Mahamudra Lama Ole Nydahl :
The highest teaching known as Chag Chen or Dzogchen , as Mahamudra or Maha Ati , allows us to open to the experience of total non-separation between subject , object and action .
— What is Buddhism ?
Gampopa :
To realize that the viewer , the viewed , and the realization are indivisible is the correct view for the person of highest capacity .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path Dissolving Stiff Ideas
When one fully realizes the illusory , dream - like nature of the present outer world , one is no longer at its mercy .
Morpheus : How did I beat you ?
Neo : You ... you 're too fast .
Morpheus :
Do you believe that my being stronger , or faster , has anything to do with my muscles in this place ?
You think that 's air you are breathing now ?
[ From the movie script of the Matrix : If you can free your mind , the body will follow . ]
A story from the life of Gampopa :
Once Rukom asked , " When one achieves the state of one taste , do body , mind and appearance become one ? "
Gampopa demonstrated by waving his hand through a pillar , and replied , " Just as there are no obstructions when one moves one 's hand in space , so , body , mind , and appearance become one . "
— The Life of Gampopa Meditation on the 16th Karmapa : Disturbing feelings and stiff ideas dissolve and our mind becomes spontaneous joy .
It is space and bliss inseparable .
N eo :
What are you trying to tell me ?
That I can dodge bullets ?
Morpheus : No , Neo .
I 'm trying to tell you that when you 're ready , you wo n't have to .
Gampopa :
Once you recognize that sights and sounds are magical illusions , you do n't need to accept or reject .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path
Manipulating the Illusion A realized yogi may manipulate this world of illusion , if that makes someone to be interested in discovering the true nature of his or her mind .
Rhineheart :
You believe that you 're special , that somehow the rules do n't apply to you .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
The realm of unusual occurrences may in fact be much closer than people usually assume when they are busily caught up in their stressful lives .
Whoever recognizes this from a healthy state of mind is usually already very bright and experiences a great deal of happy excitement in life . [---]
As mind and the world evidently influence one another and seem to be in essence inseparable , one should obtain for oneself a relaxed relationship to this sort of phenomenon at an early stage .
As they will anyway tug at one 's mind stream ever more frequently in the course of one 's development , it is useful to understand just what an openness to mind 's beyond - materialistic potential entails . [---]
One first succeeds in recognizing that one 's own experiences are impermanent and change like dreams whether they happen during the day or at night .
Then , one can take the next step and focus on the condensed karmic dream that is the present outer world of one 's senses .
As it consists of constantly shifting conditions , it is also not real and one is therefore not at its mercy .
It can be worked with and changed . [---]
What the Uri Gellers or Ted Serios of this world display [...] are miracles that [...] appear through a particularly strong ability to focus mind .
This generates outer as well as inner events from the endless possibilities of space .
The type of meditation that brings them about is the previously mentioned ' Shine ' or Shamatha , which literally means calming and holding mind in one place .
The benefit derived from wonders such as these depends on the maturity of those who produce them as well as those who witness them .
— The Great Seal Just Let Go Glimpses of mind 's timeless nature may appear spontaneously when people forget to expect or fear , to spend their energy on past or future , and just relax .
Morpheus :
You have to let it all go , Neo .
Fear , doubt , and disbelief .
Free your mind !
Lama Ole Nydahl : Because ultimately everything is perfect anyway , one only needs to let go to have true fulfillment !
— The Great Seal Lama Ole Nydahl : Finally everything will fit ; wherever one looks , there will be only purity .
There is then only happiness within , and fulfillment without .
From a position of such richness , mind joyfully goes beyond concepts and trusts in its timeless space ; in this state freed of hope and fear , every breakthrough makes one more spontaneous and effortless .
— The Way Things Are Lama Ole Nydahl :
Our moments of real joy , where things are simply right and the hairs stand up on our arms with joy , are not caused by chasing happiness and seeking to fill our mind with pleasant impressions .
They appear when we forget to expect or fear , to spend our energy on past or future , and just relax .
Then mind recognizes its timeless nature .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom Tilopa :
In the transcending of mind 's dualities is Supreme vision ;
In a still and silent mind is Supreme Meditation ;
In spontaneity is Supreme Activity ;
And when all hopes and fears have died , the Goal is reached .
— Tilopa 's Mahamudra Instructions to Naropa Beyond Intellect
This effortless original state of mind is free of attachment and beyond intellect .
It is the mirror behind the pictures , the ocean beneath the play of the waves .
Morpheus :
What are you waiting for ?
You 're faster than this .
Do n't think you are .
Know you are .
Lama Ole Nydahl : Everything stilted and artificial misses the point .
Such behavior limits awareness and strength .
Every spontaneously arising insight , however , is a fleeting glance at enlightenment and sets one free .
Therefore one may use and enjoy relative thoughts , but they should not be considered too real .
If they set in motion processes of hope and fear , one is deeply in the conditioned world .
Outside the feeling that we truly grow and develop , there exists nothing completely satisfactory .
Whoever does not trust space here and now , may hardly ever notice the self - liberating potential that constantly manifests in the situations of one 's life .
— The Great Seal Lama Ole Nydahl :
In true absorption we rest in the original state , beyond concepts , knowing awareness to be our space and objects our clarity ; that both together are our unlimitedness .
Then mind shines naturally like a diamond or an electric bulb , spontaneous and effortless .
To sum up : thoughts are a good slave but a very bad master , and here we make the strong wish to remain in our timeless essence and not be distracted or caught by the conditioned world .
— Mahamudra : Boundless Joy and Freedom The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje :
Unpolluted by deliberate and intellectual meditation and not driven by the winds of ordinary life , may we learn to rest mind in its non-artificial and natural state and be skilled in sustaining this practice of mind ’s nature . [---]
Unceasing great bliss , free of attachment .
Unobscured clarity , free of clinging to characteristics .
Spontaneous non-conceptuality , beyond the intellect .
May these effortless experiences be continuous .
— Great Seal Wishes Spontaneity and Effortlessness
The four buddha activities emanate spontaneously and effortlessly out of the fearless , joyful , compassionate space .
Morpheus : Stop trying to hit me , and hit me !
Lama Ole Nydahl :
The secret level is perfected by abiding in the experience of space and bliss as inseparable .
One experiences the buddha - essence of all beings , the fundamental truth and the nowness of all events , and acts spontaneously and effectively .
— The Great Seal Tilopa : KYE HO !
Listen with joy !
The truth beyond mind cannot be grasped by any faculty of mind ;
The meaning of non-action cannot be understood in compulsive activity ;
To realise the meaning of non-action and beyond mind ,
Cut the mind at its root and rest in naked awareness .
— Tilopa 's Mahamudra Instructions to Naropa Gampopa :
One moment of spontaneous action is far superior to any amount of deliberately intended positive deeds .
[---]
Since the conduct of effortless non-action is free from the constructs of accepting or rejecting , it is spontaneously present as great bliss .
— The Precious Garland of the Sublime Path Gendyn Rinpoche : Happiness cannot be found through great effort and willpower , but is already present in open relaxation and letting go . [---]
Do n't strain yourself , there is nothing to do nor undo . [---]
Nothing to do or undo .
Nothing to force .
Nothing to want .
Emaho !
Marvelous !
Everything happens by itself .

Oracle : Open your mouth , say ah .
Neo : Ah .
Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche :
To condense the Buddha 's teaching still further , all four sentences could be expressed in one syllable : the syllable AH , in either Sanskrit and Tibetan .
The syllable AH is the nature which is free from any creation , any condition , and any fabrication .
In this context , AH symbolizes the essential nature of emptiness .
The limitless teachings of Buddha are intended to convey the completely empty nature of all phenomena to us .
The Prajnaparamita , the very well - known teaching with which we are all familiar , also explains the nature of emptiness .
The syllable AH symbolizes that emptiness , so the Buddha 's teachings , which are limitless , could be condensed into just one syllable !

All impressions of harmful and confused words disappear and we become conscious of our speech .
It is now compassion and wisdom , a powerful tool for benefiting others .
Along with the red light , we retain the deep vibration of the syllable AH .
Lama Ole Nydahl :
After one stops breathing , during the following ten to fifteen minutes the white energy loosens its hold at the top of one 's head and moves down towards the heart .
On its way down , a beautiful clear light is experienced , like from the moon , while thirty three feelings , which have their basis in anger , disappear .
Many hear the sound of a drawn - out HANG syllable and memory is so intense that one frequently sees beings who have died before one .
After that , a red light rises from the point four fingers below one 's navel .
The feeling is very powerful and the light is like a deep sunset .
While it moves up to the heart , also taking ten to fifteen minutes , many hear the deep vibration AH .
Forty feelings of attachment disappear at this point and an indescribable joy is felt .
Twenty to thirty minutes after death these two energies have thus fused in the center of one 's chest and everything becomes black .
While this happens , seven veils deriving from ignorance dissolve .
Then appears a radiant light , totally beyond - personal awareness .
If we can hold that state the meditation is called thugdam .
It means that mind is bound at the heart in a condition which does not separate truth inside and out .
Here , its open , clear and limitless essence pervades all times and directions ; this is the awareness of lamas like Karmapa .
It is compared to the meeting of a child and its mother and , if it can be held , there is real enlightenment .
Every separation between space and energy , as between past , present , and future then falls away .
— The Bardo of Death and Rebirth Beyond Restrictions A yogi's speech and body are conscious tools for benefiting others and have no option but to respond spontaneously to the ultimate needs of beings , to liberate them from the confines of their emotional and mental prisons .
Whenever people become too dualistic , moralistic or dense , it is a yogi's job to kick the chairs from under the pillars of societies .
Rhineheart :
You have a problem with authority , Mr. Anderson .
You believe that you 're special , that somehow the rules do n't apply to you .
Lama Ole Nydahl : In Tibet , there were three possible ways of following Buddhism : one might become a monk , practice as a lay person , or be a yogi .
Monks and nuns lived separately in monasteries and nunneries and had strict rules of conduct .
The lay people had families , a normal occupation and tried to put the teachings into their everyday lives .
The yogis lived unrestricted by social norms , often in various caves with changing partners and focused their entire lives on spiritual development ( one example is the well known yogi , Milarepa ) .
— The Way Things Are Lama Ole Nydahl :
There was also a third group of people whom the Buddha taught , the yogis .
Living beyond conventions and holding the highest view of the purity of all phenomena , their function was to kick the chairs from under the pillars of societies when they became too dualistic , moralistic or dense .
Being the holders of vision and constantly testing the boundaries of existence , they were supposed to constantly see everything as naturally fresh and full of potential .
Experiencing the world as radiant and sparkling , there was always space for new solutions .
— Learning in a Total Way Lama Ole Nydahl : Buddha 's confidence in his students is shown clearly in the freedom he gives them to trust their own minds .
He does not force them to make automatic moralistic judgments , which so often completely miss the point .
This is particularly true when it concerns the liberating and sometimes controversial activities of the Bodhisattvas .
They are the people who free others .
Having understood the dream - like nature of all existence , they can help beings to mature in effective but unconventional ways .
— The Great Seal Powerfully Protective Activity
Whoever uncovers the mind 's limitless clear space has no option but to work compassionately for the good of all beings .
This active love and compassion manifests in peace - giving , enriching , fascinating , and powerfully protective ways .
Tank :
So what do you need ?
Besides a miracle .
Neo : Guns .
Lots of guns .
Buddhism Today : Many people today say that they especially like Buddhism because of its emphasis on peace .
They understand it as expressed by teachers like Dalai Lama or Thich Nhat Hanh .
Does a Buddhist teacher have to be a pacifist ?
Lama Ole Nydahl :
No , although the feeling of anger must definitely be out .
At least to a Great Way Buddhist , there are causes worth protecting and fighting for .
It is a question of emotional economy and common sense .
Thomas Jefferson put it somewhat like this , " I learned the art of war so my children can farm and their children can study philosophy . "
Of course I share the above mentioned great teachers ' wish to see a world where mildness is appropriate anywhere .
In all honesty , however , I think they are wrong and that preaching a harmony , which only exists at religious meetings is misleading .
I see great dangers in and around our soft and spoiled democratic countries .
Islam and over - population often hand in hand , move ever closer , and if there is no willingness and foresight to protect our values , we will fall like earlier high cultures .
This would be a vast step backward for humanity and is also unnecessary if decisive steps are taken now .
By the way , if the Tibetan army had functioned , the Dalai Lama would certainly not have yielded to the Chinese aggressors .
The weak parties are always for peace , at least until they can arm or re-arm .
But peace without freedom is a jail for a German and a morgue for a Dane .
For Americans it was often the reason to get on a ship or a covered wagon .
There were never more posters for peace than earlier behind the Iron Curtain , with fat pigeons everywhere in the uniform gray - blue color of socialism .

Finally , the media pays attention .
A story exposing the lies , deceit , and cheating of the Republicans is exactly what the doctor ( Dean , that is ) ordered for tonight 's evening newscasts .
Apologies for the BREAKING and brevity of the story , but that 's all there is for now .
I will update as more information becomes available .
The ABC story :
Bob Bauer , General Counsel for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a cease and desist letter to Don McGahn , General Counsel of the National Republican Campaign Committee requesting a stop to what he alleges is an illegal form of random calling of voter 's residences using recorded political messages , often known as ' Robo - calling ' .
The letter states : " The NRCC calls do no identify at the outset , and as required , that they are sponsored by the NRCC .
These calls do no contain a telephone number .
This failure to comply with the law denies callers effective sponsorship information .
Without the benefit of a number , they are also unable to request that they not be called again .
And we have received reports that individuals have been contacted multiple times by your prerecorded calls , despite their continued refusal to accept the calls . "
Don McGahn , Council for the Republicans responded in this letter : " Thank you for your press release .
Per your request , this is to let you know that there is no need for the NRCC to , in your words , bring its actitivities into compliance with Federal law , because NRCC acitivities are already in compliance with Federal Law .
In Fact , with respect to telephone disclaimers , we have simply copied what you own national committee does .
I have a recording of a pre-recorded phone message from DNC counsel Joe Sandler which contains the same sorts of disclaimers ( including placement ) as NRCC calls .
Maybe you ought to send a letter to the DNC as well ? "
When asked about the letter , NRCC communications director Carl Forti said " we comply with all federal laws and regulations regarding political phone calls . "
NRCC Communicatiosn director Carl Forti , in a separate conversation with ABC News 's David Chalian , he said that they have made no phone calls past 8 PM , which suggests he realizes that would constitute a violation .
Text of the letter can be found HERE .
TEL AVIV , July 4 — Ayelet Movsowitz , a Jewish Israeli , peers out the car window as her ride veers off the highway and follows the signs to an Arab village .
" Are you crazy ? " she asks in an opening scene of an episode of Israel 's version of the television reality show " Wife Swap . "
" Do n't tell me I am going to have to cook all day , kabobs and what not .
Oy .
I 'm in an Arab village .
I just hope it 's not a hostile village . "
Meanwhile , Amal Ahmed Abdullah , 28 , her Arab Israeli counterpart , slowly walks past a large Jacuzzi in Mrs. Movsowitz 's house about 90 miles north , in the Galilee region of Israel .
Her mood dampens when she examines the contents of the refrigerator .
" There is nothing spicy here , " she says , pronouncing this a typical European Jewish home .
" A real Ashkenazi fridge .
They do n't know how to cook . "
TABC officials said the sweep concerned saving lives , not individual rights
... but I was n't drunk so ... The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission has done us all a great service .
In this day when would - be oppressors of all stripes seek to hide their real motives , the TABC has sent us a clear and unambiguous message .
The chilling thing is not that they believe it .
That 's always been true , it 's the core principle of government , even one supposedly guided by things like constitutions and bills of rights .
No , what 's scary is that they no longer feel that they have to hide it .
They have enough confidence in your ability to rationalize it away that they are n't worried in the least about any complaints from the Peanut Gallery .
In my last article , V for Vendetta , I talked about losing your fear of your government .
But for some of you , the next step is tofearing your government .
If you plan to see the movie , watch it with this in mind :
How does a society get to that point ?
Watch V's broadcast speech in the first half , and compare his accusations against your reaction to the TABC quote .
That is where and how it starts .
Do n't worry about how everyone else is reacting to it - look at howreact to it .
Is fear preventing you from understanding the meaning of something even this crystal clear ?
Is it fear of admitting that this country is no longer the free country it perhaps once was ?
Are you afraid that if you admit this fact into your conciousness that you will then be helpless to avoid the avalanche of such facts that you 've been able to remain blissfully ignorant of all your life ?
We are not yet the society of V , even in light of this .
But there are many turning points along the road to it , and this is one of them .
Your reaction to this is a very personal turning point .
You do n't have to take to the streets and protest - that kind of thing is of no significance whatsoever , and for reasons more complex than I 'll get into now , does more harm than good .
What you do have to do , what there is no way to avoid doing no matter how badly you might want to , is to make a personal choice .
Your choice may not prevent this country from becoming that of V .
But it will determine whether you live in it with integrity or with fear .
It will determine whether you remain free - now and in the future - even within a totalitarian society .
You wo n't have many chances left to make that decision .
Understand this , or pretend you do n't .
Embrace its meaning or rationalize it away .
There 's plenty of rationalizations available :
They 're just drunks and they should be locked up ...
They might have gone out and driven a car , or gotten rowdy and hurt someone ...
The law says you can't be drunk in public , and we have to preserve the rule of law ...
I do n't spend my time drunk in bars , so it does n't affect me ... Go ahead , choose one of those , or make up one of your own .
But do n't you dare , decades from now , ask me " how did this happen ? " .
Do n't you dare pretend that it was some rogue scoundrel who took over your free country and made it into a true police state complete with curfews and gulags and roving rape squads .
Do n't you dare .
It will have been your fault .
The gloomy assessment at a conference in America last week came as senior US and Iraqi officials sat down yesterday with officials from Iran , Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia in Baghdad to persuade Iraq 's neighbours to help seal its borders against fighters , arms and money flowing in .
During the conference the US , Iranian and Syrian delegations were reported to have had a ' lively exchange ' .
In a bleak analysis , senior officers described the fighters they were facing in Iraq and Afghanistan 'as smart , agile and cunning ' .
In Vietnam , the US was eventually defeated by a well - armed , closely directed and highly militarised society that had tanks , armoured vehicles and sources of both military production and outside procurement .
What is more devastating now is that the world 's only superpower is in danger of being driven back by a few tens of thousands of lightly armed irregulars , who have developed tactics capable of destroying multimillion - dollar vehicles and aircraft .
By contrast , the US military is said to have been slow to respond to the challenges of fighting an insurgency .
The senior officers described the insurgents as being able to adapt rapidly to exploit American rules of engagement and turn them against US forces , and quickly disseminate ways of destroying or disabling armoured vehicles .
The military is also hampered in its attempts to break up insurgent groups because of their ' flat ' command structure within collaborative networks of small groups , making it difficult to target any hierarchy within the insurgency .
The remarks were made by senior US generals speaking at the Association of the US Army meeting at Fort Lauderdale in Florida and in conversations with The Observer .
The generals view the ' war on terror ' as the most important test of America 's soldiers in 50 years .
' Iraq and Afghanistan are sucking up resources at a faster rate than we planned for , ' one three - star general said .
' America 's warriors need the latest technology to defeat an enemy who is smart , agile and cunning - things we did not expect of the Soviets . '
Other officers said coalition rules of engagement were being used against the forces fighting the insurgency .
' They know when we can and cannot shoot , and use that against us , ' said one officer , reflecting the comments of US soldiers in the field .
Another said recent video footage of an ambush on a convoy , posted on the internet , was evidence that insurgents were filming incidents to teach other groups about American counter - measures .
The concerns emerged as Iraq 's Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , issued a stern warning that unless Iraq 's neighbours - including Iran and Syria - united to help to shut down the networks supplying both Sunni and Shia extremists , Iraq 's sectarian bloodshed would engulf the Middle East .
Speaking at the beginning of the conference of regional and international powers in Baghdad , Maliki warned : ' Iraq has become a front - line battlefield .
It needs support in this battle , which not only threatens Iraq , but will also spill over to all countries in the region . '
Shortly after he spoke , mortar shells landed near the conference site and a car bomb exploded in a Shia stronghold across the city .
Maliki asked for help in stopping financial support , weapons smuggling and ' religious cover ' for the relentless car bombings , killings and other attacks that have increasingly been inflicted on Iraq , as the minority Sunnis , who dominated the country under Saddam Hussein , have fought the Shia majority who now run the government .
Terrorism , Maliki said , ' was an international epidemic , the price of which was being paid by the people of Iraq ' .
He also warned Syria and Iran not to use Iraq as a proxy battlefield against the US : ' Iraq does not accept that its territories and cities become a field where regional and international disputes are settled . '
Maliki said he hoped that today 's conference could be a ' turning point in supporting the government in facing this huge danger ' .
The one - day gathering is also seen as a chance for conversations on its fringe between Iran and the US over the deepening Iranian nuclear crisis - opening the way to end the 28 - year diplomatic impasse between America and Iran since the US hostages crisis .
The chief US delegate has left open the door for possible one - on - one exchanges about Iraq .

When I first encountered Cascading Style Sheets in the autumn of 1998 , I was trying to do cool stuff — make this stuff over here move , make that stuff over there change color — and it took another six months before I started using CSS to control presentation rather than behavior .
Article Continues Below
It took me two years to break out of the comfortable prison of layout tables , and another two years before I could use CSS to produce layouts that were originally intended for tables .
Even though I was forced during that time to deal with such anachronistic works of art as Netscape 4.0 and Internet Explorer 5.0 for Windows , the moral of the story should be clear : it took me a long while to achieve genuine mastery of CSS .
There are plenty of excellent books and articles out there , including many written by the contributors to this publication .
While most of those works gracefully walk the inexperienced developer through challenging layouts and teach by literal example , few of them acknowledge that using CSS to create standards - friendly sites requires a mindset that is alien to many experienced developers .
This requirement hamstrings a lot of talented people , and for two years I ’ve been looking for the words that will heal their pain .
The cries of frustration I hear from other developers about CSS are only an echo of the ones I made for years .
As a result I like to think that I can relate , and I ’m writing to convey the most important lessons I ’ve learned so far .
Lesson No. 1 : Everything you know is wrong … sort of #section2
Just so we ’re on the same wavelength , I want to underscore the fact that if you ’re starting to work with CSS , everything you ’ve learned to this point probably feels useless , or worse than useless .
That ’s a problem that needs to be dragged out into the open and shot with the utmost speed and mercy .
Unaffected is the body of wisdom you ’ve acquired on subjects like design , optimization , user experience , programming , and project management .
However , the assumptions under which you ’re accustomed to applying that knowledge change — sometimes drastically — when you switch to standards - friendly production techniques .
As a result , the best thing you can do is give yourself a clean slate .
Throw out your assumptions and expectations .
For that matter , throw out everyone ’s assumptions and expectations .
Roll up your sleeves and learn something new .
When it comes to layout and production , resolve to remove “ but ” and “ should ” from your professional vocabulary for a while .
Replace them with “ how ” and “ why ” — and commit to meeting your project objectives .
At the implementation level , this lesson is about the differences between table markup and semantic markup :
Table vs. Semantic Markup Table markup Semantic markup Implications Linear Hierarchical Design for the information , not in spite of it .
Procedural Functional
Put things where they belong .
Location - based Contextual
Let the markup describe what something is , before you let it describe where something is .
Defines constraints Defines domains
You do n’t need to push the envelope , because it will change its shape to suit your needs .
Finally , do n’t forget that there are things layout tables can do , and then there are things CSS can do .
Some of these capabiities are mutually exclusive , and this does n’t diminish the power of CSS .
Lesson No. 2 : It ’s not going to look exactly the same everywhere unless you ’re willing to face some grief … and possibly not even then #section3
There are an awful lot of differences between rendering engines , and the W3C specs sanction those differences .
You can adjust , tweak , hack , and waive , but if you want to preserve your social life , you will learn to let go of the small differences — and convince the stakeholders in your projects to do the same .
Lesson No. 3 : You will be forced to choose between the ideal and the practicable #section4
Life and work often become series of compromises , especially when things are in a state of transition .
The best thing you can do to ensure compromises in your favor is to plan effectively .
From time to time , though , you can expect to encounter situations where you will be forced to choose between the lesser of two evils , or perhaps even situations where you will be given no choice at all .
Sites that are incapable of passing accessibility or validity tests will result , and you will be forced to accept those outcomes even when your contrarian assertions are absolutely correct .
Appreciate the objectives of your projects .
Acknowledge workplace politics .
Decide what is most important to you as a professional .
Concede that the decisions of others made over your objections , much less those made without your input , do not reflect on your skill or integrity a jot ( though they may reflect on the wisdom with which you choose your project sponsors ) .
Choose your ground , pick your battles … and fight the ones you can actually win .
Lesson No. 4 ( with thanks to Antoine de Saint - Exupéry ) : Perfection is not when there ’s nothing to add , but when there ’s nothing to take away # section5
When producing markup for a standards - friendly site , it ’s all too easy to stick to the table - based way of doing things and create an over - abundance of container elements .
While at first it may seem like common sense to force the markup into the design , doing so misses the point of standards - friendly production .
Do n’t force anything , and do n’t add markup unless context encourages it .
Focus on the information first .
If you ’ve got several instances of content that share the same purpose or classification , do n’t be afraid to stick them inside div s or span s that share a class named in a way that describes that purpose or classification .
If you want to put body copy inside a container element that ’s common to all of your pages , most people wo n’t fault you .
If instead you ’re going crazy with div s because you need certain widgets to be present at particular layout coordinates ( or have other seemingly unique presentation requirements ) , chances are you ’re not thinking through your design completely .
As a consequence , your markup will be even harder to maintain than the table - based markup that you ’re trying to replace .
Remove tags wherever possible … while keeping the next lesson in mind .
Lesson No. 5 : Some sites are steaming heaps of edge cases #section6
In many cases , the person responsible for a site ’s graphic design is not responsible for any other aspects of site implementation .
When paired with a failure to create strict site - and section - wide wireframes , this lack of accountability results in unique comps for too many pages , and thus a lot more work for the stylist and producers .
It has been this writer ’s experience that such an outcome is far more common during small projects than large ones , which leads to those small projects going egregiously over budget .
I invite the reader to consider the implications of that fact .
Whenever possible , encourage the graphic designers with whom you work to respect the imperative of consistency .
If your encouragement has no effect , make sure to stick a unique id on the body of every page of the site , and enjoy the bright side : there ’s no doubt that you ’ve got a living .
Lesson No. 6 : Longer lead times are inevitable #section7
Browser vendors had five frenetic years to work out a uniform and reasonably stable approach to table rendering , and that task was made easier by the fact that until Gecko and KHTML were released , most rendering engines had a great deal in common — Mosaic begat Netscape but was also licensed to Microsoft .
The state of CSS rendering technology is comparable to the state of table rendering technology in early 1998 … so give it time , and test your layouts diligently in the meantime .
The good news is that the time needed to test and debug your layouts is repaid after launch by the reduced time spent on maintenance , extensions , and revisions .
Lesson No. 7 : Coherent and sensible source order is the best of Good Things#section8
If you deliver work that reads properly when styles are removed , your thoughtfulness will repay you many times over .
Such a practice carries many benefits , including :
A site - wide print stylesheet replaces separate print - only pages .
Stylesheets are easier to document , normalize , and maintain .
Interspersal of markup and scripting on site templates decreases .
Keyboard navigation of the site becomes considerably less painful .
When the site is redesigned , there ’s no need to rearrange the content all over again .
Lesson No. 8 : Descendant selectors are the beginning and end of genuinely powerful CSS rules # section9
When you begin the transition from table - based layout to standards - friendly production , it ’s tempting not only to go crazy with container elements , but also to stick class es and id s all over the place .
Of course , you usually do n’t need to .
For an example , consider an element intended to contain navigation links .
A common beginner ’s mistake is to build the whole thing with div s , which offends purists because doing so makes things more difficult for users of screen readers .
Since div s are n’t the ideal solution , we can use unordered lists instead .
Screen readers accept commands to skip those .
Thus , a “ good ” navigation element is an unordered list of links .
A conscientious developer might put an id on the list for the sake of positioning , and class es on the links , so that they can be distinguished from all of the other links in the document .
However , in this scenario , only the id is necessary .
The trimming in question is made possible by a descendant selector :
#nav a { color : red ; }
In English , this selector says “ all links within #nav should be made red . ”
Here ’s a more complicated example :
# bodycopy blockquote.critical { float : right ; width : 30 % ; padding : .5 em ; margin : .5em ; }
The attributes in that rule would be applied to blockquote s assigned to the class critical , but which also appear within # bodycopy .
This allows both plain blockquote s in #bodycopy and similar blockquote s in #sidebar to be styled differently , while minimizing the number of class es and id s that need to be used .
In effect , descendant selectors allow you to reduce the number of class es and id s in the markup and to keep a keener eye on context than is possible without these selectors .
When used in combination with background images and layout properties , descendant selectors make possible effects that tables can’t even begin to duplicate .
Lesson No. 9 : In the real world , stylesheet hacks will get your project across the finish line # section10
Yes , stylesheet hacks are mildly disrespectful to the intentions behind the underlying technology .
Yes , stylesheet hacks introduce the possibility of nightmares in the wake of a major change … such as the one that will take place when Internet Explorer 7 is released .
Yes , the whole subject is an uproar waiting to happen .
This writer takes an unambiguous attitude on the subject .
Given a choice between making excuses to a client about why something looks lousy in their browser or just fixing it , the latter decision settles up a pending invoice with far less pain and delay .
When used wisely and with the appropriate caveats , stylesheet hacks make life a lot easier !
Lesson No. 10 : Working around rendering bugs is like playing Whack - a- Mole#section11
By this , I mean that when a rendering bug in one browser is worked around successfully , it often results in the exposure of another rendering bug in another browser ( or a different version of the same browser ) .
When this happens , you can expect to step back and re-examine your entire ruleset … if not your entire stylesheet collection .

Lesson No. 11 : When you ’re drowning in CSS layout problems , make sure of the width and height of the water , float without putting up a struggle , and get clear of the problems # section12
When you ’re working with columnar layouts , unpleasant surprises are common .
The best way to achieve an aesthetically pleasing columnar layout and sensible source order is to use the CSS float attribute .
However , in order for this to work well , all of your columns need to have defined width s and , in some circumstances , defined height s as well .
Without those width s and height s , the layout is rendered willy - nilly .
Additionally , you may find yourself ignoring Lesson No. 4 above in order to create the layout successfully .
However , that ’s one of the compromises I mentioned — a compromise hopefully made only after you ’ve tried your best to do it some other way .
Lesson No. 12 : Background images will make the difference between the plain and the tastefully embellished # section13
Thanks to the vagaries of the CSS box model , mixing proportional and fixed dimensions within a layout — in other words , attempting an elastic layout with lots of borders — is a sure way to disaster ( or at least considerable grief ) .
However , you can create the illusion of that mixture by creating well - composed background images and referencing them properly in your stylesheets .
Self - directed experimentation is recommended , particularly with regard to the behavior of borders .
Another common task for which I believe background images are appropriate is the replacement of headings with bitmapped type .
Though arguably contoversial , the practice of combining the background - position and text - indent CSS properties makes it possible to give search engines and screen readers what they need , while also providing the high - quality visual experience for which most graphic designers strive .
For the record , naysayers should know that I ’ve yet to encounter any personal computer users who routinely browse the web with stylesheets enabled and images disabled .
While that scenario leads to an intriguing intellectual exercise , I ’m presently confident that it bears little relationship to the way people habitually browse the web in the real world .
In Conclusion#section14
The buzz about Web 2.0 , CSS , and myriad other subjects of the bleeding edge can become a dull roar to those left ill - equipped for industry changes because of work habits adopted in good faith years before .
It is my hope that the experience I ’ve shared will help some folks to find a way back to the top of the heap — which is where the web needs you .
Last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics re-benchmarked the payroll jobs data back to 2000 .
Thanks to Charles McMillion of MBG Information Services , I have the adjusted data from January 2001 through January 2006 .
If you are worried about terrorists , you do n't know what worry is .
Job growth over the last five years is the weakest on record .
The US economy came up more than 7 million jobs short of keeping up with population growth .
That 's one good reason for controlling immigration .
An economy that cannot keep up with population growth should not be boosting population with heavy rates of legal and illegal immigration .
Over the past five years the US economy experienced a net job loss in goods producing activities .
The entire job growth was in service - providing activities -- primarily credit intermediation , health care and social assistance , waiters , waitresses and bartenders , and state and local government .
US manufacturing lost 2.9 million jobs , almost 17 % of the manufacturing work force .
The wipeout is across the board .
Not a single manufacturing payroll classification created a single new job .
The declines in some manufacturing sectors have more in common with a country undergoing saturation bombing during war than with a super - economy that is " the envy of the world . "
* Communications equipment lost 43 % of its workforce .
Semiconductors and electronic components lost 37 % of its workforce .
*
The workforce in computers and electronic products declined 30 % .
* Electrical equipment and appliances lost 25 % of its employees .
*
The workforce in motor vehicles and parts declined 12 % . * Furniture and related products lost 17 % of its jobs .
* Apparel manufacturers lost almost half of the work force .
* Employment in textile mills declined 43 % . * Paper and paper products lost one - fifth of its jobs .
*
The work force in plastics and rubber products declined by 15 % . * Even manufacturers of beverages and tobacco products experienced a 7 % shrinkage in jobs .
*
The knowledge jobs that were supposed to take the place of lost manufacturing jobs in the globalized " new economy " never appeared .
*
The information sector lost 17 % of its jobs , with the telecommunications work force declining by 25 % . * Even wholesale and retail trade lost jobs .
* Despite massive new accounting burdens imposed by Sarbanes - Oxley , accounting and bookkeeping employment shrank by 4 % . * Computer systems design and related lost 9 % of its jobs .
* Today , there are 209,000 fewer managerial and supervisory jobs than 5 years ago .
In five years , the US economy only created 70,000 jobs in architecture and engineering , many of which are clerical .
Little wonder engineering enrollments are shrinking .
There are no jobs for graduates .
The talk about engineering shortages is absolute ignorance .
There are several hundred thousand American engineers who are unemployed and have been for years .
No student wants a degree that is nothing but a ticket to a soup line .
Many engineers have written to me that they cannot even get Wal - Mart jobs because their education makes them over - qualified .
Offshore outsourcing and offshore production have left the US awash with unemployment among the highly educated .
The low measured rate of unemployment does not include discouraged workers .
Labor arbitrage has made the unemployment rate less and less a meaningful indicator .
In the past unemployment resulted mainly from turnover in the labor force and recession .
Recoveries pulled people back into jobs .
Unemployment benefits were intended to help people over the down time in the cycle when workers were laid off .
Today the unemployment is permanent as entire occupations and industries are wiped out by labor arbitrage as corporations replace their American employees with foreign ones .
Economists who look beyond political press releases estimate the US unemployment rate to be between 7 % and 8.5 % .
There are now hundreds of thousands of Americans who will never recover their investment in their university education .
Unless the BLS is falsifying the data or businesses are reporting the opposite of the facts , the US is experiencing a job depression .
Most economists refuse to acknowledge the facts , because they endorsed globalization .
It was a win - win situation , they said .
They were wrong .
At a time when America desperately needs the voices of educated people as a counterweight to the disinformation that emanates from the Bush administration and its supporters , economists have discredited themselves .
This is especially true for " free market economists " who foolishly assumed that international labor arbitrage was an example of free trade that was benefitting Americans .
Where is the benefit when employment in US export industries and import - competitive industries is shrinking ?
After decades of struggle to regain credibility , free market economics is on the verge of another wipeout .
No sane economist can possibly maintain that a deplorable record of merely 1,054,000 net new private sector jobs over five years is an indication of a healthy economy .
The total number of private sector jobs created over the five year period is 500,000 jobs less than one year 's legal and illegal immigration !
( In a December 2005 Center for Immigration Studies report based on the Census Bureau 's March 2005 Current Population Survey , Steven Camarota writes that there were 7,9 million new immigrants between January 2000 and March 2005 . )
The economics profession has failed America .
It touts a meaningless number while joblessness soars .
Lazy journalists at the New York Times simply rewrite the Bush administration 's press releases .
On February 10 the Commerce Department released a record US trade deficit in goods and services for 2005 - - $ 726 billion .
The US deficit in Advanced Technology Products reached a new high .
Offshore production for home markets and jobs outsourcing has made the US highly dependent on foreign provided goods and services , while simultaneously reducing the export capability of the US economy .
It is possible that there might be no exchange rate at which the US can balance its trade .
Polls indicate that the Bush administration is succeeding in whipping up fear and hysteria about Iran .
The secretary of defense is promising Americans decades - long war .
Is death in battle Bush 's solution to the job depression ?
Will Asians finance a decades - long war for a bankrupt country ?

I just took a quick peek at the new , so - called user - friendly installer for the next release of Debian .
It ’s pretty obvious these folks do n’t have a clue about talking to real users .
I doubt they ’ve done any end - user testing .
For instance , after I ’ve selected “ English ” as my primary language , maybe it would make sense to move the English keyboard layouts to the top of the list ?
And do they really expect end users to understand or care about messages like “ Loading module ‘ plix ’ for ‘ Intel Corporation 82371AB / EB /MB PIIX4 ” ?
I asked for English in the install .
Would it be too much to ask that the installer speak it ?
And I ’m sorry , but “ SCSI1 ( 0,0,0 ) ( sda ) – 4.3 GB VMware , VMware , Vi ” is not a sensible name for a disk .
How I am supposed to choose between “ Primary ” and “ logical ” partitions ?
I could continue , but I ’ll stop here .
Have n’t any of these people ever used a Mac ?
In many ways , Linux is an extremely modern operating system , which makes it all the more frustrating that its user interface is still stuck in 1982 .
One thing Stallman has never really acknowledged ( at least that I ’ve ever heard ) is that the freedom he talks about is only for programmers and people who can afford to pay them .
Everyone else is a serf who has to bow at the table of their programmer masters .
In some ways it reminds me of ancient Athenian philosophers and Roman republicans philosophizing about freedom and democracy in a society built on the backs of slaves .
The simple fact is that until the free software movement starts to take user interface design seriously , a typical end user is vastly more free using a Mac or even Windows than they ever will be using Linux .
The only counter example I can think of is Firefox .
Firefox has a genuinely good user interface , with only a few minor glitches ; probably less than you ’d see in a typical end - user Windows application and only a few more than you ’d find in an average Mac app .
But that ’s it .
Mozilla ’s a little worse than Firefox when it comes to the user interface .
And I ca n’t think of any other open source , end - user application that even comes close to its non-free counterparts .
No , OpenOffice does n’t qualify .
Claims that OpenOffice is as good as Microsoft Office , itself not a sterling example of user interface design , are wishful thinking at best .
Maybe 2.0 will be better , but 1.x is at most adequate .
I speak as someone who wrote an entire book using OpenOffice , and boy was that a mistake .
There are real costs to using software with poor user interface design , and in this case the cost was a book that came out months later than it was supposed to .
There are advantages to OpenOffice compared to Microsoft Word .
The native XML format is a big one .
But as typical for open source , this advantage does not make the slightest bit of difference to a non-programmer end user .
Until open source developers start writing software for end users instead of each other , the situation will not improve ; and most of the world will remain serfs .
The only difference will be whether they bow in the direction of Redmond , Cupertino , or Cambridge .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has struck down the District of Columbia ’s gun ban and done so while recognizing that the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment is an individual right :
Divided three - judge D.C. Circuit panel holds that the District of Columbia ’s gun control laws violate individuals ’
Second Amendment rights :
You can access today ’s lengthy D.C. Circuit ruling at this link .
According to the majority opinion , “ [ T ] he phrase ‘ the right of the people , ’ when read intratextually and in light of Supreme Court precedent , leads us to conclude that the right in question is individual . ”
The majority opinion sums up its holding on this point as follows :
To summarize , we conclude that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms .
That right existed prior to the formation of the new government under the Constitution and was premised on the private use of arms for activities such as hunting and self - defense , the latter being understood as resistance to either private lawlessness or the depredations of a tyrannical government ( or a threat from abroad ) .
In addition , the right to keep and bear arms had the important and salutary civic purpose of helping to preserve the citizen militia .
The civic purpose was also a political expedient for the Federalists in the First Congress as it served , in part , to placate their Antifederalist opponents .
The individual right facilitated militia service by ensuring that citizens would not be barred from keeping the arms they would need when called forth for militia duty .
Despite the importance of the Second Amendment ’s civic purpose , however , the activities it protects are not limited to militia service , nor is an individual ’s enjoyment of the right contingent upon his or her continued or intermittent enrollment in the militia .
The importance of this opinion cannot be understated .
Gun control advocates have consistently attempted to argue that the Second Amendment ’s protection of the right to keep and bear arms was a “ collective ” right that applied , for example , to the right of individual states to form militas and control state National Guard units .
This argument , of course , is completely inconsistent with the Founders view of the individual right to keep and bear arms , which is why this Court of Appeals decision is , as Jason Pye put it , very good news .
It looks like my fellow contributor Chris and I were thinking along the same lines at about the same time .
Alkali Metal Bangs
So far as I am aware , history does not record whether the great chemist Sir Humphrey Davy , who discovered sodium in 1807 by electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide , ever threw any in a lake .
But I think it 's safe to say that very few chemists since then have n't .
The entire left - most column of the periodic table ( not counting hydrogen ) is composed of elements that are great fun to throw in a lake , provided of course that you take full account of the speed and effectiveness which which these elements and their caustic oxides can burn your eyes out ( permanent blindness is a common side effect of such experiments gone wrong ) .
I have assembled this page to try to shed some light on the truth behind a recent controversy generated by the popular British television show Brainiac .
A few seasons ago Brainiac broadcast an episode in which they claimed to show what happens when approximately two grams of each of the five alkali metals ( lithium , sodium , potassium , rubidium , and cesium ) are thrown into a tub of water .
The first three were , probably , real , but the last two explosions turned out to have been completely fake .
They simply put a bomb in a bathtub and blew it to bits , pretending that this was the result of two grams of rubidium .
Then they did it again and pretended it was two grams of cesium .
( Cesium is spelled caesium where they come from , but lying is lying on either side of the Atlantic . )
This shocking fact was revealed by reporter Ben Goldacre in an article in The Guardian ( a respected daily newspaper in England ) .
The next week he followed up with further revelations about the deplorable state of honesty at Brainiac .
( Modesty prevents me from pointing out that his second article compares my humble sodium party most favorably to the fakers over at Brainiac . )
And then the following week ( July 29 , 2006 ) , displaying admirable tenacity , he wrote about it again in an article that links to this very page as a reference to show what really happens .
Watch the Brainiac clip for yourself on Google Video , or YouTube .
And remember while you 're watching it that the whole thing is fake .
All that drama and puffing up of the dangers of two grams of rubidium and cesium is just for show .
They did n't actually do it .
As someone who has personally exploded not two but five grams of rubidium and cesium under water , I thought I should set the record straight .
Yes , rubidium and cesium are very reactive .
When my British film producer friend Max Whitby and I set out to film a series of alkali metal explosions , we took every possible precaution .
I built an ampule smashing machine that allowed us to break open sealed glass ampules from a comfortable distance .
In this picture it 's set up to smash them underwater ( click any picture to get a larger version in a new window ) :
It has an aluminum rod loosely clamped above the ampule , which is taped to a heavy metal plate ( pure nickel , since I 'm an element collector and have that kind of thing lying around ) :
Above the rod is a four pound sledge hammer held back by a pin , onto which is tied a long string .
The very , very last step is to fill the bowl with warm water :
( Note that in the first picture I just have a face shield , while in this one I have heavy leather protective clothing :
The addition of water to the setup greatly increases the potential consequences of a mishap .
Note also that my feet are completely unprotected .
This is a bit harder to explain . )
The machine can also smash ampules above the water and drop the contents down , to more accurately simulate the process of throwing something into a lake .
( If you 're not familiar with what alkali metal ampules look like , this clip shows me removing a 5 gram rubidium ampule from the ammunition box we kept our stock in . )
Enough talk , on to the videos .
First we filmed a series of videos smashing the ampules above water :
Lithium
Sodium
Potassium
Rubidium
Cesium
As you can see , the rubidium and cesium explosions are , frankly , rather pathetic .
We were very disappointed , and began to doubt our own ability to create proper explosions .
One idea was that perhaps the rubidium and cesium were in fact so reactive that they blew themselves off the surface of the water before most of the material could react .
In this clip I explain this theory , which was supported by the fact that we often found exciting little bits of explosive material on the surrounding concrete ( which we rendered safe by use of a large squirt gun ) .
To solve this incomplete reaction problem , we modified the ampule smasher to break the ampules open entirely underwater , and re-filmed the rubidium and cesium explosions : Rubidium Underwater
Cesium Underwater Rubidium did a reasonable job ( although the bowl was not shattered as we had hoped ) , but cesium again disappoints .
What 's going on here ?
Are rubidium and cesium really not that reactive after all ?
Were the consulting chemists ( assuming they had any ) just playing a joke on the Brainiac team to see if they could get them to fake some explosions ?
The answer is that reactivity , as the term is used by chemists , does not accurately correlate with the size and spectacle of the resulting explosion .
When an alkali metal is dropped into water , there are two separate stages to the explosion .
First , the metal reacts with the water , tearing off and liberating hydrogen gas .
Second , and this part does n't always happen , the heat generated by the first part of the reaction ignites the hydrogen gas , which burns , sometimes explosively , in the surrounding air .
It is this secondary hydrogen gas explosion that produces the visible flame above the bowl of water and / or lake , not the initial reaction of the metal with water ( which , of course , tends to happen mostly under water ) .
And it does n't matter which alkali metal created that hydrogen gas : Hydrogen is hydrogen , regardless of its source .
All that matters is how much of it there is when it 's lit , and how well it 's mixed with air before it 's ignited .
Generally speaking , the hydrogen gas explosion contributes more to the overall visible size of the explosion than does the initial metal - water reaction .
And this brings into play an important fact :
When you go down the periodic table from lithium to cesium , the atomic weight goes up from 6.94 to 132.9 .
Higher atomic weight means fewer atoms per unit of weight , and the amount of hydrogen gas generated is directly proportional to the number of atoms .
So 5 grams of cesium liberates only about one twentieth as much hydrogen as five grams of lithium , and a bit over one sixth as much as 5 grams of sodium .
You might think this would mean lithium gives the biggest hydrogen explosion , but as you can see from the video it reacts so gently that it never gets hot enough to actually set off the hydrogen .
And if it did , it 's producing gas so slowly that very little would still be close enough to be ignited .
Sodium and potassium are the happy medium :
They produce lots of hydrogen gas , and they do it fast enough that it is still around when they get hot enough to ignite it .
In fact , sodium often waits just about exactly the right amount of time to allow a large plume of hydrogen to accumulate and mix with oxygen from the air before igniting an almighty bang .
In a very real sense the slightly lower rate of reaction of sodium compared to potassium makes it a perfect time fuse , an essential component in any fuel - air bomb .
With potassium you tend to get very energetic , but basically small - scale explosions of gas :
It reacts and heats up so rapidly that the gas is ignited before much has accumulated .
Sometimes more or less the same thing happens with sodium ( for example , if a small piece breaks off and heats up rapidly , it might ignite the gas sooner than normal ) .
But other times the sodium sits there hissing and sizzling without a flame for what seems like an eternity ( but is actually at most maybe 5 seconds ) .
That 's when I start to cringe , because I know that all that time it 's building up an invisible plume of hydrogen - air mixture which , sooner or later , is going to make a really loud bang .
This unpredictability makes sodium arguably the most dangerous of the alkali metals in inexperienced hands ( soon to be inexperienced stumps ) .
The behavior of large pieces is very different from that of small pieces , and on my sodium party page you can read numerous stories contributed by people who have experienced first hand the unpredictable nature of this beast .
Including some who have had their eyes permanently damaged by it .
Given half a chance it will take your sight from you :
Do not give it that chance .
That means wearing eye protection at all times when handling sodium or any alkali metal .
You remember the picture above where my feet are bare ?
That 's basically a risk I 'm willing to take .
I would n't particularly enjoy having cesium splashed on my feet :
Depending on the quantity I would experience burns up to a fairly serious level .
By serious I mean going to the hospital for a skin transplant , weeks of physical therapy and living with pain for months thereafter .
But given the level of precautions we took , and the severity of that possible consequence , I chose not to wear long pants on a hot day .
You will never see me without glasses , or more likely a full face shield , anywhere near any remotely energetic chemical reaction .
Loosing your eyesight simply does not compare with any other injury I can imagine suffering .
All four limbs chopped off ?
Not even close .
Now back to alkali metals .
If you are interested in further reading , my Periodic Table Table website has lots more stuff like this , including photographs and descriptions of over a thousand samples of the chemical elements .
These are the entries for the five alkali metals : Lithium
Sodium
Potassium
Rubidium
Cesium
If you just want to see my stock photography library for each element , these links show the pictures in more compact form ( same pictures just without the descriptive text ) : Lithium
Sodium
Potassium
Rubidium

If you 're into elements , you should have some !
My site has a lot of information about where to get samples , or you can order complete sets and wall displays from my partners at RBG Research , which sells the finest sets in the world .

It 's quite pretty .
( Just a quick note about the google ads you see above .
These are placed automatically by google , and I do not necessarily endorse any of the products advertised .
In particular , any page that mentions the word " cesium " is sure to attract ads promoting cesium chloride as a cure for cancer .
This is complete bunk , vile worthless quackery of the worst kind . )
This is copy&paste from the project comments page that summarize my view on Cheesecake .
What do you mean there should be a README file ?
If I add an empty README file I get a good cheesecake score , while somebody who has excellent information in a file DOC , gets a bad score ?
I ’m afraid cheesecake ’s kwalitee is going to become a factor that wo n’t be respected by developers .
If cheesecake gives a bad score to a project it may mean that either the project is bad , * or* cheesecake is bad and the project is good .
And if there are many good projects that get a bad score cheesecake will render itself wrong !
And that ’s exactly the reason we ’re asking the community for feedback .
We do n’t want to implement “ book standards ” but real working and useful practices that good Python developers use .
If there will be a few good projects with DOC instead of README file , we ’ll add this check to Cheesecake .
What I could call most common misunderstanding about Cheesecake is a misconception that we are trying to come up with our own standards and try to enforce them on Python developers .
What we ’ll actually do is listen to what developers have to say and come up with a greatest common divider for all these good programming advices .
Cheesecake score will represent project compliance to this common and established way of doing things .
Important part of this is that Cheesecake wo n’t be ever complete .
It will have to incorporate changes in the same way the community and methodology changes over time .
Having a tool to point you to current trends and suggest good advices on trivial things like file naming convention or distribution method is invaluable .
This way you can focus on coding , leaving boring stuff to Cheesecake .
One of our goals is to create an easy reference for all factors that affect Cheesecake score , so that every developer can easily look up why he ’s loosing points .
And that does n’t mean these rules are set in stone – we encourage all developers to question them .
The point I ’m trying to make is that Cheesecake is written to help programmers , not to put blame on them .
It ’s one of agile development advices : “ Criticize Ideas , Not People ” .
If most developers use README it ’s probably a good thing to have a README in your project .
It tells nothing about the quality of your documentation , it only suggest you do n’t have file that most people will try to look for first , right after package has been unpacked .
It also make it easier for package managers in different open source distributions , like Debian or Gentoo , as they do n’t have to check manually which of your DOC / UserManual / anything file contains actual documentation they can , for example , incorporate into a man .
Having one good way of doing things is very efficient for collaboration and project maintaince .
Python was built upon this principle , so Cheesecake is merely a continuation of this thinking , but on different level .
Hvis du står og føler dig parat til at flyve fra reden ind og i en større , mere robust en af slagsen , og her står i det fortvivlede dilemma om hvorledes dit nye hjem skal bygges , så følg med her .
Mange trækker i arbejdshandskerne , når de skal finde det perfekte hus , hvilket da også kan være en god investering , og en , hvor der kan spares en masse penge .
Men ofte kan dette give anledning til uforudsete udgifter , lidt for mange arbejdstimer og generelt bare overraskelser , man egentlig helst havde været foruden .
Det kan også være , at du står med overvejelser vedrørende nybyggeri i Aarhus , eller i andre større byer , hvor priserne generelt er høje og valget derfor måske kan være en smule sværere .
Selvom du vælger nybyggeri , er der stadig en masse beslutninger , du skal tage stilling til .
Dog kan du i langt højere grad læne dig tilbage , da du netop ved , at husets fundament og grundelementer er nye og derved har en længere levetid end hvis du valgte istandsættelse af et ældre hus .
Fordele ved at vælge nybyggeri
· Design huset efter dine behov og ønsker
Få en plantegning hvor hver eneste kvadratmeter er udnyttet præcis efter dine ønsker .
Det kan være , det er hobbyrummet , det ekstra store kontor eller blot børneværelset , der lige sætter prikken over i’et , men uanset hvad du går og sukker efter , kan du ved nybyggeri få det indfriet .
· God isolering og energisikring
Ved nybyggeri er der høje krav til isolering , hvorfor du kan få udsigter til en lav varmeregning .
· Kan være økonomisk fordelagtigt
På længere sigt kan nybyggeri være en god investering , da vedligeholdelse og forbrug begrænses gennem et moderne fundament .
Materialerne er ofte gode , hvorfor det sjældent er nødvendigt med udskiftning .
· Føl dig tryg
Såfremt du vælger nybyggeri , er det i denne anledning lovpligtigt at have en byggeforsikring .
Det betyder , at hvis der opstår uventede problematikker eller deciderede fejl fra byggeriet , kan forsikringen tage over , således du er sikret tag over hovedet .
· Slip for besværet
Der er ingen vægge , der skal males , ingen revner , der skal spartles og ikke gamle , outdated køkkenelementer , der skal udskiftes .
Følg din mavefornemmelse
Hvis du gerne vil købe hus med god mavefornemmelse og gerne vil have denne også varer ved , efter du er flyttet ind , så anbefales det , at du bygger nyt .
Selvfølgelig skal du følge din egen mavefornemmelse , når der skal købes hus – men hvis du ønsker minimalt besvær , så benyt dig af nybyggeri .
A new theory that explains why the language of our genes is more complex than it needs to be also suggests that the primordial soup where life began on earth was hot and not cold , as many scientists believe .
In a paper published in the Journal of Molecular Evolution this week , researchers from the University of Bath describe a new theory which they believe could solve a puzzle that has baffled scientists since they first deciphered the language of DNA almost 40 years ago .
In 1968 , Marshall Nirenberg , Har Gobind Khorana and Robert Holley received a Nobel Prize for working out how proteins are produced from the genetic code .
They discovered that three letter ‘ words ’ - known as codons - are read from the DNA code and then translated into one of 20 amino acids .
These amino acids are then strung together in the order dictated by the DNA code and folded into complex shapes to form a specific protein .
As the DNA ‘ alphabet ’ contains four letters - called bases - there are as many as 64 three - letter words available in the DNA dictionary .
This is because it is mathematically possible to produce 64 three - letter words from any combination of four letters .
But why there should be 64 words in the DNA dictionary which translate into just 20 amino acids , and why a process that is more complex than it needs to be should have evolved in the first place , has puzzled scientists for the last 40 years .
Dozens of scientists have suggested theories to solve the puzzle , but these have been quickly discounted or failed to explain some of the other quirks in protein synthesis .

“ Why there are so many more codons than amino acids has puzzled scientists ever since it was discovered how the genetic code works , ” said Dr Jean van den Elsen from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry .
“ It meant the genetic code did not have the mathematical brilliance you would expect from something so fundamental to life on earth . ”
One of quirks of the genetic code is that there are groups of codons which all translate to the same amino acid .
For example , the amino acid leucine can be translated from six different codons whilst some amino acids , which have equally important functions and are translated in the same amount , have just one .
The new theory builds on an original idea suggested by Francis Crick - one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA - that the three - letter code evolved from a simpler two - letter code , although Crick thought the difference in number was simply an accident “ frozen in time ” .
The University of Bath researchers suggest that the primordial ‘ doublet ’ code was read in threes - but with only either the first two ‘ prefix ’ or last two ‘ suffix ’ pairs of bases being actively read .
advertisement
By combining arrangements of these doublet codes together , the scientists can replicate the table of amino acids - explaining why some amino acids can be translated from groups of 2 , 4 or 6 codons .
They can also show how the groups of water loving ( hydrophilic ) and water - hating ( hydrophobic ) amino acids emerge naturally in the table , evolving from overlapping ‘ prefix ’ and ‘ suffix ’ codons .
“ When you evolve our theory for a doublet system into a triplet system , you get an exact match up with the number and range of amino acids we see today , ” said Dr van den Elsen , who has worked with Dr Stefan Babgy and Huan - Lin Wu on the theory .
“ This simple theory explains many unresolved features of the current genetic code .
No one has ever been able to do this before , so we are very excited . ”
The theory also explains how the structure of the genetic code maximises error tolerance .
For instance , ‘ slippage ’ in the translation process tends to produce another amino acid with the same characteristics , and explains why the DNA code is so good at maintaining its integrity .
“ This is important because these kinds of mistakes can be fatal for an organism , ” said Dr van den Elsen .
“ None of the older theories can explain how this error tolerant structure might have arisen . ”
The new theory also highlights two amino acids that can be excluded from the doublet system and are likely to be relatively recent ‘ acquisitions ’ by the genetic code .
As these amino acids - glutamine and asparagine - are unable to hold their shape in high temperatures , this suggests that heat prevented them from being acquired by the code at some point in the past .
One possible reason for this is that the Last Universal Common Ancestor ( LUCA ) , which evolved into all life on earth , lived in a hot sulphurous pool or thermal vent .
As it moved into cooler conditions , it was able to take up these two additional amino acids and evolve into more complex organisms .
This provides further evidence for the debate on whether life emerged from a hot or cold primordial soup .
“ There are still relics of a very old simple code hidden away in our DNA and in the structures of our cells , ” said Dr van den Elsen , who points to several aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases - molecules involved in protein synthesis - which only look at pairs of bases in triplet codons , as well as other physical evidence in support of the theory .
“ As the code evolved it has been possible for it to adapt and take on new amino acids .
Whether we could eventually reach a full complement of 64 amino acids I do n’t know , a compromise between amino acid vocabulary and its error minimising efficiency may have fixed the genetic code in its current format . “
The latest edition of the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry has a comprehensive review of the evidence on whether cannabis contributes to causing psychotic mental illness – the best known being schizophrenia .
It has been known for a long time that there is a link between cannabis use and psychosis , but it was not known whether cannabis contributed to the development of psychosis , or whether people with psychosis were just more likely to smoke cannabis because it helps dispell some of the unpleasant emotions and feelings associated with the condition .
There is now good evidence that cannabis can contribute to the cause of psychosis , particularly during adolescence and early adulthood .
At a population level , this effect is detectable but small .
At the individual level , the effect seems to be quite variable .
Recent research has suggested that the risk of developing psychosis when using cannabis is heavily influenced by what version of the COMT gene a person has .
The main conclusions of the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry review are summarised in an editorial , but for those wanting the in - depth lowdown , the full paper is also available online .

Washington D.C. , February 14 , 2007 - The U.S. Central Command 's war plan for invading Iraq postulated in August 2002 that the U.S. would have only 5,000 troops left in Iraq as of December 2006 , according to the Command 's PowerPoint briefing slides , which were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and are posted on the Web today by the National Security Archive ( www.nsarchive.org).
The PowerPoint slides , prepared by CentCom planners for Gen. Tommy Franks under code name POLO STEP , for briefings during 2002 for President Bush , the NSC , Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , the JCS , and Franks ' commanders , refer to the " Phase IV " post - hostilities period as " UNKNOWN " and " months " in duration , but assume that U.S. forces would be almost completely " re-deployed " out of Iraq within 45 months of the invasion ( i.e. December 2006 ) .
" Completely unrealistic assumptions about a post - Saddam Iraq permeate these war plans , " said National Security Archive Executive Director Thomas Blanton .
" First , they assumed that a provisional government would be in place by ' D - Day ' , then that the Iraqis would stay in their garrisons and be reliable partners , and finally that the post - hostilities phase would be a matter of mere ' months ' .
All of these were delusions . "
The PowerPoint slides reflect the continuous debate over the size of the invasion force that took place within the Bush administration .
In late November 2001 , President Bush asked Rumsfeld about the status of plans for war with Iraq .
He asked for an updated approach , but did not want to attract attention .
Rumsfeld ordered Gen .
Franks to prepare a commander 's estimate of improvements needed , and Franks convened a planning group that adopted the codeword POLO STEP .
POLO STEP was a coded compartment created during the Clinton administration to encompass covert Iraq and counter - terrorism plans and activities .
In the mid-1990s , the compartment specifically included the targeting of Osama bin Laden .
Following the September 11 attacks , CentCom , among other military and national security components , used the designation to cover planning for the war in Iraq .
( Note 1 )
In mid-2002 , military analyst William Arkin obtained a leaked copy of a briefing on the Iraq plans and revealed the existence of POLO STEP in an op -ed for the Los Angeles Times ( June 23 , 2002 , p. M1 ) .
According to Arkin , the revelation unleashed the fury of Gen. Franks and Secretary Rumsfeld who immediately ordered a probe of the leak that lasted until the end of 2003 and subjected more than 1,000 military and contractor personnel to sometimes repeated questioning .
( Note 2 )
The slides in this Web posting are a compilation reflecting various iterations in war planning .
The U.S. government maintains plans for conflict with a multitude of possible adversaries .
The contingency operating plan for Iraq -- OPLAN 1003 - 98 -- had last been fully reviewed in 1996 and was updated in 1998 .
It envisioned an invasion force of more than 380,000 troops .
Former CentCom commander Gen. Anthony Zinni ( who saw gaps in the plan -- particularly in regard to the post - war order ) organized a war game -- Desert Crossing -- in 1999 to examine additional contingencies .
Under pressure from Secretary Rumsfeld for a leaner force ( according to accounts in books by Michael Gordon / Bernard Trainor , Thomas Ricks , and Bob Woodward ) , Zinni 's successor , Gen .
Franks , reduced the number to 275,000 in the commander 's estimate he gave to President Bush on December 28 , 2001 .
During the course of 2002 alternative versions of the plan were developed reflecting various assumptions about levels of allied support - -" robust " , " reduced " , or " unilateral " -- and about the amount of lead time available between the order to invade and the deployment of forces .
Under the Generated Start option Bush would have provided CentCom with 30 days notice for war , and 60 days to deploy .
Following Rumsfeld 's mandate to reduce deployment time to prepare for any contingency , Franks developed the alternative Running Start option : conflict would begin with escalating Red , White , and Blue air strikes followed by ground war as troops were deployed .
By mid-August 2002 a Hybrid concept had been developed -- the U.S. military would quickly mobilize forces in the region , initiate an air strike campaign , then launch a ground invasion .
One account written after the war points out a basic problem with the concept of scaled - down ground forces - a " contradiction " between ends and means ( Michael R. Gordon & Gen. Bernard Trainor , Cobra II , pp. 503-504 ) :
" Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , and Tommy Franks spent most of their time and energy on the least demanding task - defeating Saddam 's weakened conventional forces - and the least amount on the most demanding - rehabilitation of and security for the new Iraq .
The result was a surprising contradiction .
The United States did not have nearly enough troops to secure the hundreds of suspected WMD sites that had supposedly been identified in Iraq or to secure the nation 's long , porous borders .
Had the Iraqis possessed WMD and terrorist groups been prevalent in Iraq as the Bush administration so loudly asserted , U.S. forces might well have failed to prevent the WMD from being spirited out of the country and falling into the hands of the dark forces the administration had declared war against . "
In the end , Secretary of State Colin Powell and British Prime Minister Tony Blair persuaded President Bush that the U.S. needed to go to the U.N. to try to legitimize the invasion .
Diplomatic efforts over the next few months allowed more time for war preparations and the final option embraced by Rumsfeld - Lt. Gen.
David McKiernan 's Cobra II - was closer to Generated Start , the original plan , than the various iterations that were subsequently developed and are reflected in the declassified PowerPoint slides .
Lt. Gen. McKiernan later told Washington Post reporter Thomas Ricks ( Fiasco , p. 75 ) :
" It 's quite frustrating the way this works , but the way we do things nowadays is combatant commanders brief their products in PowerPoint up in Washington to OSD and Secretary of Defense ...
In lieu of an order , or a frag [ fragmentary ] order , or plan , you get a set of PowerPoint slides ... [ T ] hat is frustrating , because nobody wants to plan against PowerPoint slides . "
Retired Army Col. Andrew Bacevich told Ricks ( Fiasco , pp. 75-76 ) that PowerPoint war planning was the ultimate insult :
" Here may be the clearest manifestation of OSD's [ Office of Secretary of Defense ] contempt for the accumulated wisdom of the military profession and of the assumption among forward thinkers that technology -- above all information technology -- has rendered obsolete the conventions traditionally governing the preparation and conduct of war .
To imagine that PowerPoint slides can substitute for such means is really the height of recklessness . "
National Security Archive senior analyst Joyce Battle asked the U.S. Army under the FOIA in 2004 for documents related to the 2001 - 2003 debates over troop levels for the Iraq war .
In response , the Army referred the request to Central Command in 2005 ; and CentCom responded to the FOIA request in January 2007 with the declassified PowerPoint slides .
The slides were compiled at CentCom with tabs labeled " A " through " L " ( one slide is unlabeled ) .
The Web posting today reproduces the documents as they were released by CentCom , together with additional items prepared by the National Security Archive : a brief chronology of Iraq war planning based on secondary sources , a glossary of military acronyms ( essential for translating the otherwise cryptic references on the slides ) , and an introduction written by Ms. Battle .
The Bush administration , backed by Britain , has blocked efforts for an immediate halt to the fighting initiated at the UN security council , the G8 summit in St Petersburg and the European foreign ministers ' meeting in Brussels .
" It 's clear the Americans have given the Israelis the green light .
They [ the Israeli attacks ] will be allowed to go on longer , perhaps for another week , " a senior European official said yesterday .
Diplomatic sources said there was a clear time limit , partly dictated by fears that a prolonged conflict could spin out of control .
US strategy in allowing Israel this freedom for a limited period has several objectives , one of which is delivering a slap to Iran and Syria , who Washington claims are directing Hizbullah and Hamas militants from behind the scenes .
George Bush last night said that he suspected Syria was trying to reassert its influence in Lebanon .
Speaking in Washington , he said : " It 's in our interest for Syria to stay out of Lebanon and for this government in Lebanon to succeed and survive .
The root cause of the problem is Hizbullah and that problem needs to be addressed . "
Tony Blair yesterday swung behind the US position that Israel need not end the bombing until Hizbullah hands over captured prisoners and ends its rocket attacks .
During a Commons statement , he resisted backbench demands that he call for a ceasefire .
Echoing the US position , he told MPs : " Of course we all want violence to stop and stop immediately , but we recognise the only realistic way to achieve such a ceasefire is to address the underlying reasons why this violence has broken out . "
He also indicated it might take many months to agree the terms of a UN stabilisation force on the Lebanese border .
After Mr Blair spoke , British officials privately acknowledged the US had given Israel a green light to continue bombing Lebanon until it believes Hizbullah 's infrastructure has been destroyed .
Washington 's hands - off approach was underlined yesterday when it was confirmed that Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , is delaying a visit to the region until she has met a special UN team .
She is expected in the region on Friday , according to Dan Gillerman , Israel 's ambassador to the UN .
The US is publicly denying any role in setting a timeframe for Israeli strikes .
When asked whether the US was holding back diplomatically , Tony Snow , the White House 's press spokesman , said yesterday : " No , no ; the insinuation there is that there is active military planning , collaboration or collusion , between the United States and Israel - and there is n't ... the US has been in the lead of the diplomatic efforts , issuing repeated calls for restrain , t but at the same time putting together an international consensus .
You 've got to remember who was responsible for this : Hizbullah ...
It would be misleading to say the United States has n't been engaged .
We 've been deeply engaged . "
Steven Cook , a specialist in US - Middle East policy at the Washington - based Council on Foreign Relations , said : " It 's abundantly clear [ that US policy is ] to give the Israelis the opportunity to strike a blow at Hizbullah ...
" They have global reach , and prior to 9/11 they killed more Americans than any other group .
But the Israelis are overplaying their hand . "
Israel is already laying the ground for negotiations .
" We are beginning a diplomatic process alongside the military operation that will continue , " said Tzipi Livni , Israel 's foreign minister , yesterday .
" The diplomatic process is not meant to shorten the window of time of the army 's operation , but rather is meant to be an extension of it and to prevent a need for future military operations , " she added .
Moshe Kaplinsky , Israel 's deputy army chief , said the offensive could end within a few weeks , adding that Israel needed time to complete " clear goals " .
Israeli officials said fighting could begin to wind down after the weekend , if Hizbullah stops firing rockets .
A peace formula is also beginning to emerge : it includes an understanding on a future prisoner exchange , a deployment of the Lebanese army up to the Israeli border , a Hizbullah pullback , and the beefing up of an international monitoring force .
For the first time , Ms Livni suggested Israel might accept such a force on a temporary basis .
There were signs of differences of emphasis between the Foreign Office and Downing Street over the conflict .
Kim Howells , a Foreign Office minister , explicitly called for the US to rein in Israel .
" I very much hope the Americans will be putting pressure on the Israelis to stop as quickly as possible . " he told the BBC .
" We understand the pressure the Israeli government is under , but we call on them to look very carefully at the pressure ordinary people are under in southern Lebanon and other parts of Lebanon too ...
We want to stop this as quickly as possible " .
Israeli airstrikes killed 31 yesterday , including a family of nine in Aitaroun .
More than 230 civilians in Lebanon have been killed in the past week .
An Israeli man was killed by a Hizbullah rocket in Nahariya in northern Israel , bringing the total of Israeli civilian deaths to 13 .

In his # 1 bestseller , Stephen R. Covey presented a framework for personal effectiveness .
The following is a summary of the first part of his book , concluding with a list of the seven habits .
Inside - Out : The Change Starts from Within
While working on his doctorate in the 1970's , Stephen R. Covey reviewed 200 years of literature on success .
He noticed that since the 1920's , success writings have focused on solutions to specific problems .
In some cases such tactical advice may have been effective , but only for immediate issues and not for the long - term , underlying ones .
The success literature of the last half of the 20th century largely attributed success to personality traits , skills , techniques , maintaining a positive attitude , etc .
This philosophy can be referred to as the Personality Ethic .
However , during the 150 years or so that preceded that period , the literature on success was more character oriented .
It emphasized the deeper principles and foundations of success .
This philosophy is known as the Character Ethic , under which success is attributed more to underlying characteristics such as integrity , courage , justice , patience , etc .
The elements of the Character Ethic are primary traits while those of the Personality Ethic are secondary .
While secondary traits may help one to play the game to succeed in some specific circumstances , for long - term success both are necessary .
One 's character is what is most visible in long - term relationships .
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said , " What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I can not hear what you say . "
To illustrate the difference between primary and secondary traits , Covey offers the following example .
Suppose you are in Chicago and are using a map to find a particular destination in the city .
You may have excellent secondary skills in map reading and navigation , but will never find your destination if you are using a map of Detroit .
In this example , getting the right map is a necessary primary element before your secondary skills can be used effectively .
The problem with relying on the Personality Ethic is that unless the basic underlying paradigms are right , simply changing outward behavior is not effective .
We see the world based on our perspective , which can have a dramatic impact on the way we perceive things .
For example , many experiments have been conducted in which two groups of people are shown two different drawings .
One group is shown , for instance , a drawing of a young , beautiful woman and the other group is shown a drawing of an old , frail woman .
After the initial exposure to the pictures , both groups are shown one picture of a more abstract drawing .
This drawing actually contains the elements of both the young and the old woman .
Almost invariably , everybody in the group that was first shown the young woman sees a young woman in the abstract drawing , and those who were shown the old woman see an old woman .
Each group was convinced that it had objectively evaluated the drawing .
The point is that we see things not as they are , but as we are conditioned to see them .
Once we understand the importance of our past conditioning , we can experience a paradigm shift in the way we see things .
To make large changes in our lives , we must work on the basic paradigms through which we see the world .
The Character Ethic assumes that there are some absolute principles that exist in all human beings .
Some examples of such principles are fairness , honesty , integrity , human dignity , quality , potential , and growth .
Principles contrast with practices in that practices are for specific situations whereas principles have universal application .
The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People presents an " inside - out " approach to effectiveness that is centered on principles and character .
Inside - out means that the change starts within oneself .
For many people , this approach represents a paradigm shift away from the Personality Ethic and toward the Character Ethic .
Our character is a collection of our habits , and habits have a powerful role in our lives .
Habits consist of knowledge , skill , and desire .
Knowledge allows us to know what to do , skill gives us the ability to know how to do it , and desire is the motivation to do it .
The Seven Habits move us through the following stages :
Dependence : the paradigm under which we are born , relying upon others to take care of us .
Independence : the paradigm under which we can make our own decisions and take care of ourselves .
Interdependence : the paradigm under which we cooperate to achieve something that cannot be achieved independently .
Much of the success literature today tends to value independence , encouraging people to become liberated and do their own thing .
The reality is that we are interdependent , and the independent model is not optimal for use in an interdependent environment that requires leaders and team players .
To make the choice to become interdependent , one first must be independent , since dependent people have not yet developed the character for interdependence .
Therefore , the first three habits focus on self - mastery , that is , achieving the private victories required to move from dependence to independence .
The first three habits are :
Habit 1 : Be Proactive
Habit 2 : Begin with the End in Mind
Habit 3 : Put First Things First
Habits 4 , 5 , and 6 then address interdependence :
Habit 4 : Think Win/Win
Habit 5 : Seek First to Understand , Then to Be Understood
Habit 6 : Synergize
Finally , the seventh habit is one of renewal and continual improvement , that is , of building one 's personal production capability .
To be effective , one must find the proper balance between actually producing and improving one 's capability to produce .
Covey illustrates this point with the fable of the goose and the golden egg .
In the fable , a poor farmer 's goose began laying a solid gold egg every day , and the farmer soon became rich .
He also became greedy and figured that the goose must have many golden eggs within her .
In order to obtain all of the eggs immediately , he killed the goose .
Upon cutting it open he discovered that it was not full of golden eggs .
The lesson is that if one attempts to maximize immediate production with no regard to the production capability , the capability will be lost .
Effectiveness is a function of both production and the capacity to produce .
The need for balance between production and production capability applies to physical , financial , and human assets .
For example , in an organization the person in charge of a particular machine may increase the machine 's immediate production by postponing scheduled maintenance .
As a result of the increased output , this person may be rewarded with a promotion .
However , the increased immediate output comes at the expense of future production since more maintenance will have to be performed on the machine later .
The person who inherits the mess may even be blamed for the inevitable downtime and high maintenance expense .
Customer loyalty also is an asset to which the production and production capability balance applies .
A restaurant may have a reputation for serving great food , but the owner may decide to cut costs and lower the quality of the food .
Immediately , profits will soar , but soon the restaurant 's reputation will be tarnished , the customer 's trust will be lost , and profits will decline .
This does not mean that only production capacity is important .
If one builds capacity but never uses it , there will be no production .
There is a balance between building production capacity and actually producing .
Finding the right tradeoff is central to one 's effectiveness .
The above has been an introduction and overview of the 7 Habits .
The following introduces the first habit in Covey 's framework .
A unique ability that sets humans apart from animals is self - awareness and the ability to choose how we respond to any stimulus .
While conditioning can have a strong impact on our lives , we are not determined by it .
There are three widely accepted theories of determinism : genetic , psychic , and environmental .
Genetic determinism says that our nature is coded into our DNA , and that our personality traits are inherited from our grandparents .
Psychic determinism says that our upbringing determines our personal tendencies , and that emotional pain that we felt at a young age is remembered and affects the way we behave today .
Environmental determinism states that factors in our present environment are responsible for our situation , such as relatives , the national economy , etc .
These theories of determinism each assume a model in which the stimulus determines the response .
Viktor Frankl was a Jewish psychiatrist who survived the death camps of Nazi Germany .
While in the death camps , Frankl realized that he alone had the power to determine his response to the horror of the situation .
He exercised the only freedom he had in that environment by envisioning himself teaching students after his release .
He became an inspiration for others around him .
He realized that in the middle of the stimulus - response model , humans have the freedom to choose .
Animals do not have this independent will .
They respond to a stimulus like a computer responds to its program .
They are not aware of their programming and do not have the ability to change it .
The model of determinism was developed based on experiments with animals and neurotic people .
Such a model neglects our ability to choose how we will respond to stimuli .
We can choose to be reactive to our environment .
For example , if the weather is good , we will be happy .
If the weather is bad , we will be unhappy .
If people treat us well , we will feel well ; if they do n't , we will feel bad and become defensive .
We also can choose to be proactive and not let our situation determine how we will feel .
Reactive behavior can be a self - fulfilling prophecy .
By accepting that there is nothing we can do about our situation , we in fact become passive and do nothing .
The first habit of highly effective people is proactivity .
Proactive people are driven by values that are independent of the weather or how people treat them .
Gandhi said , " They can not take away our self respect if we do not give it to them . "
Our response to what happened to us affects us more than what actually happened .
We can choose to use difficult situations to build our character and develop the ability to better handle such situations in the future .
Proactive people use their resourcefulness and initiative to find solutions rather than just reporting problems and waiting for other people to solve them .
Being proactive means assessing the situation and developing a positive response for it .
Organizations can be proactive rather than be at the mercy of their environment .
For example , a company operating in an industry that is experiencing a downturn can develop a plan to cut costs and actually use the downturn to increase market share .
Once we decide to be proactive , exactly where we focus our efforts becomes important .
There are many concerns in our lives , but we do not always have control over them .
One can draw a circle that represents areas of concern , and a smaller circle within the first that represents areas of control .
Proactive people focus their efforts on the things over which they have influence , and in the process often expand their area of influence .
Reactive people often focus their efforts on areas of concern over which they have no control .
Their complaining and negative energy tend to shrink their circle of influence .
In our area of concern , we may have direct control , indirect control , or no control at all .
We have direct control over problems caused by our own behavior .
We can solve these problems by changing our habits .
We have indirect control over problems related to other people 's behavior .
We can solve these problems by using various methods of human influence , such as empathy , confrontation , example , and persuasion .
Many people have only a few basic methods such as fight or flight .
For problems over which we have no control , first we must recognize that we have no control , and then gracefully accept that fact and make the best of the situation .
SUMMARY OF THE SEVEN HABITS
Habit 1 : Be Proactive
Change starts from within , and highly effective people make the decision to improve their lives through the things that they can influence rather than by simply reacting to external forces .
Habit 2 : Begin with the End in Mind
Develop a principle - centered personal mission statement .
Extend the mission statement into long - term goals based on personal principles .
Habit 3 : Put First Things First
Spend time doing what fits into your personal mission , observing the proper balance between production and building production capacity .
Identify the key roles that you take on in life , and make time for each of them .
Habit 4 : Think Win/Win
Seek agreements and relationships that are mutually beneficial .
In cases where a " win/win " deal cannot be achieved , accept the fact that agreeing to make " no deal " may be the best alternative .
In developing an organizational culture , be sure to reward win / win behavior among employees and avoid inadvertantly rewarding win / lose behavior .
Habit 5 : Seek First to Understand , Then to Be Understood
First seek to understand the other person , and only then try to be understood .
Stephen Covey presents this habit as the most important principle of interpersonal relations .
Effective listening is not simply echoing what the other person has said through the lens of one 's own experience .
Rather , it is putting oneself in the perspective of the other person , listening empathically for both feeling and meaning .
Habit 6 : Synergize
Through trustful communication , find ways to leverage individual differences to create a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts .
Through mutual trust and understanding , one often can solve conflicts and find a better solution than would have been obtained through either person 's own solution .
Habit 7 : Sharpen the Saw
Take time out from production to build production capacity through personal renewal of the physical , mental , social / emotional , and spiritual dimensions .
Maintain a balance among these dimensions .
Misspellings in the U.S. Constitution
The Constitution was written in 1787 in the manner of the day — in other words , it was written by hand .
According to the National Archives , the version we are most familiar with today was penned by Jacob Shallus , a clerk for the Pennsylvania State Assembly .
In the document itself are several words which are misspelled .
Far from the days of spell checkers and easy edits , these misspellings survive in the document today .
Only one , though , is a glaringly obvious mistake .
In the list of signatories , the word " Pennsylvania " is spelled with a single N : " Pensylvania . "
This usage conflicts with a prior spelling , at Article 1 , Section 2 .
However , the single N was common usage in the 18th century — the Liberty Bell , for example , has the single N spelling inscribed upon it .
Another mistake , though less obvious , is a common one even today : the word " it's " is used in Article 1 , Section 10 , but the word " its " should have been used .
The most common mistake , at least to modern eyes , is the word " choose , " spelled " chuse " several times .
This is less a mistake than it is an alternate spelling used at the time .
The word is found in the Constitution as both " chuse " and " chusing . "
Finally , at that time , the American spelling of words was inconsistent at best , and several words are spelled in the British manner .
These words are " defence , " " controul , " and " labour . "
In America , we would today write these words as " defense , " " control , " and " labor . "
Most of the misspellings are in the original document , which was written hastily after the Convention concluded .
Aside from one use of British spelling in the Bill of Rights ( " defence " in the 6th ) , the amendments are all error - free .
The authors of the latter amendments all had the benefit of time to better proofread their work , and the benefit of a standardized American dictionary .
New students of the Constitution often see one more thing that raises eyebrows : the use of capital letters in the original text .
Some have even gone so far as to say that capitalized words in the original Constitution have some sort of special significance above and beyond the non-capitalized words .
This is only true in that most of the non-standard capitalization is done to nouns .
Again , this was an issue of style , and is similar to the way German capitalizes nouns — they are simply capitalized , and that 's all .
The words " People " and " State " have the exact same significance and meaning as " people " and " state " .
Many modern transcriptions of the Constitution remove this extra capitalization without changing the meaning of the document .

Recognized as one of the closest relatives to vertebrates , the colonial sea squirt Botrylloides leachi can regenerate an entire body from just a piece of blood vessel .
Our closest invertebrate relative , the humble sea squirt , can regenerate its entire body from just tiny blood vessel fragments , scientists now report .
The entire regeneration process , which in part resembles the early stages of embryonic development , can produce an adult sea squirt in as little as a week .
Video : Skimming the Seabed
The finding could illuminate not only the evolutionary origins of regeneration in all organisms , but also subsequent changes to it during vertebrate evolution .
Vertebrates ( animals with backbones ) such as salamanders are capable of regenerating limbs or tails , and even humans are capable of regenerating portions of skin , lungs and livers .
" However , in general , the more complex the animal , the lower the regeneration abilities are , relatively , " biologist Ram Reshef at Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa explained .
" No vertebrate could regenerate their whole bodies if you cut them in two . "
The ability to regenerate a whole body from a fragment is typically restricted to less complex invertebrates , such as sponges , worms and jellyfish .
Nonetheless , Reshef and his colleagues , including biologist Yuval Rinkevich , chose to look at the sea squirt Botrylloides leachi [ image ] , a more complex invertebrate , by carefully peeling off colonies from underneath stones in shallow waters along the Mediterranean coast of Israel .
The scientists found that " massive regeneration is not just confined to low complexity animals , but rather can take place in highly evolved animals , " Reshef told LiveScience .
Each colony is composed of up to thousands of genetically identical individuals , each two to three millimeters long and embedded in a gelatinous matrix .
A network of blood vessels connects all modules within a colony .
The scientists removed fragments of blood vessels from the colonies and placed them on microscope slides for investigation .
Each roughly one - millimeter - long fragment contained one or more ampullae , which are the pear - shaped endpoints of the vessels , as well as 100 to 300 blood cells .
Of 95 fragments , 80 regenerated an entire functional adult within one to three weeks .
The whole body regeneration process that the scientists witnessed proved unlike any recorded so far .
" When less complex groups regenerate their bodies , they do so through what we call a blastema , which is a kind of tissue that forms right at the place where you want to regenerate an organ or body , " Reshef said .
In contrast , the sea squirts did not employ blastemas .
Instead , regeneration began from dozens of tiny compartments loaded with stem cells , which the researchers dubbed regeneration niches .
" In mammals , many adult organs and tissues contain specific stem cells that are involved in repair and some restricted regeneration abilities , " Reshef said .
The regeneration niches helped form a hollow sphere that organized into a thin and thick layer on opposite sites , very similar to early stages of embryonic development .
As cells proliferated , this sphere folded over and over again , developing chambers and organs , with the end result being adults capable of sexual reproduction .
While the stem cells the researchers looked at are much like stem cells in adult mammals that give rise to our tissues and organs , " the huge difference is that they culminate in an entire organism , " Reshef said .
The most important implication of their finding is the possibility that vertebrate adult tissue stem cells may exhibit the same capabilities to generate any cell in the body , he added .
Reshef and his colleagues are currently teasing apart the molecular mechanisms by which the sea squirt accomplishes its whole body regeneration and to compare that process with similar mechanisms in other invertebrates and vertebrates .
" We speculate that vertebrates altered or suppressed parts or all of this ability , " Reshef said .
The scientists detailed their latest findings March 6 in the journal PLoS Biology .
US submarines currently rely on the Trident missile system The Bush administration has selected the design for America 's first new nuclear warhead in nearly two decades .
US officials say the warhead will not add to the country 's nuclear arsenal , but will replace existing missiles .
Critics have complained it sends the wrong signal at a time when the White House is leading efforts to curb Iran and North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
The chosen design was developed in a Californian laboratory and is based on a warhead already tested in the 1980s .
The US Congress authorised design work on a new warhead in 2005 on the basis that there would not be any fresh missile tests .
No nuclear underground tests have been conducted since a ban in 1992 .
The new warhead , due to be operational in five years ' time , will be used to replace Trident missiles on submarines .
' No arms race '
Making the announcement , US officials said the plan was simply to replace older , less reliable warheads with a safer version .
" This is not about starting a new nuclear arms race , " said Thomas P D'Agostino , acting head of the National Nuclear Security Administration ( NNSA ) .
Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory would now continue work on the design , costing and development of the programme , he said .
This could serve to encourage the very proliferation we are trying to prevent
Dianne Feinstein
Democratic Senator However , says the BBC's Jamie Coomarasamy in Washington , at a moment when the White House is trying to stop North Korea and Iran developing their nuclear programmes , some see the decision to press ahead with a new US warhead as sending an unfortunate mixed message .
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was among the critics in Congress .
" The minute you begin to put more sophisticated nuclear warheads on the existing fleet , you are essentially creating a new nuclear weapon .
And it 's just a matter of time before other nations do the same , " the Associated Press quotes her as saying .
" This could serve to encourage the very proliferation we are trying to prevent . "
Nuclear non-proliferation groups have also criticised the move , warning that it could lead to proliferation and saying there is no need to replace the US ' Cold War -era stockpile .
The NNSA has said the destruction of ageing warheads will mean that in five years ' time , the number held by the US will be at its lowest since the 1950s .

American high school students are taking tougher classes , getting better grades and , apparently , learning less than their counterparts of 15 years ago .
Those were the discouraging implications of two reports issued Thursday by the federal Department of Education , assessing the performance of students in public and private schools .
Together , the reports raised sobering questions about the past two decades of educational reform , including whether the movement to raise school standards has amounted to much more than window dressing .
“ I think we ’re sleeping through a crisis , ” said David P. Driscoll , the Massachusetts commissioner of education , during a Washington news conference convened by the Department of Education .
He called the study results “ stunning . ”
Bruce Fuller , a professor of education and public policy at UC Berkeley , said he found the results “ dismal . ”
After years of reforms aimed primarily at elementary schools , Fuller said the studies “ certainly support shining the spotlight on the high school as a priority for reform efforts . ”

The reports summarized two major government efforts to measure the performance of high school seniors as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
One was a standardized test of 12th graders conducted in 2005 .
The other was an analysis of transcripts of students who graduated from high school that year .
The transcript study showed that , compared to students in similar studies going back to 1990 , the 2005 graduates had racked up more high school credits , had taken more college preparatory classes and had strikingly higher grade point averages .
The average GPA rose from 2.68 in 1990 to 2.98 -- close to a solid B -- in 2005 .
That was the good news -- or so it seemed .
But the standardized test results showed that 12th - grade reading scores have generally been dropping since 1992 , casting doubt on what students are learning in those college prep classes .
Math scores posed a different sort of mystery , because the Department of Education switched to a new test in 2005 that was n’t directly comparable to those used before .
Still , the results of the new test did n’t inspire confidence :
Fewer than one - quarter of the 12th graders tested scored in the “ proficient ” range .

The reports also showed that the gap separating white students from black and Latino students has barely budged since the early 1990s .
And although the results were not broken down by state , a broad regional breakdown showed that the West and Southeast lagged well behind the Midwest and , to a lesser extent , the Northeast .
David Gordon , the Sacramento County superintendent of schools and a participant in the Department of Education news conference Thursday , said he found it especially disturbing that the studies focused on “ our best students , ” those who had made it to 12th grade or who had graduated .
“ It ’s clear to me from these data that for all of our talk of the achievement gap among subgroups of students , a larger problem may be an instructional gap or a rigor gap , which affects not just some but most of our students , ” Gordon said .
The reading and math test was given to 21,000 high school seniors at 900 schools across the country , including 200 private schools .
The transcript study was based on 26,000 transcripts from 720 schools , 80 of them private .
The reports did not give separate results for public versus private schools .

Policy analysts nationwide said the studies were gloomy news for the American economy , since the country ’s educational system already measured poorly in international comparisons .
“ What we see out of these results is a very disturbing picture of the knowledge and skills of the young people about to go into college and the workforce , ” said Daria Hall , assistant director of the Education Trust , a Washington - based nonprofit dedicated to improving education , especially for poor and minority students .
Among other things ,
Hall said , the transcript study provided clear evidence of grade inflation , as well as “ course inflation ” -- offering high - level courses that have “ the right names ” but a dumbed - down curriculum .
“ What it suggests is that we are telling students that they ’re being successful in these courses when , in fact , we ’re not teaching them any more than they were learning in the past , ” she said .
“ So we are , in effect , lying to these students . ”

Although the reports came out five years after passage of President Bush ’s signature education reform initiative , No Child Left Behind , Hall and others said it would be unfair to blame that program for the students ’ poor showing .
They were already in high school when No Child Left Behind was enacted , and it is primarily aimed at elementary and middle schools .
Driscoll recalled an earlier president ’s contribution to education reform -- the Nation at Risk report that seemed to galvanize the educational establishment when it was issued by President Reagan in 1983 .
“ That was a shocker , ” said Driscoll .
“ But here we are , 25 years later [ and ] ... we ’ve just been ignoring what it ’s going to take to really change the system . ”
In a statement issued by her office , Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings said Thursday that the two reports “ show that we have our work cut out for us in providing every child in this nation with a quality education . ”

Snack on Russell Brand 's video diary
Three YouTube channels - one for news and two for entertainment - will showcase short clips of BBC content .
The BBC hopes that the deal will help it reach YouTube 's monthly audience of more than 70 million users and drive extra traffic to its own website .
The corporation will also get a share of the advertising revenue generated by traffic to the new YouTube channels .
Three deals in one
The deal with Google - non-exclusive and set to run for several years - will establish three different YouTube services :
BBC : One of the BBC's two entertainment channels will be a " public service " proposition , featuring no advertising .
It will show clips like trailers and short features that add value - for example , video diaries of David Tennant showing viewers around the set of Dr Who or BBC correspondent Clive Myrie explaining how difficult it is to report from the streets of Baghdad .
The channel 's main purpose is to popularise current programming and drive traffic back to the BBC 's own website , and point the audience to the BBC 's pages , where they can watch or download programmes in full , once the BBC Trust approves the corporation 's catch - up television proposal , called iPlayer .
The BBC 's channels are on YouTube 's partner pages
One of the BBC's two entertainment channels will be a " public service " proposition , featuring no advertising .
BBC Worldwide :
The second entertainment channel will feature self - contained clips - about three to six minutes long - mining popular programmes in the BBC 's archive .
Excerpts from Top Gear , The Mighty Boosh and nature programmes presented by David Attenborough are top candidates for this channel .
This YouTube page will carry advertising such as banner adverts , and possibly pre-roll adverts ( shown as part of the video clip ) as well .
Controversially , the BBC Worldwide page - adverts and all - can be seen in the UK .
BBC
Worldwide insists that this is not a new departure , as BBC magazines like Top Gear and channels like BBC World and UK Living ( which shows mainly BBC content ) already do carry advertising .
The second entertainment channel will feature self - contained clips - about three to six minutes long - mining popular programmes in the BBC 's archive .
Excerpts from Top Gear , The Mighty Boosh and nature programmes presented by David Attenborough are top candidates for this channel .
BBC
News :
The news channel , which will be launched later this year , will show about 30 news clips per day .
It will be advertising funded like a similar deal with Yahoo USA .
BBC
News is also offered to non-UK subscribers of Real Networks .
Because of the advertising , these clips can be seen outside the UK only .
Any UK users clicking on a link to one of the news clips on YouTube will get a message that they have no access to this clip .
Groundbreaking - and controversial
The BBC , now a " director " on YouTube
The BBC 's director general , Mark Thompson , called the deal a " ground - breaking partnership " that would " engage new audiences in the UK and abroad " .
The BBC 's director of Future Media and Technology , Ashley Highfield , said the deal was " not about distributing content like full - length programmes ; YouTube is a promotional vehicle for us " .
In the United States , several television programmes experienced a discernible audience increase after they made clips available on YouTube .
But the deal is likely to be controversial with other media companies , who have accused the BBC of straying from its licence - fee funded public service remit and moving too far into commercial web ventures .
Copyright protection
Several large US broadcasters , including CBS , NBC and Fox , already have similar agreements with YouTube .
YouTube makes it easy for members not only to watch and share video clips , but also to upload their own content .
However , the site is riddled with pirated film and music clips uploaded by members who do not own the copyright .
Some media firms , most prominently Viacom , have recently demanded that YouTube removes tens of thousands of clips from the site that they own the copyright for .
Mr Highfield said the BBC would not be hunting down all BBC - copyrighted clips already uploaded by YouTube members - although it would reserve the right for example to swap poor quality clips with the real thing , or to have content removed that infringed other people 's copyright , like sport , or that had been edited or altered in a way that would damage the BBC 's brand .
" We do n't want to be overzealous , a lot of the material on YouTube is good promotional content for us , " he said .
However , the BBC , like other broadcasters , is working with video sharing sites like YouTube to improve the way in which copyrighted material is identified and taken down .
YouTube was founded in February 2005 and was bought by Google in November last year for $ 1.65 bn .
In January , one of YouTube 's three founders , Chad Hurley , announced that the website would soon start sharing revenue with the thousands of users who upload their own content to YouTube .
Elementary Calculus : An Infinitesimal Approach
On-line Edition .
Copyright © 2000 by H. Jerome Keisler , revised August 2020 .
This is a calculus textbook at the college Freshman level based on Abraham Robinson 's infinitesimals , which date from 1960 .
Robinson 's modern infinitesimal approach puts the intuitive ideas of the founders of the calculus on a mathematically sound footing , and is easier for beginners to understand than the more common approach via epsilon , delta definitions .
The First Edition of this book was published in 1976 , and a revised Second Edition was published in 1986 , both by Prindle , Weber & Schmidt .
When the Second Edition became out of print , the copyright was returned to me as the author .
In September 2002 I decided to make the book available for free in electronic form at this site .
These PDF files were made from the printed Second Edition , and are continually being revised with minor corrections .
A Third Edition of this book was published by Dover Publications , Inc. in 2012 , with the agreement that this online version will continue to be freely available .
This gives you the choice of downloading this free version or purchasing the printed book .

Russian guys makes knives made of sapphire .
These knives can be easily taken inside the airplane in your handbag , for example if you care about your right to use your knife anywhere you want .
These knives cannot be discovered by any sort of metal - detector , they have none metal parts at all .
Their blades are being made from artificial sapphire , the same material that is being used to make non-scratchable watches by leading Swiss brands .
Handles are made of the bone .
Only diamonds exceed it in the hardness , so anybody can easily make his name carved on the airplanes bull ’s - eye airplane window .
It scratches glass without any difficulty and can be sharpened only with special diamond whetstone .

BarbinMD wrote about this on Wednesday , but I want to bring it up again because it represents , yet again , one of the central incompetences of the Bush administration .
Dick Cheney says :
With respect to Iraq , I think he 's dead wrong .
I think , in fact , if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Murtha are suggesting , all we 'll do is validate the al Qaeda strategy .
The al Qaeda strategy is to break the will of the American people -- in fact , knowing they can't win in a stand - up fight , try to persuade us to throw in the towel and come home , and then they win because we quit .
What 's infuriating , here , is that Richard Cheney is one of the three or four men in America most responsible for validating the al Qaeda strategy .
Through his strategizing , along with that of Donald Rumsfeld and whatever stray thoughts manage to rattle their way loose of George W. Bush himself , he has managed to hand Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda the closest thing to post - 9/11 successes they could have possibly asked for .
And the key word , in this entire debacle , is Afghanistan .
Like most Americans , I considered American actions in Afghanistan to be a dismal but necessary act .
An attack on United States soil requires , unequivocally , a disproportionate response ; a valid military response in this case would have indeed been a removal of the Taliban from power , the complete and total removal of al Qaeda from Afghanistan and in any other countries in which they had found refuge , and a generous reconstruction of Afghanistan in such a fashion as to ensure al Qaeda 's continued inability to function there , thus demonstrating that terrorism against the United States would both fail in its purpose , and would result in disproportionate damage to the terrorists and hostile nations responsible .
That 's how you prevent terrorism : you make the consequences worse than the possible upside .
That proposition , supported by nearly all Americans , lasted mere months , however , before the Bush administration 's eyes wandered away from the actual fight against al Qaeda and supporters and towards a large scale proxy war advocated by Rumsfeld and by neoconservative strategists looking to transfer American attention to the war they had wanted to fight , rather than the war they were actually in .
The relatively small number of troops that had been committed to Afghanistan were drawn off to prepare for a larger Iraq conflict , including special forces tasked directly with tracking bin Laden .
At no point was Afghanistan on the road to sure recovery : the Taliban remains a force in the country to this day .
From the start , Iraq was at minimum a distraction from al Qaeda .
But in practice , it was clearly and predictably worse , and Dick Cheney was one of the prime architects of the strategic American failure that followed .
Al Qaeda had several major goals , if you believe most non-neocon experts , in their terrorist attacks on America , and primary among them was to provoke a widespread war with the United States in the Middle East .
Such a war could act as a focus for Arab nationalism , a tool of jihad to rally the religious , a recruitment device for building a larger al Qaeda , and in the end a nexus point around which Arabs could build bin Laden 's particular religious and nationalistic vision of a dominant Muslim state .
Iraq , of course , was exactly the kind of response they dreamed of provoking .
And it worked in spectacular fashion , and through U.S. incompetence worked better than they could have ever hoped .
As Dick Cheney has pointed out over and over , bin Laden especially believes that Americans can be defeated as the Russians were , because America is not willing to commit the kind of resources to the Middle East that would outlast nationalistic Arab fighters .
Cheney and Rumsfeld proved his point , more than any other Americans .
They proved that the U.S. administration did not have the willpower to fight al Qaeda in Afghanistan ; did not have the attention for it ; would not commit the resources to it ; would not take the necessary actions to prevent an al Qaeda and Taliban return .
This will be , if we face a new generation of al Qaeda - based terrorism , the primary legacy of the Bush administration .
In Iraq too , however , the Rumsfeld doctrine was largely one assured to end in fiasco .
In Iraq , too , an entirely insufficient force was dedicated to the job : while the initial tactical victory was assured from the beginning , each of the subsequent neoconservative premises failed , like dominoes , throughout the rest of the conflict .
There were insufficient coalition forces to police the nation , resulting in reprisal killings and rising unrest in nearly all regions of the country .
The complete disbanding of the Iraqi Army removed one of the few potential stabilizing forces .
Reconstruction efforts were handled so badly as to have not even kept up with the continuing destruction of infrastructure .
And sectarian religious divisions were , it seems , entirely discounted as a possible outcome .
Even the current " surge " is nothing more than more of the same : a token shuffling of forces in numbers seemingly having no relation to the actual scope of the problem ; a single garden hose tasked with stopping a raging forest fire .
Even if you bought the premise shared by both al Qaeda and the neoconservatives -- that a proxy war in Iraq was a damn fine idea -- there is no credible way to examine the administration strategy in Iraq and declare it sound .
Each and every failure of the war was predicted in advance by war critics : none were surprising .
if we were to accept the premise of the centrality and critical importance of the Iraq war , we would have expected it to have been executed in a competent fashion and with tactical metrics for success that consisted of something more substantive than " not leaving . "
The only thing more criminal than starting a war is being unable to finish one .
Even if you presume for some small moment that there is some small good to be done from prosecuting a war , whatever promise of " good " you may assert evaporates with every life lost , on either side .
Given that , we cannot look at the administration - led tactics in Iraq as anything but bungling .
They either do not believe the war to be as central as they argue it to be , or they do believe it to be central , and yet are incompetent in the execution .
Here , then , is the most damning condemnation of administration policy in Iraq , and why Cheney , Rumsfeld , Kristol , Feith and others have no cause for presuming any Americans have been of anywhere near the assistance to al Qaeda that they themselves have been .
In Iraq , we have chosen to fight the fight al Qaeda wanted to fight .
In Afghanistan , we were fighting al Qaeda on their own doorstep , dismantling their own bases of support and safe haven .
Even before the last shots fell to the ground at Tora Bora , though , our own administration lost apparent interest in the outcome .
It is the height -- the height -- of military fiasco to withdraw from a fight at the gates of the enemy 's core base and turn your attention to fighting them in a proxied war of attrition far away from their infrastructure and vital networks of support .
No military commander worth the polish on his shoes would propose such a thing : anyone who actually executed such a bungling move would be removed from the ranks of leadership forthwith and put back to captaining a laundry ship .
And yet America and the neoconservatives have chosen exactly that proxied war , a war destined to do the core of al Qaeda and other extremists little possible harm and have myriad possible benefits for them , and have bungled even that .
You could not have done al Qaeda a better favor if you had actively tried .
The neoconservatives have walked , entirely on their own accord , into handing terrorism two separate victories : the victory of making an attack on American soil a survivable achievement , for a terrorist movement , and the victory of subsequently engaging the terrorists in the very action they had been attempting to provoke .
Pundits and politicians continue , stupidly , to presume American lack of support for the Iraq debacle to either be born of pacifism or partisanship .
Neither is true , as was clearly demonstrated in the widespread support for the American actions Afghanistan directly precipitated by 9/11 .
Lack of support for the Iraq war was and still is predicated on the rather simple observation that our actions in Iraq have been at best ancillary to , and at worst devastatingly wounding to the actual " war on terrorism " .
One of my own motivations for a withdrawal from Iraq is for the goal of refocusing the " war on terror " to cells of actual terrorism , including returning the necessary number of troops to Afghanistan to solidify an anti-Taliban government there permanently -- if it , too , is not too late .
At this point , it may well be .
In any case , Dick Cheney has , as a national security strategist of any sort , proven to be an absolute and abject failure .
The strategy against terrorism implemented by the Bush administration has gone from mildly half - assed to concretely destructive , all captured on videotape so that the entire planet can see it , and in the meantime , Cheney of all people has the audacity to opine on the intelligence and patriotism of those that point out his own incompetence .
Add simple human indecency to the charges history will level against the man , then .
There is no reason to believe his personal character to be of any higher fiber than the rest of him .
「 digg.com」の生みの親であるKevin Roseにインタビューを行い、現在の人気、スパムとの戦い、集団思考に関する最近の懸念、まもなく登場するパーソナライズ機能などについて話を聞いた。前編と後編に分けて、その内容をお届けする。
digg.comは、この半年の間にITギークの間で「Slashdot」に迫る人気を博すようになったテクノロジー系のニュースサイトだ。Slashdotでは編集者がコンテンツを管理しているが、diggの運営はコミュニティに任されている。ユーザーの投稿がdiggのトップページを飾るかどうかは、他のユーザーの「票（digg）」をいくつ獲得したかによって決まる。diggはこれを「非階層的な編集方式」と呼んでいるが、そこにはSlashdotに対する明らか皮肉が込められている。
しかし数週間ほど前から、このユーザー主導のシステムにもほころびが見え始めた。「集団の英知」も、時によっては単なる「群集心理」にすぎないのではないか--そんなうがった見方も登場しつつある。筆者も2度ほど、diggのシステムに批判的な記事を書いた。最初の記事はスパムに対するdiggの過剰反応（と私が当時感じたもの）について、2度目はdiggユーザーがO'Reillyの無実のライターをつるし上げ、議論を呼んだときのものだ。どちらの場合も、私はこのシステムに疑問を感じざるをえなかったが、diggが持つ可能性には今でも魅力を感じている。
これらの問題の根本原因を明らかにするためには、作り手に話を聞くのが一番だ。その意味で、diggを始めたKevin Roseがインタビューに応じてくれたことに感謝したい。インタビューの内容は2回に分けて掲載する。下記はその前編だ。
ティッピングポイント（臨界点）
--diggはいつ、どのようにして始まったのですか。
サイトの構築に着手したのは2004年10月です。仲間とdiggのアイディアを練り始めたのは、その2カ月ほど前からですが、diggのベータ版というべきものに実際に取りかかったのは10月初旬でした。サイトが公開されたのは2004年12月5日です。
--人気に火がつき、ユーザー数が爆発的に増えたのはいつ頃ですか。今やdiggは大変な人気サイトですが、人気が臨界点に達するまでにはどのくらいかかったのでしょうか。
これほど人気になるとは思ってもいませんでした。diggは私が趣味のプロジェクトとして始めたもので、「決定権と管理権をユーザーの手に戻したらどうなるか」を実験するためのものでした。テクノロジー系のニュースサイトでは、少数の編集者がどの情報を記事にするか、読者はどんな情報を知りたがっているのかを判断するのが普通です。その日のトップニュースを選ぶ権利をユーザーに与えたのは、diggが最初でした。
最初の数カ月間は、diggのコンセプトをどう具体化するかに頭を悩ませました。diggのトップページにアクセスすると、まずは票の数が目に入ります。しかし、初めてdiggを訪れた人には、投票することの意味や、投票結果が自分のプロフィールに反映される仕組みは分かりません。diggで行った活動はすべて、RSSフィードの形で保存され、友人と共有することができます。ユーザー数はすでにクリティカルマスに達していますが、新しいユーザーが増えるほど、diggの価値は高まります。
digg人気の高まりを肌で感じるようになったのは2005年の2月から3月のことでした。ブレイクのひとつのきっかけとなったのは、パリス・ヒルトンの携帯電話ハッキング事件です。パリスの携帯電話に保存されていた画像とデータが盗まれ、ネット上で公開されたというニュースが出たとき、誰かが深夜にこの記事へのリンクをdiggに投稿しました。この投稿は多くの人の興味を引いたため、あっという間にdiggのトップページに表示されました。その晩のうちに、diggは「パリス ヒルトン 携帯電話 ハッキング 」というキーワード でGoogle とYahooのインデックスに登録され、翌朝目が覚めてみると、diggへの大量のトラフィックが発生していました・・・数十万人がこれらのキーワードで検索を行い、最初に表示されたdiggのサイトを訪れていたからです。これは本当に奇妙な出来事でしたが、はからずも、参加型のニュースサイトが持つ力を実感させられることになりました。

Starling Car Wash
Animal Stories from All - Creatures.org
Change is in the Air !
[ Not original title - - it came from cyberspace too ! ]
A Bird Story from Cyberspace sent our way by Glenn Barlow
who received it from an unknown source , and
submitted to all - creatures by Connie Young - 13 Jul 2002
January 2012
Bill owns a company that manufactures and installs car wash systems .
Magic Wand Car Wash Systems just in case you want to buy one .
Bill 's company installed a car wash system in Frederick , Md. for a gentleman .
Now understand that these are a complete system including the money changer and money taking machines .
The problem started when the new owner complained to Bill that he was losing significant amounts of money from his coin machines each week .
He went as far as to accuse Bill 's employees of having a key to the boxes and ripping him off .
Bill just could n't believe that his people would do that .
So they set up a [ photo ] trap for the thief .
Well , they caught the thief in the act !
Scroll down to see the thief .
The bird had to go down in the machine and back up to get to the money !
That 's three quarters he has in his mouth !
( Below )
Another amazing thing Bill told us is that it was not one bird ; there were several working together .
Once they identified the thief , they found over $ 4000 in quarters on the roof of the car wash and more under a nearby tree .
Editor Note :
This is not a story of a gang of criminal starlings , but a story of curiosity about some birds and their attraction to shiny objects .
( We have heard of ravens , crows , and an unknown tropical bird taking and collecting shiny objects , too . )
We surmise that a starling was attracted to the glint of the sun on a quarter that a person was putting into the machine , or when taking out his or her change .
Seeing the place where the shiny objects " appeared " , the starling went to investigate , and discovered that he ( males seem to do this to attract a female ) could remove the quarter and take it back to his nest or courting place .
Not wanting to be out - romanced , other starlings learned from the original " inventive " fellow how to get " their own " quarters , which shows the intelligence and learning ability of birds .
Feather Forestwalker sent us the following explanation :
Starlings will clear out a chosen nest cavity before attempting to attract a mate through song and wing - waving .
This is a male starling in the photo ( noted by the blue base at the beak - a female 's would be pink , no kidding ) , and when he is finished clearing a cavity he will sit and sing and wing - wave until a female is attracted .
Unfortunately for this male starling , his efforts at clearing his chosen cavity were thwarted by all the customers at the car wash . :)
Poor birdie .
He 's not a relative of the crow , magpie , jay or raven and is therefore not as attracted to colorful or shiny objects ( as even the Australian Bower birds are ) , but instead , had found what he thought was the " perfect " nest cavity in which to raise a family .
He just kept clearing it out every day and if the folks who'd caught him on camera had pointed their camera instead at a high point nearby during his " intermissions , " they would have seen him sitting there singing and wing - waving .
.
.until the next round of " debris removal " .

Book says Bush just using Christians
Washington , D.C .
10/12/06
More than five years after President Bush created the Office of Faith - Based Initiatives , the former second - in - command of that office is going public with an insider 's tell - all account that portrays an office used almost exclusively to win political points with both evangelical Christians and traditionally Democratic minorities .
The office 's primary mission , providing financial support to charities that serve the poor , never got the presidential support it needed to succeed , according to the book .
Entitled " Tempting Faith , " the book is not scheduled for release until Oct. 16 , but MSNBC's " Countdown with Keith Olbermann " has obtained a copy .
" Tempting Faith 's " author is David Kuo , who served as special assistant to the president from 2001 to 2003 .
A self - described conservative Christian , Kuo's previous experience includes work for prominent conservatives including former Education Secretary and federal drug czar Bill Bennett and former Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Kuo , who has complained publicly in the past about the funding shortfalls , goes several steps further in his new book .
He says some of the nation 's most prominent evangelical leaders were known in the office of presidential political strategist Karl Rove as " the nuts . "
" National Christian leaders received hugs and smiles in person and then were dismissed behind their backs and described as ' ridiculous , ' ' out of control , ' and just plain ' goofy , ' " Kuo writes .
More seriously , Kuo alleges that then - White House political affairs director Ken Mehlman knowingly participated in a scheme to use the office , and taxpayer funds , to mount ostensibly " nonpartisan " events that were , in reality , designed with the intent of mobilizing religious voters in 20 targeted races .
According to Kuo , " Ken loved the idea and gave us our marching orders . "
Among those marching orders , Kuo says , was Mehlman 's mandate to conceal the true nature of the events .
Kuo quotes Mehlman as saying , " . ( I ) t ca n't come from the campaigns .
That would make it look too political .
It needs to come from the congressional offices .
We 'll take care of that by having our guys call the office [ of faith - based initiatives ] to request the visit . "
Nineteen out of the 20 targeted races were won by Republicans , Kuo reports .
The outreach was so extensive and so powerful in motivating not just conservative evangelicals , but also traditionally Democratic minorities , that Kuo attributes Bush 's 2004 Ohio victory " at least partially . to the conferences we had launched two years before . "
With the exception of one reporter from the Washington Post , Kuo says the media were oblivious to the political nature and impact of his office 's events , in part because so much of the debate centered on issues of separation of church and state .
In fact , the Bush administration often promoted the faith - based agenda by claiming that existing government regulations were too restrictive on religious organizations seeking to serve the public .
Substantiating that claim proved difficult , Kuo says .
" Finding these examples became a huge priority ..
If President Bush was making the world a better place for faith - based groups , we had to show it was really a bad place to begin with .
But , in fact , it was n't that bad at all . "
In fact , when Bush asks Kuo how much money was being spent on " compassion " social programs , Kuo claims he discovered " we were actually spending about $ 20 million a year less on them than before he had taken office . "
The money that was appropriated and disbursed , however , often served a political agenda , Kuo claims .
" Many of the grant - winning organizations that rose to the top of the process were politically friendly to the administration , " he says .
More pointedly , Kuo quotes an unnamed member of the review panel charged with rating grant applications .
" But , " she said with a giggle , ' When I saw one of those non-Christian groups in the set I was reviewing , I just stopped looking at them and gave them a zero ... a lot of us did . ' "
" Tempting Faith " contains several other controversial claims about Kuo's office , the Bush White House and even the 1994 Republican revolution in Congress .

My husband was a NYC firefighter , working on 9/11 .
I thought he was dead all day .
He was okay , but then got sick from the poisonous air down there that the EPA told us was fine .
I knew it was NOT fine , and berated him to wear his gear , flimsy as it was , and he still ended up with asthma .
So when the administration began beating the drumbeats of war , I could not stand the thought of something terrible happening , such as a mushroom cloud , to my city , or another city .
I just could not survive it .
So when I thought about a nuclear weapon from Hussein 's WMDs being used , I said , " Well , I do n't like it , but I think we have to do it . "
I was not alone in this .
Many of my family and friends bought into this lie also .
We could NOT imagine the administration lying to us about something as important , and deadly , as a push to war .
It never occurred to us that anyone in this country could be so evil as to use the tragedy of 9/11 , the tragedy of my husband and thousands of others who were even worse off than we were , to push for a war based on a lie .
I was stunned and ashamed when I found out , bit by bit , what had occurred .
Was I uninformed ?
Of course I was - I was a Republican .
But more importantly to me , personally , is that I saw the truth when I found out they lied about the WMDs and about the air at Ground Zero .
They allowed those rescue workers down there to clean up so they could get Wall Street open again .
I firmly believe this .
These workers lives were sacrificed to keep the gears of money oiled , and then they bought them off with some money from the infamous " Victim's Compensation Fund . "
From that conclusion , it was an easy step to look at the lies that got us into Iraq .
The lies that many of our Democrats echoed , and supported , and created .
And the lies that I , as an American , have supported for most of my life .
So why am I telling this story once again , when I am sure some of you who have heard it before are rolling your eyes .
Because I see that many of our candidates for ' 08 seem to not have learned the lessons that I , a dumb civilian , have learned .
This is the reason why I am so uncomfortable with Hillary Clinton .
Her reluctance to admit she was wrong , using the personal pronoun " I , " makes me feel she does not deserve my vote .
Her support by big money candidates makes me uncomfortable as well , as I live with the rush to get Wall Street open when it was not safe for the rescue workers to be down there .
John Edwards , at least he has admitted his error , but he seems to not have learned to apply his lessons to Iran .
I , a dumb civilian , have learned much more , it seems , when Iran is discussed .
I know that any attack against Iran will harm us just as much , and that we may have to learn to live with a nuclear Iran , much the same way we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union .
We tell them , " You bomb Israel , or anyone else , and we will destroy every inch of your country . "
Even the Iranians would see no benefit in harming Israel .
This is what kept us from killing each other during the Cold War , and we can do it again if we have intelligent leaders .
So with some of our top candidates seemingly beholden to military solutions and big business , is it too much for the Democratic Party to tell the big corporate donors , the media and the powers that be to buzz off , and let us pick our own candidate ?
And more importantly , how do we do that ?
How do we get rid of Clinton , and Mr. Bankruptcy Bill Joe Biden , and any other pro-war , corporate - owned Democrat ?
I find myself nodding in agreement with OPOL all of the time now , which is remarkable , since less than 3 years ago , I was a nonthinking republican .
I do n’t know if I ’ve posted about this before , but it keeps coming up over and over again with people I talk who want to start a businesses , invest in real estate , start new projects , etc .
Either they do n’t have a new novel idea to start with , or if they do , they think the idea is worth a mint .
The reality is that both of these preconceptions are dead wrong !
Ideas are worth very little , it ’s the execution that ’s worth it ’s weight in gold !
Let ’s think about this a little …
How many times have you heard someone say something like “ I thought of that years ago .
I should be a millionaire ” .
I know I ’ve heard it a lot .
The reality is that 99.99 % of the general population does n’t follow through with their ideas , at least not much past the first few months .
Most people are n’t willing to put in the effort it takes to get an idea off the ground .
And make no mistake about it , it takes effort .
By the way , health gyms are notorious for using this to their advantage .
They get you to buy a year membership , with an initiation fee , knowing full well that the majority of their members will stop using the facilities within a few months .
Are you one of these people ?
I can also tell you that I come up with potentially successful business ideas every day .
The problem is that I ca n’t try them all out .
You need to focus on one idea and push through it because it will take time for it to come to fruition .
If you decide to invest in real estate , than expect it to take you many properties and deals before you can retire , you wo n’t retire on one golden deal ( also you probably wo n’t have the experience to know what a golden deal is without some experience ) .
In business the same is true , it takes time for a business to gain momentum and get off the ground .
Do n’t keep moving from project to project , which is easy to do as soon as you hit a speed bump or when you think of something new and exciting .
If you study psychology at all ( or probably through common sense ) , you ’ll know that people like novelty more than repetition , so it ’s very easy to get sidetracked .
On the other side of the coin , you have those who think they need to come up with a golden idea to make it .
They think that everything ’s done and there ’s nothing they can do .
Guess again , there ’s lots of things everyone can do , you just need to put your mind to it .
And please do n’t ask me what you can do , that ’s what you have to come up with yourself .
Make that your first goal !
Come up with an idea .
Now do n’t think it has to be original , it does n’t .
Just look at what ’s happening in your area of interest , see what others are doing , look at who ’s succeeding , and see if there ’s more room in the market for you .
How many grocery chains are there , movie rental chains , real estate investors , software companies , chocolate bar producers , tv shows , etc .
You do n’t need to be original , you just need to look at it from a slightly different angle .
Maybe a higher quality , cheaper price , best locally , fastest , better service , etc .
The next major obstacle I often hear is that I do n’t have enough money to get going .
The reality is that if you think too big to start , than absolutely you do n’t have the money .
You might need to start smaller and grow from there .
If you ’re a real estate investor , start with a single resident home instead of with an apartment complex .
Maybe one in a more affordable community .
If it ’s a business , look at something that can be started with your current capital .
It can be as simple as a web service , a blog , a software application .
You could even sell cookies , a lot of large companies have started this way .
Who ’s familiar with the purple dinosaur Barney ?
How many of you know it was started by a mother ( Sheryl Leach ) in 1987 as home videos she wrote and filmed herself because she was dissatisfied with the selection of home videos on the market to amuse her own son ?
She produced three “ Barney and the Backyard Gang ” videos and marketed then to day - care centers and video stores until they were finally discovered by a PBS director in 1991 .
And the rest , to quote a cliche , is history .
So what are the steps to success ?
1 . Get started !
That means now !
We all have things happening in our lives , it ’s just a matter of priorities .
If you can find the time to watch any TV , then you can find the time to get started .
I can tell you right now that for me it ’s 11:15 pm right now ( actually I ’m now revising this entry , minus some LandlordMax related sidetracks , and it ’s 12:35 am now ) and I ’ll be up on the computer for at least another hour or two working ( as I ’ve just confirmed ) .
I live by the principle of work extremely hard for 5 or so years and then completely relax for the rest of my life rather than work moderatly for my whole life .
So get started , find the time , it ’s there .
2 . It ’s a marathon , not a sprint .
That is , stay the course .
Yes , you ’re all pumped and the first 2 - 3 weeks go flying by .
You get some work done but suddenly its your friends wedding on the weekend .
One weekend is n’t so bad .
But the next thing you know you have a party you just have to attend , a supper , a celebration , a birthday .
And then there ’s the bbq the weekend afterwards at your parents .
And not to mention the fact that it ’s SuperBowl weekend right after and everyone meets up for that .
Suddenly a month goes by and nothing gets done , so you stop working .
The project pitters to a dead stop .
This is exactly how health gyms make their money !
Stay the course .
Push yourself .
Set your priorities .
Know what ’s important to you and live accordingly .
3. Educate yourself .
This means spend time AND money on educating yourself .
I think I ’ve read every book there is on real estate , business , marketing , sales , software development , etc .
I try to read one book a week that ’s related to what I ’m trying to do .
Yes I still read the odd novel , but again , base your priorities on what you want .
A novel to me is like going to the movies , so I read them when I need a break .
Not all my books are interesting , actually I can tell you many are really pretty boring and hard to read , but the content is worth the effort .
Try to read a lot of what will help you succeed .
The unfortunate side is that it ’s not always the most interesting material .
Also attend seminars , talk to people in your industry , join like minded groups .
For example , I belong to several local groups , the latest of which was just formed .
This last one is a group focused on generating passive income here in Ottawa that meets once a month to discuss any and all passive income opportunities available out there ( stocks , real estate , automated businesses , web sites , etc . )
Take the time to educate yourself , you ’re worth it .
4. Spend on yourself .
Most people think that they can start a business , invest in real estate , and so on , with just time .
It ’s possible , but do n’t be afraid to invest money on yourself .
I ca n’t tell you how many people get flustered when I start to share my expenses in regards to LandlordMax and FollowSteph .
They ’re all pumped to get started , but as soon as I suggest they look at investing $ 500 - $ 1000 on themselves and their idea , WAIT A MINUTE !!!
“ I do n’t know , that ’s seems like an aweful lot of money . ”
Well let me put it another way , if you do n’t even believe in yourself and your idea enough to put down a little money on it , do you think anyone else will ?
Why are so many people afraid to invest in themselves ?
I do n’t understand it .
Do n’t they realize that their employers are doing just that , they expect to make more money from their labour and skills than they pay them ( that ’s how business works ) ?
I ca n’t imagine a world in which I would n’t be willing to invest in myself and my ideas .
I do it all the time .
Actually , I ’ve been known to be a little trigger happy in this regard .
I ’m willing to take the chance sooner than later as I ’m a big fan of trying rather than theorizing .
After all you ca n’t debate with results , right or wrong ( and I ’ve proven myself both right and wrong many times ) .
5 . Stay focused .
I ca n’t even count any more how many people have asked me to co-venture with them …
From small to larger projects .
In the past I would generally hear everyone out , consider their ideas , and possibly be interested , in the least I ’d offer some guidance .
Today I have a different perspective .
After having gone through it so many times , I now tell people that if they have an idea they ’d like me to consider as a co-venture , come talk to me again about it in 6 - 12 months , whether or not they ’re succeeding .
Why 6 - 12 months ?
Simply because I want to see if they ’re going to stick with their projects .
Again , it all comes down to the fact that the vast majority of people , good intentions or not , will for some reason or another , start to lose interest in their projects within a few months .
All I ’m trying to do is weed these people out .
So far I only know of a very small select few people who ’ve gone beyond this !
I do n’t care whether their succeeding after this time , everyone has different areas of expertise and maybe its something simple their missing , maybe it ’s not the great idea it seemed , maybe its an amazing success I missed an opportunity on , it does n’t matter .
I ’m personally not interested in any co-ventures unless the person has put in at least 6 - 12 months of effort , to show me that they ’re going to stay the course , that they ’re focused , that they ’re not just another health gym statistic .
6 . Stick to your idea , test it .
Lastly , do n’t run away as soon as you hit a road block .
Get past it .
Go around it .
Go in a slightly different direction .
But keep moving .
I ca n’t tell you how many people hit a road block and stop .
If I did that with LandlordMax , well I would n’t be here .
It ’s now been over 3 years now , 4 if you count the year in which I created the initial version .
If you think there were n’t some brutal road blocks , think again !
To use one of my favorite quotes from I ca n’t remember who : “ It took me 10 years to become an overnight success ! “ .
And with that , let me just say , you ca n’t make a journey around the world without first taking a step , so take it !
Henry Ford put it another way : “ You ca n’t build a reputation on what you are going to do . ”
Or as a fellow business owner and investor of mine , Glenn Scott put it : “ I would rather see a stupid do ’er than a brillant dreamer “ .

East Hampton , N.Y .
FOR Americans under a certain age , Gerald Ford is best remembered for his contribution to Bartlett ’s —
“ Our long national nightmare is over ” — or , more likely , for the comedian Chevy Chase ’s stumbling , bumbling impersonations of him on “ Saturday Night Live . ”
But there ’s a different label we can attach to this former president , one that has been overlooked for 62 years : war hero .
In 1944 , Lt. j.g. Jerry Ford — a lawyer from Grand Rapids , Mich. , blond and broad - shouldered , with the lantern jaw of a young Johnny Weissmuller — was a 31 - year - old gunnery officer on the aircraft carrier Monterey .
The Monterey was a member of Adm. William Halsey ’s Third Fleet , and in mid-December , Lieutenant Ford was sailing off the Philippines as Admiral Halsey ’s ships provided air cover for the second phase of Gen.
Douglas MacArthur ’s “ I shall return ” Philippine invasions .
The Monterey had earned more than half a dozen battle stars for actions in World War II ; during the battle of Leyte Gulf , Lieutenant Ford , in charge of a 40 - millimeter antiaircraft gun crew on the fantail deck , had watched as a torpedo narrowly missed the Monterey and tore out the hull of the nearby Australian cruiser Canberra .
Two months later , in the early morning hours of Dec. 18 , the Japanese were the least of the Monterey ’s worries , as it found itself trapped in a vicious Pacific cyclone later designated Typhoon Cobra .
Lieutenant Ford had served as the Monterey ’s officer of the deck on the ship ’s midnight - to - 4 - a.m. watch , and had witnessed the lashing rains and 60 - knot winds whip the ocean into waves that resembled liquid mountain ranges .
The waves reeled in from starboard , gigantic sets of dark water that appeared to defy gravity , cresting at 40 to 70 feet .
In his 18 months at sea , Lieutenant Ford had never seen waves so big .
As breakers crashed over the carrier ’s wheelhouse , he could just barely make out the distress whistles sounding about him — the deep beeps of the battleships , the shrill whoops of the destroyers .
While the Permian - Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95 percent of marine species , it also laid the foundation for the explosive growth in complex marine organisms and ecosystems .
US and Australian researchers say that the end - Permian event that occurred 250 million years ago triggered an abrupt shift to the current dominance of higher - metabolism , mobile organisms ( such as snails , clams and crabs ) that actually go out and find their own food , and the decreased diversity of older groups of low - metabolism , stationary organisms ( such as lamp shells and sea lilies ) that filter nutrients from the water .
These findings about ecosystem complexity challenge earlier assumptions about marine diversity at that time .
The article inspeculates that previous research relied on single numbers – such as the number of species alive at one particular time or the distribution of species in a local community – to track the diversity of marine life ; whereas in the new study , the researchers examined the relative abundance of marine life forms in communities over the past 540 million years .
The new research was enabled by the Paleobiology Database , a huge repository of fossil occurrence data .
The result is the first broad objective measurement of changes in the complexity of marine ecology over the Phanerozoic ( the 500 million year period since diverse hard - shelled animals first appeared ) .
“ We were able to combine a huge data set with new quantitative analyses , ” says The Field Museum ’s Peter J. Wagner , lead author of the study .
“ We think these are the first analyses of this type at this large scale .
They show that the end - Permian mass extinction permanently altered not just taxonomic diversity but also the prevailing marine ecosystem structure . ”
The ecological implications of the new findings are striking .
Simple marine ecosystems suggest that bottom - dwelling organisms partitioned their resources similarly .
Complex marine ecosystems suggest that interactions among different species , as well as a greater variety of ways of life , affected abundance distributions .
Prior to the end - Permian mass extinction , both types of marine ecosystems ( complex and simple ) were equally common .
After the mass extinction , however , the complex communities outnumbered the simple communities nearly 3 to 1 .
“ [ The findings ] show us that there was not an inexorable trend towards modern ecosystems , ” Wagner explained .
“ If not for this one enormous extinction event at the end of the Permian , then marine ecosystems today might still be like they were 250 million years ago . ”
Wagner thinks the results may also be a warning .
“ Studies by modern marine ecologists suggest that humans are reducing certain marine ecosystems to something reminiscent of 550 million years ago , prior to the explosion of animal diversity .
The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs could n’t manage that . ”

Smoking Gun For Permian - Triassic Extinction Found

An incomprehensible screed of words carved by a grief - stricken schizophrenic French farmer into his bedroom floor has become Paris 's most controversial new art exhibit .
Since the Plancher de Jeannot ( Jeannot 's Floorboards ) went on display last week , it has created an unprecedented stir .
' People are terribly disturbed by it .
Some feel it should not be on public view , ' said Claudine Hermabessiere , spokeswoman for the Bibliotheque Francois Mitterrand .
The carving - 80 lines of text , in capital letters with no punctuation - contains references to Hitler , to Popes and to an infernal machine that controls humans .
' The work raises painful questions about whether madness can be artistic .
The people who are most upset are those who know Jeannot 's story , ' said Hermabessiere .
The journey to artistic fame of the 24ft by 9ft oak floor is as strange as its message .
Jeannot , whose surname and Pyreneean village have been kept secret , was born in 1939 and lived with his parents and his two older sisters , Simone and Paule .
After their father 's suicide , Simone married and left home but Jeannot and Paule stayed there with their mother .
In 1966 , Jeannot opened fire on his neighbours ' dining room , after voices had told him to kill them .
When a doctor committed Jeannot to a mental institution in 1967 , a team of 30 gendarmes could not get him out of the house .
In December 1971 , a local vet found his mother dead in her armchair .
Jeannot insisted she should be buried under the kitchen stairs , with a ball of wool , knitting needles and a bottle of wine .
Jeannot moved his bed to the dining room , next to the stairs , and began carving the oak floor : ' Religion has invented machines for commanding the brain of people and animals and with an invention for seeing our vision through the retina uses us to do ill (... ) the church after using Hitler to kill the Jews wanted to invent a trial to take power (... ) we Jean Paule are innocent we have neither killed nor destroyed nor hurt others it 's religion that uses electronic machines to command the brain . '
Seven months after his mother was buried under the stairs , Jeannot starved to death .
Paule lived until 1993 when a neighbour found her body in the pigsty .
The bric - a - brac merchants who came to the house at the request of Simone 's family found the carved floor .
Although art critics want the work to continue to be seen by a wide audience after its stint at the Bibliotheque Nationale , Benoit Gallet , a spokesman for the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company which owns Jeannot 's Floorboards , said : ' We intend to offer the work to the Hopital Sainte Anne , a psychiatric centre in Paris .
We feel that placing the work in that environment will help fight against the stigmatisation of mental illness as people will want to go in and see it . '
Colbert questions Obama 's ' blackness ' RAW STORY

Douglas Atkin is a partner and chief strategy officer at advertising agency Merkley +

An expert on the relationship between consumers and brands , he knows about iconic branding from the consumer side , too : " I 'm a self - confessed Apple loyalist , " he tells FRONTLINE in this interview .
Macintosh , Atkin says , is an example of a " cult brand , " one that inspires a loyalty as intense as religious devotion by selling an implicit idea , identity , or community along with a product .
" At the end of the day , Apple is a box of electronics , " he says .
" What makes them different ?...
When I 'm buying an Apple , I 'm not buying a clever box of electronics ; I 'm buying the belief that I 'm a nonconformist . "
This interview was conducted on Feb. 2 , 2004 .
The difference nowadays is that there are [ more ] products than consumers need .
...
Long ago , producers ruled .
The consumer was almost sort of panting for the next innovation , the next new detergent , the next breakthrough in technology .
Now they 're not .
There are more products than consumers , and the producer has to have some kind of different way of selling them .
A brand originally was a way for a producer of a brand , like a maker of beer , to put their ownership symbol on it and to give it a sense of authenticity .
And this was really , really important when the Industrial Revolution happened , because beer or any other product was distributed widely , away from where it was produced .
So , for example , Bass beer , which was the first official brand , put the red triangle on its bottle to show that it was real beer ; it was consistent high quality .
Now all of that has changed .
Brands have a completely different function in my mind , because the producer is not king ; the consumer is .
Pizza fraudsters take a slice of your credit

If you 're thinking about ordering a pizza for dinner tonight , you 'll definitely want to think twice if the pizza place insists that you pay by credit card .
That 's because an AT&T official fired off an internal memo the other day warning of a scam being perpetrated on California consumers , pizza restaurants and the telecom giant itself .
( A copy of the memo has made its way to my hands . )
Here 's how the scam works :
A fraudster contacts an AT&T service rep and says he works at a pizza parlor and that the phone is having trouble .
Until things get fixed , he requests that all incoming calls be forwarded to another number , which he provides .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Pizza orders are thus routed by AT&T to the fraudster 's line .
When a call comes in , the fraudster pretends to take the customer 's order but says payment must be made in advance by credit card .
The unsuspecting customer gives his or her card number and expiration date , and before you can say " extra cheese , " the fraudster is ready to go on an Internet shopping spree using someone else 's money .
John Britton , an AT&T spokesman , confirmed the contents of the memo and said two separate instances of the call - forwarding scam have been reported so far in Southern California .
Could the scam be more widespread ?
Britton said it 's possible there have been other instances elsewhere in the state .
He said AT&T has no way of knowing until an individual pizza parlor calls in to ask why its phone has stopped ringing .
" If someone does n't call us , we would n't know about it , " Britton said .
" After learning of this , we immediately took action to warn employees to be extra cautious when dealing with any requests for call forwarding . "
He said the two known instances of the scam being successfully pulled off occurred in two Southern California area codes .
He declined to provide further details .
Once AT&T was alerted to the scam , Britton said , company officials focused on trying to catch the perpetrators .
He said at least one of them has attempted to run the scam a few more times .
" When he calls , we ask for further information , " Britton said .
" The person then hangs up . "
He was reluctant to discuss the steps AT&T has taken to improve its call - forwarding system so this sort of thing does n't happen again .
What , for example , is to prevent someone from convincing AT&T to forward all calls to a local flower store or some other business that takes orders by phone ?
" We had some guidelines in place that we believe were effective , " Britton said .
" Now we have extra precautions . "
He added that AT&T has alerted other phone companies about the bogus call - forwarding requests .
" Hopefully , if these scammers try to call them up , they 'll be aware of this and the scam will be thwarted , " he said .
Britton said it never ceases to amaze him how ingenious con artists can be .
" If these people put that ingenuity to work in the legal world , " he said , " they 'd probably make a lot of money . "
More red ink : Speaking of lots of money , the Congressional Budget Office said last week that the federal budget deficit will increase next year to $ 286 billion and will total almost $ 1.8 trillion over the next decade .
Republicans , who control the nation 's purse strings , hailed the numbers as good news .
Rather , they ignored the prospect of higher deficits down the road and focused instead on word that this year 's shortfall will be " just " $ 260 billion , a $ 59 billion improvement over last year 's $ 319 billion budget hole .
" The federal budget deficit is being erased as a result of the pro-growth economic policies implemented by a Republican Congress , along with renewed focus on spending taxpayer dollars wisely , " said House Majority Leader John Boehner .
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi countered that the deficit numbers " are just the latest evidence of the Republican failure to control spending and burden our future generations with mountains of debt . "
Political posturing aside , the thing that struck me is that when you approach the budget numbers realistically , they 're even scarier than you think .
The Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan budget watchdog group in Washington , noted that the Congressional Budget Office 's projections assume that politicians will hold spending increases for discretionary programs -- including defense -- to just 2.7 percent annually .
From 1994 to 2004 , spending on discretionary programs grew by an average 5.2 percent a year , the coalition pointed out .
It also observed that the budget office is n't factoring in President Bush 's tax cuts becoming permanent and is n't anticipating any efforts to protect millions of middle - class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax -- a move that would cost the government more than $ 1 trillion over the net decade .
( The alternative minimum tax was intended for rich people taking deductions for tax shelters .
It is n't adjusted each year for inflation , which means middle - class taxpayers increasingly find themselves owing money under the levy . )
Factoring in these and other financial obligations , including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Concord Coalition determined that the deficit will skyrocket over the next 10 years not by $ 1.8 trillion but by almost $ 5.2 trillion .
" The most important point to take from this report is that current fiscal policy remains unsustainable under realistic assumptions , " said Robert Bixby , executive director of the group .
But since when has realism been part of the budgetary process ?

Unfortunately , companies often build a set of comprehensive rules , often for the sake of equality and organization .
Great goals , but the end result could be unhappy employees who just wish they had a little more control over their own work .
When people have more choices , they enjoy their work more , and are better at it .
The choices do n't have to be monumental ones : simply being able to arrange their desk and workspace , choose when to take their lunch breaks , and choose their own favorite tools can make a huge difference .
Your people are smart and talented , and they want you to recognize their potential .
You probably do that already , with praise and rewards , and that 's a great start .
But the next step is to start making more and better opportunities available for your team members .
Open up some of the doors .
Let your employees take on leadership , handle projects , deal with clients , and make calls that you 've always made .
If you 've been a good leader , they 'll know what to do .
If they 're not quite ready , and they make a mistake , you 'll all learn from the experience and move forward more equipped for the future .
While no one is going to be angry about a bonus or a salary raise , employees are looking for more than money .
They want a workplace that respects individuals and treats people fairly .
In fact ,
shows that employees rank " respectful treatment of all employees at all levels ” over compensation .
Respect is one of the most basic ways you can show your team that you value them and what they bring to the business .
From the way you address each individual to how you respond to their ideas , you 're communicating whether you respect them or not .
Communicate respect and treat all your team members as you 'd like to be treated , and you 'll build a stronger , happier team .
Life continually changes , and it 's difficult to deal for people to deal with the changing circumstances of life when they have no flexibility from their employer .
You can give your team more control and more choices : from standard work time , telecommuting options , flex time , work methods , travel arrangements , to project management and communication methods .
They 'll be happier , more engaged employees when they have more flexibility .
Ask yourself , " Why not ? "
Trust your people to make good decisions with their freedom and use their flexibility to be more productive , not to slack off .
Most people want to contribute and do meaningful work ; they 're just struggling to do it under predefined rules that do n't fit their lifestyle or priorities anymore .
So help your people love their jobs and do better work .
Flexibility allows them to fit their lives and jobs into one cohesive , enjoyable , and ultimately more productive and fulfilling experience .
If you can give your employees a holiday gift this season , make it one or more of these .
Sure , those windbreakers in company colors are neat ; but your employees want , and deserve , more from you .
Let them know you 're interested in their long - term growth and success , not just in holiday trinkets that get lost a month later .
You can still hand out the coffee mugs ; just hand out some flexibility , autonomy , and plenty of respect while you 're at it .

TEN THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RACE
Our eyes tell us that people look different .
No one has trouble distinguishing a Czech from a Chinese .
But what do those differences mean ?
Are they biological ?
Has race always been with us ?
How does race affect people today ?
There 's less - and more - to race than meets the eye :
1. Race is a modern idea .
Ancient societies , like the Greeks , did not divide people according to physical distinctions , but according to religion , status , class , even language .
The English language did n't even have the word ' race ' until it turns up in 1508 in a poem by William Dunbar referring to a line of kings .
2. Race has no genetic basis .
Not one characteristic , trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so - called race from all the members of another so - called race .
3. Human subspecies do n't exist .
Unlike many animals , modern humans simply have n't been around long enough or isolated enough to evolve into separate subspecies or races .
Despite surface appearances , we are one of the most similar of all species .
4 . Skin color really is only skin deep .
Most traits are inherited independently from one another .
The genes influencing skin color have nothing to do with the genes influencing hair form , eye shape , blood type , musical talent , athletic ability or forms of intelligence .
Knowing someone 's skin color does n't necessarily tell you anything else about him or her .
5 . Most variation is within , not between , " races . "
Of the small amount of total human variation , 85 % exists within any local population , be they Italians , Kurds , Koreans or Cherokees .
About 94 % can be found within any continent .
That means two random Koreans may be as genetically different as a Korean and an Italian .
6. Slavery predates race .
Throughout much of human history , societies have enslaved others , often as a result of conquest or war , even debt , but not because of physical characteristics or a belief in natural inferiority .
Due to a unique set of historical circumstances , ours was the first slave system where all the slaves shared similar physical characteristics .
7. Race and freedom evolved together .
The U.S. was founded on the radical new principle that " All men are created equal . "
But our early economy was based largely on slavery .
How could this anomaly be rationalized ?
The new idea of race helped explain why some people could be denied the rights and freedoms that others took for granted .
8 . Race justified social inequalities as natural .
As the race idea evolved , white superiority became " common sense " in America .
It justified not only slavery but also the extermination of Indians , exclusion of Asian immigrants , and the taking of Mexican lands by a nation that professed a belief in democracy .
Racial practices were institutionalized within American government , laws , and society .
9 . Race is n't biological , but racism is still real .
Race is a powerful social idea that gives people different access to opportunities and resources .
Our government and social institutions have created advantages that disproportionately channel wealth , power , and resources to white people .
This affects everyone , whether we are aware of it or not .
10 . Colorblindness will not end racism .
Pretending race does n't exist is not the same as creating equality .
Race is more than stereotypes and individual prejudice .
To combat racism , we need to identify and remedy social policies and institutional practices that advantage some groups at the expense of others .
RACE - The Power of an Illusion was produced by California Newsreel in association with the Independent Television Service ( ITVS ) .
Major funding provided by the Ford Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Diversity Fund .
Most of you probably have n't heard the term " accessibility " outside of the context of ramps , elevators , and other means of making facilities usable to people with disabilities .
I do n't know much about the architectural nuances that go into creating accessibility in the physical world , but I do know a thing or two about building accessible websites and the issues of accessible multimedia .
If you 're already glossing over and wondering , " Why should I care ?
I 've got 20 / 20 vision and my mousing hand has never felt better ! " slow down for a second .
Accessibility on the Web , contrary to Wikipedia 's page on the subject , is more than simply pandering to the disabled and their specialized software clients .
Designing a website with accessibility in mind makes it more usable for everyone .
There 's a reason why surfing the web on your cellphone or PDA is still difficult and frustrating at best .
Most sites are horribly inaccessible .
Those few that are actually easy to use on such devices behave that way because of accessible design .
In a nutshell :
The more accessible a piece of media is , the easier it is for its content to be parsed and digested .
The more easily content can be parsed and digested , the more people can actually get at the content .
The more people who can get at the content , the better that piece of media is at doing its intended job .
Media is a delivery system for content .
Accessible media is a stronger , more flexible delivery system than media that lacks accessibility .
This goes for anything from a website to a DVD Movie to a newspaper .
If you 're still having trouble wrapping your head around this whole " accessibility " thing , do n't worry .
You 're not at all alone .
Most people do n't know , let alone care about it .
That 's why folks like Joe ( keep reading ) have so much work to do .
Before some passionate designer who does n't agree with some of this starts posting angry comments , let me make clear that accessibility issues and specs are by no means clear or set in stone .
It 's more of a continuum and a methodology than a hard technical spec .
It 's almost an art form still , with heated discussion and argument happening in the relatively small community of designers and developers who care about such things .
Nobody has the definitive , final word on this subject yet .
Thankfully , it is relatively easy to make textual content accessible these days .
Imagery and other visual content is a bit more difficult .
Audio and video is almost impossible to make uniformly accessible .
This is a huge and complicated problem , with no real solution .
Yet .
A dude by the name of Joe Clark has decided to take on this problem , and to do what he can to bring accessibility to multimedia .
He knows a thing or two about it , having written a book on the subject , and generally being a web accessibility guru .
" The Open & Closed Project " as it's being called , has a very wide scope .
It wo n't be cheap to make this happen , and Joe needs some serious funding .
In order to eat food and have a roof over his head while getting said serious funding , he needs donations .
If you have some spare change , please consider donating to Joe .
This guy " knows what 's up " when it comes to this issue , and he 's selflessly dedicating his professional career ( no personal profit here ) to making Media better for everyone , including that which lives in our dear sweet World Wide Web .
But he can't do it alone .
He needs your help .

No posts in a week , I have been silent too long .
Blame it on Io !
You see , Io is a contagious disease .
It affects programmers ’ brains .
The incubation period is extremely short , due to the simplicity of its syntax .
But the damages are extensive , particularly for Algol - derivative programmers : you will end up messed up !
Huh …
I forgot to mention the vectors include reading posts about Io .
I just hope your infection will not be as bad as mine .
( If I do not get google hits from E.R. fans with this paragraph , what will it take ? )
Yo Io !
First things first , let ’s get the token “ Hello World ! ” implementation out of the way :
" Yo Io ! " print
Aside from my poor taste in greeting phrases , you probably noticed how concise and simple this statement is .
At first sight , to most programmers , it appears to be written backward .
Not so if you think that the " Yo Io ! " object — which happens to be a string — is being sent the message print .
Everything in
Io is an object , and I really mean everything : lists , files , strings , numbers and even messages !
Attack of the clones
Well that is not fully accurate , to be pedantic , I should have written : everything in Io is a prototype .
Indeed ,
Io is a prototype - based language .
C++/ Java/C# programmers , here comes surprise # 1 : Io knows nothing about classes .
In class - based languages , classes describes the structure and behaviour of objects in term of methods whereas instances hold the objects ’ data .
Prototype - based languages do not make this distinction .
A prototype is both a class and an instance .
To get a new instance , you clone an existing prototype .
To get a new class you add or alter the behaviour of an existing prototype .
Sounds complex ?
Let your inner mad scientist free :
Sheep := Object clone
In English , Sheep is defined as a clone of Object — the parent of all Io prototypes .
Sheep legCount := 4
In brain - damaged English , the legCount property of a Sheep is defined as four .
Non-programmers would have you believe this is equivalent to : a sheep has four legs .
MutantSheep := Sheep clone
A MutantSheep is defined as a clone of a Sheep .
No surprise here , we all knew that !
MutantSheep legCount = 7
But their legCount property is set to seven !
Most inner mad scientists tend to go for six legs , but my inner mad scientist is also nonconformist .
I explain the difference between = and := in the next section .
Just pretend they are the same for the moment .
dolly := MutantSheep clone
Here be dolly the mutant sheep !
The convention is to use an upper - case character at the beginning of the name of prototypes acting as classes and a lower - case character for prototypes acting as instances .
Lots of slots
Once again , I have to confess that I have been inaccurate : I wrote legCount was a property of a Sheep whereas , in Io speak , it is actually a slot of Sheep .
A slot associates a value to a name within the context of a prototype .
Sheep holds one slot named legCount with the value 4 .
Here comes surprise # 2 : slots can contain variables and methods .
Sheep baa := method ( " bah ! " print )
The baa slot on Sheep is defined as a method which prints “ bah ! ” .
Simple , no ?
You noticed earlier that Io has two different assignment operators : := and = .
Both of them are actually methods on Object .
:= is actually parsed as setSlot and = is parsed as updateSlot .
From the method names you probably inferred the difference : := creates a new slot on a prototype from a name and a value whereas = updates an existing slot with a new value .
Io interprets the previous code sample like this :
Sheep setSlot ( " baa " , method ( " bah ! " print ) )
There is madness to Io ’s methods
In case you were wondering , method is a method on Object that creates anonymous methods .
The self - referential aspect of what I just wrote surely enlightened you , not .
Rewind .
Slow motion .
The method method takes a list of parameters .
All but the last one are arguments to the created method .
The last argument is the body of the method .
In this example , I define the growMoreLegs slot on MutantSheep to be a method with one parameter :
MutantSheep growMoreLegs := method(n , legCount = legCount + n)
Apart from the slightly surprising syntax , I hope this all sounds pretty familiar so far .
Things are about to change big time !
Surprise # 3 : a method can control when and if to evaluate an argument .
This lets us define flow control constructs ( if , unless , while , etc. ) as methods .
Most of them already exist on Object of course .
One construct is missing though and we will implement it here .
But first , we will botch the job :
Object unless := method ( cond , then , else , if ( cond , else , then ) )
The problem : cond , then and else are evaluated when unless is called .
We do not want that .
What we want is : unless cond is true , evaluate then , otherwise evaluate else .
In Io this is done like this :
Object unless := method ( if ( call eval arg At ( 0 ) , call eval arg At ( 2 ) , call eval arg At ( 1 ) ) )
Update : see jer ’s comment for a better implementation
What looks like a nice trick , is actually extremely powerful .
Lisp programmers laugh in the background , they ’ve used it successfully since 1958 !
I will not explore this vast topic any further in this post — I must save some ammunition for future posts !
By the way , I hope you appreciated the fact that Io is a dynamic language : we just added a method to the Object prototype !
Lobby for Io !
Before concluding , I would like to point out that Sheep and MutantSheep are defined like slots .
But what is the underlying prototype ?
In Io , this is the Lobby .
So what ?
Well , Lobby ultimately derives from the Object prototype , like all other prototypes .
But where do you think we found the Object prototype ?
Bingo !
It is a slot in the Protos slot of Lobby .
I suggest you read this again .
You are not dreaming : Object is both a slot of a slot in the Lobby and an ancestor of the same Lobby .
How is that for another self - referential bit of self - reference ?
Time to conclude , I hope this introduction will entice you to dwell deeper into this really amazing language .
Believe me , we have only scratched the surface !

The Worst Analogies
Ever Written in a High School Essay
They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that resembled Nancy Kerrigan 's teeth .
He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience , like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it .
She caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches that used to dangle from screen doors and would fly up whenever you banged the door open again .
The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a bowling ball would n't .
McBride fell 12 stories , hitting the pavement like a Hefty Bag filled with vegetable soup .
From the attic came an unearthly howl .
The whole scene had an eerie , surreal quality , like when you 're on vacation in another city and " Jeopardy " comes on at 7 p.m. instead of 7:30 .
Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze .
Her eyes were like two brown circles with big black dots in the center .
Bob was as perplexed as a hacker who means to access T:flw.quid55328.com \aaakk / ch@ung but gets T:\flw.quidaaakk / ch@ung by mistake .
He was as tall as a six - foot - three - inch tree .
The hailstones leaped from the pavement , just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease .
Her date was pleasant enough , but she knew that if her life was a movie this guy would be buried in the credits as something like " Second Tall Man . "
Long separated by cruel fate , the star - crossed lovers raced across the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains , one having left Cleveland at 6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph , the other from Topeka at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of 35 mph .
The politician was gone but unnoticed , like the period after the Dr. on a Dr Pepper can .
John and Mary had never met .
They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met .
The thunder was ominous - sounding , much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play .
His thoughts tumbled in his head , making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer without Cling Free .
This image was lost some time after publication .
We 're a little bitter at Southern hipsters right now ( except for Henry because he's as impossible to hate as he is irascible ) , but these Georgia kids had a great idea for a speed - limit protest .
They drove four - wide on a four - lane at the posted limit and filmed the ensuing craziness , including an Angry White Van Man exploding his mirror on a disabled car on the side of the road .
Plus , you know , we 'd totally date at least two of those chicks .

What does Infinity Divided by Infinity Equal ?
At first , you may think that infinity divided by infinity equals one .
After all , any number divided by itself is equal to one , however infinity is not a real or rational number .
I am going to prove what infinity divided by infinity really equals , and you may not like the answer .
First , I am going to define this axiom ( assumption ) that infinity divided by infinity is equal to one :
∞

∞
= 1
Since ∞ = ∞ + ∞ , then we are going to substitute the first infinity in our axiom :
∞ + ∞

∞
= 1
The next step is to split this fraction into two fractions :
∞

∞
+ ∞

∞
= 1
Next , substitute the axiom twice into the equation , we get :
1 + 1 = 1
Finally , this can be rewritten as :
2 = 1
This equation is obvious incorrect .
Therefore , infinity divided by infinity is NOT equal to one .
Instead we can get any real number to equal to one when we assume infinity divided by infinity is equal to one , so infinity divided by infinity is undefined .
If you still do not believe me , let 's try proving this another way .
Let 's start with our axiom again .
∞

∞
= 1
Next , split this fraction into two parts .
∞ * 1

∞
= 1
Solve the fraction of 1 divided by ∞ .
At first , you would think 1 divided by ∞ is equal to 0 , however that is not correct because that would mean 0 times ∞ would equal to 1 .
And that is proven not true here .
However , 1 divided by ∞ does equal a limit approaching 0 .
In other words , 1 divided by ∞ does not equal a number or is undefined .
∞ * undefined = 1
As a result , we reached a dead end .
Therefore , infinity divided by infinity is still undefined .

In the UK , some very odd standards enforcement group has ruled that this ad , run by a UK civil liberites group called No2ID in a newspaper was not offensive , after people complained about it , according to Silicon.com 's Andy McCue .
A full - page anti-ID card advert that appeared in the national press portraying Prime Minister Tony Blair with a Hitler - style barcode moustache was not offensive , the UK 's advertising watchdog has ruled .
The ad for the No2ID non-partisan anti-ID card lobby group showed a close - up photograph of Blair with a barcode on his upper lip and text underneath it saying " ID cards have worked well in Europe before " .
The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) received eight complaints about the advert saying the barcode on Blair 's lip made him resemble Hitler and that the portrayal of a public figure as Hitler was offensive .
The photograph of Blair had been retouched to make it look like a 1930s portrait and the layout was designed to echo the Nazi era .
However No2ID said the advert was not meant to portray Blair as Hitler but to be a comparison of Blair 's and Hitler 's policies .
Link .
I do n't know anything about how advertising regulation happens in the UK , but according to the the Advertising Standards Authority website , they are an independent body that reviews claims about misleading or offensive ads , makes decsions and then " once the Council has made a decision , the advertisers must make sure that the ruling has been followed , whether that means changing an ad or withdrawing it .
Our
Compliance team will ensure that Council 's rulings are acted on . "
Wonder if both the complaintants and the respondents had to file 27 BStroke6s in order to learn officially that this image is not offensive .
That 's good , because goodness knows what would happen if Compliance team opened a can of Ensure on No2id 's butt .
Hat Tip : RC
I am not actually a janitor , I work the hotel audit .
I have been doing the audit for six years .
I might not have much to say about what you should do in your room .
But I have learned what to do to get the absolute best prices .
The first thing I should explain is the concept of the rack rate .
This is like the sticker price on a new car .
It is an inflated price that no one pays , so everyone gets to feel like they are getting a discount .
Oh , you are an AARP member , well you get 10 percent off the rack rate .
Guess what , that is a sucker 's price .
What we are aiming for is 30 to 50 percent off the rack rate , and you can do it ( with my help ) .
First thing I can tell you is that you can forget all about that precious internet of yours .
Never make your reservations online , you can't negotiate online and hotel prices are very negotiable .
As a matter of fact , Priceline is the only one that will ever get you a price better than what you can negotiate with the property itself .
But they do n't let you pick your hotel , and the price you are paying the priceline is usually equivalent to the hotels bargain basement price anyway .
You can sometims manage to get it , and sometimes not .
But sometimes even my Priceline people are actually paying more than the average person in my hotel .
Using almost any other service is basically a guarantee of a higher price .
Now I would like to talk about travel agents .
A travel agent is much like a realtor .
They are not working for you , they are working for themselves , and getting commissions on it at the same time .
Rooms booked by travel agents at my hotel average about 15 percent higher than rooms booked by other methods .
Travel agents will never really get you the good rates , as they do n't have access to them , and could n't get commission on them if they could .
Travel agents handling corporate accounts for wasteful companies will often book rooms at the highest available rate possible , simply to get that extra bit of commission .
The hotel can never give you a good deal if you are using a travel agent , as they have to pay the travel agent a commission for booking your room , and who do you think ultimately pays for that ?
The next thing you can start forgetting about is the 1 -800 number for the hotel chain .
You see hotels are largely independently owned , and the individual hotel owners pay franchise fees for the name and services of the chain .
The person staffing the 800 number only has access to those same rates that the internet and travel agents can get to .
So they can't get you the good price to begin with .
Second off the hotel has to pay a fee when you book with that number , more fees for them means less bargaining room for you .
Do you have a loyalty card for the chain ?
Good , so does every one else .
The loyalty card is not a bargaining tool , it is a liability .
Guess what happens when you whip that sucker out ?
The hotel is hit with a five percent commission .
If you have such a card wait until check out time to present it .
Never whip it out at the start of negotiations .
It wo n't get you a better price , it just tells the hotel they are already taking a hit on you .
You are about to start making your phone calls .
Before you do let me stress one thing .
Until the final price is fixed you are getting a non-smoking room and you are paying with credit card .
You can change this after the price is fixed .
The reason for this is the fact that problem guests in hotels almost exclusively pay cash , request smoking rooms , or both .
Some people wo n't want to negotiate a cash room , or smoking room quite as well .
Just reserve the basic room , you can usually get the upgraded room for no extra charge when you check in .
Just say " can you give me one of the rooms with the couch and the microwave " .
They might not have couches , they might not have microwaves , but they will likely have one or the other , and that phrase makes it pretty likely that the clerk can change you into one of the better rooms .
Best strategy for reservations is to call the same place multiple times , 8 hours apart ( so you get 3 different people ) , try to negotiate each time , write down all the prices you get , and the names of the people you got them from .
You will probably get 3 different prices .
You can use this information to develop the pricing structure of the hotel .
If you are quoted $ 69 , $ 75 , and $ 79 then you can be pretty sure there is a $ 59 price as well , and somewhat sure there is a $ 65 price .
Most places like prices ending in 9 .
After you have taken a guess at the pricing you are going to want to try to make your reservation , if Shanna on 2nd shift quoted you $ 69 then call on 3rd shift and say that Shanna quoted you $ 59 .
Shanna wo n't be there , and the person will probably just take the reservation at that price .
If they wo n't , then call back first shift and say that the overnight guy quoted you $ 59 .
You pretty much have 3 tries at this ( one for each shift ) .
This trick is a little sneakier , but can get you the absolute lowest price in town .
Only use this one for single night stays when you will be checking in after 6 PM .
Find out where you want to stay , then web search to find the parent company of the hotel chain .
For example , Cendant owns Howard Johnson , Super 8 , Days Inn , Fairfield , Ramada , Wingate , Amerihost and about 10 other brands .
Call in your reservation sometime between 6 PM and 6AM .
Be very businesslike , and simply put in your reservation and say " I need that at the Cendant rate " .
Insert whatever parent company owns the chain you are making your reservation at .
This will work about 90 percent of the time , provided you make your reservation during evening or overnight hours , and arrive after the day staff has gone home .
Do n't ask what the host rate is , at least not on the same phone call with your reservation .
Do it on a different phone call , a different day , " Hi , this is Bob with Cendant , can you please tell me what the Cendant rate is at your property " .
The reason you do n't want to make your reservation during the daytime , or arrive during the daytime is that you do n't want to run into a chatty general manager who might actually ask you what you do for Cendant ( or whatever the company is ) .
Even if you are unsuccessful at making a reservation at the parent company rate , finding out that price tells you the absolute lower limit that you could ever negotiate to , in reality you can probably get about $ 10 over that price with negotiations .
Finally , you should never ever claim to be an employee of the actual hotel chain , they tend to use verification certificates and such for those rates , but no one verifies the people getting the parent company rate .
I do n't even suggest claiming to be a parent company employee when making your reservation , just say you need it at " that rate " .
If you find yourself having to get a room without a reservation then try to get a look at the desk clerk from outside .
If the desk clerk is male then send in the youngest prettiest woman in your group to get the room .
Send her in all by herself .
What she has to do is pretty simple , once she is quoted the price , she is supposed to knock $ 20 off it , and say , but I only have " X " amount , what am I supposed to do .
The success rate with that tactic is nearly 100 percent .
If there is a woman behind the counter ( or you have no young women in your group ) , then send in the most clean cut looking male in your group to get the room .
This person should not make any small talk , nor should they present any stories .
This person should never approach with their wallet already out .
They should simply attempt to negotiate a lower rate .
The most successful tactic is simply to try chipping off $ 10 or $ 20 from the price and claiming you paid that last time .
If the clerk still wo n't budge on price then you can start walking out .
They might give you a better price as you leave , if not then you probably got the best one .
Thus you can go get your luggage and come back in for the price you did manage to get .
The reason you want to send in the most respectable looking man and avoid small talk is because of who the majority of the people who stay in hotels without reservations tend to be .
You want to seem like a businessman who had an unexpected stop , not some slimeball , gambler , unemployed loser , or criminal .
Small talk is to be avoided because there is almost nothing you can gain from it price wise , and it is very easy to say the wrong thing and make the clerk dislike you .
You see the people who tend to be the most trouble in hotels are the ones who show up without reservations .
I wish you good luck with all your travels .
One thing I forgot to mention in my original node is the " sunday " trick .
Hotels almost never sell out on sunday nights , they usually do n't even reach half occupancy , not even during the busy season .
Lets say you want to stay friday and saturday for a weekend trip , or monday - thursday for a business trip .
Do all your phone calls and negotiate your price on a room for just the sunday night .
Reserve the room for the sunday night adjacent to when you will be coming .
Then call back later and add the other days on , then finally call back a third time and get rid of the sunday part of the reservation .
At almost anyplace you try this at you will end up getting that cheaper sunday price for the days you will actually be there , since normally the person making a change to a reservation is not supposed to change the price when doing so .
What was your worst production failure ?
Mine was a missing WHERE clause in a certain DELETE query that resulted in the deletion of all 6,000 + rows instead of just one .
Whoops .
Of course , my blunder only resulted in several hours of lost work , a painful data restore , and one really embarrassed junior developer ( me ) .
I 'm sure , had I been in an environment like Adam's , I would have deferred to someone with more expertise or , at the very least , been much , much more careful .
Adam works for a large steel manufacturer .
If you have n't been inside of a steel mill before , I can tell you first hand , it 's quite an interesting place .
The plants themselves easily span several hundred acres , each housing quite a few gigantic , airplane - hangar sized buildings .
Some are for melting iron .
Others are used for steel production .
And then there 's casting .
And roughing .
And rolling .
And , of course , a whole bunch are for support facilities like water filtration and electricity generation .
And just about everything is automated .
Of course , as an employee of the steel company , Adam does n't work directly with the machine controlling software .
Because those are such critical systems , only Extremely Highly Paid Consultants are entrusted with such work .
And probably for the better .
I , for one , sleep soundly knowing that my software is n't responsible for pouring giant vats of molten metal into lines of rail cars .
Generally speaking , manufacturers and the consultants do a very good job ensuring that their equipment operates safely and at full capacity .
A control system ( usually a PLC ) receives measurements from various sensors -- temperature , vibration , speed , pressure , fuel flow , etc -- and adjusts the system 's parameters when things go slightly awry .
In the rare case that something goes seriously wrong , the controller shuts down the equipment by sending a " trip " signal to a separate relay that 's connected to all sorts of other shutdown devices ( including , of course , The Big Red Button ) .
With all of the redundancy built in , uncontrolled problems virtually never occur .
That said , it was a pretty big deal when one of the steel mill 's gas - fired turbines crashed , causing an extensive fire , millions of dollars in lost production , and tens of millions in equipment damage .
The good news was that the turbine was shutdown before it ripped itself apart and sent 1500 + degree shrapnel in every direction .
After an extensive investigation by a team of experts ( also Extremely Highly Paid Consultants ) , it was concluded that the incident was fluke .
No one was to blame .
A few months later , another gas turbine crashed .
And then another .
The steel manufacturer was starting to get a bit irked at these multi-million dollar " flukes " ( not to mention the serious risk of life and limb ) and an all - out investigation was commenced .
Every last detail of the gas turbine and its related equipment was scrutinized .
Eventually , they were able to trace the problem to a " watchdog " timer .
Every few seconds or so , the turbine 's control system would send a " heartbeat " signal to the watchdog timer in a separate safety system .
If the watchdog did n't receive a signal as expected , the safety system would sound an alarm and alert the operator .
In these particular cases , the control system software crashed ( generally fixed by , what else , a reboot of the control system computers ) and the watchdog timer did not alert the safety system .
They went to the consulting company that developed the turbine control system software ( and the corresponding watchdog timer ) .
As it turned it , one of the consultants commented out the entire watchdog timer program .
It was a lot easier to debug the control system that way , apparently .
The consultant simply forgot to un-comment the code before deploying it to the safety system .
Whoops .
On a lighter note , Eric ( my company 's intern ) just told me that all of the stickers from Free Sticker Week have been mailed .
They 're still available for free ( details here ) .
Eric did have one small request , though : " And please , make sure you send a stamped , self - addressed envelope with your request .
If I have to label / seal / address one more @# !%* &@ envelope , god knows what I will do .
Now , if you ’ll all excuse me , I have a triple venti mocha backflip latte to fetch . "
And Eric , no whip cream on the latte , please !
It has always been a threadbare strategy , born of wishful thinking and wilful ignorance .
One of the many scenarios that it did not countenance was the orderly transition of authority while Castro was still alive .
Insofar as this possibility was examined at all , it was dismissed on the grounds that he would never willingly cede the power which he had exercised for more than 40 years , at every level of detail in Cuba 's affairs .
The startling truth to which the US will eventually have to adjust , and which the British government should urgently recognise , is that the transition has already taken place .
Castro's ill health created the context in which power passed seamlessly to a group of his most trusted and experienced colleagues .
There is no longer any need to speculate about the post - Castro order , far less try to manipulate the outcome .
It is already in place .
When Fidel Castro eventually dies , there will be outpourings of heartfelt sorrow among the Cuban people .
However much it dislikes them , Washington will do well to pay more attention to these sentiments than to the whoops of celebration in Miami .
For the Cuban masses who mourn Castro are not going to turn on his appointed successors .
All of these people , most of whom I know and respect , have been to the forefront in Cuban domestic life for decades .
Even if they do not aspire to the charisma and stature of Fidel , they enjoy far more popular recognition and support than the Americans admit .
And there is not the slightest evidence that US interference in Cuban affairs post - Fidel , even among those who want to see change , would be any more welcome than it has been for the past 45 years .
The collective leadership that has emerged since last July is headed by Raul Castro , Fidel 's 75 - year - old brother , who has long had responsibility for the armed forces .
But the Cubans are pragmatic people and they know that Raul might not be around for long either ; hence the transition to collective leadership .
It is made up of men who fought by Fidel 's side years ago and retain legendary status , alongside younger , more technocratic members of government .
Carlos Lage , a paediatrician by profession and de facto prime minister under Fidel , has taken responsibility for the key energy sector .
He is a first - class organiser and communicator .
Francisco Soberon , the governor of the Central Bank , is a sophisticated operator who has been making the books balance against all odds for years .
I first met Felipe Perez Roque , the fiery and articulate foreign minister , when he was Fidel 's private secretary .
There are women like Yadira Garcia , responsible for natural resources .
Believe me , these are high quality people who would be assets to any government - and are now firmly in control of Cuba .
Each of them is ideologically committed to maintaining Cuba 's independence and political system .
But none of them is the unbending ideologue of Washington caricature , far less an authoritarian denier of human rights .
They will display pragmatism and flexibility but will certainly not roll over and allow the fundamental reforms of the Cuban revolution to unravel .
So where does Britain stand ?
Sadly , yet again on the Americans ' coat - tails .
I well understand the imperatives that oblige Britain generally to be on the same side as Washington in international affairs .
But it always struck me that Cuba was one matter on which we could have developed a constructive foreign policy without calling that wider relationship into question .
During my time in government , I tried to normalise UK relationships with Cuba in areas such as trade and energy , while excellent diplomatic relations were spearheaded by the then ambassador in Havana , David Ridgway .
Without deviating from the formal positions of either government , it was possible to open up areas of discussion and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect .
But then all of that changed .
The Foreign Office chose to become involved in the EU 's diplomatic offensive against Cuba , led by prime minister Aznar of Spain , and in line with American policy .
Though Spain has moved on with its Socialist government , and the EU policy has softened as a result , Britain repeatedly allies itself with the most right - wing governments in Europe on Cuba .
Our embassy in Havana is shunned by Cuban ministers , and other avenues of cooperation have virtually disappeared .
No one in a senior government position in Britain has any first - hand knowledge either of Cuba or of the people who run it .
Our influence is zero , because we have chosen to accept the Washington orthodoxy that regime change is just around the corner .
Ostensibly , the justification for this position is concern about Cuba 's record on human rights .
When Margaret Beckett made her first major speech as foreign secretary on human rights it was , remarkably , Cuba that was given pride of place in her remarks .
Our glorious ally , Saudi Arabia , did not even merit a mention .
Not only the Cubans are entitled to complain about this epic display of double standards .
The British are too .
The Americans ' camp followers on Cuba have never been prepared to acknowledge that a country which has lived under constant economic siege for almost half a century , and which has been subject to more foreign plots than any other , might be entitled to define " dissidents " in terms that do not match those of their persecutors .
But the obvious point is that dialogue might produce results , as it has done in the past , while the current stand - off , based on mimicry of Washington , will certainly yield none .
By recognising that regime change will not happen , and cannot be forced by external intervention , Britain could restore mutually respectful relationships with Cuba .
There is still time .
But if our sole objective is to destabilise the Cuban government and support American manoeuvres to replace it , there will be no point in even going to the funeral .
Because nobody will even speak to us , except the man from the CIA .
Brian Wilson is a former Foreign Office minister and was the only member of the government to maintain regular contact with Cuba between 1997 and 2005 .

BBC Money Programme
Banks are making billions of pounds each year from penalty charges .
But now the legality of these charges - which cost their customers an average of £ 30 a time - is being called into question and thousands of customers want their money back .
STEP-BY - STEP GUIDE
How to claim back your penalty charges
We have investigated why some campaigners claim penalty charges are illegal and what the banks and their regulators are doing about it .
Last year the top six High Street banks in the UK made an estimated £ 4.5 bn from penalty charges .
These are charges that are incurred for unauthorized overdrafts , bounced cheques and clearing Direct Debits when there are insufficient funds in the account .
The Campaigner
Stephen
Hone is a young father of three and a law student based in Plymouth .
When Stephen 's bank , Abbey , removed £ 64 from his account for two £ 32 penalty charges he called his branch and asked them to pay it back .
" I was livid , I was really annoyed that they refused to give me the money back , the banks are always trying to say they 're sympathetic , " says Mr Hone .
His bank pointed out that these charges were fair and within the terms and conditions of his contract .
Mr Hone , however , believed those terms and conditions were unfair and therefore illegal .
Abbey offered to refund one of his charges .
The Legal Position
Stephen argued that under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations ( 1999 ) all penalty charges have to truly reflect the cost of administering them .
They are not permitted to be a profit - making enterprise for any business .
He believes if a penalty charge is higher than its administrative cost , it is illegal .
It 's very , very difficult to assign costs to specific aspects of the customer relationship
Joe Garner , HSBC
Stephen called Abbey again and threatened it with court action if it did n't refund both of his charges .
Furthermore he told the bank he would reclaim all the charges he had incurred over the previous six years if it did not reconsider .
The bank declined the offer and said it would defend its policy in court .
So Stephen went through his bank statements from the past six years ( the legal maximum period of time that money can be reclaimed in the UK ) and filed a claim at the small claims court .
Shortly after filing his claim , Abbey paid Stephen back £ 840 .
Stephen used some of this money to set up a website that advises others how to reclaim their bank charges .
The Banks
The key point in this case is that none of the banks want to reveal their true administrative cost for penalty charges .
THE BANK COMMISSION
The highest cost banks could justify for bouncing cheques is £ 4.50
How the Money Programme's " bank commission " worked
We asked Joe Garner , of HSBC , what it costs his bank to process a charge .
" You 'll understand that I wo n't go into specific details of individual costs " , said Mr Garner .
We then asked him to give us a rough cost of these charges to which he replied : " again it 's very , very difficult to assign costs to specific aspects of the customer relationship .
It 's very , very hard to attribute a specific price tag to each aspect of that and that 's why fundamentally we do n't agree to looking at one specific charge " .
After asking all the big banks the same questions , without getting an answer , we decided to find out for ourselves with our own Money Programme " Bank Commission " .
We asked two professors of banking and a former NatWest executive to estimate the banks ' costs .
It 's odd that the banks have not chosen to fight a case to date ; it suggests that they are finding it difficult to justify the charges that they impose upon their customers
Kieron Beal , barrister
Questions for the lenders
The highest figure they concluded that banks could justify was £ 4.50 - much lower than what the banks currently charge .
HSBC also told us it settles customer claims for refunds before cases are heard in court .
We are unaware of any bank opting to defend its charges in a court .
Kieron Beal , a barrister from Matrix chambers , told us : " It 's odd that they 've not chosen to fight a case to date .
It suggests that they are finding it difficult to justify the charges that they impose upon their customers " .
He believes that if a bank did go to court it would lose .
And Nick
White , head of personal finance at price comparison site Uswitch.com , says that if a bank did lose a case there would be huge publicity around the issue that would alert many more consumers to the fact they could challenge the banks .
It would make it much harder for the banks to defend their charges .
The regulators
The Office of Fair Trading has already forced banks to reduce their penalty charges for credit cards to a maximum £ 12 , and it has now opened an investigation to establish what the real costs of current account penalty charges are .
The Bovingdon factor
The Money Programme went to Bovingdon - a typical English village - to find people that had also been affected by the banks ' charges and to see if Stephen Hone 's advice on how to claim back these charges really worked .
" The banks , I think are putting these charges on to make a profit , no - one would agree with the charges , " she says .
" They are there for the banks to make a profit and it 's not fair .
I just thought it was what banks did .
So , I was astonished when Stephen said [ the charges ] were illegal . "
Mickey Boulton , a self - employed builder was frustrated with his bank over the amount it had charged him .
" We 've got in six months just under a £ 1,000 worth of charges .
They 've had a lot of money out of us , and I want it back . "
As a result of Stephen 's advice , Jemma successfully claimed back just under £ 5,000 , while Mickey was offered £ 600 , which he has accepted .
While the country waits in anticipation for the outcome of the Office of Fair Trading 's inquiry , is it time to reclaim your charges ?
If you think you have been a victim of what some are calling Bank Robbery , why not follow our step - by - step guide to reclaiming your bank charges , which includes letter templates to send to your bank ?

The central mystery of the modern state is this .
The necessary resources , both economic and political , will always be found for the purpose of terminating life .
The project of preserving it will always struggle .
When did you last see a soldier shaking a tin for a new rifle , or a sponsored marathon raising money for nuclear weapons ?
But we must beg and cajole each other for funds whenever a hospital wants a new dialysis machine .
If the money and determination expended on waging war with Iraq had been used to tackle climate change , our carbon emissions would already be in free fall .
If as much money were spent on foreign aid as on fighter planes , no one would ever go hungry .
When the state was run by warrior kings , this was comprehensible : they owed their existence to overwhelming force .
Now weapons budgets and foreign wars are , if anything , an electoral liability .
But the pattern has never been broken .
In Geneva today , at the new review of the conventional weapons treaty , the British government will be using the full force of its diplomacy to ensure that civilians continue to be killed , by blocking a ban on the use of cluster bombs .
Sweden , supported by Austria , Mexico and New Zealand , has proposed a convention making their deployment illegal , like the Ottawa treaty banning anti-personnel landmines .
But the UK , working with the US , China and Russia , has spent the past week trying to prevent negotiations from being opened .
Perhaps this is unsurprising .
Most of the cluster bombs dropped during the past 40 years have been delivered by Britain 's two principal allies - the US and Israel - in the " war on terror " .
And the UK used hundreds of thousands of them during the two Gulf wars .
Cluster munitions are tiny bombs - generally about the size of a drinks can - packed inside bigger bombs or artillery shells .
They scatter over several hectares and they are meant to be used to destroy tanks and planes and to wipe out anti-aircraft positions .
There are two particular problems .
The first is that the bombs , being widely dispersed , cannot be accurately targeted .
The second is that many of them do n't detonate when they hit the ground .
Officially , cluster bombs have a failure rate of between 5 % and 7 % .
In reality it 's much higher .
Between 20 % and 25 % of the cluster munitions Nato forces dropped during the Kosovo conflict failed to go off when they landed .
The failure rate of the bombs dropped by the US in Indochina was roughly 30 % .
Of the cluster bombs that Israel scattered over Lebanon , 40 % did not detonate .
The unexploded bombs then sit and wait to be defused - leg by human leg .
They are as devastating to civilian populations as landmines , or possibly worse , because far more of them have been dropped .
Even 30 years or more after they land - as the people of Vietnam and Laos know - they can still be detonated by the slightest concussion .
A report published last week by the independent organisation Handicap International estimates that around 100,000 people have been killed or wounded by cluster bombs .
Of the known casualties , 98 % are civilians .
Most of them are hit when farming , walking or clearing the rubble where their homes used to be .
Many of the victims are children , partly because the bombs look like toys .
Handicap 's report tells terrible and heartbreaking stories of children finding these munitions and playing catch with them , or using them as boules or marbles .
Those who survive are often blinded , lose limbs or suffer horrible abdominal injuries .
Among the case histories in the report is that of a family in Kosovo who went to swim in a lake a few kilometres from their village .
One of the children , a six - year - old called Adnan , found a metal can on the bank and showed it to his family .
It exploded .
His father and older brother were killed and Adnan was gravely wounded .
His sister later returned to the lake to collect the family 's belongings , stepped on another Nato cluster bomb and was killed .
The economic effects of cluster bombs can also be deadly .
Like landmines they put many agricultural areas out of bounds , because of the risk of detonating one while ploughing or harvesting .
In some parts of Lebanon the fields have remained unharvested this year .
Cluster bombs dropped on to the rubble of Lebanese towns have made reconstruction slow and dangerous .
The numbers of cluster bombs deployed are mind - boggling .
The US air force released 19 m over Cambodia , 70 m in Vietnam and 208m in Laos .
Over much shorter periods , the US and the UK dropped some 54 m cluster bombs on Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war and around 2 m during the 2003 Iraq invasion .
Israel scattered 4 m cluster bombs over Lebanon during its latest invasion earlier this year , almost all of them during the final 72 hours .
It looked like revenge , or an attempt ( like its deliberate bombing of the Jiyeh power plant , causing a massive oil spill ) to cripple Lebanon 's economy .
Since the invasion , more than two Lebanese civilians have been blown up by cluster bombs each day on average .
The only other nation which has used cluster bombs extensively since the second world war is Russia , which dropped large quantities in Afghanistan , and which scatters them in Chechnya , sometimes deliberately bombing market places and other civilian targets .
Apart from that they 've been deployed in small numbers by Sudan , Libya , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Nigeria , Serb forces , Hizbullah and warring factions in Tajikistan .
What good company we keep .
These weapons are arguably already illegal .
A protocol to the Geneva conventions prohibits attacks which " are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction " and " which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life , injury to civilians , damage to civilian objects , or a combination thereof , which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " .
I think 98 % would be a fair definition of " excessive " .
But their deployment will continue until there is a specific treaty banning them .
It 's clear the US and UK governments know their use is wrong .
Handicap International reports that the Coalition Provisional Authority ( the administration set up by the US to govern Iraq in 2003 ) " strongly discouraged casualty data collection , especially in relation to cluster submunitions " .
During a debate in the House of Lords last month , the Foreign Office minister , Lord Triesman , made such a feeble show of justifying their use that you could n't help suspecting he was batting for the other side .
The only justification he could find was that , unlike landmines , cluster bombs are not intended to lie around undetonated .
Two days ago , a letter sent to the defence minister by the international development secretary , Hilary Benn , was leaked to the press .
He argued that " cluster munitions have a very serious humanitarian impact , pushing at the boundaries of international humanitarian law .
It is difficult then to see how we can hold so prominent a position against landmines , yet somehow continue to advocate that use of cluster munitions is acceptable . "
But Benn appears to be alone .
The foreign office maintains that " existing humanitarian law is sufficient for the conduct of military operations , including the use of cluster munitions , and no treaty is required " .
The government seems unable to break its habit of killing .

My previous translation postings , all involving German to English mistranslations , were quite amusing .
However , those examples simply cannot compare to the Chinese to English translation I 'm presenting you today .
Have a look :
You can click on the image to enlarge it , but the text reads :
Welcome to Chinese Restaurant .
please try your Nice Chinese Food With Chopsticks
the traditional and typical of Chinese glorious history .
and cultural
Let 's sum up what 's wrong here :
The lack of an indefinite article ( a ) before " Chinese Restaurant . "
The second sentence starts with a lowercase ' p ' , but for some reason " Nice " , " Food " , " With " , and " Chopsticks " are capitalized .
There should also be a comma before the second half of the sentence .
The third line never mentions what the adjectives " traditional " and " typical " are describing !
My guess is that " utensil " is the missing word here !
The random " and cultural " in the fourth line , all by itself !
The word " glorious " and the random " and cultural " line are in a different font , which might indicate corrections were attempted to be made !
These chopsticks are generic , and thus can probably found at a Chinese restaurant near you !
This package was discovered at the Chinese / Japanese Buffet on Erie Boulevard in DeWitt , a suburb of Syracuse .
But then there was also the fortune in the fortune cookie :
AIGLE , Switzerland , July 26 ( AP ) 
An unidentified cyclist tested positive for doping during the Tour de France , potentially widening the scandal that gripped this year ’s race before it even began .
The rider ’s name , team and nationality will not be released until the testing process is completed , including the analysis of a backup sample , the International Cycling Union said Wednesday .
The U.C.I. , the sport ’s governing body , said the rider ’s team and national federation were notified , as well as national and world antidoping authorities .
USA Cycling had not been contacted by U.C.I. , according to the organization ’s spokesman , Andy Lee .
A spokeswoman for the United States Anti-Doping Agency said that group had no comment .
The American cyclist Floyd Landis won the Tour de France on Sunday , keeping the title in United States hands for the eighth straight year .
Lance Armstrong , long dogged by doping whispers and reports that he has vehemently denied , won the previous seven .
The prisoners , armed with chilli water , stormed the gate
Prisoners at Pematang Siantar jail in Sumatra mixed hot chillies with water in plastic bottles to spray at guards .
The fiery liquid temporarily blinded the guards , allowing prisoners to grab their keys and make the break for freedom .
Sixteen of the inmates had now been recaptured , a police official said , but two were still on the run .
The men were meant to be on their way to breakfast but instead stormed the prison gate , Detective Den Martin told the Associated Press news agency .
They were spraying the chilli water and shouting " attack , attack " , he said .
A prison warder , Harianaja , told the Jakarta Post newspaper that the guards could not fight back because they were outnumbered .
" The is the first time chilli has been used to get out of this penitentiary , " the daily quoted him as saying .
I just put up Cornershop , a tool for generating rounded corner graphics for website design .
It 's another skippy - powered project , but it does get a little tricky .
The initial version used Wu's circle algorithm to generate one quarter of an anti-aliased circle , then flipped it or translated it to get all four corners .
That was pretty fast , but as the radius got big ( I allow up to 150 pixels ) , it consed a lot ( about 300KB ) and got pretty slow ( about 0.25s for four graphics ) .
The output images differ by foreground , background , and size .
Since GIF is an indexed image format , changing the color table does n't involve changing a single bit of image data .
If you have an existing GIF for each allowed size , you can make a new image in any color by reading the " template " gif , munging its color table in memory , and writing out a new file .
With that strategy , making any size from 2 to 150 pixels in any color takes a relatively constant 0.001s , and it takes only about 3MB of template images .

How Catalog Companies will Use the Internet
The World Wide Web defines a graphical interface to the Internet .
The web makes it possible to view both text and images , and you do n't have to type anything to use it .
You just point and click , and instantly you are talking to a computer in another state , or even another country .
By creating an easy , point - and - click interface , it makes the Internet accessible to everyone .
You can learn to use the web in 10 minutes .
The web makes it easy to distribute pictures as well as text .
For catalog companies , especially , this makes the web an attractive proposition .
Estimates of the number of people with web access range between 5 and 10 million .
A recent Newsweek poll found this group to be ``more educated and more affluent than the general population . ''
Microsoft is said to be planning to include web - browsing software in an upcoming version of Windows .
By then , if not before , almost everyone who uses a computer will also be able to use the web .
A company 's presence on the web is called a web site .
A web site consists of web pages , which can contain text and color images , just like pages in a magazine or catalog .
Once you have established a web site , people with web access will be able to see it from anywhere in the world for the cost of a local phone call .
For companies in all businesses , the web will be an important sales tool .
For catalog companies , especially , the web has decisive advantages over paper :
There is no unit cost .
Once you 've put a catalog on the web , it is available to everyone with web access .
There is no lead time .
When you update a catalog , customers instantly get the new version .
The catalog can even be tied directly to your inventory system .
A catalog on the web can be interactive .
Customers can order items directly from it .
A catalog on the web helps you to understand your customers better .
If you want , you can indentify and track each customer 's visits to each page of your site .
We do not expect that the web will replace printed catalogs .
We do expect that it will eventually account for a substantial fraction of catalog sales .
The Internet , like the telephone and the print media , will be a valuable sales tool for those who know how to use it .
The web is probably best considered in the way you might consider a potential retail space .
Does renting a good space automatically yield sales ?
No , but it certainly helps .
A good location gets attention , and a well - designed store inspires respect .
The same is true on the Internet .

When I published my book Blood and Religion last year , I sought not only to explain what lay behind Israeli policies since the failed Camp David negotiations nearly seven years ago , including the disengagement from Gaza and the building of a wall across the West Bank , but I also offered a few suggestions about where Israel might head next .
Making predictions in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict might be considered a particularly dangerous form of hubris , but I could hardly have guessed how soon my fears would be realized .
One of the main forecasts of my book was that Palestinians on both sides of the Green Line  those who currently enjoy Israeli citizenship and those who live as oppressed subjects of Israel ’s occupation  would soon find common cause as Israel tries to seal itself off from what it calls the Palestinian “ demographic threat ” : that is , the moment when Palestinians outnumber Jews in the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River .
I suggested that Israel ’s greatest fear was ruling over a majority of Palestinians and being compared to apartheid South Africa , a fate that has possibly befallen it faster than I expected with the recent publication of Jimmy Carter ’s book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid .
To avoid such a comparison , I argued , Israel was creating a “ Jewish fortress , ” separating  at least demographically  from Palestinians in the occupied territories by sealing off Gaza through a disengagement of its settler population and by building a 750 km wall to annex large areas of the West Bank .
It was also closing off the last remaining avenue of a Right of Return for Palestinians by changing the law to make it all but impossible for Palestinians living in Israel to marry Palestinians in the occupied territories and thereby gain them citizenship .
The corollary of this Jewish fortress , I suggested , would be a sham Palestinian state , a series of disconnected ghettos that would prevent Palestinians from organizing effective resistance , non-violent or otherwise , but which would give the Israeli army an excuse to attack or invade whenever they chose , claiming that they were facing an “ enemy state ” in a conventional war .
Another benefit for Israel in imposing this arrangement would be that it could say all Palestinians who identified themselves as such  whether in the occupied territories or inside Israel  must now exercise their sovereign rights in the Palestinian state and renounce any claim on the Jewish state .
The apartheid threat would be nullified .
I sketched out possible routes by which Israel could achieve this end :
* by redrawing the borders , using the wall , so that an area densely populated with Palestinian citizens of Israel known as the Little Triangle , which hugs the northern West Bank , would be sealed into the new pseudo - state ;
* by continuing the process of corralling the Negev ’s Bedouin farmers into urban reservations and then treating them as guest workers ;
* by forcing Palestinian citizens living in the Galilee to pledge an oath of loyalty to Israel as a “ Jewish and democratic state ” or have their citizenship revoked ;
* and by stripping Arab Knesset members of their right to stand for election .
When I made these forecasts , I suspected that many observers , even in the Palestinian solidarity movement , would find my ideas improbable .
I could not have realized how fast events would overtake prediction .
The first sign came in October with the addition to the cabinet of Avigdor Lieberman , leader of a party that espouses the ethnic cleansing not only of Palestinians in the occupied territories ( an unremarkable platform for an Israeli party ) but of Palestinian citizens too , through land swaps that would exchange their areas for the illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank .
Lieberman is not just any cabinet minister ; he has been appointed deputy prime minister with responsibility for the “ strategic threats ” that face Israel .
In that role , he will be able to determine what issues are to be considered threats and thereby shape the public agenda for next few years .
The “ problem ” of Israel ’s Palestinian citizens is certain to be high on his list .
Lieberman has been widely presented as a political maverick , akin to the notorious racist Rabbi Meir Kahane , whose Kach party was outlawed in the late 1980s .
That is a gross misunderstanding : Lieberman is at the very heart of the country ’s rightwing establishment and will almost certainly be a candidate for prime minister in future elections , as Israelis drift ever further to the right .
Unlike Kahane , Lieberman has cleverly remained within the Israeli political mainstream while pushing its agenda to the very limits of what it is currently possible to say .
Kadima and Labor urgently want unilateral separation from the Palestinians but are shy to spell out , both to their own domestic constituency and the international community , what separation will entail .
Lieberman has no such qualms .
He is unequivocal : if Israel is separating from the Palestinians in parts of the occupied territories , why not also separate from the 1.2 million Palestinians who through oversight rather than design ended up as citizens of a Jewish state in 1948 ?
If Israel is to be a Jewish fortress , then , as he points out , it is illogical to leave Palestinians within the fortifications .
These arguments express the common mood among the Israeli public , one that has been cultivated since the eruption of the intifada in 2000 by endless talk among Israel ’s political and military elites about “ demographic separation . ”
Regular opinion polls show that about two - thirds of Israelis support transfer , either voluntary or forced , of Palestinian citizens from the state .
Recent polls also reveal how fashionable racism has become in Israel .
A survey conducted last year showed that 68 per cent of Israeli Jews do not want to live next to a Palestinian citizen ( and rarely have to , as segregation is largely enforced by the authorities ) , and 46 per cent would not want an Arab to visit their home .
A poll of students that was published last week suggests that racism is even stronger among young Jews .
Three - quarters believed Palestinian citizens are uneducated , uncivilized and unclean , and a third are frightened of them .
Richard Kupermintz of Haifa University , who conducted the survey more than two years ago , believes the responses would be even more extreme today .
Lieberman is simply riding the wave of such racism and pointing out the inevitable path separation must follow if it is to satisfy these kinds of prejudices .
He may speak his mind more than his cabinet colleagues , but they too share his vision of the future .
That is why only one minister , the dovish and principled Ophir Pines Paz of Labor , resigned over Ehud Olmert ’s inclusion of Lieberman in the cabinet .
Contrast that response with the uproar caused by the Labor leader Amir Peretz ’s appointment of the first Arab cabinet minister in Israel ’s history .
( A member of the small Druze community , which serves in the Israeli army , Salah Tarif , was briefly a minister without portfolio in Sharon ’s first government . )
Raleb Majadele , a Muslim , is a senior member of the Labor party and a Zionist ( what might be termed , in different circumstances , a self - hating Arab or an Uncle Tom ) , and yet his appointment has broken an Israeli taboo : Arabs are not supposed to get too close to the centers of power .
Peretz ’s decision was entirely cynical .
He is under threat on all fronts  from his coalition partners in Kadima and in Lieberman ’s Yisrael Beitenu , and from within his own party  and desperately needs the backing of Labor ’s Arab party members .
Majadele is the key , and that is why Peretz gave him a cabinet post , even if a marginal one : Minister of Science , Culture and Sport .
But the right is deeply unhappy at Majadele ’s inclusion in the cabinet .
Lieberman called Peretz unfit to be defense minister for making the appointment and demanded that Majadele pledge loyalty to Israel as a Jewish and democratic state .
Lieberman ’s party colleagues referred to the appointment as a “ lethal blow to Zionism . ”
A few Labor and Meretz MKs denounced these comments as racist .
But more telling was the silence of Olmert and his Kadima party , as well as Binyamin Netanyhu ’s Likud , at Lieberman ’s outburst .
The center and right understand that Lieberman ’s views about Majadele , and Palestinian citizens more generally , mirror those of most Israeli Jews and that it would be foolhardy to criticize him for expressing them  let alone sack him .
In this game of “ who is the truer Zionist , ” Lieberman can only grow stronger against his former colleagues in Kadima and Likud .
Because he is free to speak his and their minds , while they must keep quiet for appearance ’s sake , he , not they , will win ever greater respect from the Israeli public .
Meanwhile , all the evidence suggests that Olmert and the current government will implement the policies being promoted by Lieberman , even if they are too timid to openly admit that is what they are doing .
Some of those policies are of the by - now familiar variety , such as the destruction of 21 Bedouin homes , half the village of Twayil , in the northern Negev last week .
It was the second time in a month that the village had been razed by the Israeli security forces .
These kind of official attacks against the indigenous Bedouin  who have been classified by the government as “ squatters ” on state lands  are a regular occurence , an attempt to force 70,000 Bedouin to leave their ancestral homes and relocate to deprived townships .
A more revealing development came this month , however , when it was reported in the Israeli media that the government is for the first time backing “ loyalty ” legislation that has been introduced privately by a Likud MK .
Gilad Erdan ’s bill would revoke the citizenship of Israelis who take part in “ an act that constitutes a breach of loyalty to the state , ” the latest in a string of proposals by Jewish MKs conditioning citizenship on loyalty to the Israeli state , defined in all these schemes very narrowly as a “ Jewish and democratic ” state .
Arab MKs , who reject an ethnic definition of Israel and demand instead that the country be reformed into a “ state of all its citizens , ” or a liberal democracy , are typically denounced as traitors .
Lieberman himself suggested just such a loyalty scheme for Palestinian citizens last month during a trip to Washington .
He told American Jewish leaders : “ He who is not ready to recognize Israel as a Jewish and Zionist state cannot be a citizen in the country . ”
Erdan ’s bill specifies acts of disloyalty that include visiting an “ enemy state ”  which , in practice , means just about any Arab state .
Most observers believe that , after Erdan ’s bill has been redrafted by the Justice Ministry , it will be used primarily against the Arab MKs , who are looking increasingly beleaguered .
Most have been repeatedly investigated by the Attorney - General for any comment in support of the Palestinians in the occupied territories or for visiting neighboring Arab states .
One , Azmi Bishara , has been put on trial twice for these offenses .
Meanwhile , Jewish MKs have been allowed to make the most outrageous racist statements against Palestinian citizens , mostly unchallenged .
Former cabinet minister Effi Eitam , for example , said back in September : “ The vast majority of West Bank Arabs must be deported …
We will have to make an additional decision , banning Israeli Arabs from the political system
We have cultivated a fifth column , a group of traitors of the first degree . ”
He was “ warned ” by the Attorney - General over his comments ( though he has expressed similar views several times before ) , but remained unrepetant , calling the warning an attempt to “ silence ” him .
The leader of the opposition and former prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , the most popular politician in Israel according to polls , gave voice to equally racist sentiments this month when he stated that child allowance cuts he imposed as finance minister in 2002 had had a “ positive ” demographic effect by reducing the birth rate of Palestinian citizens .
Arab MKs , of course , do not enjoy such indulgence when they speak out , much more legitimately , in supporting their kin , the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza , who are suffering under Israel ’s illegal occupation .
Arab MK Ahmed Tibi , for example , was roundly condemned last week by the Jewish parties , including the most leftwing , Meretz , when he called on Fatah to “ continue the struggle ” to establish a Palestinian state .
However , the campaign of intimidation by the government and Jewish members of the Knesset has failed to silence the Arab MKs or stop them visiting neighboring states , which is why the pressure is being ramped up .
If Erdan ’s bill becomes law  which seems possible with government backing  then the Arab MKs and the minority they represent will either be cut off from the rest of the Arab world once again ( as they were for the first two decades of Israel ’s existence , when a military government was imposed on them ) or threatened with the revocation of their citizenship for disloyalty ( a move , it should be noted , that is illegal under international law ) .
It may not be too fanciful to see the current legislation eventually being extended to cover other “ breaches of loyalty , ” such as demanding democratic reforms of Israel or denying that a Jewish state is democratic .
Technically , this is already the position as Israel ’s election law makes it illegal for political parties , including Arab ones , to promote a platform that denies Israel ’s existence as a “ Jewish and democratic ” state .
Soon Arab MKs and their constituents may also be liable to having their citizenship revoked for campaigning , as many currently do , for a state of all its citizens .
That certainly is the view of the eminent Israeli historian Tom Segev , who argued in the wake of the government ’s adoption of the bill : “ In practice , the proposed law is liable to turn all Arabs into conditional citizens , after they have already become , in many respects , second - class citizens .
Any attempt to formulate an alternative to the Zionist reality is liable to be interpreted as a ‘ breach of faith ’ and a pretext for stripping them of their citizenship . ”
But it is unlikely to end there .
I hesitate to make another prediction but , given the rapidity with which the others have been realized , it may be time to hazard yet another guess about where Israel is going next .
The other day I was at a checkpoint near Nablus , one of several that are being converted by Israel into what look suspiciously like international border crossings , even though they fall deep inside Palestinian territory .
I had heard that Palestinian citizens of Israel were being allowed to pass these checkpoints unhindered to enter cities like Nablus to see relatives .
( These familial connections are a legacy of the 1948 war , when separated Palestinian refugees ended up on different sides of the Green Line , and also of marriages that were possible after 1967 , when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza , making social and business contacts possible again . )
But , when Palestinian citizens try to leave these cities via the checkpoints , they are invariably detained and issued letters by the Israeli authorities warning them that they will be tried if caught again visiting “ enemy ” areas .
In April last year , at a cabinet meeting at which the Israeli government agreed to expel Hamas MPs from Jerusalem to the West Bank , ministers discussed changing the classification of the Palestinian Authority from a “ hostile entity ” to the harsher category of an “ enemy entity . ”
The move was rejected for the time being because , as one official told the Israeli media : “ There are international legal implications in such a declaration , including closing off the border crossings , that we do n’t want to do yet . ”
Is it too much to suspect that before long , after Israel has completed the West Bank wall and its “ border ” terminals , the Jewish state will classify visits by Palestinian citizens to relatives as “ visiting an enemy state ” ?
And will such visits be grounds for revoking citizenship , as they could be under Erdan ’s bill if Palestinian citizens visit relatives in Syria or Lebanon ?
Lieberman doubtless knows the answer already .

Committee chairs often have ' horrific ' records on science , matters they oversee Kate Raiford
Published : Thursday November 2 , 2006 Print This Email This Senator James Inhofe , R - OK , calls climate change a hoax , voted against stem cell research , and since the 2002 election has taken more than $ 500,000 in campaign contributions from the oil , gas and electric industries .
He 's also the chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works .
" Inhofe is really horrific when it comes to the environment .
He 's continuing to perpetuate misinformation , " says Tirenan Sittenfeld , legislative director of the independent organization , the League of Conservation Voters .
She says he 's not the only one .
Rep. Joe Barton , R - TX , is a skeptic on global warming and sponsored the House version of the Clear Skies Act , which would actually increase the amount of pollution permitted , according to the Sierra Club .
He 's also the chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce .
Barton is the primary House author of the Bush Administration 's Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which was passed by Congress in July .
Among other things , it encourages increases in nuclear and coal use .
( However , drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was removed from the Act . )
Between 1997 and 2004 , Barton received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the energy industry , the Washington Post reported .
This year he received more than $ 383,000 from oil , gas and electric companies .
But do n't blame President Bush , Sittenfeld said .
It 's not the Administration that selects the chairmen ; it 's Congress .
That does n't make it any less unfortunate , she added .
Every year , the League of Conservation Voters compiles an environmental scorecard of Congress members , based on how they voted on select issues .
One of the lowest scorers , at 17 percent this term  and 7 percent overall  goes to Rep. Richard Pombo , R- CA , chairman of the House Resources Committee .
For example , he voted to increase offshore drilling and against the Clean Water Act .
For the current Congress , Inhofe has a score of 0 percent and an Barton 8 percent rating .
But these are not the only policy makers with a record that would make a liberal cringe .
Rep. Paul E. Gillmor , R- OH , chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee 's Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials , voted against stem cell research and against the Kyoto Protocol .
He also voted yes for deauthorizing " critical habitat " for endangered species .
In the Senate , Ted Stevens , R- AK , Chair of the Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation is the longest - serving Republican .
He is also the formerly unnamed senator who held up a bill that would make the government provide an online database of federal spending .
He is in favor of drilling the Coastal Plan of the Arctic Wildlife Preserve .
Howeever , he did support the bill for embryonic stem cell research .
Sen .
Pete Domenici , R- NM , chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , voted for offshore drilling and against environmental funding .
Sen. George Voinovich , R- OH , chairs the Subcommittee on Clean Air , Climate Change and Nuclear Safety .
He voted against EPA 's clean air mercury emissions proposal and for drilling in the wildlife refuge .
He and Inhofe co-sponsored the Senate Clear Skies Act .
The chair of the Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions , Sen. Michael B. Enzi , R - WY , is against the proposed plan to reduce oil imports by 2025 , and for the Bush Administration energy plan .
Enzi's voting record is 100 percent anti-environment , according to the League of Conservation Voters .
Sen. Richard Burr , R-NC , is chair of the Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness .
He supports stem cell research but is against the Kyoto Protocol .
He is known for introducing " Bioshield Two , " which would encourage the private sector to develop vaccines and drugs .
It 's been called " a drug company stockholder 's dream and a consumer 's worst nightmare " in a press release from the National Vaccine Information Center .
In 2004 , the League of Conservation Voters listed him in their Dirty Dozen 's list of politicians taking the most money from oil and gas companies .
Other Republican leaders of science , environment and energy committees are more moderate .
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert , R-NY , is the chair of the Committee on Science and has a better track record for the liberal voter .
He voted yes on stem cell research and yes on the Kyoto Protocol .
" He 's a real environmental champion , " Sittenfeld told RAW STORY .
The House 's Subcommittee on Health chair , Nathan Deal , R- GA , is against the Kyoto Protocol and for the Bush Administration National Energy Policy .
A spokesman said Deal must review all legislation before he can rule on stem cells , though he does not believe in manipulation of life .
Sittenfeld declined to speculate on a potential Democratic win of Congress this November , though she said : " Regardless of who 's in charge , Congress needs to move in a drastically different direction . "
Representatives from Barton 's and Enzi's office could not be reached for confirmation by press time .

The gist of the book Guns of the South is straightforward yet odd .
What if , during the Civil War , the South became equipped with a lot of AK - 47s ?
Long story very short , they would have won .
Handily .
The author , Harry Turtledove , chose not to focus on time travel or other delectable science fiction tidbits ; he spends the time on , “ Yay !
The South won !
So , uh , what are they going to do about that whole slavery thing ? ”
While I ’m certain Civil War enthusiasts would enjoy this book , it is not geared for someone with my particular disability : nerd attention deficiency disorder , or NADD .
While I read this book , this innocuous condition reared its head when it became clear that it was an in - depth exploration of the lifestyles and morality during an alternative post–Civil War period … ZzZzZzzZZzz .
Now , Guns is a fine read , but more than once I was flipping ahead through the pages wondering , “ OK , how long is this chapter ? ”
When I neared the end of the book and it became clear that some time traveler from the future was n’t going to appear and , using some whizbang futuristic device , join the North and South together , well , I was disappointed .
Sure , I ’m happy that President Lee learned his lesson and started abolishing slavery on his own , but … no lasers ?
Please .
Folks , I ’m a nerd .
I need rapid - fire content delivered in short , clever , punchy phrases .
Give me Coupland , give me Calvin and Hobbes , give me Asimov , give me the Watchmen .
I need this type of content because I ’m horribly afflicted with NADD .
If you ’re still with me , it might mean you also suffer from some type of NADD - related disorder .
Let ’s find out .
Stop reading this book right now and walk over to your desktop .
How many things were you doing when you were last there ?
Me , I ’ve got Slack opened and logged into four different teams , I ’m listening to music in Spotify , I ’ve got Chrome open with three tabs where I ’m watching stocks on E*TRADE , I ’m tinkering with WordPress , and I ’m looking at weekend movie returns .
Not done yet .
I ’ve got iMessage open , Tweetbot is merrily streaming the latest fortune cookies from friends , and I ’ve got two Sublime windows open where I ’m capturing random thoughts for later integration into various to - do lists .
Oh yeah , I ’m rewriting this article as well .
Folks , this is n’t multitasking .
This is an advanced case of nerd attention deficiency disorder .
I am unable to function at my desktop unless I ’ve got at least five tasks going on at the same time .
If your count comes close , you ’re probably afflicted as well .
Most excellent .
A Nerd Diagnosis
My mother first helped diagnose me with NADD .
It was the late 1980s and she was bringing me dinner in my bedroom ( nerd ) .
I was merrily typing away to my friends in some primitive chat room on my IBM XT ( super nerd ) , listening to music ( probably Flock of Seagulls — nerd + + ) , and watching Back to the Future with the sound off ( nerrrrrrrrrrd ) .
She commented , “ How can you focus on anything with all this stuff going on ? ” I responded , “ Mom , I ca n’t focus without all this noise . ”
The existence and amount of NADD in your life is directly related to how you ’ve chosen to deal with the media deluge that has accompanied our insatiable thirst for new technology .
You ’ve likely gone one of three ways :
You ’ve checked out .
You do n’t own a TV , and it ’s unlikely you ’re even reading this chapter .
You enjoy your content in moderation .
When I asked you to count the windows on your desktop , you either said , “ One , my mail client , to read my incoming e-mail , ” or you made yourself a note to check this after reading this chapter .
You probably own a day planner , which you can touch from where you are sitting right now .
You surf the content fire hose .
Give me tabbed browsing , tabbed instant messaging , music all the time , and TWITTER TWITTER TWITTER .
Welcome to NADD .
The presence of NADD in your friends is equally easily detectable .
Here ’s a simple test :
Ask to sit down at their computer and start mucking with stuff on their desktop .
Move an icon here , adjust a window there .
If your friend calmly watches as you tinker away , they ’re probably NADD - free .
However , if your friend is anxiously rubbing their forehead and climbing out of their skin when you move that icon 12 pixels to the right , there ’s NADD in the house .
Back away from the computer .
The Context Switch
You may think the core competency behind NADD is multitasking — and it ’s true , NADD sufferers are amazing multitaskers — but it is n’t their fundamental skill .
It ’s the context switch .
The idea of the context switch is key to understanding NADD , and it ’s a simple concept .
In order to focus on something , you need to spend time and energy to get your brain in the right mental state .
Think about your Sunday morning reading of the New York Times .
You ’ve got your coffee , your comfortable pajamas , your couch , and you ’ve got whatever story it is that you ’re reading .
All of this is your context .
Now , halfway through your current story , I ’m going to rip the paper from your hands and turn on CNN , which happens to be running exactly the same story that you were
just reading .
What .
The hell .
Just happened ?
You just experienced a context switch .
It ’s not a horrible one , since you ’re luckily experiencing the same story ; it ’s just in a different medium — TV talking heads with that annoying scrolling news bar at the bottom of the screen .
Still , it ’s jarring , right ?
Forget about why I ’m yanking the paper from your hands —
I ’m talking about the mental shift from reading a story to watching it .
It takes time to switch .
For you .
A healthy NADD sufferer would barely notice the switch .
In fact , chances are that they ’re already digesting their news via random different media right this second .
What separates a NADD sufferer from everyone else is that the context switch is transparent .
The mental muscle that drives the context switch is well developed because it ’s spent a lifetime switching between random streams of data , trying to make sense of a colossal amount of noise to hear what is relevant .
Anyone can multitask .
NADD sufferers multitask with deft purpose .
They ’re on a quest of high - speed information acquisition and processing .
Leveraging NADD
I ’m making NADD sound like a trait of information - obsessive power freaks , and , well , it is .
How else can you deal with a world where media is forced on you at you at every turn ?
You become very adept at controlling it .
There ’s more good news .
Folks who are not afflicted with NADD think those who are ca n’t focus because — look at us — we ’re all over the place .
Please stop clicking on things — you are giving me a headache .
Wrong .
Those with NADD have an amazing ability to focus when they choose to .
Granted , it ’s not our natural state , and yes , it can take us longer than some to get in the Zone , but when we ’re there — boy howdy .
The Internet is designed for NADD .
Whether it ’s the short delicious bursts of information that comprise each of your newsfeeds or the exponentially increasing apps that just want a smidge of your time , the Internet knows about NADD .
It knows that any good website or application must be designed not to answer the question “ Do you want to learn ” but rather “ How long do I have your attention ? ”
NADD can advance your career , if you ’re in the right career .
Ever worked at a startup ?
Ever shipped software ?
What are the last few weeks like ?
We call it a fire drill because everyone is running around like a crazy person doing random , unexpected shit .
NADD is the perfect affliction for managing this situation because it ’s an affliction that reduces the cost of the context switch .
If the building you are currently in is burning to the ground , go find the person with NADD on your floor .
Not only will they know where the fire escape is , they ’ll probably have some helpful tips about how to avoid smoke inhalation , as well as a vast array of likely probabilities regarding survival rates in multistory building fires .
How is it that this junior software engineer knows all this ?
Who knows , maybe he read it on a Wikipedia two years ago .
Perhaps a close virtual friend of his in New York is a firefighter .
Does it matter ?
He may save your life , or , more likely , keep you well informed with useless facts before you are burned to a crisp .
Downsides
I ’m making NADD sound like a rosy affliction .
There are downsides .
First , it ’s a lot of work to figure out your personal regimen of digesting the world , and , sorry , you are going to miss things .
This will annoy you , but it will also drive you incessantly to look for the next big thing .
Second , you ’re going to sound like a know - it - all .
Try not to .
Most people do n’t actually know that much random trivia , useless info , obscure facts , assorted news , current events , and complex mathematical formulas .
These people are happy without it , and simply because you ’re brimming with the latest and greatest information does n’t mean that everyone is going to want to hear about it .
You ’re not going to have much patience with those who have not chosen a NADD - like life .
Occasionally , you ’ll attempt to impart your fractured wisdom , only to throw your hands up four minutes later when it ’s clear , “ Crap , they just do n’t get it . ”
Chances are , they might ’ve gotten it , and you ’re just afflicted with a disease where your attention span is that of a second grader .
Whether you ’re afflicted with NADD or not , you need to understand one thing .
It ’s not going away .
The generation that invented NADD in the 1980s and 1990s has been replaced by the generation that never knew a world without it , and they ’re going to be annoying in their own unique way .
BOSTON , Aug. 30 - The level of nicotine that smokers typically consume per cigarette has risen 10 percent in the past six years , making it harder to quit and easier to be addicted , said a report that the Massachusetts Department of Health released on Tuesday .
The study shows a steady increase in the amount of nicotine delivered to the smokers ' lungs regardless of brand , with overall yields increasing 10 percent .
Massachusetts is one of three states to require tobacco companies to submit information on nicotine testing to its specifications and is the sole state with data as far back as 1998 .
The study found that the three most popular brands with young smokers , Marlboro , Newport and Camel , delivered significantly more nicotine than they did six years ago .
Nicotine consumed in Kool , a popular menthol brand , rose 20 percent .
Cambridge University researchers have creaked open the door to one of the greatest mysteries in science .
For the first time they can describe some physical properties of " dark matter " , the mysterious substance that outweighs all the stars and galaxies that can be seen in the universe .
Cosmologists know that the stars and planets we can see add up to only 4 % of the mass required to keep the universe in its ordered state .
The rest is made of a combination of unknown particles called dark matter and a source of energy , which seems to push galaxies apart , called dark energy .
Other than knowing that both these things must exist , scientists have been at a loss to describe anything about them .
But by studying the motion of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way , Gerry Gilmore , the deputy director of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University , calculated that dark matter moved at 5.6 miles a second and that the smallest chunks it could exist in measured 1,000 light years across and had 30 m times the mass of the Sun .
" This is the first time we 've determined a property of the dark matter robustly in a way that we expect will give us some real clues as to what the real physics of this stuff is , " said Professor Gilmore at a briefing in London .
He said the universe appeared to be built out of these invisible 1,000 light - year - wide bricks of dark matter .
" There must be some basic property of the dark matter that limits it in that way , " he said .
" It 's the basic unit from which bigger things are made up .
Some of these you put stars in and you call it a little galaxy ; sometimes you put several of these together and call it a bigger galaxy .
But you never get anything smaller . "
The biggest surprise is that dark matter is not the cold cosmic sludge that scientists once thought .
Prof Gilmore calculated its temperature to be in the tens of thousands of degrees , although this is not normal heat .
" Normal hot things glow and you can feel the infrared coming off , " he said .
" The strange thing about dark matter is that it does n't give off radiation . "
This is because dark matter is not made of electrons and protons , the fundamental particles that everything else consists of .
Whatever its mysteries , dark matter has its uses .
It is essential in keeping the universe ordered and , without it , the galaxies would quickly fall apart .
" The Sun is moving so fast that if it were n't for the dark matter , it would fly straight off out of the Milky Way , " said Prof Gilmore .
" The reason we are still here is that we 're held here by the dark matter . "
Different regions of space have different amounts of dark matter .
The concentrations can be measured in terms of the equivalent weight of hydrogen , the lightest atom in the universe , per cubic centimetre .
Around the Sun the concentration of dark matter is equivalent in weight to a third of an atom of hydrogen per cubic centimetre .
According to the new results , the maximum density that dark matter can be packed into is much greater : the weight of four hydrogen atoms per cubic centimetre .
While diffuse , it permeates the entire universe and adds up to more than five times the mass of all the stars and galaxies in existence .
The results , which are yet to be published , were obtained by analysing measurements made at the Very Large Telescope , an array of four 8 m telescopes on the Paranal mountain in Chile , part of the European Southern Observatory .
The observations took 23 nights of work , the biggest British experiment carried out at Paranal .
Prof Gilmore said he was in the final stages of drafting a paper on the results to be submitted to a scientific journal .
The research might also give clues to the relationship between dark matter and dark energy .
" Something has fine - tuned the relative amounts of this stuff to make them similar in amount and exactly right to add up to perfection .
That can't be chance , there 's got to be some connection between the two , " said Prof Gilmore .
An additional unexpected result that came out of the dark matter study was the discovery that the Milky Way was bigger than cosmologists had thought .
Prof Gilmore said it was the biggest galaxy in the local group , knocking Andromeda , previously thought to be the largest , into second place .
FAQ : Missing mass
What is dark matter ?
It was first proposed in 1933 by Swiss cosmologist Fritz Zwicky as a way to explain the missing mass of the universe .
Estimates suggest that normal matter - what we see in the universe , including the stars and planets - makes up only 4 % of the universe .
How much of it is there ?
Dark matter makes up about 23 % of the mass of the universe and the remainder is dark energy , another mysterious substance that pushes matter apart .
What do we know about dark matter particles ?
Not much .
Whatever they are , dark matter particles are transparent to light , and unlike most components of ordinary matter , have no electric charge .
Yet they are weighty enough to exert a gravitational pull that prevents the stars in galaxies from flying apart .
Are scientists trying to detect it ?
Yes .
Experiments are attempting to measure the presence of dark matter using huge , one - tonne crystals kept at low temperatures .
The passage of a dark matter particle through the crystal will , very occasionally , lead to a gravitational drag in some of the particles in the crystal .
Aside from these indirect measurements on Earth , there is no way of observing the particles yet .

Randal Schwartz was too curious for his own good .
As a contractor at Intel in Oregon in the early 1990s , he poked and prodded a bit too much , especially in the area of demonstrating how poorly chosen – how weak – many account passwords were in the groups he worked for .
Schwartz is best known as an expert in the programming language Perl that is widely used for Web applications alongside later arrival PHP .
( In fact , big hunks of TidBITS are now powered by Perl . )
Most system administrators view testing passwords for strength as one of many tests to ensure that a network and its associated computers are resistant against infiltration and compromise .
However , disputes in the manner by which Schwartz ran his password - cracking tests and the permission he had to do so led to him being released from Intel , charged with a computer crime under Oregon law , and convicted of three felonies .
He also had to pay restitution to Intel and a large pile of legal costs – hundreds of thousands of dollars in all .
Those convictions have now been expunged , and I ’m happy to spread the word .
On 01 - Feb - 07 , a court ordered that due to “ the circumstances and behavior of the defendant since the date of conviction ” and his completion of all provisions required of him , his conviction and arrest are to be removed from the record .
In the words of the order , “ the defendant … shall be deemed not to have been previously convicted or arrested . ”
The conviction was a travesty of justice , one that I ’m not convinced would have been upheld by Oregon ’s Supreme Court or higher courts .
The judge noted in one part of the trial that the law appeared to characterize changing the background color of a computer ’s operating system display as a crime .
( An appeal in 2001 resulted in a mixed bag of results . )
And I do n’t believe anyone has been prosecuted since in Oregon in a remotely similar manner .
The PDF of the expungement order can be found at the Friends of Randal Schwartz site , which has extensive archives of public statements on the matter by those involved , which make it pretty clear that Intel was running the prosecution , and that Schwartz was convicted partly on the basis of police recollection of one conversation while his home was being searched .
Schwartz never said he acted intelligently in the matter .
He was read his rights by the police during a quasi- raid of his premises , and he spoke without a lawyer present .
He had been asked multiple times to not run cracking software and to turn off software that allowed him remote access for various purposes .
And he held off reporting the flaws he found for so long that it looked like he was hiding something .
But I have long maintained the prosecution was pretty much a farce .
Schwartz had no criminal intent and the “ restitution ” he paid Intel was for them to fix problems that existed before he demonstrated them .
In fact , Intel would have paid a huge price had criminal crackers gained access to their systems ; they probably should have paid Schwartz a bonus rather than trying to get him put in the pokey .
Schwartz never served jail time .
In fact , the judge in the case was remarkably sympathetic to him but had to follow existing law .
But he was , until a few weeks ago , a felon , and that ’s a cross to bear in the post - 9/11 world .
As an internationally recognized program - language expert , Schwartz ’s ability to work on certain government and corporate contracts was restricted , and traveling outside the United States was quite difficult .
I met Schwartz through Geek Cruises ‘s first Mac Mania cruise , a great week spent with lots of Mac writers I had long known or wanted to meet , and a fantastic set of attendees .
Schwartz has been on every Geek Cruise , a sort of vocational hobby of his now , a fact I accidentally confirmed at Macworld Expo with CEO and “ Captain ” Neil Bauman , who runs the conference series .
On the last day of the cruise , as we waited to get called to disembark , Schwartz sat in the lounge from which we had Wi -Fi access to a slow Internet connection explaining to people how they were sending their passwords in the clear over the Wi-Fi connection – and he would tell them a snippet of their password to prove it .
It was a startling wake - up call to those present , and an ironic callback to what led to his difficulties in the first place .
A few years ago , Schwartz asked me if I , along with a number of other people , would write a letter to the then - outgoing governor of Oregon asking for a pardon .
In it , I described Schwartz ’s consistent white - hat behavior , his generosity with his time , and his strict adherence to the terms set at his sentencing .
The governor declined to issue a pardon , but as I wrote at the time , Schwartz demonstrably never had any intent to cause harm , only to improve security , and erred only in violating company policies .
There was never any proof – nor any needed under Oregon law , unfortunately – that Schwartz obtained any information he was n’t intended to have , either .
I ’m delighted that Schwartz has been rendered unconvicted .
And I wrote this article in part to spread the word , in part to note how easy it could be to be charged and convicted of a computer crime for actions that may not seem problematic at the time , and in part to file this brief with Google – so that Schwartz ’s name is associated more with the absence of a conviction than the presence of one .
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 were published in 1999 and quickly grew out of date .
The proposed new WCAG 2.0 is the result of five long years ’ work by a Web Accessibility Initiative ( WAI ) committee that never quite got its act together .
In an effort to be all things to all web content , the fundamentals of WCAG 2 are nearly impossible for a working standards - compliant developer to understand .
WCAG 2 backtracks on basics of responsible web development that are well accepted by standardistas .
WCAG 2 is not enough of an improvement and was not worth the wait .
Article Continues Below
Prepare for disappointment #section2
If you ’re a standards - compliant web developer , you already know about web accessibility and are familiar with the only international standard on that topic , the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines .
WCAG 1 just celebrated its seventh birthday and is closing in on the end of its life .
WCAG 1 badly needs revision .
On 27 April 2006 , WAI published the first instalment of the interminable sequence of documents required for the revision , WCAG 2.0 , to become a standard .
If you were hoping for a wholesale improvement , you ’re going to be disappointed .
A lot of loose ends have been tidied up , and many low - priority guidelines are now pretty solid .
The problem here is that standardistas already knew what to do to cover the same territory as those low - priority guidelines .
Where WCAG 2 breaks down is in the big stuff .
Curiously , though , and perhaps due to meticulous editing over the years , the big stuff is well camouflaged and , to an uninformed reader , WCAG 2 seems reasonable .
It is n’t , and you as a working standards - compliant developer are going to find it next to impossible to implement WCAG 2 .
Where to find the documents # section3
In the great tradition of the W3C , the actual WCAG 2 documents are confusing and hard to locate .
( I ’ll also give you pagecounts , as printed to U.S. letter–sized PDF from Safari with unchanged defaults , as well as wordcounts without markup . )
I printed and read all three of these documents for this article .
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is the actual root document and is the only one that is “ normative , ” i.e. , a standard .
It ’s described , in W3C parlance , as a Last Call Working Draft .
( 72 pages , 20,800 words )
parlance , as a Last Call Working Draft . ( 72 pages , 20,800 words ) Understanding WCAG 2 .0 is a document that purports to explain WCAG 2 .
( 165 pages , 51,000 words )
. 0 is a document that purports to explain .
( 165 pages , 51,000 words )
Techniques for WCAG 2 .0 provides “ general ” techniques .
( 221 pages , 88,000 words )
When compared against typical page dimensions in books , the three WCAG 2 documents , at 450 pages , exceed the size of each of the books published on the topic of WCAG 1 , including mine .
Additionally , according to many blog reports ( Snook , Clagnut , Sitepoint ) , Shawn Lawton Henry of the WAI Education & Outreach Working Group cautioned attendees at her South by Southwest 2006 presentation to read only the Understanding document , not the actual spec .
Since the Understanding document is more than double the size of what it purports to explain , this itself may indicate a problem with WCAG 2 .
There ’s a separate document , not updated since November 2005 , covering HTML techniques .
It is n’t included in this article .
Also , “ guidelines ” in WCAG 1 are now called “ success criteria ” in WCAG 2 , a change in nomenclature I will ignore .
You do n’t have a lot of time to comment #section4
After working on WCAG 2 for five years , WAI gave the entire industry and all interested parties , including people with disabilities , a whopping 34 days to comment on WCAG 2 ( until 31 May 2006 ) .
While that is in excess of the suggested three - week minimum , it is n’t long enough .
The Working Group , moreover , would like you to fill out a form , possibly using Excel , for each and every issue you disagree with .
I advise you to simply send mail to public-comments-wcag20@w3.org and read the archives of that mailing list ( where it ’s impossible to tell exactly who submitted what comment via the WAI form ) .
There ’s a lengthy omnibus list of comments received via the WAI form .
I also advise people to petition for at least another month ’s commenting time , quoting W3C process back to them ( viz . , comment periods “ may last longer if the technical report is complex or has significant external dependencies ” ) .
The process stinks #section5
And now a word about process , which you have have to appreciate in order to understand the result .
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is the worst committee , group , company , or organization I ’ve ever worked with .
Several of my friends and I were variously ignored ; threatened with ejection from the group or actually ejected ; and actively harassed .
The process is stacked in favour of multinationals with expense accounts who can afford to talk on the phone for two hours a week and jet to world capitals for meetings .
The WCAG development process is inaccessible to anyone who does n’t speak English .
More importantly , it ’s inaccessible to some people with disabilities , notably anyone with a reading disability ( who must wade through ill - written standards documents and e-mails — there ’s already been a complaint ) and anyone who ’s deaf ( who must listen to conference calls ) .
Almost nobody with a learning disability or hearing impairment contributes to the process — because , in practical terms , they can’t .
What WAI is supposed to be doing is improving the web for people with disabilities .
Something ’s wrong if many participants work in a climate of fear , as they tell me they do .
I never hear of similar complaints from WAI ’s other groups .
WCAG Working Group is a rogue element within the W3C , one that chair Tim Berners - Lee must urgently bring to heel .
The process is broken , so let ’s not be surprised that the result of that process is broken , too .
Less of a travesty , but still a failure #section6
If you ever set aside two hours of your life to read a previous “ draft ” of WCAG 2 , you were probably baffled and / or infuriated .
The Working Group has been effective at improving minor guidelines and has excelled at making the whole document seem eminently reasonable .
They ’ve succeeded spectacularly at burying the lede — hiding the nub of the guidelines deep within the document .
They ’ve done a beautiful job at making WCAG 2 look like it will actually work .
It wo n’t .
Based on the three documents I read , taking into account both required and suggested practices , let me explain what WCAG really says :
Since these three documents are “ drafts , ” of course all the above can change .
But really , it wo n’t .
A Last Call Working Draft is viewed as substantially complete .
It is “ a signal that … the Working Group believes that it has satisfied its relevant technical requirements [ and ] has satisfied significant dependencies with other groups . ”
The WCAG Working Group is not going to budge on major issues at this point .
It ’s the definitions that sink it #section7
While WCAG 2 calls for all manner of unrealistic and unproven features , those are not what ’s going to sink the guidelines .
Something as mundane as definitions will take care of that .
WCAG 1 was strongly HTML - specific .
Everybody recognized that as a problem in an age when formats that blind people love to hate , like PDF and Flash , are slowly becoming accessible .
So WCAG 2 had to be technology - neutral .
But in so doing , it imagined a parallel universe in which the vast majority of web content ceased to be plain - Jane HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
It envisioned a world in which lots and lots of Flash , PDF , and other , as - yet - uninvented formats were available and intended to be accessible .
To accommodate this dreamworld , WCAG 2 was written and rewritten and rerewritten to apply to everything .
Along the way , it lost the ability to apply to the real things real developers work on every day — plain - Jane HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
Pop quiz :
What do the following terms , given with their official WCAG 2 definitions , really mean ?
authored unit set of material created as a single body by an author authored component an authored unit intended to be used as part of another authored unit web unit a collection of information , consisting of one or more resources , intended to be rendered together , and identified by a single Uniform Resource Identifier ( such as URLs ) parsed unambiguously parsed into only one data structure programmatically determined determined by software from data provided in a user - agent - supported manner such that the user agents can extract and present this information to users in different modalities
Can you translate any of these terms into words that every reader of this article understands , like “ page , ” “ site , ” “ valid , ” “ well - formed , ” or “ template ” ?
Well , I can ’t .
Amid all these definitions , where are the templates we use to create sites composed of valid , well - formed pages ?
If you ’re a standardista working on accessible websites today , are you actually , without even knowing it , an author authoring authored units to be used in authored components in programmatically - determined web units that can be parsed unambiguously ?
Take a look at WCAG 2 and you ’ll come up with your own checklist of malapropisms and incomprehensible passages .
In fact , so much of WCAG 2 is so hard to understand , and almost impossible to apply to real - world websites , that WCAG 2 is no better than its predecessor in one respect — both documents flunk their own guidelines for clear and simple writing .
If you ca n’t understand the basics of a guideline , and if WCAG 2 in general is so aloof from the real web that it ca n’t even bother to use words that working developers understand , are you realistically going to be able to implement WCAG 2 on your site ?
Remember , you cannot officially fall back on the Techniques and Understanding documents for added information .
Only the WCAG 2 document itself is “ normative . ”
You sink or swim based solely on that .
And if you have trouble understanding WCAG , does this not imply that someone could come along with a different interpretation and accuse you of violating WCAG , and , by implication , producing an inaccessible site ?
Since that ’s illegal in some parts of the world , a certain degree of clarity is essential , but clarity is something you do not get in WCAG 2 .
If you slog through WCAG 2 , you ’ll notice that even something as deceptively simple as that WCAG 1 guideline on clear and simple writing is n’t there .
Nor is there anything actually stronger than that guideline .
In fact , there ’s nothing at all along those lines to be found in WCAG 2 ’s Principle 3 , “ Content and controls must be understandable . ”
You do , however , have to take fanatical care to mark up foreign - language passages , idioms , and the like , and if your content “ requires reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level , ” you have to provide “ supplementary content ” that does n’t require that reading level .
If you ’re a learning - disabled person , that ’s pretty much all WCAG 2 is willing to do for you .
Based on my analysis and on presentations by Gian Sampson - Wild , it seems that dyslexics and others with cognitive disabilities have been sacrificed on the altar of testing .
As WCAG 2 tells us :
All WCAG 2.0 success criteria are testable .
While some can be tested by computer programs , others must be tested by qualified human testers .
Sometimes , a combination of computer programs and qualified human testers may be used .
When people who understand WCAG 2.0 test the same content using the same success criteria , the same results should be obtained with high inter-rater reliability .
“ High inter - rater reliability ” is not defined .
Does it mean eight out of ten people ?
Six ?
All ten ?
It seems that everybody assumed it would be easy to find “ people who understand WCAG 2.0 ” yet who also disagree that a certain segment of content is clearly and simply written .
I assume it was taken as axiomatic that tests of content would seldom achieve “ high inter - rater reliability , ” which relies on messy human opinion .
The Working Group was and is unreasonably fixated on automated testing , in part due to the presence on the Working Group of authors of automated testing applications and algorithms .
The group was able to stomach the reality that , for example , alt texts can be evaluated only by humans , but was unwilling to accept that the same applies to “ content ” generally .
It is harsh but fair to observe that WCAG 2 sells out people with learning disabilities so that a tool like Bobby , or a competing or successor tool , can test a larger number of criteria with a higher success rate .
The creative fiction of multiple levels # section9
WCAG 1 had three levels of “ conformance , ” which , in typical WAI style , were given a total of six names — Priority 1 / Level A , Priority 2 / Level AA ( annoyingly written as “ Double - A ” to get around faulty screen - reader pronunciation ) , and Priority 3 / Level AAA ( “ Triple - A ” ) .
Standardistas eventually figured out that Priorities 1 and 2 were what you really needed to make an accessible website ; Priority 3 was strictly optional ( also onerous and impossible to meet in principle ) .
Even some governments , like Canada ’s , require Priority 2 compliance for their own sites , though it is not necessarily achieved .
When experts carry out evaluations of websites against WCAG 1 , most of the time they consider the first two priority levels .
Few , if any , sites pass Priority 3 evaluation ; the Disability Rights Commission and Nomensa found that no sites tested met Priority 3 .
To a rational observer , all this means that Priorities 1 and 2 in WCAG 1 are really a single set of rules and Priority 3 is irrelevant and unattainable .
Getting this idea through the heads of the Working Group ( or rather , through the head of one of the cochairs ) was impossible , so in WCAG 2 we ’re still stuck with three levels .
But get this :
All levels are deemed important .
Level 1 success criteria : Achieve a minimum level of accessibility .
Can reasonably be applied to all web content .
Level 2 success criteria : Achieve an enhanced level of accessibility .
Can reasonably be applied to all web content .
Level 3 success criteria : Achieve additional accessibility enhancements .
Cannot necessarily be applied to all web content .
To translate :
We poor saps misunderstood WCAG 1 ’s priority levels to be real priority levels .
WCAG 2 considers all of its guidelines “ essential for some people , ” though they ’re still broken up into three levels .
But actually , if you look closely at the WAI documents :
Even if you comply with all three levels in WCAG 2 , you may still end up with an inaccessible site .
You never have to comply with more than half of the Level 3 guidelines .
The WCAG 2 document itself baldly states that “ It is not recommended that Triple - A conformance ever be required for entire sites . ”
In a circular contradiction , Guideline 4.2.4 , at Level 3 , does n’t even require you to meet Level 3 in some cases .
Which level would you like to conform to ?
Please make your selection now .
In a further absurdity , the Working Group could n’t even finesse its guidelines to apply to all levels .
Some guidelines do n’t even manifest themselves at Level 1 , the lowest level .
I did a count :
Levels 1 + 2 + 3 : 7 guidelines
No Level 1 : 1 guideline
No Level 2 : 2 guidelines
No Level 3 : 1 guideline
Level 1 only : 2 guidelines
( Level 2 only or Level 3 only : Nil )
It ’s as if web standards never existed # section10
While people like you and me were labouring in the trenches since approximately 1998 to improve web standards — improve support in browsers , improve understanding among authors , improve the basic task of explaining standards — the WCAG Working Group has been off in its parallel universe cooking up guidelines that apply equally ambiguously to everything .
But the Working Group certainly did take the time to exterminate some accepted concepts .
Yes , we know already : A site with valid HTML is not automatically accessible .
We ’ve got a couple of fun little example pages to look at ( by Gez Lemon and Bruce Lawson ) .
But that ’s all they are — examples .
In the real world of clueless tag - soup developers , the growing minority who understand valid HTML are an elite who also understand accessibility .
They understand which accessibility features you get for free with valid HTML ( like alt texts , which — yes , we know already — have to be written correctly ) .
These developers take the time to include the remaining accessibility features anyway .
They also understand that tag soup produces unpredictable results in browsers and in screen readers .
They know that a single unencoded ampersand , or omitted semicolon , or stray Unicode character on a page may knock it into the land of invalid HTML , but those are trifling examples not found in tag - soup sites like Amazon and eBay .
( They know that Amazon and eBay are successful despite their source code . )
They know that validity is a fragile thing that indeed can be blown out of the water by something as simple as a character like an é , an ( sic ) , or an & in the wrong place .
They know all that .
Nonetheless , valid HTML was a second - level requirement in WCAG 1 .
You almost never find it in a commercial site — Nomensa ’s recent survey , which found four examples out of 99 sites it manually checked , is the highest I ’ve ever seen .
But , as a requirement , it warned developers that , while tag soup is the norm , it is not what we want .
WCAG 2 upends that apple cart completely .
You never have to have valid HTML in WCAG 2 – compliant sites .
All that ’s required is that the page be parsed unambiguously ( Guideline 4.1 — a Level 1 guideline with no Level 2 or 3 guidelines ) .
This is supposed to mean “ no improperly - nested elements , ” but you ’d never know that from the term itself .
In an HTML page , you can keep right on using all the misplaced stray characters you want , but you ca n’t nest < p > inside < p > .
You do not have to use any elements or attributes required by the specification .
You do not have to use elements according to specification .
All this spells trouble for the case of forms , an area of constant annoyance for screen - reader users .
A document made up of nothing but div s and span s , if unambiguously parsable , passes WCAG 2 free and clear .
XHTML pages , according to spec , are supposed to stop dead in their tracks at the first ill - formed content , but we know they do not do so in the real world , where XHTML is treated like a kind of HTML with added closing slashes
( save for the tiny few perfectionists who serve XHTML as XML ) .
So in fact this requirement gives XHTML the same pass it gives HTML .
Does any of that really solve the problem ?
Or does it have enough of an appearance of solving the problem that it could be voted into existence by Working Group members from companies like IBM , Oracle , and SAP , whose software cannot reliably produce genuine valid HTML ?
( IBM has been actively promoting a DHTML accessibility technique that breaks the HTML spec .
Oddly , and futilely , the Techniques document discourages such a thing . )
Do you think WCAG 2 ’s guideline is good enough to improve the practices of tag - soup developers ?
Even if valid HTML everywhere all the time is unattainable , the fact remains that , in 2006 , we have never had more developers who understand the concept and are trying to make it real on their own sites .
WCAG 2 undoes a requirement that , were it retained , could be perfectly timed now .
Captioning and audio description for multimedia#section11
If there ’s any area in which the application of WCAG 1 was a total failure , it ’s multimedia .
People have been quite happy to ignore the requirements for captions ( for the deaf ) and audio descriptions ( additional narration for the blind ) , both of which were required at the lowest accessibility level .
( Actually , it was worse than that from a deaf person ’s perspective .
You could get by just with a transcript , not actual captions . )
Captioning and description simply are not found in the wild .
When there ’s any access at all , it ’s through captioning .
In this way , online multimedia follows TV , home video , and cinema in major democracies , where captioning is common and description is n’t .
( Who can forget the irony of AOL ’s head of accessibility , a blind man , announcing captioning on “ select ” AOL videos , but no audio description at all ? )
For a deaf or a blind person who wants to understand multimedia , WCAG 2 offers no real improvement .
The transcript - only loophole has been closed , and captions remain a requirement at the lowest level for prerecorded video .
But instead of audio description , you can get by with a figment of the Working Group ’s imagination called a “ full multimedia text alternative including any interaction ” .
A discredited holdover from WCAG 1 , it ’s apparently a combination of transcript of dialogue and sound effects ( which blind people do n’t need ) , transcript of audio descriptions ( which deaf people do n’t need ) , and links to any interactive components in the video .
The whole thing is supposed to be of help to deaf - blind people , who were never surveyed for their preferences , an action I recommended to WAI at a face - to - face meeting in 2003 .
Nor was any user testing carried out .
( That ’s all I can tell from published evidence , anyway .
I sent e-mail inquiries to deaf - blind organizations in several countries asking if they ’d been surveyed or had any opinions , with no response . )
There are about three known examples of such a transcript in the seven - year history of WCAG ( e.g. , DigNubia ) .
And there really are n’t any HTML semantics for such transcripts , unless you wanted to push the envelope of the definition list ( a banned usage in “ HTML 5 ” ) .
At the next - to - lowest compliance level , suddenly real audio descriptions are required and , again suddenly , live video must be captioned .
Go one step higher and you have to translate your video into sign language ( which one ? ) and provide that same imaginary transcript , among other things .
You never have to describe live video .
And while I ’ve never been a proponent of requiring the hundreds of live online radio stations to caption themselves , certainly prerecorded podcasts are an obvious source of inaccessible multimedia .
But actually , multimedia is defined as “ audio or video synchronized with another type of media and / or with time - based interactive components . ”
Your MP3 podcast is n’t synchronized with anything , so it ’s exempt .
This requirement will satisfy the majority of podcasters who ever even bothered to think about accessibility , pretty much all of whom decided it was too much trouble even if they liked the idea or worked for WAI at the time .
The requirement will also ensure that the status quo of inaccessible podcasting remains untouched .
Further discussion #section12
That ’s enough for one article , I think .
But that is n’t the end of my comments on WCAG 2 ; you can check my website for ongoing additions .
This article ’s comments section , and the tag WCAG2 , are other ways to comment .
Announcing the WCAG Samurai#section13
WCAG 2 is not too broken to fix , but we have no reason to think the WCAG Working Group will actually fix it .
The Working Group is too compromised by corporate interests , too wedded to the conclusions we see in the current “ draft , ” too broken in general .
What you see in WCAG 2 now is pretty much what you ’re gonna get — permanently .
As such , WCAG 2 will be unusable by real - world developers , especially standards - compliant developers .
It is too vague and counterfactual to be a reliable basis for government regulation .
It leaves too many loopholes for developers on the hunt for them .
WCAG 2 is a failure , and not even a noble one at that .
If this is what we get when WAI tries to rewrite WCAG from scratch , maybe there ’s another option .
WCAG 2 does not “ replace ” WCAG 1 any more than XHTML “ replaced ” HTML .
Maybe all we really need to do is to fix the errata in WCAG 1 .
It ’s been discussed before , but a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition or a WCAG 1.1 never happened .
Now , though , I can announce that such errata really are going to be published , and my friends and I are going to do the publishing .
After the manner of Zeldman ’s CSS Samurai posse , which put CSS layouts on the map for browser makers and developers , the WCAG Samurai will publish errata for , and extensions to , existing accessibility specifications .
Of course we are n’t going to infringe anybody ’s copyright , but another thing we ’re not going to do is run a totally open process .
It ’s a viable model for standards development , one I have championed in another context , but in web accessibility it is proven not to work .
Membership in WCAG Samurai , as in CSS Samurai , will be by invitation only .
If we want you , you ’ll hear from us .
Of course this is unfair to say the least , if not actively elitist and hypocritical .
Call it as you see it .
But this is what we ’re going to try in the hopes of getting the job done , which WAI and its model have simply failed to do .
Is Israel Falling Apart ?
Mr. Wahrman is Ruth N. Halls Professor of History and Director of the Center for Eighteenth - Century Studies at the Indiana University History Department ( adjunct in English , Jewish Studies , Cultural Studies ) .
Foreign observers of Israel tend to focus so intently on the dangers the country faces from its Arab neighbours that they have largely missed an astonishing story that has been accelerating over the past few months : that of the Jewish state ’s possible move toward internal collapse .
If you consider this an exaggeration , just take note of what the past couple of weeks have brought about .
A few days ago the chief of the Israeli police resigned after an investigation that found several of Israel ’s highest police officers guilty of corruption and negligence .
This came within a week of the forced resignation of Israel ’s Chief of Staff from the military because of the fiascos of the second Lebanon war .
It was also some ten days after Israel ’s minister of justice was convicted of sexual assault while on duty , and a couple of weeks after Israel ’s president – who holds a largely symbolic position – resigned temporarily following charges of rape and sexual misconduct .
It was also the same day that the head of Israel ’s tax authority resigned because of possible corruption charges .
In the meantime , several other investigations are still pending , not least two or three directed at the Prime Minister himself , Ehud Olmert , concerning corruption and favoritism .
And an appeal to the Supreme Court has already been filed against the minister of police ’s choice for a new police chief – again , because of old charges of corruption of which the nominee had been acquitted only through a particularly narrow benefit of the doubt .
Do these events really presage the collapse of the Israeli system of governance and democracy ?
There certainly has never been such a deep crisis of leadership in the country that touts itself as the only democracy in the Middle East .
The leader of the ruling parliamentary coalition , Avigdor Yitzhaki , said so publicly a few days ago .
And the Minister of Education has suggested that all schools devote special classes to the “ government crisis ” , so that children can speak out about what might well seem to them like a total collapse of all systems that control their lives .
Suddenly the Palestinians and the Hizbullah , and even Iranian nukes , have taken a back seat : Israel does indeed seem in danger of imploding from within , at least as a viable democracy .
There are at least two narratives that can help situate why Israel finds itself in such a worrying place on the eve of its sixtieth birthday .
For convenience we can tag them by the country ’s most decisive formative moments : the story of 1948 and the story of 1967 .
The story of 1948 is that of a country that underwent an almost miraculous process of birth and growth despite limited resources .
From a tiny nation brought into the world by the twin handmaidens of war and seige , and immediately thereafter deluged with waves of immigration several times greater than its 1948 population , Israel managed to become in almost no time a thriving economic , scientific and military power .
This unprecedented leap could not be achieved by following the rules .
Not that there were too many rules to follow – even those still had to be created .
But the main ethos of Israel ’s founding fathers was one of in - the - field activism : to a man on the job – and in those days it was always imagined to be a man , not a woman , undertaking a task that was indubitably essential to the building of the nation – everything was permissible .
In those early and exciting days , the most powerful compliment you could give an Israeli leader was to describe him as a “ bulldozer ” : someone who was right there on the ground , moving mountains and paving roads , unstoppable by anything .
Intertwined with the myth of the creation of Israel was a culturally sanctioned encouragement to disregard the rules .
The story continues , typically , that the founding fathers never abused this permission to transcend norms and regulations for their private gain .
The supposed proof of this claim , endlessly and nostalgically reiterated , is Yitzhak Rabin ’s resignation from his first term as prime minister in 1976 .
It had been discovered that Rabin ’s wife retained a bank account abroad , which was prohibited by Israel ’s foreign currency laws at that time : a minor infraction that nonetheless led Rabin to throw in the towel .
And yet the disregard for limitations on action , the lack of effective supervisory mechanisms , the advantage of local initiative , and the fact that activities were all undertaken by a small group of people who knew each other intimately , could easily shade into more serious forms of corruption .
When Israel ’s most legendary soldier , Moshe Dayan , developed a penchant for archeology , not only did he allow himself to take home nearly any antiquity his heart desired , but when this antiquity happened to be sitting on top of Masada – the archeological dig that itself came to symbolize Israel ’s success – he had no compunctions about enlisting an IDF helicopter to help lift it off the cliff .
Few of these facts were secret ; after Dayan ’s death the state paid a million dollars to his widow to move his antiquities collection to the Israel Museum , where it should have been all along .
Public outrage was minimal .
The story of 1967 is darker .
It is the story of occupation .
To see the connection , here are two other news items from this past week , though neither has made it into the front pages .
The Israeli courts are trying gingerly to evict a group of settlers who used shady real estate manipulation to invade a Palestinian village just south of the Old City of Jerusalem , and who built without a permit a seven story building ( inside a traditional village ! ) for settler families .
Meanwhile , inside the Old City , it was revealed that the Israeli government is withholding its formal recognition of the new leader of the Greek - Orthodox Church in the Holy Land , Patriarch Theophilus , because it wants him to sell prime real estate near Jaffa Gate to settlers as a condition for recognizing his official status .
Both acts brazenly ignore Israeli law .
Based on past experience , however , both are likely to succeed .
And such events are common , the tail end of a history of forty years of illegal appropriations under occupation .
The infinite variety of devices through which Israel has condoned and often actively encouraged the breaking of the rules in its drive to expropriate Palestinian occupied land against both Israeli and international law has been documented not only by journalists , scholars and observers on the left : it was also the subject of a thick government judicial document , known as the “ Sasson Report , ” which created something of a furore when it was handed to prime minister Ariel Sharon in March 2005 .
Within months , however , the Sasson Report joined the mounting pile of legal and normative documents that have been effortlessly side - stepped by the settlers and their supporters in multiple branches of the government .
It was only a matter of time , inevitably , before the lawlessness of the occupied territories – and their support networks throughout the Israeli state apparatus – began infecting Israel proper .
Both stories of disregard for law and norms , the nation - building drive of 1948 and the land - grabbing drive of 1967 , have come together above all in one particular figure , mythological already in his lifetime : Ariel Sharon .
Sharon was the ur- bulldozer .
His name is virtually synonymous with dogged action combined with disrespect for law and authority .
His public career as a soldier and as a civilian was built out of repeated acts of disobedience and of establishing facts on the ground ; the first Lebanon War is only the most famous and disastrous example .
In the occupied territories , nobody did more for the settlement movement than Sharon , who taught its leaders techniques to railroad the opposition .
And then he did the same to them , in turn , when he suddenly shifted his loyalties and embarked on his “ disengagement plan ” in 2004 .
It is therefore hardly a coincidence that Sharon ’s rise to the highest office in the state marked a decisive moment in this process of collapse : the moment when corruption and normlessness suddenly seemed to take over the system in all its nooks and crannies .
Sharon ’s tenure in office was more autocratic than any Israel had previously seen .
He bypassed even his own government and ministers through a small cabal of friends and family that came to be know as “ The Ranch Forum ” ( named after Sharon ’s private ranch in the Negev , itself a manifestation of quasi- corrupt privilege ) .
It also turned out that Sharon ’s unstoppable drive easily bled into self - serving corruption , funneling millions into his family ’s bank accounts .
And yet , despite the multiple corruption scandals that swirled over his head , Sharon himself remained largely unscathed , saved in part by his mythical status , and in part by his conversion to the disengagement plan which suddenly gave his many critics on the left a surprising stake in his survival .
He was also saved , in a sense , by falling into a coma in January 2006 : only this personal catastrophe prevented him from seeing a few weeks later his son and political amanuensis , Omri Sharon , being carted off to jail for corruption charges .
So if Sharon ’s reign was the epitome of success for the activism of both 1948 and 1967 , the reign of his successors has been the time of collapse and of reckoning .
With Sharon ’s departure Israel has been left with a weak cadre of second - rate politicians , who seem even more puny in the shadow of Sharon ’s towering figure and tragic exit .
The corrupt practices are all there , but no higher motives can be claimed for them , and no protection from public outrage can be afforded to their perpetrators .
They are simply as petty and ugly as they look .
Even when Dan Chaluz , the Army Chief of Staff , resigned for reasons ostensibly linked to the failed war in Lebanon , the one act of his that will be remembered with particular public disgust is that even as he ordered the bombing of Southern Lebanon on the 12th of July 2006 , he paused to instruct his stock broker to sell his portfolio ; a callous , greedy mistake Sharon would never have committed .
So let us ask again : is Israeli democracy in danger ?
This democracy is young , evolving , and certainly not indestructible .
For a while it has been showing clear signs of strain ; not least , the inability to maintain reasonable political stability amid the frequent turnovers of ministers and administrations .
Now it is showing even clearer signs of deep crisis .
According to every survey and poll , levels of popular confidence in the system have never been so low .
People are turning their backs on politics as never before .
Indeed , the very violence with which the public is pouncing on every falling public figure is a sign of how deep the anger runs .
The present void might well encourage those who promise a radical cleansing of the Augean stables in return for a different kind of political rule – and is it such a stretch of the imagination to see them succeeding ?
Two figures , indeed , have already been making such a pitch , and should therefore be listened to carefully .
Both , probably not coincidentally , are Russian immigrants – and thus even less wed to the Israeli democratic tradition , such as it is .
One is a minister in the current Israeli government , Avigdor Lieberman , a self - proclaimed “ strong man ” with an abiding hatred of the legal system ( and a few brushes with it in his past ) who has already put forth a suggestion to turn Israel into more of a presidential system with few restraints on the chief executive ( as Ben Lynfield reported in the Nation , Dec. 26th 2006 ) .
Lieberman ’s popularity keeps going up even as that of the political system falls .
But in terms of being the most authentic symptom of how deep the malaise goes , as well as having the greater potential to change the rules of the game , Lieberman pales in comparison to a man who chose this same past week to announce his own arrival on the political scene : Arkadi Gaydamak .
Gaydamak is a Russian born billionaire who owes his wealth in part to shady arms dealings in Angola that led the French to issue arrest warrants for illegal arms dealings and money laundering .
Having successfully fended off extradition to France , the oligarch has turned his attention in recent years to philanthropic work in Israel , with a keen interest on using it to create a public image for himself .
When it turned out during the 2006 Lebanon war that the government was ineffective in caring for the civilian population under missile attacks in the north of Israel , Gaydamak stepped into the void and set up a ‘ tent city ’ on the Mediterranean beach for refugees , thus becoming Israel ’s most popular public figure at precisely the moment the political class was experiencing its greatest failure .
No less dramatically – and Gaydamak has nothing if not a flair for dramatic public relations – when Sderot , a small town near the border with Gaza that is home to Minister of Defense Amir Peretz , was showered with Kassam missiles in the fall of 2006 and Peretz and his colleagues in government were wringing their hands , Gaydamak sent buses to take several thousand inhabitants for a vacation at the Red Sea .
Peretz ’s angry reaction to this public gesture only underscored how impotent the establishment looked by comparison to this philanthropist with his bottomless pockets .
A couple of days ago Gaydamak announced , in a lavishly organized event , the foundation of a new political party called “ Social Justice . ”
At a moment when all other politicians are seen as guilty , at least by association , for sticking their hand in the till ( or somewhere else where it does not belong ) , the founder of “ Social Justice ” is the gift that keeps on giving , rather than taking .
Gaydamak does not want to enter politics himself – or so he says .
Indeed , he cannot even speak Hebrew – his speeches are all translated .
What Gaydamak wants , and says almost explicitly , is to use his money to become the king maker of Israeli politics : he wants to choose singlehandedly the next Israeli prime minister .
And based on current polls , his ambitions can not be set aside lightly .
But if Gaydamak is convinced that the Israeli electorate is for sale , and if the voters are willing to prove him right ; and if this transaction is now happening in the public eye , and met with more applause than dismay ; then the problem is not one of the political class alone .
Israeli democracy is in severe crisis : the friends of the Jewish state should be mobilizing post - haste to help Israeli citizens , jaded , disappointed and angry as they might be , ensure it is not a fatal one .

It is NOT a question of what political system will be adopted by the body for governance that will determine the outcome !
It is the intrinsic nature of the intruding body : if indigenous it will merge in its surrounding and integrate there in .
If Alien and unintegrable it will be rejected by the surrounding .
Whether Israel will ever be integrable in its regional surrounding will decide its fate , not its political system .
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007 Questions to Mr Clark
1 - Why " dividing the land along some approximate variant of the 1948 - 67 line " ;
Why NOT along the UN Partition Plan ? ( the only " legal " foundation of Israel 's very existence . )
Patently such a division of the land , according to the UN Partition Plan , will unsettle and disrupt Israeli society to a great extent BUT patently NOT more than the virtual destruction inflicted on Palestinian socity by the establishment of Israel in their native land .
2 - Why should the " Palestinians will have to agree to bargain away the right to return to properties ( in their homeland / my addition ) they lost 60 years , " ?
Why bargain away a fundamental human " RIGHT " except to preserve the ethnic / confessional majority of the alien intruder in their homeland ?
The obvious answer to both questions would be that that reflects the status quo achieved through the use of force which is fair enough as long as the right to reverse that status quo via the same means is maintained .
My point is : as long as the use of force is , or has been , the ultimate arbitrator as to the scope of the " final " settlement ( who gets what ) BOTH parties will always be tempted to use it to create new status quo(s ) and the settlement will NOT be " final " .
The way out ?
Either :
- A settlement as envisaged by the international community ie the UN Partition Plan with its own UN legality and semblance of justice BUT preferably a secular deZionized Palestine for both Arabs and Jews .
OR
- more of the same for generations to come .
( the issue is NOT a borders dispute . )

I do NOT know about Marx and how authorative and well researched his article is .
However the indisputably far better researched and documented population figures are those included in the American KING - CRANE commission report which stated that ( Note OETA / South is Palestine ) :
" The King - Crane Commission Report , August 28 , 1919
I. THE REPORT UPON SYRIA
POPULATION ESTIMATES
An estimate of the population of the different districts is added at this point , for a better understanding of the tables and discussion which follow .
The figures in all cases must be regarded as only approximate , but may be taken as giving a fairly accurate view of the proportions of the population .
O. E. T. A. South O. E. T. A. West O. E. T. A. East Totals
Moslems 515,000 600,000 1,250,000 2,365 000
Christians 62,500 400 000 125,000 587 560
Druses 60,000 80,000 140,000
Jews 65,000 15,000 30,000 110,000
Others 5,000 20 000 20 000 45,000
Totals 647,500 1,095,009 1,505,000
Grand Total 3,247,500 "
Noteworthy in this repect is that Jews numbered 65000 versus 725000 Arabs , both Moslem and Christian ie LESS than 1 to 10 of the Arab population up to late 1919s .
This natural demographic composition of Palestine was transformed by the FORCED entry of Jews into Palestine , against the declared and unrelenting opposition of the indigenous Palestinan people , through Zionist / British imperialism collusion to establish a Jewish colony in it ; the so called " Jewish homeland " .
Next Mr Green will be quoting Mark Twain .
Or , possibly , Groucho Marx !
Any thing will do to support the historical BIG LIE " A land with NO people for a people with NO land " ( The then battle cry of the colonialist and racist Zionist movement . )
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007 " Having the HISTORY right " in human affairs does not mean , can not mean , as you know Mr. Clarke , expecting identical precedents to guide us towards the future .
Neither Switzerland nor Belgium were born out of the interaction of identical forces !
Nor did the interaction of these forces lead to identical outputs .
The Palestinian question is UNIQUE in that sense ; as were the other questions pre their respective resolution .
However I believe that Zionism grave mistake which is rapidly turning into its and Israel ’s fatal mistake was to underestimate the reaction to the supplanting of its alien body ( Alien , at least , according to its perception by the indigenous population of the region ) in the heartland of the Arab / Moslem world .
Nor did they anticipate the ongoing build up of the reaction against it to include the massive mobilization of the Moslem World against it .
The Arabs have shown enough “ sense " to lead some of them to accept Israel , primarily out of defeat in the battlefield and then out of acquiescence to international opinion , to absolutely NO AVAIL . .
I do not expect the Moslems , including " Islamist " Arabs , as distinct from " Nationalist " Arabs , to ever treed the same road of concessions leading to more concessions to NO AVAIL .
What is urgently needed is less Zionist / Israeli arrogance and more farsightedness and a better understanding of history and geography .
Arafat ’s historical unforgiveable hyper mistake , that more than any other single act or event gave HAMAS its historical role and raison d'etre and put a well deserved end to FATAH , was to recognize Israel legitimacy without simultaneously getting a parallel and equal ( in all life matters ) Israeli recognition of Palestinian legitimacy in their homeland .
What Egypt and Jordan achieved through their “ peace ” was to show and convince everybody here that Israel DID NOT , DOES NOT change with peace ; it only wets its appetite for more
If anything it becomes more insatiable and demanding ; witness the settlements construction activity , the Wall , the ascent of Sharon and the starvation of the Palestinians after their respective " peace ” .
Zionist / Israeli shortsightedness cum arrogance both aided and abetted by the USA , will lead to its ultimate demise .

1 - The figures as reported in the KING - CRANE commission report @ the link :
http://www.hri.org/docs/king-crane/syria-pop.html;
ARE :
" O. E. T. A. South
Moslems 515,000
Christians 62,500
Druses 60,000
Jews 65,000
Others 5,000 "
Which proves the substance of my argument that Jews were a tiny minority in a predomonanly Arab Palestine .
Quibling about the exactness of figures in an " estimate " is NOT the point .
( Figures discrepancies are possibly due to the fact that the table in KING - CRANE about " Population Estimates " would NOT reproduce on HNN as is , spread wise , by Copy and Paste .
Try it . )
However the link is there for everbody to consult and draw his own conclusions .
However whether their total was 65000 or 75000 the point is indisputable that Jews were a tiny minority in an overwhelmingly Arab country : Palestine =Filistin and that that small minority turned into a sizable minority as a result of their imperialistiically assisted inavision to , or so called migration into British occupied Palestine AGAINST THE OPPOSITION of the majority of the indigenous Palestinian people .
2 - Do you envision reverting to the childish myth that there was NO Palestine with a predominantly Arab population ?
Is that NOT an infantile argument ?
( Is that the 21st century version of the mega LIE " a land with no people for a people with no land " ) .

omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007 re " insatiability " ( #106624 )
by Peter K. Clarke on March 6 , 2007 at 8:53 PM
Let 's see : I think I meant the 20 odd times over the past year or two you have referred to Israel as " expansionist " in the present tense , or some variant of that claim .
As though any new territory had been conquered and held permanently AFTER 1967 .
It is really quite lame , because there are a long list of horrors ACTUALLY perpetrated by Israel over the past 40 years , such that even the most strident of anti-Israeli commentators do not need to , normally and do not , make up non existent horrors .

Re : re " insatiability " and the Wall / Israeli Expansionism ( #106635 )
by omar ibrahim baker on March 7 , 2007 at 1:45 AM
Mr Clarke
I disagree : Israel is EXPANSIONIST in fact / action , in policy and in doctrine driven intent that is by its ideology .
Witness :
1- The annexation of Arab East Jerusalem and surroundings ; an actual / factual act of de jure expansionism .
2- The confiscation of Arab held lands in the occupied territories and subsequent construction of settlements there on and the land grab of the Wall ; a patent policy move meant to establish a set of fait ( s ) accompli(s ) leading to de jure annexation in case of a settlement .
The USA of the Bush / Wolfowitz administration has officially supported these " de facto " expansionist moves by declaring its support of the Isaraeli claim that they should be retained , ie annexed , by Israel in case of a settlement .
( Note worthy in this respect is that , to my knowledge , NOT a single settlement was constructed on pre 1967 Israeli held land and the implications of the herd 's refusal of the term " occupied territories " . )
3 - The imposition of Israeli law over the occupied Golan Hights ; a preliminary step , the prelude , to future annexation , ie expansion , into Syrian territory .
As a matter of historical fact , law and ideological orientation three major points should be noted :
a-
That every single square cm held by Israel beyond its land allocation according to the UN Partition Plan of Palestine is / was an act of expansion into the Palestinian land allocation by same .
b- That all Israeli " peace " plans proposed boundaries way beyond the 1967 " armistice " , " green " , line .
c- The various definitions of " the land of Israel " by Zionist dogma and Zionist theoreticians , which range from historical Palestine , as a minimum , to " from the Nile to the Euphrates " .
Being the ready made theoretical / ideological / doctrinaire , foundation for future Israeli expansion .
Any way and irrespective YOU DO NOT HAVE to kill MORE than one person to become a killer !
One will do .
However I do agree that : " there are a long list of horrors ACTUALLY perpetrated by Israel over the past 40 years " which neither belie nor attenuate its intrinsic aggressively
" expansionist " nature .

omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007 Mr Clarke
I disagree : Israel is EXPANSIONIST in fact / action , in policy and in doctrine driven intent and by its ideology per se .
Witness :
1- The annexation of Arab East Jerusalem and surroundings ; an actual / factual act of de jure expansionism .
2- The confiscation of Arab held lands in the occupied territories and subsequent construction of settlements there on and the land grab of the Wall ; a patent policy move meant to establish a set of fait ( s ) accompli(s ) leading to de jure annexation in case of a settlement .
The USA of the Bush / Wolfowitz administration has officially supported these " de facto " expansionist moves by declaring its support of the Isaraeli claim that they should be retained , ie annexed , by Israel in case of a settlement .

I , for one , would like to know the answer (s ) to your questions re Abdullah and Hassan .
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007
All kinds of play on words and irrational " logic " are used to deny the obvious !
That there is a Palestinian Arab people .
The absurdity of Mr Green 's assertion ( # 106688 ) is best seen if we consider the following :
- You can NOT be a Texan and an American at the same time .
- There is no such place called Texas ; it is simply part of the USA .
- Traditionally Americans living in Texas saw themselves as nationals of the USA ; ie they are Americans NOT
Texans .
Therefore there is no such place called Texas and , say , North Koreans or Afghanis , are entitled to colonize it and drive away its indigenous population back to the USA .
That Palestine , and its inhabitants , the Palestinian people , the culture , the arabized land predates Texas and the USA by many centuries of continuous habitation , cultivation of the land and construction should NOT make any difference to the " logic " used to deny the obvious .
There is no such place called Texas .

The late sage , but devoted Zionist , Abba Ebban had a persistent nightmare that could eventually lead to the collapse of Israel :
" The Levantization of Israel ! " ,
he called it if I remember correctly his own words .
By that he meant that Israel will eventually acquire / be contaminated with the " environmental / regional " endemic diseases / viruses that plague it and has plagued it historically mainly ( According to Ebban ) :
indolence , corruption and the absence of public participation in governance / despotic non democratic rule !
Being the sage man that he was , Ebban , was also quick to note that the region has a strong concurrent inborn self defense mechanism , particular to its indigenous people , against aliens " viruses " ( in this analogy ) that is usually triggered by mega challenges and in time of mega crisis enables the region to meet and overcome its historical " indolence " thus enabling it to sand up successfully to the challenge , meet it and defeat it .
He , I recall from various readings of Ebban , attributed the collapse of the Crusaders ' challenge to the fact that by being " Levantinez " they acquired the ills of the region without acquiring its concurrent concomitant " immunity " which is particular to its indigenous population .
And having triggered that immunity in its indigenous population by their mere presence , the Crusaders ' incursion was bound to fall under the repeated attacks of the resurgent self defense mechanism of the region against ALIENS .
His , Ebban's , nightmare was that Israel might / will succumb to this " Levantization " and rejection of Aliens syndrome .
The symptoms of the " levantization " + ( levantization plus ) of Israel are more than those already cited in this article to which I will stress ( the new disease ? ) of the huge size , scope , wealth , influence and reach of " organized crime " .
According to Israeli media it seems that " organized crime " is often in the position to " mediate " differences , act as a go between , some criminals and its security organizations .
That is Organized crime has , sometimes , attained an equal standing with its security organizations !
( Haaretz had recently an extremely interesting interview with a senior Israeli judge that touched mainly on this aspect of Israeli life . )
On the other hand the symptoms of the resurgence of the region 's " self
defense " mechanism are there for everybody to note ; not least Hizb Allah 's ability to stand up to and deter / defeat the hugely powerful war machine of the IDF last summer
This could be Phase One in the realization of Abba Ebban 's nightmare
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007
It does NOT matter much how people are killed or who is killing whom ; what really matters is that killing is repulsive and inexcusable paricularly if it has nothing to do with repulsing a foreign invader .
Islam , as an excuse for killing , is no more nor no less sick than other religions or doctrines in the name of which huge killing was perpetrated .
What is going on in Iraq is inexcusable by any standard ; however the point to keep in mind is that it would have been impossible before the Iraqi state was dismantled by the USA invasion of the Bush / Wolfowitz administration !
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007
I made up nothing Eckstein .
I simply reposted articles by the Israeli newspapers " Haaretz " and " The Jerusalem Post " ; if I recall correctly their names .
What is IT that I made up .
Failure to point out what I made up is indicative of a try at making up something for lack of any thing of substance to say .
NOT unusual !
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007
As correctly pointed out by Ben Gurion Israel had to have " its criminals and prostitutes " to become a " nation " .
Now that it has both and much more to boot it will , never the less , always suffer from its deeper illnesses / birth defects which will ultimately determine its fate .
These I deem to be existential in the sense that they will determine the future of its very existence .
** First and foremost is the accelerating and deepening regional rejection of Israel.very existence .
Contrary to Israeli expectations the passage of time did NOT make Israel more " acceptable " to the region .
That is despite " official " acceptance via " peace treaties " with Egypt and Jordan and semi official " normalization " with many others .
" Acceptance " of Israel , both " official " and " semi official " has consistently been accompanied by the radicalization of public opposition to Israel .
In Arab countries it is seen by the rise of Islamist rejectionists in both categories ; witness the rise of the rejectionist Islamist movement in Egypt and Jordan for the former and in Morocco for the latter and , most remarkably , in Kuwait who owes its " official " continued existence to the USA the guardian of Israel .
Non Arab countries in the region has also turned their erstwhile friendly relations with Israel , often verging on strategic alliances , into cold negative " neutrality " as with Turkey and out right enmity as with Iran .
** Of possibly equal importance is the dawning realization , by the Israeli public in particular , of the limitations of hyper military prowess ( last seen in Lebanon last summer ) as the means for attaining the " Jewish Safe Haven and “ the good life ” that goes with it . (
The cause d’etre of the Zionist cause and its offspring Israel ) .
With Israeli present nuclear capability , the imminent nuclearization of Iran and the inevitable overall concurrent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the region “ safety ” , both personal and communal , has and will become so much harder to attain and the “ good life “ , with the threats to Israeli Democracy , farther than ever before
As such both " regional rejection " and " limitations of hyper power " pose " existential " threats to Israel ; and none of these is diminishing with the passage of time .!
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Nor
I am the only one whose skills need improving , Mr. S. Your History skills , for example , probably could stand some polishing .
I say " probably , " because I do not recall any of the hundreds of your prior comments I have seen on HISTORY News Network ever discussing History .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Whatever the answer to Mr. Reisman 's question above , the likely real reason is " better to go to hell our own way than to go to heaven under someone else 's orders . "
This is the ultimate existentialist rationalizing for nationalism , most of the time , and certainly in the case of Israel - Palestine .
The " prognosis " for this discussion , seen in a million similar discussions prior , is for opposing partisans of opposing nationalisms - both wanting SOLE existence in the same physical territory - to bash each other back and forth , convincing no one , and leading nowhere .
I have a query , therefore .
Which of these two will step aside to advocate instead the only viable solution : the " two - state compromise , " dividing the land along some approximate variant of the 1948 - 67 line , accompanied by credible guarantees of peaceful co-existence ?
Such a solution will require adherence to something less than total nationalism on both sides .
Most Israeli " settlers " will have to abandon their hideously ugly bunkers , Palestinians will have to agree to bargain away the right to return to properties they lost 60 years , and many states of the world ago .
And Siamese twin folly of Sharafat during 2000 - 05 will have to be at least tacitly acknowledged for the collosal waste that it is , as the deal which could have been had in 2000 is finally returned to along with a turn to that great rarity in the Middle East : common sense .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 " Some people " have been around here much long than others , and the normal , civilized " benefit of the doubt " thus had a much earlier expiration date .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Thanks , Mr. Crocker , for setting things straight .
I do not , however , share the following particular " expectation , "
" The next time Israel is being criticized for some real or perceived transgression and people start hyperventilating about , admittedly far worse , events in Somalia , Sudan , or elsewhere to defend Israel 's actions expect to see this phrase on the other side of the argument . "
because we fundamentally do not have a balanced " equal attention to both sides " situation here on the HNN comment boards .
What we have here are almost totally unmoderated discussions , open to all comers , effectively giving completely free rein to some subsets within groups of true believers in certain causes , who follow the principle of using quantity of output as a substitute for quality and consistency .
As a purely emperical observation , based on years of experience reading and posting here , " hyperventilating , " is not equally distributed amongst the several " camps " of opinion on Mideastern politics and history .
I think the fundamental way discussions are structured here helps produce that sort of outcome on this and several other " hot- button " subjects .
Even if all the present comment - posters were to disappear or undergo magical reformation , others would replace them .
There is no sanction here against being historically uninformed , illogical , inconsistent , deliberately obfuscatory or deliberately misleading , excessively repetitive , or irrelevant .
There are no inhibitions to interupting , making childish rebuttals , hijacking threads , going onto private soap boxes , or systematically misattributing and falsely labelling other commenters .
There is a limited sanction against being rude , which is sufficient to keep the whole thing functioning at a high level of heat and considerably lower level of light .
These problems are then compounded by an editorial penchant for selecting articles inconsistent with HNN 's stated missions , and designed - deliberately or otherwise - to provoke a maximum of the worst sorts of abuses listed above .
The lack of comment - moderating reinforces this editorial penchant , because balanced and objective articles get vastly lower numbers of comment " hits . "
I suppose , in theory , the inherently - encouraged high - heat and low - light attributes might develop in roughly equal measures on opposite sides of controversial issues .
It has not worked that way in the actual instance of discussions on the Mideast .
If you survey the archives of articles and blogs featured on HNN over past months and years , you will see a diversity but not a balanced diversity .
Among several other reasons , I believe that this observable pattern of editorial bias contributes to the fundamental imbalance on the comment boards .
The whole playing field is basically skewed before the teams even line up .
Sometimes it tilts one way , and sometimes another , but the % breakdown is more like 90 - 10 than 50 - 50 .
There is no improvement in sight re these problems , and that is why the particular expectation of yours expressed in this thread , and any more general expections of that type , are not realistic , in my view .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I have stated the reasons , the logic , and the history behind my conclusions about what people in the Mideast " want " or " do n't want . "
You come to different conclusions based mainly on polling results , which I consider of secondary reliability .
You have lifted numbers out of logistical , social and historical contexts and leapt to conclusions about popular opinion which may prove ultimately valid but have not yet been proven to my satisfaction .
We also disagree on the importance of popular sentiment to policy questions .
There are legitimate reasons for disagreement in this area too .
I have made the point , which you have ignored , that the answers to polling questions depends on history as well as on fundamental personal beliefs .
I think that one could have used polls amongst Jews in Palestine in 1947 to conclude that they " did not want peace . "
Not a reason , in my view , to therefore deny forever the possibility of creating a Jewish state in Palestine .
There are no grounds for calling my conclusions , and ONLY my conclusions , " wishful thinking , " simply because I do not share your views of the importance of mass psychology to policy decision - making or re the reliability of polls as a gauge of popular opinions and emotions .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
" Please support your leading indicator topic . "
Why are you asking for this ?
My Isreal as leading indicator of increased " falling apart - ness " is a tentative conclusion ( I expressed this from the outset as a belief not an established fact ) .
Would you agree that Israel is on the forefront in many areas , such as hight tech research and applications ?
Would you agree that Israel has faced the issue of Islamic anti-modern pressure earlier , more powerfully and longer than elsewhere ?
Would you agree that Israel is not the only country facing increased cheating , disrepect for societal tradtions , general rule - breaking and scandal over recent years ?
Would agree that Israel , generally , shares many features with other countries , despite being unique in some key ways too ?
If you agree with me on these points , I think my leading indicator conclusion should be at least plausible .
If you do n't agree on these points , then you might reach a different conclusion .
If you want to have a discussion on the topic of the page , you need to contribute something to the discussion of that topic yourself , and not just ask me to elaborate on my points , or express suprise that an elaboration by me on ONE of my points , does not support another DIFFERENT point of mine .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
When you are ready to " engage an argument " relevant to the topic of the page and can manage to do so by starting your own thread , Mr. Simon , we can perhaps have a meaningful discussion .
I have seen such miracles occur on very rare occasions in the past .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
With due respect to Mr. Baker , his own family 's presumably unwarranted mishaps due to the uprootings resulting from the formation of Israel , and his right to express his views , he is not any kind of official spokesman .
His views on Israel are not those of the Arab League , the PLO , the UN , or the " Quartet . "
Despite his hardline position , it could still be a basis for discussion , however , if he could manage to de-Zionize his rhetoric and if he could realize that no right is absolute .
The right to free speech not applying to calling fire in a crowded theater , for
example .
I would certainly agree that right of Arabs to return to properties in Israel lost 60 years ago far exceeds the right of Jews to return to Judea and Samaria 2000 years after leaving .
Israel can hardly be expected to surrender the choices parts of itsel , but it needs to compensate Arabs it ethnically cleansed or drove out in fear , and not hide behind a false parallel to Jews who were kicked out of Egypt and other Arab countries .
That was not the fault of Palestinian refugees .
The outlines of a deal were reached in Geneva in 2003 .
They are not substantially different than that envisioned by Oslo in the early 1990s , and by Ythzahk Rabin and moderate Palestinians , and by Clinton in 2000 .
A lot of patient negotiating will be required to get back to 1995 , but is n't it time to stop shouting past each other and start talking more constructively ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 Einstein was right .
There did NOT go the neighborhood .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I would not take Omar Baker 's word for it , if he claimed to be " representative of Palestinian Arab opinion " ( which I do n't think he has ever been so vain as to do . )
Still less would I accept ethnic - cleansing - rationalizer Benny Morris " wonderings " about what Arafat might have thought before he died two years ago as representing Palestinian views .
Less yet can I accept your bald assertions based on extrapolating Morris 's speculations , Mr. Friedman .
Nothing I 've ever seen in any of your many long - winded regurgitations on HNN would alter the basic perception from the last election where Hamas and Fatah basically tied .
Fatah accepts Israel in its 1948 - 67 borders ( but may hope for a rollback some day ) .
Hamas does not accept Israel at all ( but might well do so if there were a face - saving quid pro quo ) .
Some Hamas supporters probably are willing to accept Israel ( Hamas 's unexpectedly strong showing was clearly in part a protest vote not related to Israel ) .
On the other hand , there are probably also some Fatah supporters who would renege on accepting Israel , depending on future cirumstances .
Then is the minority who is neither pro-Hamas nor pro-Fatah , and that group undoubtedly contains both accepters and non-accepters of Israel 's existence .
The reality is that we will probably never know the true composite " representative " opinion of the Palestinians , concerning willingness or non-willingness to truly accept Israel as a permanent neighbor , UNTIL the Palestinians are finally granted a viable functioning sovereign state as the Jews were in the 1940s .
Palestinian and Arab devotion to violence and terror has been a prime obstacle to statehood over those intervening six decades .
But , since 2000 , no objective observer could fail to assign at least equal blame to the senselessly brutal occupation policies of the Israeli authorities , their continued kowtowing to the lunatic fringe West Bank " settlers , " and the treasonous rubber - stamping of almost every detail of these recklessly inhumane policies by a brain - dead U.S. administration and a spineless U .
S. Congress .
The time has come for Israelis to find the courage to try to get back to mode , as in the early 1990s when both sides were able to curb their fanatical extremes and actually negotiate .
A policy of endless disproportionate reprisal and revenge is failing utterly , as Rabin realized back then that it would .
The Palestinians have never yet failed to blow an opportunity to join the civilized world , but that is not a good reason for apriori deciding to never give them another chance .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
These are good points .
Underlying them is the indisputable truth that while Israel is , in some ways , " falling apart " so is most of the rest of the world .
The spate of exposed corruption in Israel should not be taken as an occasion for gloating by holier - than - thou parties outside Israel .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Good proposal , Mr. Baker .
Just make sure you have the history right .
The core of the European Alps was split between the Austrian monarchy and the Swiss confederation .
The " low countries " were divided between Belgium and the Netherlands .
In each case , two effectively independent entities mutually accepting each other 's permanent existence were recognized and made viable within established territorial divisions .
This approach also is at the core of the two - state " road map , " Arab League , UN " Quartet , " Mitchell Plan , Oslo Accords , Geneva Plan , " land - for - peace " and Camp David solution for Israel and Palestine .
It is time for Israel to dump its religious loony - bin settler - fanatics and get with it .
And time for Hamas to shed its own - foot - shooting martyr complex and accept the existence of Israel within negotiated borders approximating the pre 1967 line , so that they can become part of the solution too , instead just part of the problem .
These transitions will take some time , which is needed anyway , because there will not be viable American leadership available until the current blockhead clown of a Likud - rubber - stap president retires in disgrace in January , 2009 .
The blunder of the Arabs in rejecting the 1948 UN partition proposal cannot be undone - Jews are not going to be forcibly removed from internationally - recognized Israeli pre-'67 territory en masse - and Palestinians will have to learn to live with them on their doorstep , but it will be an improvement over endless oppression and terrorist reprisal .
Try stepping on board , Mr. Baker .
Stop arguing with the " herd " .
You will never convince them that Zionism is the root of all evil , which I think , anyway , even you realize it is not .
Try to find a middle way with sensible and far - sighted Israelis , into which grouping it is hoped that Mr. Reisman falls .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Yes and no , Mr. B .
YES on the idiotic settlements which Likudni propaganda and US dupes thereof would pretend do not exist .
NO on the Wall ( " security fence " ) .
The Wall is , of course , BOTH a security measure AND a land grab ( the latter aspect being a disgraceful sop to the lunatic settlers ) BUT , it certainly does NOT represent a " whetting of the appetite " for more and more .
IF the wall is in fact ever completed , it will represent - at least symbolically - a RELINQUISHING of territory .
I am not aware of anyone - not even the settler - fanatics towards whom Mr. F's childish calls for " evidence " ( of obvious facts , like Arafat recognizing Israel and receiving the Nobel Peace prize as a result ) never apply - saying that the wall should be built so as to enclose land BEYOND that seized forty years ago , e.g during the LAST land seizure in Israel 's sixty year history .
I can understand , though I disagree with , your steadfast views on matters such as the " right of return , " Mr. B. , but is hard to understand stubborn and incessant repetition of obvious factual errors .
They only make you look foolish .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
This attempt to rationalize the fanatical Israeli settler movement will not hold water .
They are the Israeli equivalent of Arab suicide bombers .
They are rife with religious lunatics and killers as it is now .
I have little doubt that they would be just about as ruthless and bloodthirsty as any band of Palestinian terrorists were the tables reversed , and a Palestinian state occupying , oppressing , and brutalizing Israelis over many decades .
Even Sharon ( for decades a chief egger - on of those settler crazies ) saw the necessity of reining them in in Gaza .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
And I am " waiting but not holding my breath " for people to devote .0001 % of the discussion of Israeli - Palestinian history on HNN to the Jews who could not " live in peace " with the Jew Ytzhak Rabin and foully murdered him instead .
I have said many times before and will say it again as directly as possible so there is no mistake .
Being Jewish , Buddhist or Zoroastrian or being a partisan for Israel , Upper Volta or an outer moon of Jupiter does not excuse hypocrisy .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Friedman , you are flailing , and it 's time to call it a day .
1 . I made some comments opening this thread .
I made a short observation about the irrelevance of most of this page to the article , acknowledged that I that had been an active contributor to that prior irrelevance , and then made a few relevant - to - the - article remarks about Israel 's scandals in international perspective .
2 . Nowhere in this thread did I " trash " anybody .
I invite you to retract that erroneous statement .
3 . You have made no arguments in this thread " against my positions " regarding Israel 's scandals vs other countries .
So how could I possibly " change the subject " away from somewhere it had never been ?
4 . I am not " required " to adhere to you or anybody else 's ideas of what constitutes " proof " or does not .
You certainly make many remarks based on belief or logic rather than pure facts .
So do I .
It is part of having a normal conversation .
It is a matter of empirical fact over many months of prior comment threads , that when I do provide proof or citations , you almost always deny them - no matter what - unless they adhere to your preconceived conclusions .
This sort of behavior ( there are scores of examples over past years on HNN ) does not encourage me to leap to attention each time you scream like a spoiled child for " evidence , " e.g. 20 + times or so , as on this page .
5 . You have made three comments already in this thread .
None of them are relevant either to the article or to my thread - opening remarks , except insofar as a parrot might be relevant to " wanna cracker " .
It is extremely probable that you will make a fourth comment in this thread because you are too immature to ever let anyone else have the last word .
Look at all the threads and subthreads across this page above if you want " proof " of this .
Find me one here , or on any other HNN page ever , where you made a comment , someone else answered , and then you shut up .
It will be a needle in the haystack hunt .
It might have happened one time in a hundred .
6 . I am tired of these childish games .
Goodbye .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
This proves nothing beyond your ability to cut and paste .
What politican anywhere does NOT talk out of several sides of his mouth depending on the audience ?
Deeds , not words , are what counts .
Until Sharon went to the Temple in 2000 , Arafat kept his terror squads on a rather tight leash despite the resumption of settlements after Rabin 's assassination .
There was a period in the early 1990s when a lasting peace deal was a real possibility , regardless of reservations , trickery , and inconsistent suppport from both sides .
The trajectory of every leader opposing Jews is not involve a repeat of the " the Holocaust was predicable because of Hitler 's virulent anti-Semitism in ' Mein Kampf ' " ) .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
We discussed the Rabin history back on the long - winded session where the German guy thought Ahmindejad was Hitler II .
As for " the topic at hand " what does Arabs living in peace or not peace witheach have to do with scandals in Israel ?
Why does Mr. Green 's one - sided irrelevancy get a free pass while I , who merely point that blatant one - sidedness , get taken to task ?

Israeli Troops Forcibly Remove Gaza Settlers
Wednesday , August 17 , 2005
MORAG , Gaza Strip —
Violence marred the first full day of the forced evacuation of Israeli settlers from their homes in the Gaza Strip ( search ) on Wednesday .
An Israeli grabbed a gun from a security guard and sprayed a group of Palestinian laborers with gunfire in the West Bank settlement of Shilo , killing three and wounding two , one of whom died later .
The shooter was quickly arrested .
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ( search ) denounced the attack as an act of " Jewish terror ... aimed against innocent Palestinians , out of twisted thinking , aimed at stopping the disengagement . "
The gunman , identified as Asher Weisgan , 40 , from the West Bank settlement of Shvut Rahel , was a driver who transported Palestinian laborers to the industrial zone of the nearby settlement of Shilo every day .
At the end of the work day , he picked up the workers and briefly stopped at a security post .
He got out of his car , seized the weapon from the guard at knifepoint and fired from close range on two workers in his vehicle .
He kept shooting , killing a third worker and wounding two others outside the car .
One of them died later .
In Kfar Darom , several hundred settlers went on a rampage , pushing large cinderblocks off a bridge and trying to torch a nearby Arab house , witnesses said .
Israel troops brought the fire under control and tried to push the settlers back into Kfar Darom as Palestinians threw stones .
A West Bank settler in southern Israel set herself on fire and suffered life - threatening burns on 70 percent of her body , police and hospital officials said .
The 54 - year - old woman was taken to a hospital in serious condition .
Police spokeswoman Liat Nidam said the woman who burned herself carried a sign reading , " Impose a closure on the media , destroy the disengagement , put Sharon before a military court … . "
Sharon proposed his " disengagement plan " two years ago to ease Israel 's security burden and help preserve the country 's Jewish character by placing Gaza 's 1.3 million Palestinians outside Israeli boundaries ….
Israelis and Palestinians have been cooperating to prevent militant violence during the pullout , though lately Jewish extremists have caused the most concern .
Wednesday 's attack was the second on Palestinians by Israelis in two weeks .
On Aug. 4 , a 19 - year - old Israeli soldier opened fire on a bus , killing four Israeli Arabs .
Hours after a midnight deadline to evacuate willingly , Israeli soldiers were still forcibly removing defiant settlers from homes and houses of worship throughout communities in the Gaza Strip …
The army said it arrested 52 Israelis headed Wednesday to Homesh , one of the settlements slated for evacuation ...
There were few reports of settler violence against Israeli troops , though a brigade commander told FOX News that a female settler had stabbed one of his soldiers with a needle .
Overall , he said the operation was a success …
In the settlement of Morag , troops smashed through a cinderblock barricade , forming a human chain to push back a line of settlers .
Young protesters set two garbage containers on fire as security forces dragged settlers who had holed up in the settlement 's main synagogue to police buses to be driven out of Gaza .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Do you think that when Jews in Palestine were living under dangerous and oppressive foreign rule , without a state of their own , that the Stern Gang and Irgun were only " building homes " and acting in a way " very , very far removed from people who blow other people up " ?
Perhaps the problem here is that you
" merely think you know but you have not done the applicable research " ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Here is a touch of the Israeli public you , Mr. Eckstein , Daniel Pipes , etc. never want to talk about , and that is only heard from once in a blue moon on HNN :
Good riddance to Gaza , many Israelis say
By Matt Spetalnick Sept 9 , 2005
TEL AVIV ( Reuters ) - One Israeli prime minister called Gaza " a bone stuck in our throats . "
Another wished it would just sink into the sea .
In Hebrew , " Go to hell " sounds almost like " Go to Gaza , " an irony some Israelis savour .
With settlers already gone and the army following on their heels early next week , many Israelis are as glad to say good riddance to the tiny coastal territory as the Palestinians are to see them leave after 38 years of occupation .
It 's a sentiment that resonates especially among Israeli army veterans with bitter memories of dangerous duty in the Gaza Strip guarding a few thousand Jews isolated from a hostile population of 1.4 million Palestinians .
" Thank God another generation of soldiers wo n't have to risk their lives for so little reason , " said Avi , 46 , a former army reservist who served in Gaza in the late 1980s when it was a hotbed of the first Palestinian intifada , or uprising .
He recalls long stints when his unit , sweating in heavy flak jackets , patrolled crowded refugee camps or chased stone throwing youths through rutted streets flowing with sewage .
Israel 's presence in Gaza is now ending only after a second , bloodier cycle of violence , this one erupting in 2000 .
Palestinian fighters traded their rocks for bombs and bullets and the army responded with tanks and helicopter - fired missiles .
To many Israelis , Gaza -- one of the most densely populated places on earth -- had long been a costly liability , with polls consistently showing a majority willing to part with it despite religious Jews ' claims of a biblical birthright .
As military casualties mounted , public pressure grew , helping to give Prime Minister Ariel Sharon momentum to uproot Gaza 's 21 settlements in a plan he billed as a disengagement from conflict with the Palestinians .
... Some historians say Prime Minister Menachem Begin tried in vain to get Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat to take Gaza back in peace talks that led to Israel 's return of Sinai in 1982 .
" I would like Gaza to sink into the sea , but that wo n't happen , and a solution must be found , " Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in 1992 .
The next year he signed the Oslo accords with Yasser Arafat , turning over much of Gaza to Palestinian rule but keeping control of settlements covering up to one - fifth of the strip ...
Commentators said Israel 's silent majority had finally spoken , saying it wanted to give Sharon 's plan a chance .
Just to be sure , though , Israel is building a high - tech barrier on its border with the strip , expanding a single fence line to three .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I did not mean to suggest that only religious extremists populate the Israeli West Bank settlements .
But since Jordan signed a peace deal back in the early '90s and abandoned its claims to the West Bank peace deal , there is no other viable reason for the settlements , except as bargaining chips .
When Jews were not able to very effectively use settlements as leverage , in 1946 - 46 ( as Palestinians have not been able to ) their extremists resorted to terrorism ( as Palestinians often have ) .
As a decades - long practice , however , clinging tooth and nail to such " bargaining chips " effectively become a means of repeatedly and deliberately torpedoing peace negotiations , which is what I believe settlements and terrorism in fact have been used for .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
These SEVERAL incidents were isolated , I agree , but they prove the sloppy kneejerk one - sideness of your statement about " nothing other than legal , " and - more importantly - reveal the ugly face of Jewish fanaticism ( erupting not due to 40 years of occupation , but by having to move from one heavily subsidized housing arrangement in Gaza to another in the West Bank ) which you ( plural ) are so deeply and repeatedly committed to denying .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
By your latest " logic , " the Holocaust was okay because it happened 60 and 70 years ago .
The issue is whether the Israeli West Bank settlers ( or more properly put , the religious extremists on whose behalf they have been settled ) have similarities to Palestinian terrorists .
To make the comparison a more complete one , one needs to include an apples to apples measure .
Since the Palestinians have never had their own state , the proper parallel is when the Israelis did not have a state either .
That happens to have been 60 years ago .
The Jewish terrorists were much more effective at getting quick positive results .
Their state came after only a couple of years .
Time for Palestinians to try another tack , I hope you would agree .
Or do you prefer another 60 years of periodic war and terrorism ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I did not say that the story about Israelis damning Gaza and calling evacuating it " good riddance " " UNDERMINED " anything you or Eckstein or anybody else said .
I said that you folks had avoided the subject of Israeli mainstream public opinion going against Israeli lunatic fringe opinion .
This is called misattribution .
I have noticed , to your credit , that - unlike some other posters - you resort to this only rarely , generally when you are desperate .
Better to just give up , I would suggest .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
The fact is that Arafat got the Nobel and the Norwegians knew more about what was going on then , during the " Oslo process " than you do now .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
You can repeatedly selectively misapply any Latin phrase you want , but if a poster makes a set of one - sided slams against another poster , in a post which does not address the topic of the page , it is not " invalid " to expose such transparent hypocrisy .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Maybe
I missed a needle or two in the haystack here , but , in the seventy five posts above by Mssrs Friedman , Eckstein , and Simon above ( constituting nearly half of all those made thus far on the page ) I do n’t recall a single one discussing the topic of the page ( “ Is Israel Falling Apart ? ” ) .
This is not the first time such a mass neglect has manifested itself here on this website ’s comment pages .
This strange reluctance to post remarks that are relevant is part of a long term consistent pattern of steadfast devotion to three cardinal principles ( regardless of relevance or non-relevance to the topic of the article ) :
1. Every significant problem faced by the country of Israel is wholly the fault of its Palestinian and Arab neighbors or those who in any way support or are sympathetic to those neighbors .
2 . Anyone who , in any way , or for any reason , suggests otherwise must be evil , crazy , or a fool .
3 . The only way to persuade skeptics of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is by an unrelenting outpouring of challenges and rebuttals to any deviation or perceived deviation from these two principles .
This end , moreover , justifies a grab bag of dubious means .
Certainly , this sort of rigidly uncompromising approach to expounding a point of view can be effective in certain circumstances , for instance , on an IDF raid in the West Bank following targeted “ assassinations ” by missile or bulldozing of houses and olive groves .
It has not been effective on comment pages here .
It is more often , in fact , a dialogue - killer .
Against this , it should also be acknowledged , we also have a kind of one man opposition which is at least as steadfast in believing and proclaiming nearly the precise opposite of ( 1 ) above .
But this opposition is otherwise not symmetrical .
Its exponent is somewhat less prone to quickly assume the worst about anyone who disagrees with him , is rather less disdainful of staying on topic , and does not routinely employ a deluge of misattributions , repetitions , obfuscation and trickery as a technique of argument .
Like his opponents , he persistently argues , consciously or unconsciously , on behalf of a particular political point of view , as a matter of unalterable conviction and with small regard for effectiveness .
Unlike them , his single - minded energies are intended for the ultimate benefit of political entities in his own native land .
Adios ,

" Thank God another generation of soldiers wo n't have to risk their lives for so little reason " is the most apt quote from the article I posted .
This in NO WAY proves that most Israelis " want peace . "
I personally think most Israelis AND most Palestinians DO want peace , but not on the same terms .
I also suppose it quite likely that that gap in terms went a quite different way in 1947 .
But I cannot " prove " this , and neither can a bunch of dubious and uncited " polls . "
Even if they are unbiased and scientifically representative the ability to get unfiltered views is highly suspect .
You might as well try to find out going door to door whether South Central LA thinks justice was done in the OJ case .
What the people " want " is anyway only part of the equation .
The real key in Israel - Palestine , at least since the Yom Kippur War , and even more so since the end of the Cold War , has been whether the two sides have compelling leaders willing to face down the fanatics on their respective sides of the line , and whether there is a competent US president to help them do so .
In 2000 the weak link of that trio was quite clearly - in my view at least - Arafat .
Today it has to be - to ANY open mind - Bush .
Sometime a " weak link " can be pulled along by the momentum of circumstances and the power of the other two .
As with Begin in 1979 and Arafat in 1993 .
But all of this is off topic , and almost always is on HNN , and most " panel debates " in mainstream media .
Instead what we are served up , more often than not , is a pro-Israel jerk ( here on HNN , dozens of them ) and a pro-Arab jerk yelling past each other about how it is , always has been , and always will be everlasting 100 % the other side 's fault .
This is predictable , childish , and utterly useless except perhaps as a study in psychological disorders .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
" Now you admit that they are not religious zealots . "
Where did I say that ?
Ca n't you stop making things up ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
There are no " data " to confront anywhere in sight here .
And do n't bother not fetching them , they wo n't prove anything , and were most probably rigged for propaganda purposes in the first place .
Or did Gallup , Harris , and Yankelvitch do the polls you can't cite ?
According to " polls , " 2/3 of Americans thought in 2004 that the 9 - 11 hijackers were working for Saddam or some such idiocy - but that does n't prove they will carry such beliefs unaltered to their graves .
Only if one wants to argue ' til blue in the face that 2/3 of Americans are themselves incurable idiots would one try to make dubious uncited poll data into some kind of tablet from Mt Sinai .
I do n't give a flying leap at the moon about Omar 's Israeli documentary .
I can read the true story in the New York Times unless they screw it up in which case I 'll find it somewhere else if should ever want to .
Does it in fact have anything to do with Wahrman 's thesis ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Let 's see : I think I meant the 20 odd times over the past year or two you have referred to Israel as " expansionist " in the present tense , or some variant of that claim .
As though any new territory had been conquered and held permanently AFTER 1967 .
It is really quite lame , because there are a long list of horrors ACTUALLY perpetrated by Israel over the past 40 years , such that even the most strident of anti-Israeli commentators do not need to , normally and do not , make up non existent horrors .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I see : you misunderstood what I said .
Quelle surprise .
I said : " Jewish fanaticism ( erupting not due to 40 years of occupation , but by having to move from one heavily subsidized housing arrangement in Gaza to another in the West Bank ) "
I meant : Jewish fanaticism about the Biblical Right to land outside 1966 Israel , erupting ON THE OCCASION of the forced move
You thought I meant : Jews who were fanatically against ever having to move from one settlement to another .
You are dodging to avoid admitting a mistake as you so often do .
If you would n't exaggerate so often ( e.g. " NOTHING other than legal protest " ) and always - when discussing Israel - in a pro-Likud way ( surprise # 2 ) you could dodge less , and these pages could have a few dozen or hundred fewer silly back and forth posts .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
You reveal your age , Mr. F .
The defensible borders argument as a justification for holding the whole West Bank , dates from the 1960s when Israel was bordering Jordan on the Western end of Samaria and could hit the Israeli coast with long - range artillery .
Jordan withdrew its claim eastward to the River of its name in 1994 .
End of justification .
Long past time to order a new propaganda handbook for rationalizing endless Bantulandization of West Bank .
How about terrorism ?
Remember it ?
Or else explain please how the New York Times has never reported the long range howitzers and F - xteen fighter bombers of the Palestinian Army and Air Force .
We are also drifting back to Likud - propaganda versus - the - Atlas - makers - of - the - civilized world issue of two weeks ago .
Did you really want to go there again ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
What about Sinai ?
Needed in order to secure a " defensible border " in the 1960 - 70s ?
NOT needed to secure a " defensible border " AFTER that ?
What changed ?
The " lay of the land " ?
Moses unparting the waters and re-releasing Noah 's flood ?
Could it a be ... that awful thing , a " treaty " ?
Much more pernicious treaties are , than UN resolutions .
Those latter devils are always anti-Semitic if America vetoes them but if they offer a convoluted legal BS argument for why every Atlas Maker has been an idiot for 40 years , then of course , they are wonderfully hieroglyphically cryptic tablets of stone from God .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I did not say you were an adherent to point 1 , Mr. Green .
After you have a few thousand posts on HNN like Mr. F , or a several hundred each like Mssrs E and S , you might qualify for such status .
A few one - sided comments are not enough to qualify one as a full - fledged and incurably biased propagandist .
I stand by my prior remarks , and they are evidenced by masses of prior comments from these folks over many years on HNN , but do not see what Saudi Arabia has to do with them .
It is interesting creative accounting to make foreign tax credits into foreign aid , but why stop there ?
Why not count X % of what you fork over every time you fill up the tank at a gas station ?
Interesting point , but , again , nothing to with Mr. OB who is not Saudi to my knowledge , OR with the issue of people hijacking discussions and policy - making based on the absurd notion that 99 % of the blame in a major decades - long conflict must be assigned to one side of the other with the remaining 1 % danced around on rare occasions like a man who can't find the bathroom door .
OR with the even more absurd , never acknowledged but worshippingly - adhered to myth that the rightwing Likud - like hardline persuasion in Israel is the only tenable political position for an AMERICAN to take .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I take the liberty of assuming , from your very understandable but sometimes grammatically and semantically interesting English that you are an Israeli , Mr. Matik
Apparently , you think Americans have no business lecturing to Israelis .
Fair point , in isolation .
But , what about most of the U.S. Congress grovelling for decades in front of AIPAC or its politically functional equivalents ?
How about this deal :
We will try to curb our lecturing to you ( e.g. the 5 % of HNN articles on Israel that fall into that category ) , and you try to get your Likud 's ( or whatever it calls itself now ) dupes and lackeys over here to release their chokehold on our legislators .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Make that Mutik , not " Matik . "
Sorry , my language skills also have room for improvement .
Hope I did n't utter some kind of " four letter " word by mistake .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I said nothing about there being any conspiracies by " lobbys " on Congress .
I do n't there any of any significance .
There is a lot of pressure and a skyrocketing need to raise money .
The shameful kowtowing of Congress on many issues , to many nefarious interest groups , does not mean that the grovelling before the Likudnik interests ( certainly NOT representing Jews in general , or even anything anywhere close to most Jews ) is not among them .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Barak was willing to retreat to almost that pre-June ' 67 line .
And Barak was elected by a sizable margin .
You HAVE BEEN fooled , for life it seems , into thinking that rightwing Israeli views - such as land for peace can never work - are the ONLY Israeli views .
For you , such ultra - fear - based dogma is such a gospel truth that you will argue endlessly that Atlas makers across Western civilization for forty years are raving morons for showing the West Bank as occupied territory and not part of Israel .
No doubt if Benny Morris or Bernard Lewis were to say so , you would claim they do n't know what they 're talking about .
Or that I am arguing ad - hominen .
Or that I can't read .
Or that what is plainly on the atlas pages is only in my head .
You are absolutely as impervious to reality as Omar Baker .
You guys deserve each other .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 Well , Mr. E. since you HAVE now bothered , with a lot of cutting and pasting , how about defining the series of three one decimal point numbers for " people " who might not want to try to decipher ?
Were there three periods of polling , three regions surveyed or what ?
Data presentation 101 says that if the detail has meaning then it should be defined .
I stand , in any case , by my views about the basic unreliability of this method of peering to the collective soul of millions of people .
For instance , how do we know the collection was done and PERCEIVED to have been done anonymously ?
( It is otherwise fundamentally suspect ) .
For another instance , the types of questions asked are very prone to all sorts of misinterpretations .
This is NOTHING like asking , " if the election were held today would you voter for Mr. X or Mr. Y. ? "
If I really thought it mattered decisively , I would look at a dozen other factors before trying to read the tea leaves on these polls .
People who wish for or expect permanent war and violence make traceably different daily and long term decisions , for example , than those preferring or expecting reconcilation or benign neglect .
I would track choices on education , jobs , membership in organizations , emigration etc. , over time .
Your silly ad - hominens about my " beliefs " are a waste of type characters .
I stand by my claim that the election results of last year ( which came out rather differently than these poll numbers might indicate ) suggest a more valid guesstimate of public opinion on peace vs non-peace - and it is lame to pretend than anybody can make more than an informed guess or " belief . "
But , DOES this all really matter anyway ?
Suppose , for sake of temporary final discussion only , it IS true , as you ASSUME , that most Palestinians really want to continue living in misery in order to be macho against Israel .
What then ?
Is the best approach to
1. support policies to confirm those desires by confining them to South Africa Apartheid Era style " homelands " for eternity ?
2. put the US ambassador to the UN on autopilot , ready to veto any resolution whenever the Israeli government issues the order ?
3. have the US Congress ritually regurgitate whatever AIPAC tells it to ?
Or , if you do not endorse these actual practices of the past 6 years in America , what then ?
Suppose the numbers in these polls were to invert - flip to two thirds FOR peace instead of 2/3 / against - would you then favor flipping polices 1 - 3 above so as to effectively provide a rubberstamp for whatever shifting practices the Palestinian authorities are following ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
You talk quite prolificly about " evidence " which you " love " to see , Mr. F .
Is there any evidence for the following " presumptions " of yours about the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre ( JMCC ) ?
" .. Palestinian sources who , presumably , intended to show something accurate but which would give the best face to Palestinian Arab thinking "
If the overwhelmingly majority of Palestinians DON'T want to " end the dispute " until Israel magically vanishes , then would n't the " best face " show a maximum possible degree of unanimity ?
On the other hand , if the polling is slanted in that way , how firm can any conclusions based on it be ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 also describes your use of Latin here
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Not okay .
" Best face " for a presumed majoritarian Peace - Hating Palestinian would have to be as anti-Peace , anti -" Zionist " and pro-" resistance " as possible .
You goofed .
Ask Omar for details .
The polls are a croc anyway .
Even if the results are valie , it is not an argument for war forever .
When a criminal has done his time he gets out .
Even if " the polls " say he is likely to strike again .
You alert neighberhood watch , and you look both ways before crossing a dark alley .
Life in the real world , Mr. F .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 Maybe John knows the Latin phrase but
" acceptance of living with Israel by the Arab side " or its reverse
which N. Friedman has just called a
" factual assertion " is no such thing .
Maybe " tuesestupido " ?
The annual number of Israeli civilians killed by Palestinian terror bombers went up or down by X % versus the prior year would be a factual claim ( true or false ) .
By the way , I am not a supporter of David Irving ( who has even less to do with the topic of this page than Benny Morris ) .
There are many past posts of mine on HNN which show the contrary .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
You do n't see , but I give up .
It was a minor detail having nothing to do with my position or yours .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 Fact # 1 : Irving is a historian
Fact # 2 : Yeor is not a historian
Fact # 3 : You will never convince me that either of these is relevant to " Is Israel falling apart ? "
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
According to the ever damned but still used Wikipedia , Yeor has written some books ABOUT history .
So this makes her about as much of a historian as Irving , although I guess he has a doctorate in the field and she does not .
So revise Fact # 2 above to Yeor IS a historian .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Thanks for this link , Mr. Mutik .
My " patriot " in me , as you put , is on alert at this disgusting list .
Not sure how AIPAC ducked it , but I never said the Israel - rightwing chokehold was based on money .
Money , for example , did not heap slander and insult upon Howard Dean for advocating fairness and common sense .
Nor did I ever say you were a Likudnik .
My first comment to you assumed the opposite .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
I do n't what what the hell you are talking about , Mr. M. Do you ?
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
John , I think your points are valid and well taken .
You are arguing here against a brick wall , but the brick wall probably correctly leads to a conclusion that Israelis are , and for many years have been , more willing move from violence to negotiations and more willing to compromise than Palestinians have been .
Not uniformly so year to year , but as a long term average pattern .
But , if one wants to obssess on the shifting sands of popular moods ( e.g. and ignore larger and more vital geopolitical forces ) then the valid historial counter - factual question would be :
How would the Israeli vs Palestinian popular opinion comparison look if Arabs been ruling over and oppressing Jews in Palestine for 40 years ( e.g. the reverse of the recent actual history ) ?
I think the days of the Irgun and Stern gang suggest that the Israeli - Palestinian % - for - peace comparison would then look quite different .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Just thought I 'd point that out for the record .
I am included in that neglect except here :
Re : Global War on Law ? ( # 106535 )
by Peter K. Clarke on March 6 , 2007
Expanding on my remarks there , I think it may be true that Israel is somewhat more prone to both
( 1 ) corruption
and
( 2 ) exposing and correcting for it
than other places , but not drastically so .
It is the global trend over time , not place - to - place comparisons at contemporary points in time , which deserves the greater attention and concern .
Israel needs to be seen , I believe , as a leading indicator , not an exception .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Right , I have taken a position on the topic of the page .
You , in sharp contrast , have done no such thing and are wasting type characters ignoring the topic of the page .
Note : the topic of the page is NOT " How many times can Friedman ask for evidence like a broken record ? "
The evidence of " culturally sanctioned encouragement " of rule - breaking in Israel is in the article .
I suggest you read it for a change and try to rein in your ingrained habit of marking your territory on threads where you have nothing to say .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
The subject line had to change .
It was too close to : please live forever in Hell , snowball .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Anything to avoid the topic .
Elliott Aron Green - 3/18/2007 NF and John ,
the massacres in Sudan of the southern tribal Africans , non-Muslims , started in 1956 , the first year of independence .
These massacres continued sporadically but often until a truce in 1972 , after which fighting continued at lower intensity , since the truce was only partly honored by the Govt side .
This truce lasted until 1983 , as NF points out .
NF is making a very important point .
Real genocide was going on in the Sudan , yet the " international community , " so quick to condemn Israel , had little or nothing to say about it .
N. Friedman - 3/17/2007 John ,
My position is that the EU states have a vested interest in retarding efforts to resolve the dispute between Israel and the various Arabs .
I think that is clearly the case .
Europeans see such as a means to secure oil and valuable construction and technology contracts , as a means to keep terrorism out of Europe ( e.g. the decision to let go those involved in the Munich massacre in which Germany staged a highjacking ) and as the means to a potential political counterweight to American power .
The evidence for all of this can be found in the documentation related to the Euro - Arab Dialogue and the more recent Mediterranean Partnership .
Clearly , European nations are not supporting Palestinian Arabs out of kindness as there are numerous examples where people are oppressed for real , not as a result of a decision to make war , as is the case with Palestinian Arabs .
Think about the lack of support that existed from 1983 to 2000 for Sudanese Christians and animists while 1 to 2 million of them were killed or intentionally starved , when slavery was re-instituted as official government policy - asserted to be a requirement of Islam , no less , by the president of the country , if I recall correctly - , when Christian and animist children were forcibly taken from their parents and forcibly converted to Islam and when food was used as a war weapon in order to force Christians and animists to convert to Islam .
Frankly , Sudanese genocide - the real thing , not Israel 's response to Palestinian Arab kamikazi attacks and the suppression of Palestinian Arab society in order to prevent such attacks , would be what a moral foreign policy would have addressed .
The reason , in a word , why the Palestinian Arab cause is front and center is oil , a force which has corrupted politics and has corrupted liberal and conservative parties and has corrupted the university - and , in the case of universities , quite literally , with 90 + % of funding for Middle East studies coming from Saudi Arabia .
People do not bad mouth the source of their funding .
In the case of European countries , a decision was clearly made to support ongoing dispute between Israel and Palestinian Arabs .
That is clearly in Europe 's perceived self - interest .
And , again , the issue derives from Oil and flows into all the other issues I mentioned above with reference to Europe .
Elliott Aron Green - 3/17/2007 John , just by the way , Javier Solana , the EU 's answer to Pierre Laval , stopped by in Syria the other day .
He promised EU help for Syria recovering the Golan Heights , lost in Israel 's just war of defense in 1967 .
Carolyn Glick in the Jerusalem Post , and I agree , sees Solana 's demarche as encouraging Syria to make war on Israel for that purpose , believing that he has EU support .
Solana said what he did despite the recent installation by Syria of an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 missiles on their sector of the Golan aimed at Israel .
Further , the EU disregards the Syrian murder of leading Lebanese politicians and journalists in order to keep Lebanon in Syrian hands and , recently , in order to prevent an international investigation of Rafiq Hariri 's murder by Syrian agents .
In short , Solana is encouraging Syrian war on Israel .
This should answer your question above .
E. Simon - 3/15/2007
That is only because correcting your misunderstanding of history only does not count in your book .
John Charles Crocker - 3/15/2007
You said or at least strongly implied that it was a Western plot to prevent peace with Israel .
Most of what followed was talk of how you and Mr Friedman think that EU countries are working to prevent peace for Israel .
My question remains .
Do you think it is the policy of the EU and the US to harm Israel and prevent Israel from negotiating peace ?
Do you have any real evidence for your conspiracy theory re the Jordanian succession or will it remain entirely unfounded ?
Elliott Aron Green - 3/15/2007
John , I looked at the page that you linked to on opensecrets.org .
It overlooks other channels of Arab and pro-Arab influence .
It does not mention the contributions of pro-Arab oil interests , nor the big money paid to American politicians such as Jimmy carter , Jim Baker , perhaps to Ramsey Clark , and many others .
Consider the speaking engagements of such as Bill Clinton in Persian Gulf emirates [ the UAE ] , etc .
Baker 's law firm , Baker Botts , gets magnanimous fees from Saudi Arabia which it serves as an official representative in the USA .
As it stands , the opensecret page is rather naive .
Elliott Aron Green - 3/15/2007
John , please read carefully what I said when I first brought the issue of the Jordanian succession .
I never said it was a European conspiracy .
Perhaps you inferred that , but I did not say it .
John Charles Crocker - 3/15/2007
First you assert , " John , Hussein had several sons .
Abdullah was not the oldest . "
Now you admit , " I have not checked back on the Hashemite family tree , so you may be right as to the eldest son of Hussein . "
I did check the family tree .
It is not so difficult to do .
You should check your facts before making assertions .
You should also have better evidence before you forward conspiracy theories .
Your initial position was that the change in succession was a European conspiracy to harm Israel , now you imply that it is more likely a US conspiracy .
If it is a US conspiracy , is it still for the purpose of preventing peace and harming Israel ?
Elliott Aron Green - 3/15/2007
I have not checked back on the Hashemite family tree , so you may be right as to the eldest son of Hussein .
However , it is very peculiar that a situation that had stood for decades [ that Hassan was crown prince ] was changed .
Further , Abdullah 's mother was British , which might give him less legitimacy in traditional Arab society which is much concerned with ancestry and blood - lines , etc .
Abdullah was American educated .
If any outside power or powers influenced the change in heir to the throne , then it was either the USA or UK or both .
As you know , Jordan was created by the British empire and was long subsidized by the UK until the USA took over that role , after the 1958 coup in Iraq , I believe .
Shortly before Hussein changed his successor , he had been in one of the famous , prestigious American medical clinics for treatment for cancer .
John Charles Crocker - 3/15/2007 http://www.opensecrets.org/news/pro-israel.pro-arab/index.asp
John Charles Crocker - 3/15/2007
Some of the polling data can be used to support multiple arguments as to underlying opinions as is true in most large and complex polls .
The education system is a problem , but it is a second tier problem and not all problems can be addressed simultaneously if progress is to be made .
I note that even with the continuation of that same education system the approval for suicide bombing of civilians has dropped and the opposition for that policy has steadily increased .

Why is it you give Mr. Green 's speculation and factual errors a pass ?
Mr. Green 's speculation requires a large and still concealed conspiracy involving European powers secretly controlling the succession of Jordan and that the aim of these European powers is the persecution of Israel .
Further in that same post he stated that Abdullah was not Hussein 's eldest son ( factually incorrect ) .
This speculation and false statement you allowed to pass uncommented upon , however as soon as it was challenged you felt the need to respond .
Please explain .

I have n't read Littman 's book , but I have read a summary it and her position .
When I dig myself out from under the reading I have to do for my research I will give it a look , but at first blush it appears to be quite a conspiracy theory and she clearly has an ax to grind .
Her theory sounds quite similar to the " reconquista " theory of Mexico retaking the American SW and then America .

Omar , the Jews made up about 13 - 14 % of the population in 1914 of the areas that the San Remo Conference juridically erected as the Jewish National Home , with the Western geographic name of " palestine . "
I do not think that 13 % or 14 % is " a tiny minority " of the population , although a minority to be sure .
Next , " Palestine " or Filastin was not the name traditionally used by Arab - Muslims for the country made into " Palestine " by the San Remo Conference .
The Arabs - Muslims inhabiting the Land of Israel traditionally saw the country they inhabited as an indistinct part of bilad ash - Sham [ Syria or Greater Syria ] .
Yes , there was a Muslim majority in the country , but they did not see themselves as a separate nationality or people .
Further , the country was very sparsely populated for centuries until the late 19th century when the population increased rapidly , including the Jewish population .
Jews had always lived in the country .
Jews were a substantial part of the population until the Crusades when the Crusaders massacred many or most of the Jews in the country [ Prof Moshe Gil ] .
So the overwhelming Muslim majority [ before 1850 ] was due in part to the Crusader massacres , as well as to Muslim / Arab immigration , to the legal oppression , economic exploitation , humiliation , and persecution of Jews in the country over the centuries by the Muslims / Arabs , etc .

Thank you , Omar , for reminding me of the term OETA - South , which the British used for the Land of Israel before the San Remo Conference [ April 1920 ] set up the Jewish National Home with the territorial name " Palestine . "
As you know , there was no territory or district called palestine or Filastin by the Mamluk or Ottoman empires , which ruled the Land consecutively from the end of the Mongol invasion in 1260 to the British conquest in 1917 .
This shows that the geographic name " Palestine " [ or Filastin ] is not traditional in Arab / Muslim usage , as it is not traditional in Jewish usage .
OETA means Occupied Enemy Territory Administration , which the British divided into three parts , OETA - South covering -- roughly speaking -- the Land of Israel or what was called after 1920 , " Palestine . "
Next , let 's reexamine the figures you represent as compiled by the King - Crane Commission .
There is a big discrepancy between the numbers on the table and your total for the OETA - South .
Your table gives for OETA - South :
Muslims 515,000
Christians 62,500
Druses 60,000
Others [ not counting Jews ]
5,000
I reach a total of 642,500 for those four numbers .
Yet you reach a total of
" 725,000 Arabs both Moslem and Christian , " a difference of 82,500 more than my total for the non-Jewish population .
Could you go back and check your arithmetic ?
I reach a total of 642,500 for all non-Jews in the OETA -S. Now , if there were 65,000 Jews in OETA-S , as you assert according to King - Crane , then the Jews were MORE THAN 10 % of the population of OETA - South according to the figures that you accept .
But let us go further , in 1914 , before WW 1 , the estimated Jewish population of what later became OETA-S and then " Palestine " was about 75,000 .
That is , Jews were about 13 % - 14 % in 1914 .
How and why did the Jewish numbers go down so much during WW One .
The Ottoman state deported about 30,000 Jews from the country .
Most of them were probably Russian subjects and thus enemy aliens , so the deportation from the country was legal under international law , although I do n't think that that was the real reason .
The Young Turks seem to have considered the Jews a political threat , although not as serious a threat as the Armeni
I 've been using ZFS for a backup server via the Nexenta distribution for around 3 months now .
In addition , I 've been testing the new Nexenta .
While ZFS is insanely cool , the road has been far from smooth .
Here are some of my impressions .
The concepts behind ZFS are , of course , exceedingly cool .
All data written to disc is checksummed , so the file - system can detect corruption at any stage , including a disc or bus silently corrupting data you write to it .
The transparent compression is also great , it 's saving us around 25 % on storage space .
Nexenta , if you are n't familiar with it , is an OpenSolaris distribution with many parts of the OpenSolaris codebase ( kernel , SMF , etc ) combined with apt - get and GNU tools from Ubuntu Dapper .
It 's currently in it 's 5th Alpha release , with the first version I tested being the second alpha .
The cool thing about Nexenta is that it includes apt - get to easily install packages .
One of the guys at the NCLUG meeting last week is a Solaris guy , and he was griping about not being able to just install packages for Postfix and Mailman .
This should help that .
Except that with Alpha 5 I have n't been able to get a single package to successfully install via “ apt - get ” .
It always errors out .
Luckily , the install CD includes many packages , and others I can download the Debian package directly from the Nexenta web site .
I 'm installing pretty minimal sets of packages on these boxes , so that 's not a big problem .
The bigger problem is that the kernel update packages come pretty slowly .
This would n't be as much of a problem except that I 'm having serious problems with ZFS , and would like the ability to try newer kernels .
The OpenSolaris developers seem to be releasing new kernels every 2 weeks like clockwork , but I have yet to see a kernel update package available .
In the early days of Nexenta , kernel updates via packages were n't possible , but as of Alpha 5 they are supposed to be .
“ apt - get dist - upgrade ” does n't show anything to update from what the CD installed though .
Alpha 5 has been out just over a month , so there should be some level of updates .
As I mentioned above , ZFS is having some issues .
The initial install I did was running fairly well , but once the amount of data on the system got to be around 1TB , the “ scrub ” process ( where it goes through and verifies checksums ) will hang the ZFS storage pool after running about 12 hours .
This “ scrub ” process is also how you recover from a disc failure .
I 'm happy to report that my testing of Alpha 5 shows that this is resolved .
I was running some tests with a simple set of 1TB of data and running repeated scrubs .
It would do the scrub in around 3 hours , and I kept running them for 4 days without the pool hanging .
So , my plan was to migrate the data from the existing ZFS to the new one on the new box I 'm setting up .
ZFS includes this nice backup utility that will dump the raw file - system snapshots , so I could preserve all the data and snapshots on the original system , given a bit of scripting to wrap around it .
Sadly , in my testing of copying a file - system with it 's 10 or so snapshots , the initial file - system copied over fine , but the migration of the incremental snapshots caused a kernel panic and the system to reboot .
I guess I need to set up a test system with Alpha 2 on it , create a ZFS , and then try doing an upgrade to Alpha 5 and see if that will not freak out .
In general , I have found the Nexenta user - space to be pretty solid .
The only real problems I 've had have been related to ZFS .
It still seems that ZFS is not ready for prime time .
Interestingly enough , it looks like ZFS is being used in Solaris 10 now , because Sun announced this new server that has 24 discs in a 4U chassis , and it 's using ZFS for the file - system .
I imagine that the attention that gets will translate pretty quickly to more stability in OpenSolaris .
Finally , there is a google summer of code project to port ZFS to Linux .
I imagined that would be a pretty tough port , because of the way ZFS unifies RAID , LVM , and the file - system .
However , at BLUG , Kevin looked up the project and found that it 's being ported as a user - space file - system .
Not really usable for many things , but I could definitely make use of that for some archive storage needs .
The checksummed data would be really nice to have on Linux .

The photos of this painting technically are terrible , but happen to work .
Nearly all of the bright sheen is actually glare , not the color of the paint .
Most of those areas are a filthy black color in reality , though with shiny additive mixed in the paint .
Firsthand it seems mostly black with a bit of brightness , luckily , the overall sheen works just as well .
By next month memories may be all she has .
After a 12 - year court battle with residents of a nearby apartment block , which owns the land on which Glorinha 's father built his wooden shack nearly 100 years ago , Vila Alice 's residents are preparing for eviction .
" I wo n't leave here without being given compensation , " she says .
Glorinha , whose full name is Gloria Roque Adriano , slumped into a battered classroom chair outside her home .
" What will I do ?
Sleep in the road ? "
Across Rio , hundreds of impoverished Brazilian families , like Glorinha's , are now facing the threat of eviction , as the idea of favela remoção ( removal ) gains increasing currency among better - off sections of Brazilian society .
Fourteen shantytowns , the majority in upper - class boroughs such as Gávea and Jardim Botânico , were recently earmarked for removal by Rio's public prosecutor , while there has been a recent jump in the number of legal battles , like the one over Vila Alice .
José Nerson de Oliveira , vice - president of the Federation of Favelas in Rio de Janeiro , believes as many as 70 communities could be at risk .
" We wo n't let them come into the favelas that we have built with our blood and sweat and destroy everything we have managed to achieve , " he told the Guardian .
The official reasons for the evictions vary from ownership disputes to attempts to protect the environment and concerns over the safety of those living in the hilltop favelas .
But for those fighting removal , the motivation is simple .
" It is n't about land or trees or anything like that .
They do n't want the poor close to them , " said Sebastião Machado , 47 , a community activist and odd - job man involved in the battle for Vila Alice .
Rio's wealthy benefit from the cheap labour provided by the favela , he says , but at the same they do n't want to live with their poorer neighbours .
" They want two things at the same time .
Is n't it me who fixes things in the bacana 's [ rich kid 's ] house ?
Does n't it look good when I do ? " he jokes .
The idea of remoção is nothing new to Rio de Janeiro , where nearly 20 % of the population , a million people , now live in about 750 slums .
During the 19th century , town planners forced thousands from the slums of central Rio in a bid to turn the city into a " tropical Paris " .
In the 1960s , the politics of removal again came to the fore as favelas were bulldozed in the city 's south zone and their residents sent to the housing projects on its outskirts .
Forgotten by the city 's politicians , many of the projects , like Cidade de Deus or City of God , underwent a process of favelização or " favelisation " , and are now controlled by drug - trafficking gangs .
Now , after a campaign by sections of the Brazilian media , the question of favela removal has been thrust back on to the political agenda .
Those in favour of removal , like the councillor Leila do Flamengo , whose proposals to reintroduce remoção are being considered in Rio's Assembly , see it as a way of preserving Rio 's natural beauty , while creating bairros populares ( popular boroughs ) further away from the city centre that would offer good quality , low - cost housing to the city 's poorest citizens .
" The decadence of public power has allowed Rio de Janeiro to become a city without laws , " she says .
" This is called urban disorder ...
The destruction of the environment here is leading us to an environmental catastrophe and people are joking about it .
" Since so many politicians have electoral bases in the favelas , it has been more convenient to allow this destruction of the physical beauty with which Rio de Janeiro is blessed . "
Leila do Flamengo argues the rights of the taxpayers in the nearby apartment block are more important than those of the " squatters " in Vila Alice .
Sectors of the tourist industry also back removal .
With Rio hosting the Pan American Games in 2007 , several partial removals are being planned around venues in the suburb of Barra da Tijuca , although compensation has been offered to those affected .
" I 'm absolutely in favour of removal , " the president of the Brazilian Association of Travel Agents , Carlos Alberto Ferreira , recently told Globo newspaper , arguing that without the favelas blighting the landscape , tourism levels would rise , the profits of which could be channelled into fighting poverty .
But from the granite outcrop on which Vila Alice 's shacks are stacked , the view is different .
Machado is unimpressed by claims that his community is being removed to protect the environment .
" Look at those mansions up there , " he says , gesturing across the hillside to clusters of towering homes with thick security walls and elegant balconies .
" They destroyed the forest to build the road up there and they destroyed the forest to build the mansions .
Is n't that the environment ?
Nature has nothing to do with it .
They just do n't want us .
Their problem is n't nature - it's poverty . "
Ricardo Gouvêa , an architect and human rights campaigner from the Bento Rubião Foundation , says fear of urban violence is feeding support for the relocation of Rio 's poor to more distant parts of the city .
" People are confusing the issue of violence and the issue of favelas .
The middle class are scared of the violence but it 's not removal that will solve this .
In the past ... removal has only helped change the address of this problem , " he said , citing the example of the Catacumba favela , whose expelled residents went on to form the Complexo da Maré , a sprawling slum near Rio 's airport often referred to as the " Gaza Strip " because of its high death rate .
" In the 1960s more than 100,000 families were brutally removed and this did n't solve the problem , " he said .
Gouvêa also rejects the idea that Rio's shantytowns have a negative impact on its ability to attract foreign tourists .
" Violence is a serious problem in Rio that needs a sensible public security policy .
But if they put an end to the favelas there will be a big drop in the number of visitors because of the cultural question , particularly the favelas ' links to samba and capoeira . "
As the planned eviction on November 8 gets closer , Gouvêa is supporting plans to use federal money to purchase the land for the residents of Vila Alice .
But residents are pessimistic .
" There are never enough resources for the poor , " says Machado bluntly , standing by a tangle of plastic piping that siphons drinking water to Glorinha 's home at the foot of Vila Alice .
The pumps are turned on every two days , he says .
A similar uncertainty continues for thousands of favelados .
" How can I start over again ?
With what ? " says João Carlos , who was born in Vila Alice and has grandchildren there .
" You start thinking stupid things ...
If they [ the police ] come here to destroy everything we have built up , it 'll end in violence . "
I ’m a Macintosh bigot , so I really enjoyed this .

The remains were exhumed from the cemetery of a Catholic church in the village of Menden - Barge .
Officials said the dead may have been victims of Adolf Hitler 's " euthanasia " programme , under which many disabled people were murdered .
Hitler 's Nazi regime killed more than six million Jews and other minorities across Europe during World War II .
" We assume that these were victims of the Nazi regime , " state prosecutor Ulrich Maass said .
Difficult search
Mr Maass said authorities would search for evidence about the suspected killings and witnesses to any atrocities .
At least one witness , a former church assistant , said he saw corpses brought to the grave by horse - drawn cart .
But he admitted that it could be difficult to find enough strong evidence to bring charges against any individual , 61 years after the end of the war .
Poisons often used to kill victims would be hard to detect after so many years .
The prosecutor said a culture of secrecy surrounded the grave until recent years .
The cemetery is near the site of a hospital once run by Hitler 's personal doctor Karl Brandt , who headed the " euthanasia " programme , called Action T4 .
Victims were killed by lethal injection or by carbon monoxide fumes piped into sheds from car exhausts .
Lack of sleep can affect people ’s moral judgement , a new study shows .
The findings could have implications for people in positions of responsibility , whose decisions often have life or death consequences , such as overworked medical professionals and sleep - deprived soldiers .
William Killgore and colleagues at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring , Maryland , US , set up an experiment with 26 healthy adults , all of whom were active - duty military personnel .
The participants were presented with a variety of hypothetical dilemmas , first when well rested and later , after staying awake for 53 hours .
Situations included complex moral quandaries such as having to choosing whether or not to let one person die in order to save the lives of several others .
Less weighty dilemmas without a moral component were also included , such as “ is it OK to substitute ingredients in a chocolate brownies recipe ? ”
While participants did not become less “ moral ” when sleep deprived , they did require two seconds longer on average to answer complex moral questions , Killgore says .
However , questions without a moral component did not take longer to answer after participants were kept awake .

Asleep at the wheel
The findings , along with previous brain - imaging studies , suggest that sleep deprivation has a particularly debilitating effect on decision - making processes that depend heavily on emotion .
“ When people go for more than 24 hours without sleep there are dramatic decreases in brain activity in the prefrontal cortex [ the area of the brain involved in processing emotions and decision - making ] , ” says Killgore .
“ It basically goes to sleep . ”
Sleep deprived participants also showed slight shifts in what they deemed appropriate actions compared to when they were well - rested .
The changes were more pronounced in individuals who scored lower in “ emotional intelligence ” tests .
Killgore believes that those with a lower emotional capacity to begin with may have less resistance to the affects of sleep deprivation .
Judy Illes at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Stanford University , California , US , says the study ’s implications are profound .
“ Moral judgements are perhaps the most complex decisions that people have to make , decisions that are laden with personal , social , religious , and cultural values , ” she says .
“ We do n’t want tired irritable soldiers making bad decisions that endanger themselves or others that are not a threat to them .
Nor do we want health care providers who are unable to make quick medical decisions on behalf of their patients . ”
Both Illes and Killgore are quick to note that further research , including brain imaging , should be conducted as laboratory results do not always translate to real world situations .

The government is one thing , but the army is the core institution of this little state , and a fine new film about the army ’s last days in Lebanon in 2000 , “ Beaufort , ” is being praised for its depiction of the sensitive Israeli soldier bravely doing his duty despite his fear and the usual political and military confusion .
While criticism of the army is quite acceptable in Israel ’s democracy , and not just on the left , Breaking the Silence left some raw feelings here .
At the recent talk and discussion session , one man stood and said Mr. Manekin and his friends were hurting Israel , especially its image abroad , in order to salve their own consciences .
Many in the audience nodded in agreement .
Tall and dignified , about 45 , the man said that he , too , had served in the West Bank , “ and I ’m proud of what I did there to defend Israelis . ”
It is crucial to intimidate people at checkpoints to keep them cowed , he said , his voice shaking a little , “ because we are so few there , and they are so many . ”
Then he said : “ These people are not like us !
They come up to our faces and they lie to us ! ”
That was enough for Uriel Simon , 77 years old , a professor emeritus of biblical studies at Bar - Ilan University and a noted religious dove .
“ As for liars , ” Mr. Simon said , then paused .
“ My father was a liar .
My grandfather was a liar .
How else did we cross lines to get to this country ?
We stayed alive by lying .
We lied to the Russians , we lied to the Germans , we lied to the British !
We lie for survival !
Jacob the Liar was my father ! ” he said .
As for the Palestinians , he said : “ Of course they lie !
Everyone lies at a checkpoint !
We lied at checkpoints , too . ”
The cover story of today ’s New Scientist discusses the work of Dr Kwabena Boahen who is creating microchips with neural networks designed into the hardware .
Building functions into microchips mean they run fast and efficiently , despite the fact it reduces the flexibility of what the hardware can do .
Artificial neural networks can require a lot of computer processing power because every simulated neuron in the network is essentially a mathematical procedure that needs running every time the network is updated .
With a frequently updated network of thousands and thousands of simulated neurons , the required computing power quickly adds up .
What Boahen and others are doing is building microchips that have functions to simulate neurons built into the hardware to make this possible on only a few chips .
Crucially , some of the simulation is done by analogue , rather than digital , computation .
Digital processors use transistors in their on / off switching phase .
Mead realised that by using transistors in their analogue amplifier phase instead , he could build circuits that accurately mimicked the electrical behaviour of real neurons .
Using transistors in this way also meant Mead could dispense with the central clock altogether , dramatically cutting the power demand .
As long as the input signals arrived within a few milliseconds of each other , the circuit of transistors imitating a given neuron would sum the input values , and if that tipped over a certain threshold , would produce an output spike .
“ It ’s totally foreign to the way we ’ve built computers for the last 40 years , ” says Boahen .
Neural networks can try and simulate real neurons as closely as possible , or be quite abstract or general impressions of them .
The New Scientist article notes that these hardware - based systems are also intended to mirror the brain ’s biology quite closely .
Closely enough , that the systems are being used for designing replacement retinas to augment parts of the damaged visual system in humans .

To Web Developers : Think Outside The Thread :
A few people have asked me this very good question ( I ’m paraphrasing ) : “ If I ’m just trying to build a webapp , and I do n’t need telcom - grade scalability , why should I use Erlang ?
Yes , Erlang may be the best language for concurrent programming , but I will never have to use Erlang ’s concurrency features directly , just as I do n’t use any threading libraries when I ’m building a webapp with other languages . ”
Here ’s my answer : you can certainly build a webapp without using concurrency features directly .
Most web developers do n’t .
Just keep in mind that most framework designers use languages that support concurrency so poorly , that they have resorted to fooling you into thinking that the only webapps you can realistically build must follow the good ol ’ request - response , single - threaded , CRUD - based paradigm .
This is clearly a fallacy .
Many high - quality , innovative webapps do n’t follow this paradigm .
The Google search engine does n’t follow this paradigm .
Neither does Meebo .
Many of the great webapps of tomorrow wo n’t follow this paradigm .
Why should your webapp follow this paradigm ?
The paradigm is shifting to a large degree because of one main innovation , which somebody has named “ Comet ” ( it ’s a silly name if you ask me , but it has stuck ) .
Comet boils down to having the browser keep an open XMLHttpRequest connection to the server , waiting for the server to send it messages .
This opens the door to full bidirectional communication between the browser and the server ( this is essentially what Meebo does ) .
If you want to build a Comet app with today ’s Java , Ruby or Python frameworks — good luck .
Not only will the message - passing — not to mention clustering — logic be unbelievable painful to code ( especially if you ’ve tasted the power of Erlang 🙂 ) , your servers will also croak when your app reaches a few thousand ( or fewer ) simultaneous users .
Partly for these reasons , nobody uses Ruby or Python to build commercial phone switches ( not that I know of , anyway 🙂 ) .
However , Ericsson builds them quite successfully with Erlang .
Erlang powers highly scalable , fault - tolerant phone switches with nine nines availability .
Building scalable clusters is what Erlang is made for , and I dare say Erlang makes such programming tasks ( relatively ) easy .
If you want to build an app that uses Comet , you will need concurrency and scalability , so use Erlang .
However , if your app does n’t use Comet , should you still care about Erlang ’s unmatched capabilities for concurrency , clustering and message passing ?
Yes .
Another good reason to use Erlang is that your web application may benefit from — or even require , as in Google ’s case — distributing a calculation over multiple processors or even multiple nodes in a cluster prior to sending a response back to the browser .
Erlang is designed for distributed programming .
In Erlang , sending a message to a remote node is as easy as sending it to another process in the same box .
As Joe Armstrong has shown , writing a parallel version of lists : map is almost laughably easy in Erlang .
This is all it takes :
class = " typocode " pmap( F , L ) -> S = self ( ) , Pids = map ( fun ( I ) -> spawn ( fun ( ) -> do_f( S , F , I ) end ) end , L ) , gather ( Pids ) .
gather ( [ H|T ] ) -> receive { H , Ret} -> [ Ret|gather ( T ) ] end ; gather ( [ ] ) -> [ ]. do_f ( Parent , F , I ) ->
Parent ! { self ( ) , ( catch F( I ) ) } .
Distributed computation will grow in importance as server manufacturers race to add more cores to their boxes .
( The next release of Sun Niagara will have 64 cores , for instance . )
Even if you do n’t need distributed computation right now , you ’ll benefit from adding Erlang to your toolbox .
Multi - core computation is where things are going , and knowing Erlang will help you stay on top of the game .
By the way , I ’m not suggesting that Erlang has a monopoly on distributed programming —
Erlang is just years ahead of any other language in this area .
Erlang has 20 years of development behind it for this specific purpose , with a long track record of success in large - scale production systems .
Sure , you always have the option of using , say , Starfish for Ruby .
You ’d just have to cross your fingers and hope your competition does n’t use Erlang 🙂
To summarize , if you are 100 % confident that you will never attempt to push the envelope of what your webapp ’s backend can do , you probably wo n’t need Erlang ’s concurrency features .
IMO , you ’ll have fun by using Erlang , but you certainly do n’t need it .
However , if you start venturing into areas that are beyond the single - threaded CRUD view of the world , Erlang ’s capabilities will help you greatly .
So why use Erlang ?
Think outside the thread .
Questions about his health come as he prepares to run for a third term in office as head of his newly formed Kadima party .
But Mr Sharon brushed off such concerns as he left Jerusalem 's Hadassah Hospital .
" I do n't think it will affect my functioning , " he said of the stroke .
Mr Sharon was rushed to the hospital on Sunday night after complaining of weakness and showing signs of confused speech .
Though obesity is not a direct risk factor for strokes , related problems — such as high cholesterol — are , doctors say .
US President George Bush , a fitness fanatic , rang with some advice : " Be careful about food , start exercising and cut back on work hours . "
Aides said Mr Sharon would rest for a few days .
But they hinted that getting the prime minister , a onetime rugged war hero , to count his calories might be a challenge .
" He has been told he needs to go on a diet since 1965 , " his adviser Asaf Shariv said .
Other aides said Mr Sharon had not mentioned slimming down during his two days in hospital .
The Yediot Ahronot daily reported that when his sons , Omri and Gilad , implied it might be time for him to watch his weight , Mr Sharon simply laughed .
Stories of Mr Sharon 's appetite are legendary .
He often jokes about his love of food and expansive girth , and his favourite meal is " meat in every way " , Mr Shariv said .
One journalist reported watching Mr Sharon polish off a tube of Pringles potato chips during an interview .
Others joked that when his now - deceased wife Lily tried to put him on a diet , he had his security detail sneak him a giant pita filled with greasy meat .
A day before his stroke , Mr Sharon enjoyed a typical meal with family and friends .
It included hamburgers , steak in chimichurri sauce , lamb chops , shish kebab and an array of salads , the Maariv daily reported .
For dessert , Mr Sharon had chocolate cake — and then more cake .
Mr Sharon avoided heavy or fried foods during his two - day stay in hospital , Mr Shariv said , and opted for lighter fare after his discharge , eating a lunch of Chinese noodles .
Mr Sharon 's aides repeatedly refused to disclose his weight , and the Israeli media grew increasingly aggressive in its demands for his medical records .
Channel Ten TV reporter Emmanuel Rosen grew exasperated when Mr Sharon 's aide Raanan Gissin insisted the Prime Minister 's health was a private matter .
" That 's not true , " Rosen said yesterday .
" If the doctor recommends Sharon go on a diet , not so he can compete in Channel Ten 's modelling competition , but because there is a health issue , this is the public 's business .
" If the prime minister is not healthy , the public needs to know . "

WASHINGTON  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales reached into the ranks of U.S. attorneys for an interim chief of staff Friday to replace Kyle Sampson , who resigned earlier this week for his role in the Justice Department 's abrupt dismissal of eight federal prosecutors .
Gonzales named Chuck Rosenberg , the chief federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria , to serve as his closest advisor at a time when several Democrats and some Republicans in Congress have called for the attorney general to resign over his handling of prosecutors ' firings .
Rosenberg was chief of staff to former deputy attorney general James Comey .
Other previous jobs included counselor to former attorney general John Ashcroft and counsel to FBI Director Robert Mueller .
Meanwhile , the Democrat - controlled Senate and House Judiciary committees continued to press for the testimony of several White House officials in their investigations of the matter .
At the top of that list of possible witnesses is White House political strategist Karl Rove , whose name surfaced Thursday in recently - disclosed e-mails in which he inquired in January 2005 about the administration 's replacement plan for U.S. attorneys .
Until the e-mail was made public , the White House had maintained that the idea for removing the prosecutors started with former White House counsel Harriet Miers , but the administration has since backed away from that contention .
On Friday , White House spokesman Tony Snow was unable to say who initiated the plan and when .
" The story keeps changing , which neither does them or the public any good , " Sen .
Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , said Friday .
" They ought to gather all the facts and tell the public the truth . "
Congressional subpoenas could come as early as next week , when the Senate is expected to bring up a bill that would remove a provision in the Patriot Act that allows the attorney general to replace U.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote for next Thursday on authorizing subpoenas for Rove , Miers and her deputy , William K. Kelley .
The panel already has approved the use of subpoenas , if necessary , for Justice Department officials and J. Scott Jennings , a White House aide who works in Rove 's office .
Meanwhile , a Republican House member suggested it might be time for Gonzales to go .
" It is ultimately the president 's decision , but perhaps it would benefit this administration if the attorney general was replaced with someone with a more professional focus rather than personal loyalty , " said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , R - Calif .
He complained of " a pattern of arrogance in this administration . "
Other GOP lawmakers have joined Democrats in harsh indictments of Gonzales ' effectiveness but have stopped short of saying he should be fired .
" I do not think the attorney general has served the president well , but it is up to the president to decide on General Gonzales ' continued tenure , " said Sen.
Susan Collins , R - Maine .

But while the board acknowledged " there were sexual overtones in the pose , and her consumption of the lollipop " , it said that a degree of sexuality in advertising was not unacceptable .
" The clothes can hardly be seen , " wrote one complainant to the advertising industry 's self - regulator .
" This type of ad demeans women . "
" The board ( notes ) that the woman is over 18 , is fully clothed in attire that is fashionable amongst young women for summer , and that there is no nudity , " its determination said .
" The board also ( notes ) that consumption of this style of lollipop is now common amongst people over 18 . "
Lee is believed to paid Richardson , 41 , $ 200,000 to shoot its spring - summer campaign - roughly 10 times what an Australian photographer would earn for the same campaign .
If it was paying the provocateur for controversy , its investment was rewarded .
A proposed order in a file - sharing lawsuit would force the recording industry to divulge closely - held details of their wholesale pricing arrangements .
UMG v. Lindor is one of the highest - profile file - sharing case in the news today , due in no small part to the efforts of Marie Lindor 's attorney Ray Beckerman , who maintains the Recording Industry vs The People Blog along with Ty Rogers .
Lindor , like hundreds of others , was sued by the RIAA after a John Doe lawsuit resulted in her ISP turning over information to the record labels tying an IP address allegedly used for illegal downloading to her .
Lindor has mounted a vigorous defense against the charges rather than settling with the RIAA as a large number of other defendants have .
The record labels are strenuously opposing Lindor 's attempts to gain access to the pricing information .
They have argued that if it should n't be divulged , and if it is , it should be only be done so under a protective order that would keep the data highly confidential .
The RIAA regards the wholesale price per song widely believed to be about 70 ¢ per track as a trade secret .
The pricing data really may not be all that secret .
Late in 2005 , New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer launched an investigation into price fixing by the record labels , alleging collusion between the major labels in their dealings with the online music industry .
At issue are " most favored nation " clauses that require a distributor to guarantee a record label the best possible rate .
Here 's how it works : if Apple signs a deal with UMG for X¢ per track and later agrees to pay Sony BMG
Y¢ per track , then Apple will also have to pay UMG Y¢ track , assuming X < Y .
Beckerman argues in a letter to the judge that the only reason the labels want to keep this information confidential is to " serve their strategic objectives for other cases , " which he says does not rise to the legal threshhold necessary for a protective order .
The proposed order would force the labels to turn over contracts with their 12 largest customers .
Most details such as the identities of the parties would be kept confidential , but pricing information and volume would not .
The pricing information could be crucial for Lindor as she makes the argument that the damages sought by the RIAA are excessive .
In this and other cases , the labels are seeking statutory damages of $ 750 per song shared .
Lindor argues that the actual damages suffered by the RIAA are in line with the wholesale price per song , and if that is indeed the case , damages should be capped accordingly between $ 2.80 and $ 7.00 per song if infringement is proven .

Keep your multi-core CPU busy with F #
The growth of computer CPU speed is slowly being replaced by the growth of number of CPUs ( or cores ) in the computer at least for the close future .
This causes a revolution in the way software is written , because traditional and most widely used way of writing concurrent applications using threads is difficult and brings several serious issues .
Some predictions say that within a few years , almost every computer will have about 16 cores , so there is a huge need for programming paradigms or idioms that help developers write concurrent software easily ( see also The Free Lunch Is Over [ ^ ] written by Herb Sutter ) .
Functional programming languages ( especially pure functional languages ) are interesting from this point of view , because the program does n't have side - effects which makes it very easy to parallelize it ( programs in pure functional languages can't have any side - effects by design , in other functional languages like F# the side - effects can be eliminated by following functional programming style ) .
Finding primes example
Let 's say I want to find all prime numbers between 1 million and 1.1 million ( this is example of an operation that can be nicely divided between more processors ) .
First we will need function to test whether n is a prime :
// Tests whether n is prime - expects n > 1 let is_prime n = // calculate how large divisors should we test .. let max = int_of_float ( Math. Sqrt ( float_of_int n ) ) // try to divide n by 2..max ( stops when divisor is found ) not ( { 2 .. max } |> Seq.filter ( fun d -> n%d = 0 ) |> Seq.nonempty )
To find all primes in the specified range we could use the following code :
let primes = [ 1000000 .. 1100000 ] |> List.filter is_prime
This code subsequently executes the is_prime function for all numbers that we want to test , but with multiple CPU cores it would be nice if the function divided the numbers into several parts and executed every part on different thread , so application would take benefit from multiple cores available in the system .
The is_prime function does n't have any side - effects so executing it several times in parallel can't change the result of operation ( if the order of primes in the returned list does n't change ) .
I wrote a function that does exactly what I described in the previous paragraph .
To execute the operation in parallel , you can use the following code ( the only difference is that I replaced List module with my ParallelList module ) :
let primes = [ 1000000 .. 1100000 ] |> ParallelList.filter is_prime
On my notebook ( with Intel Core Duo processor ) the first code ( using List. filter ) takes about 2,3sec and using ParallelList .
filter the operation takes only 1.3sec .
The program is n't 2 times faster , because there is some overhead for creating and synchronizing threads , but in this case the speed increase is significant .
Aside from the filter function , the ParallelList module contains also the map function ( which does the same thing as the List.map ) .
There is also a function set_thread_count that you can use to configure how many threads should be used when executing parallel operations ( the default value is 2 ) .
Performance and future work
The performance of these functions is the key issue .
Currently the ParallelList functions work can't be used for small number of repetitions of simple function , because the overhead is larger than the profit from parallel execution .
If the operation takes less than 0.01ms and the number of repetitions is less than 1000 the List functions are usually better , but for operations taking longer time the results of ParallelList are better even with smaller number of repetitions .
For operation taking about 0.1 ms the ParallelList gives better results for more than 200 repetitions and for operation taking more than 1ms the number of repetitions is not very important ( ParallelList is better even for 10 repetitions ) .
These are inaccurate results that I got on my notebook , so if you 're thinking of using the ParallelList , be sure to do some tests in your scenario !
You can see some tests that I did in the demo project in stats .fs source file .
As I said earlier , ParallelList supports only filter and map functions , so implementing more functions would be useful .
It would be also useful to provide some alternatives for functions that can't be executed in parallel ( like fold_left ) that could be used in some situations .
I 'd also like to implement functions for working with other collection types like Seq ( IEnumerable ) and array in the future .
I 'm interested in your ideas and suggestions , so if you find something that could be improved in the code , or if you have any other idea , let me know !

Testing our programming mettle through the use of under - constrained problem domains is the Trial by ordeal of technical interviewing .
David over on Exold mocks stupid interview questions that ask some basic programming problem ( in that case about file copying ) .
As his mockery shows us , these simple sounding questions have a huge amount of baggage in terms of unstated assumptions .
In the comments on Reddit was this code fragment for an alternative interview question , the classic reverse a string problem :
std ::string& reverseString ( std:: string &str ) { int strLen = str.length ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < strLen / 2 ; ++i ) { std:: swap( str[ i ] , str [ strLen - i - 1 ] ) ; } return str ; }
The fact that the person did it from scratch and straight off the top of their head is an amazing feat ( and for sure one that I could n't replicate ) .
The issue is though that the problem domain is under - constrained .
We do n't actually know enough to write the code yet !
It 's one of those things that just looks so blindingly obvious that we forget to ask the right question : what format is the string in ?
If the question sounds daft — you 're thinking that it 's just a string — then I guess you 're supposing that it 's an ASCII string .
Now take a moment to think about what happens when you run this on a UTF - 8 sequence .
The same problem is going to manifest itself for any multibyte encoding .
And if you 're using something really complex like Shift_JIS then you 're really in a lot of trouble .
Now , let 's look for more complexity : what happens if the text happens to be in a language which uses a complex script like Thai ?
I 'm not even sure that the reverse operation is possible for a Thai word .
Even if the script is in TIS - 620 ( which at least guarantees that each char is an individual glyph ) you 'll probably end up with something that can't be displayed due to the very complex rendering rules the writing system has .
Of course reversing a string is actually a fairly odd thing to do in a bit of software .
We may want to render something backwards ( mirrored ) , but that 's just drawing along an inverted axis is n't it ?
So , let 's put this problem aside as too complex and look at something easy .
An easier problem
How about we just go for something really simple like counting how many characters there are in a string ?
We can even use some library code to do this for us .
std::strlen( ) would seem to be our friend here , but what encoding is it assuming ?
Of course it is n't assuming anything and merely returns the number of bytes long the string is ( less one of course as it does n't count the final zero ) .
Is this the length ?
There 's a raft of other library functions that answer the same question in all sorts of different ways .
It does n't get any better if we decide to make use of wchar_t and start to use std::wstring .
For most platforms where wchar_t is 16 bits and strings are in Unicode we still need to know which Unicode version ( assuming of course it 's in Unicode at all ) so that we can work out how to deal with it ( are the characters constrained to 16 bits as they are in Unicode 2 or can we get surrogate pairs because it 's Unicode 4 ? ) .
A quick look at std :: basic_string <> shows us that we 're likely to have a real hoot using that part of the standard library as the accessors are all based around wchar_t .
Use these on Windows ™ and you have to be responsible for all of the Unicode decoding yourself .
Not a fun task — especially as conformance is going to be so hard to validate .
The higher Unicode planes are pretty rare and your software will probably work fine for most users most of the time .
When it breaks though you 're sure to be introducing all sorts of interesting behavior that 'll be of interest to system crackers .
More reasonable questions
Ole Eichhorn over at Critical Section has a different take on the sorts of questions to ask .
On the face of it the sorts of logic problems he uses are better , but again , there are problems with them .
Let 's look at a couple .
You have five jars of pills and one scale .
All the pills in one jar only are “ contaminated ” , they weigh 9 grams instead of 10 .
How do you tell which jar is contaminated with just one weighing ?
On first reading this I wondered what one weighing actually meant in practice , but putting that aside the solution is very clever .
Given some time to think about it I 'm fairly sure that I 'd come up with it , but I 'd have one big problem : it involves taking the pills out of the jars .
My thought process would tell me that this is a very bad idea .
The answer I 'd have to give is :
It 's impossible to do without contaminating all of the jars .
If I was posing the question I 'd be impressed that a candidate could handle the logic , but they'd have to show a deeper understanding of the context of the problem for me to be really interested in hiring them :
I can't do it without contaminating all of the jars .
We really need to be looking at why the process only allows one weighing and then how the contamination occurred .
A candidate looking at the problem domain in this way is much more valuable .
Going back to Ole 's list , his favourite question is :
Consider a pool table with the balls setup for a break .
You must write a program which models the table , so you can predict where all the balls will end up .
How do you approach this ?
His answer though misses the biggest gotcha in the problem .
First though some other ideas …
I 'm not 100 % convinced that an object - oriented solution for storing the state is most appropriate .
His solution goes on to describe a procedural loop and I think that structured data types may do us just as well in this context .
More interestingly he then says :
Ideally they 'll come up with some sort of discrete time simulation , where they have an outer loop that cycles through units of time , and computes the new position of each object .
Again , hmmm …
What about storing the balls in an ordered list keyed on the time to the next collision ?
It makes the collision determination a bit harder ( and now we 'd almost certainly want to delegate that to ball objects ) but you can get rid of the clock .
Which is better ?
That depends on what you want the simulation for which is not part of the problem domain as stated .
And what is the gotcha ?
It has to do with the physics of the system .
Newtonian mechanics has no solution for three ( or more ) balls hitting each other at the same time .
What does this mean ?
It means that the problem which at first glance looks like a load of simple mechanical physics calculations is n't even deterministic and even worse it turns out to be non-computable !
Any time you have a triple ( or more balls ) collision you have a real problem to solve ( and it 'll be the answer to how to deal with this question that would probably be most illuminating about the candidate ) .
Interviewing
When you 're interviewing you want a candidate that is going to think about the business context of the system and the utility that the software users are going to require — this is what makes David 's answers to the copy file problem so good .
Programmers do spend some of their time putting together complex algorithms , but for most of us , most of the time , we 're looking at building systems that deal with the much more general and far more woolly problems that involve people .
What does the user want to achieve ?
How are they likely to go about it ?
Where are holes in the process ?
What are the exploits ?
Where is the return on investment going to come from ?
These are harder to frame in an interview , but much more valuable to hear the answers to .
And what do we do when we need a complex algorithm ?
We look it up , because I can guarantee that better answers are easily available on the Internet than anything any of us can think up in even a two hour interview .
And just as a postscript , what about the moving mount Fuji problem ?
It 's a volcano : anybody trying to move it is up against what 's going to be a losing fight with the planet .
The mountain has a proper “ self - correcting ” error handling procedure for use against anybody who tries it .
There 's been a discussion going on over at Reddit that you may also find interesting ( if you have n't already seen it ) .
Every day we plan numerous actions , such as to return a book to a friend or to make an appointment .
How and where the brain stores these intentions has been revealed by John - Dylan Haynes from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences , in cooperation with researchers from London and Tokyo .
For the first time they were able to " read " participantsâ€™ intentions out of their brain activity .
This was made possible by a new combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and sophisticated computer algorithms ( Current Biology , 20th February 2007 , online : 8th February ) .
Our secret intentions remain concealed until we put them into action - so we believe .
Now researchers have been able to decode these secret intentions from patterns of their brain activity .
They let subjects freely and covertly choose between two possible tasks - to either add or subtract two numbers .
They were then asked to hold in mind their intention for a while until the relevant numbers were presented on a screen .
The researchers were able to recognize the subjects intentions with 70 % accuracy based alone on their brain activity - even before the participants had seen the numbers and had started to perform the calculation .
Participants made their choice covertly and initially did not know the two numbers they were supposed to add or subtract .
Only a few seconds later the numbers appeared on a screen and the participants could perform the calculation .
This ensured that the intention itself was being read out , rather than brain activity related to performing the calculation or pressing the buttons to indicate the response .
" It has been previously assumed that freely selected plans might be stored in the middle regions of the prefrontal cortex , whereas plans following external instructions could be stored on the surface of the brain .
We were able to confirm this theory in our experiments " , Haynes explained .
The work of Haynes and his colleagues goes far beyond simply confirming previous theories .
It has never before been possible to read out of brain activity how a person has decided to act in the future .
The trick by which the invisible is made visible lies in a new method called " multivariate pattern recognition " .
A computer is programmed to recognize characteristic activation patterns in the brain that typically occur in association with specific thoughts .
Once this computer has been " trained " it can be used to predict the decisions of subjects from their brain activity alone .
An important technical innovation also lies in combining information across extended regions of the brain to strongly increase sensitivity .
The study also reveals fundamental principles about the way the brain stores intentions .
" The experiments show that intentions are not encoded in single neurons but in a whole spatial pattern of brain activity " , says Haynes .
They furthermore reveal that different regions of the prefrontal cortex perform different operations .
Regions towards the front of the brain store the intention until it is executed , whereas regions further back take over when subjects become active and start doing the calculation .
" Intentions for future actions that are encoded in one part of the brain need to be copied to a different region to be executed " , says Haynes .
These findings also raise hope for improvement of clinical and technical applications .
Already today the first steps are being made in easing the lives of paralyzed patients with computer - assisted prosthetic devices and so - called brain computer interfaces .
These devices focus on reading out the movement the patient intends to - but is unable to - perform .
Previous research has shown that patients can move artificial limbs or computer cursors purely by the power of their mind .
The current research by Haynes and colleagues now opens up a completely new perspective .
In future it will be possible to read even abstract thoughts and intentions out of patientsâ€™ brains .
One day even the intention to " open the blue folder " or " reply to the email " could be picked up by brain scanners and turned into the appropriate action .

Reading hidden intentions in the human brain
Current Biology , February 20th , 2007 ( online : February 8th )
If found guilty , Saddam Hussein could face the death penalty
Mr Talabani , who has a record of opposing the death penalty , told Iraqi state TV a judge " was able to extract confessions " from the ousted leader .
" Saddam deserves a death sentence 20 times a day because he tried to assassinate me 20 times , " he said .
Saddam Hussein 's trial will start on 19 October , the Iraqi government has said .
Several of the ex-president 's closest aides will also face trial with him , on charges relating to the massacre of 143 Shias in a town north of Baghdad .
The killings in Dujail in 1982 followed an attempt on Saddam Hussein 's life .
Saddam Hussein could face capital punishment if found guilty in the case .
' 100 reasons '
Mr Talabani told Iraqiya TV that some of the alleged confessions referred to crimes " such as executions " during Saddam Hussein 's rule .
The president said the confessions involved cases currently under investigation without giving any further details .
" There are 100 reasons to sentence Saddam to death , " said Mr Talabani , a former Kurdish rebel leader .
However , the president - who has voiced public opposition to the death penalty - confirmed he would not sign any execution warrant himself .
Saddam Hussein's lawyers have greeted Mr Talabani 's comments with scepticism and have warned the allegations risk prejudicing the trial .
The legal team is trying to delay next month 's proceedings arguing it has not been given sufficient time to prepare .
Mr Talabani's intervention will also increase the widely - held suspicion among Iraqi 's Sunni community that the legal process is subject to political interference , the BBC's Jon Brain in Baghdad says .
Saddam Hussein and some of his former aides will also face separate trials on other charges .
But some government officials have suggested that if he is convicted for the Dujail killings , subsequent trials for other crimes might be shelved to open the way for sentence to be carried out quickly .

XMLisp is the integration of Lisp with XML .
The Lisp Meta Object Protocol is used to establish a simple and highly efficient mapping between CLOS objects and the XML extensible markup language .
It is not just an API to read XML files and turn them into some Lisp flavored representation .
Instead , it integrates Lisp and XML into one environment at two levels .
At a language level it allows the arbitrary combination of Lisp expressions and XML elements .
CLOS objects can be printed as XML elements .
XML elements evaluate into CLOS objects .
At a tool level XMLisp allows users to fluidly experiment with XML .
Type XML elements into the lisp listener .
Evaluate complete or parts of hierarchical XML elements .
Inspect complex XML elements using the inspector .
Get support from symbol completion when editing XML .
I stumbled across this while porting more layers of the Open Agent Engine to OpenMCL .
While at first it seems a little weird , it 's actually quite an amazingly natural way of integrating Lisp and XML .
It 's neat to work with XML fragments as an inspectable CLOS object hierarchy .
I think XMLisp is also a great example of the flexibility available to Lisps of all flavors ; I 'm sure some industrious soul could easily port it to PLT Scheme or something similar !
Iranian and Iraqi officials said the building was an Iranian consulate and the detainees its employees .
The US military said it was still investigating , but that the building did not have diplomatic status .
The troops raided the building at about 0300 ( 0001GMT ) , taking away computers and papers , according to local media .
AFP news agency quoted Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman as saying he did not know the nationality of the six but said they were " suspected of being closely tied to activities targeting Iraq and coalition forces " .
" I can confirm for you through our forces there that this is not a consulate or a government building , " he said .
However , Tehran said the attack violated all international conventions .
It has summoned ambassadors from Switzerland , representing US interests , and Iraq .
A spokesman for Iran 's foreign ministry described the raid as an attempt to sabotage Tehran 's relations with Iraq .
One Iranian MP said it showed America 's cruelty and meanness .
The raid comes amid high Iran - US tension .
In a major speech on Wednesday , President George W Bush said the US would take a tough stance towards Iran and Syria , whom he accused of destabilising Iraq .
The US also accuses Iran of seeking nuclear arms .
Iran denies both charges .
Tehran counters that US military involvement in the Middle East endangers the whole region .
Pressure
A local TV station said Kurdish security forces had taken over the building after the Americans had left .
Irbil lies in Iraq 's Kurdish - controlled north , about 350 km ( 220 miles ) from the capital Baghdad .
Reports say the Iranian consulate there was set up last year under an agreement with the Kurdish regional government to facilitate cross - border visits .
Dozens of casualties resulted from a truck bombing in Samarra
One Iranian news agency with a correspondent in Irbil says five US helicopters were used to land troops on the roof of the Iranian consulate .
It reports that a number of vehicles cordoned off the streets around the building , while US soldiers warned the occupants in three different languages that they should surrender or be killed .
In December , US troops detained a number of Iranians in Iraq , including two with diplomatic immunity who were later released .
Thursday 's raid came as US President George W Bush unveiled his new strategy in Iraq , which included increasing troop numbers and a commitment to stop Iranian support for " our enemies in Iraq " .
BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says the raid could signal a ratcheting - up of pressure on the Iranians , in line with the rhetorical thrust of his speech .
Meanwhile in the Iraqi capital , five off - duty policemen were killed in an ambush in the western al - Khadra neighbourhood , hospital officials said
Security sources said another man was killed in an attack on a money changer in downtown Baghdad .
In the restive Anbar province , the US military said that one of its troops was killed on Tuesday by a roadside bombing .
Other violence was reported in Mosul , where gunmen killed a professor driving home from work , and Samarra where a suicide truck bomber attacked the mayor 's house , killing three people and wounding 33 , including the mayor .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should " be made to disappear from the arena , " Meir Amit , a former director of Israel 's Mossad intelligence agency , advocated in an exclusive interview with WND .
Amit , one of the most esteemed figures in the Israeli intelligence establishment , said while he was director of the Mossad from 1963 to 1968 he regularly argued against the assassination of world leaders .
But he said the case of Ahmadinejad is different .
Iranian Leader Ahmadinejad : Israel wo n't dare attack us Dudi Cohen
In interview with Spanish newspaper during visit to South America , Iranian president says , ' They are aware of Iran 's strength .
I believe they wo n't do such a stupid thing . '
He reiterates Israel will vanish ' like Soviet Union , ' doubts Holocaust Ahmadinejad : Israel wo n't dare attack us
" Ahmadinejad is the pusher of all the Muslim world toward fanaticism and extremism .
In his case , he should be made to disappear from the arena .
He has said he wants to become a shahid , a martyr , so I think he should get his wish and be sent to heaven , " Amit said .
Amit , now in his mid-80's , directed some of the most notorious Mossad operations while he was the organization 's chief , including the running of Israeli spy Eli Cohen who penetrated top levels of the Syrian government , and the hijacking of an advance fighter plane from Iraq .
The subject of multiple books and movies , Amit serves as chairman of Israel 's Center for Special Studies .
Amit says he is intimately familiar with the political structure of Iran , having gone on special missions to the country during the 1960's while Israel had a relationship with Iranian leaders .
He told WND he does not advocate an Israeli military attack against Iran 's suspected nuclear facilities .
Instead he said Israel should adopt a defensive position , deploying a working anti-missile system to intercept possible Iranian missile attacks .
Israel this weekend successfully tested the Arrow missile defense system in its first nighttime exercise against a missile mocking an Iranian Shihab - 3 .
Amit termed Iran an " international threat . "
He said Israel and the US should work with the international community to undermine Ahmadinejad 's regime and foster a popular uprising .
Ahmadinejad has called for Israel to be wiped off the map
" We know most of the younger generation in Iran is against Ahmadenejad .
They should be aided .
The US and international community is trying now in a light way by using broadcasting , and putting antennas in several places in Iran and also having one or two stations broadcasting real news and appropriate messages , " said Amit .
" More money needs to be budgeted to this cause , " Amit said .
' We 're on the eve of World War III '
While the former Mossad chief did not call for a military strike against Iran , Amit said he foresees a war in the region in the future .
He said global civilization is on the verge of " World War III , " a massive conflict in which the Islamic world is attempting to impose its ideology on Western nations .
" I am worried about a regional war , but also we need to look at the bigger picture and see that Islam is fighting western world and not only Israel .
Look at the terror in Spain , France , London , the U.S. , " said Amit .
" I call it World War III .
You must look at it from this angle and treat it wider , not as a problem of terrorism here and there .
The war is not being waged just by Iran and in Iraq , it 's being launched by Muslims all over the world , " said Amit .
Amit referenced recent terror attacks against Israel , Europe and the United States ; Iran 's alleged nuclear ambitions ; the insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan ; and recent worldwide Muslim riots .
" It looks to me like it is a kind of coordinated or contemplated problem to somehow impose the Islamic idea all over the world , " Amit said .
Amit urged Western nations to " unite and work together .
Unfortunately , the world is not uniting .
Russia is playing its own game , and so is China . "
Both China and Russia have been aiding Iran 's nuclear program , which Tehran claims is intended for peaceful purposes only .
In a bid to soften possible sanctions against Iran , Russia earlier proposed setting up a joint venture to enrich uranium for Iran on Russian soil .
Amit 's call for the " disappearing " of Ahmadinejad comes as the Iranian leader yesterday told ABC News in an interview he was " open for talks , " on his country 's nuclear program .
Ahmadinejad denied suggestions he sought conflict with the US , saying Iran was " trying to find ways to love people " .
But Ahmadinejad 's statements were punctuated by comments also made yesterday by Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Seyed Mohammad Ali Hosseini , who told Iranian state - run television Tehran will " never " agree to suspend its nuclear activities .
" The issue of suspension is not acceptable under any conditions , " Hosseini said .
Amit said Iran currently is fostering region - wide instability , funding and aiding the insurgency against US troops in Iraq , directing the Lebanese Hezbollah militia and funding Palestinian terrorism .
" But I think the most serious problem is Iran developing nuclear power , " Amit said .

Certain links have been updated so that they point to the Internet Archive .
In just ten short years , the Internet has evolved considerably .
Over the past decade , Google has risen to power as the most dominant search engine , the dot - com bubble was born and ultimately burst , Microsoft Internet Explorer usurped Netscape , and Macromedia — wait , they ’re part of Adobe now —
Flash has become commonplace around the Web .
Here in the United States , most of us moved from k56 flex and X2 ( competing standards for near - 56 k modem connectivity , if you do n’t remember ) to cable and DSL .
In this article , I ’ll touch on the progress we ’ve made , as well as some of what could lie ahead .
Accessing the Internet
In 1997 , the “ mobile Web ” that we enjoy today was in its infancy .
A number of services , including the now - defunct and largely forgotten AirMedia Live , offered users wireless delivery of news and information within set subscription categories .
In the case of AirMedia Live , users placed a small receiver on their desk , and connected to the Internet ( via modem ) when they wanted to view an entire story .
Other providers , such as Ricochet , allowed us a quick glimpse of our wireless future .
Ricochet ’s wireless mesh network provided Internet connections at a speed of up to 128 kb/s when the fastest cellular connection would have been less than a mere 10 kb/s .
Today , following the advent of wireless fidelity , mobile access cards , and even mobile Web browsers , it ’s easy to stay connected .
In 2017 , perhaps we will witness a resurgence of mesh networks in the form of municipal wireless fidelity ( wi - fi ) , which could provide everybody with inexpensive or free Internet access .
If that ’s not the case , then we can expect the definition of broadband to change altogether .
Verizon FiOS , a fiber - optic Internet service , already offers connection speeds of up to 30 megabits per second .
Additionally , a new high - speed cable standard would support downstream speeds of up to 160 megabits per second .
Wafer Thin Computing
Ten years ago , pundits everywhere were predicting the emergence of the thin client .
While they did come along eventually , it turned out that there were few advantages to using them .
With the growing ubiquity of development techniques such as AJAX ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ) , maybe the truth is that our computers are indeed slowly evolving into thin clients .
Services like Amazon S3 are already providing developers with the option to store and retrieve data as objects from any computer with an Internet connection .
Imagine replacing your file system with an object cache that could be accessed from nearly anywhere in the world , on any computer .
The way we publish content will change , too .
Perhaps media files will simply exist as pointers ( not unlike symbolic links ) to other caches maintained by their publishers .
Instead of a massive hard disk drive , your computer might contain a relatively small solid state disk , which would provide it with only the information required to establish an Internet connection .
Your iPod would n’t even need to store your favorite Pink Floyd album ; instead , it would be streamed from your network cache .
Although it might sound like a decent idea , especially with the amount of bandwidth behind it , a configuration such as this would open the door to further ethical questions .
For example , who would your data belong to , exactly ?
Would you have any privacy at all ?
But storage is n’t the only thing that ’s still evolving .
Applications are , too .
Imagine a world where you license software on a monthly basis , and you will have a good idea of where we might be headed .
While you wo n’t need to patch your software anymore , the publisher will have a lot more control over what you can do with it , and at what cost .
A decade from now , Valve ’s Steam might very well be seen as the Ricochet of Web - based application publishing .
Something to Talk About
I ’m frequently told that everything old is new again .
It ’s definitely true for telecommunications , which enjoys a special kind of irony .
The technology that once empowered us to access the Internet is slowly becoming dependent on it .
I am , of course , talking about the gradual emergence of Voice over Internet Protocol .
Is it possible that , in 2017 , the mobile phones that we carry today will have evolved into Internet conduits , complete with software that enables them to act as soft phones ?
Instead of providing the actual voice service , perhaps Verizon might offer only a network connection , and the user would then choose from a number of services not unlike today ’s Skype .
While such progressions might seem inevitable , it ’s also important to remember that our telecommunications providers are notoriously adverse to change .
Driving Forces
In 1997 , GPS - based navigation systems were optional on some cars , such as the cost - no - object Mercedes - Benz S - Class , which began offering it as a feature in late 1995 .
An earlier version , which did not use the Global Positioning System , was offered in Japan as early as 1993 .
Today , navigation systems are offered as options by many manufacturers , on almost every type of car imaginable .
Most of these , however , use information stored on physical media to display and calculate your route .
A decade from now , it ’s likely that your navigation system will require some kind of network connection , enabling it to update map information dynamically .
Volkswagen recently collaborated with Google to produce a navigation system that features Google Earth integration , which allows for the display of a 3D , photorealistic view of your location , as well as the terrain around it .
Mercedes - Benz is working on another system that will allow their vehicles to communicate with a network of other cars , providing a dynamically generated , real - time overview of road conditions .
You might find this information , as well as overlaid traffic and weather conditions , displayed on your navigation system in 2017 .
Further , do n’t be surprised if either some or all of it is retrieved from a Web service .
Web 3.0
If you ’re a Web developer , you might already be groaning .
However , in ten years , the Web will be a completely different animal .
Sure , you will occasionally run across 20 - year - old static table - based layouts , but they will be markedly different from the beautiful , scalable layouts that might finally become commonplace in 2017 .
With any luck , the Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) format will find its place on the Web , allowing design elements to scale without the distortion found in today ’s GIF , JPEG , and PNG formats .
Perhaps SVG , with its support for interactive scripting , will also compete directly with Flash .
If you have a browser that supports SVG , such as modern versions of Mozilla Firefox , visit this page for an example of how SVG could potentially replace it altogether .
Of course , in 2017 , Mozilla Firefox might also look entirely different .
The AJAX development technique is poised to change the way browsers are built , requiring that changes be made to a number of fundamental elements , including the manner in which page - to - page navigation is handled .
In 2007 , most AJAX Web applications break browser navigation in a way that is highly noticeable to the end user .
While I ’m on the topic of Mozilla , they already offer a framework for application development that runs on top of a portable core .
Knowing that Google and Mozilla have formed a close relationship over the past few years , I ca n’t help but wonder how this technology might eventually be used , and by whom .
Conclusion
In the past ten years , we ’ve gone from Geocities to MySpace , although few people would consider that progress .
Nonetheless , our ambitions have driven the Internet far in just a decade ’s time .
On the Web , the new ubiquity of the blog has made news distribution viral , and perhaps unstoppable .
AJAX has altered the way we seek information , and might ultimately be remembered as a stepping stone to a far more comprehensive platform .
We ’ve even witnessed the first war in which people — not just politicians and reporters , but ordinary citizens — from every side have been heard on a platform that has given them equal footing , for better or worse .
Now , let ’s see what the next ten years bring .

WASHINGTON , March 14 — As he pressed his case to be confirmed as attorney general , Alberto R. Gonzales made a promise to the Senate Judiciary Committee — and to the nation at large .
“ I will no longer represent only the White House , ” he testified in 2005 as he prepared to leave his job as White House counsel .
“ I will represent the United States of America and its people .
I understand the differences between the two roles . ”
Yet in one of his first acts in his new job , Mr. Gonzales brought over two top White House aides and elevated a third , D. Kyle Sampson , a Justice Department staff member who had worked in the White House .
Within days , Mr. Sampson began identifying federal prosecutors to oust , an effort initiated by Harriet E. Miers , the fellow Texan who succeeded Mr. Gonzales at the White House .
The attorney general ’s accumulating critics point to the removal of seven prosecutors in December as evidence that Mr. Gonzales , a longtime Bush loyalist , had failed to distance himself and his agency from the White House and its political agenda .
There is an interesting post over at Best Gay Blogs about how they were dropped from Google ’s AdSense program because of adult or mature content on their site .
While normally I would n’t think too much of it , I can sympathize with Best Gay Blog ’s plight because the same thing has happened to me .
Yes ,
I received the e-mail from Google about two weeks ago advising me that I had violated the AdSense Terms of Service ( TOS ) because my site contained adult or mature content .
I thought they were referring to content on The Eye Candy Albums until I realized I was n’t displaying Google ads over there .
I was using a different ad provider on those pages .
I wrote back to Google and asked them to please elaborate on my violation of the TOS .
I also pleaded with them to reconsider their decision .
A couple of days later I received their reply .
The " adult content " they were referring to was the Eye Candy Mondays posts as well as an ad I have to my Amazon.com affiliate store .
The ad is currently running , but in case you miss it , it displays this image .
They also were n’t happy with the ad for David Rich ’s " Look Great Naked " Workout DVDs .
They told me I would have to remove all that content to even be considered for reinstatement .
I do n’t have a problem with Google enforcing the TOS of their AdSense program , however I began to wonder if it was being applied fairly across the board .
While yes , some of the images are provocative , none contain full frontal nudity or representations of people having sex .
I decided not to take down my content and figured I would use a different ad provider instead .
Matter dropped .
( On a side note , I do n’t need to run ads on my site , but they do help me pay my web - hosting bill and other things .
No one has ever complained to me about them . )
After reading Best Gay Blog ’s post about also being banned from AdSense , I began to wonder if Google was in fact being fair in enforcing their TOS .
Just doing a quick surf through some of the blogs on Blogger ( which Google owns ) showed me that there were many " straight " blogs with revealing photos of women that also carried Google ads .
On a couple of these sites , the women were naked from the back or side and one even showed a woman topless .
Now I ’m no expert , but if some racy photos of men violated their TOS , should n’t these photos of the undressed women also be a violation ?
I ’m curious if any other gay bloggers out there have been dropped from Google ’s AdSense , and if so , for what reason .
I ’m not ready to call Google homophobic yet , but I would like to find out if they are targeting gay bloggers .
If this has happened to your blog , or if you know a blog that it has happened to , please e-mail me and let me know .
If you can also help me spread the word so that more people can tell me if they were affected or not , I would appreciate it .
I ’ll keep you all updated as to what I find out .
P.S. The worst part for me is that my earnings were at about $ 95 for the month .
If you ’re familiar with the AdSense program , Google only pays out once your earnings reach $ 100 or more for the month , so basically I just lost out on all the money .
By beginning to investigate the Bush administration ’s interference with scientists ’ work on global warming , the Democratic Congress has embarked on a key task : restoring respect for science -- and more generally , for evidence and reason -- in the federal government .
That we need such reform , and from Democrats , is a historic irony , because it ’s the Republicans who have often tried to paint themselves as defenders of “ sound science ” against ideologically motivated attacks .
In the 1990s , conservatives such as Dinesh D’Souza , Gertrude Himmelfarb and Roger Kimball wrote best - selling jeremiads attacking postmodernist academics who , they insisted , were taking over American universities and subverting the standards of scholarship .
Although much exaggerated , this contained a grain of truth .
Some self - described leftist academics did seem determined to reduce the real world to mere “ discourse . ”
No worldview , they insisted , could be considered objectively more valid or factual than any other .
Even the findings of science were described as reflecting societal conditions and struggles for power and dominance rather than something true about the nature of the world .
One of us -- Sokal -- was sufficiently disturbed by these trends to try an unorthodox experiment : write a parody of postmodern science criticism to see whether a trendy academic journal would accept it as a serious scholarly article .
Asserting up front that “ physical ‘ reality ’ [ note the scare quotes ] ... is at bottom a social and linguistic construct , ” Sokal averred that the latest conceptions of quantum gravity support deconstructive literary theory , Lacanian psychoanalysis , “ postmodernist epistemology ” and , of course , progressive politics .
The cultural - studies journal Social Text ate it up .
Advertisement
After Sokal revealed his hoax in the magazine Lingua Franca , a debate exploded about the nature of science and rationality , popularly known as the “ science wars . ”
It pitted scientists and their staunch defenders within and outside of the academic community -- spanning the political spectrum from left to right -- against a band of intellectuals from the humanities , virtually all of them situated on the left .
Sokal took on his postmodernist colleagues because he feared that the rejection of a rigorous , evidence - based standard for assessing claims of purported fact would disarm us not only in the face of quack medical remedies or alleged paranormal occurrences , but also when confronted by distortions of scientific information having major public - policy implications .
A classic example is the tobacco industry ’s well - documented campaign to sow doubts about the health risks of smoking .
Another is the interminable push by religious fundamentalists to undermine the teaching of evolution in American schools .
As these cases suggest , attacks on science by ideologues and special interests have a long history in this country .
A stance of postmodernist relativism -- or , on the part of the media , of giving “ equal time ” to unequally substantiated viewpoints -- weakens us in the face of such strategic campaigns to undercut well - established knowledge .
But the abuse of science has lately materialized in an even more disturbing form , this time within the corridors of our own government .
Driven by the Bush administration and its congressional allies , the new American “ science wars ” have reached an alarming stage .
Advertisement
HOW AND WHY did the science wars move out of academia and reemerge in Washington , with political poles reversed ?
During the Clinton years , many of the worst science abusers -- such as anti-evolution fundamentalists -- remained politically out in the cold , at least at the federal level .
That began to change in 1994 , as the Gingrich Republicans , highly sympathetic to the party ’s emerging socially conservative “ base ” and to the interests of private industry , laid claim to Congress .
They proceeded to attack evidence demonstrating a human role in climate change , all as well as in the depletion of the ozone layer as part of a sweeping attempt to undermine environmental regulation .
Simultaneously , they dismantled Congress ’ world - renowned scientific advisory body , the Office of Technology Assessment , which had provided our elected representatives with reliable scientific counsel for more than two decades .
Meanwhile , the focus on the academic left ’s undermining of science following the Sokal hoax was generating worthwhile debates and even real soul - searching .
For instance , the prominent French sociologist of science , Bruno Latour , has wondered whether his earlier work questioning the objectivity of scientific knowledge went too far : “ Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies ?
Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant ? ”
In truth , there was nothing wrong with inventing science studies ; the error was to leap from the valid observation that science arises in a social context to the extreme conclusion that it is nothing more than politics in disguise .
Advertisement
Such introspection on the academic left has been a heartening sign , and the pronouncements of extreme relativism have subsided significantly in recent years .
This frees up defenders of science to combat the enemy on our other flank : an unholy ( and uneasy ) alliance of economically driven attacks on science ( on issues such as global climate change , mercury pollution and what constitutes a good diet ) and theologically impelled ones ( in areas such as evolution , reproductive health and embryonic stem cell research ) .
The potency of this combination has become apparent during the six years of the Bush administration , as many if not most scientific agencies of our government have become embroiled in scandals involving the misrepresentation or suppression of scientific information , gag orders on scientist employees , or other interferences with the processes by which science feeds into decision - making .
Tracing these intrusions back to their source , we almost always uncover the same pattern :
It concerns an issue in which one of the two principal constituencies of the current administration -- religious conservatives or big corporations -- has a vested interest .
Perhaps they wish to disrupt the path of Plan B emergency contraception ( the “ morning - after ” pill ) through the Food and Drug Administration on its way to over - the - counter availability .
Or perhaps they do n’t like the way global warming has been discussed in government documents .
That ’s at the core of a case recently investigated by the new Congress :
A lawyer who had formerly worked for the American Petroleum Institute and had moved to the Bush White House ’s Council on Environmental Quality was accused in 2005 of editing government climate science reports in such a way as to raise doubts about global warming and downplay the strong consensus of mainstream scientists .
Following the initial scandal , the lawyer went to work for Exxon Mobil Corp .
Advertisement
In these and countless other cases , members of the Bush administration appear to have efficiently channeled their constituents ’ grudges , leading to a distortion of the scientific evidence and a steady stream of scandals .
TO ADDRESS this new crisis over the relationship between science and politics , we propose a combination of political activism and institutional reform .
Congress needs to establish safeguards to protect the integrity of scientific information in Washington -- strong whistle - blower protections for scientists who work in government agencies would be a good start .
We also need a strengthening of the government scientific advisory apparatus , starting with the revival of the Office of Technology Assessment .
And we need congressional committees to continue with their investigations of cases of science abuse within the Bush administration , in order to learn what other reforms are necessary .
At the same time , journalists and citizens must renounce a lazy “ on the one hand , on the other hand ” approach and start analyzing critically the quality of the evidence .
For , in the end , all of us -- conservative or liberal , believer or atheist -- must share the same real world .
Antibiotic - resistant bacteria do not spare deniers of evolution , and global climate change will not spare any of us .
As physicist Richard Feynman wrote in connection with the space shuttle Challenger disaster , “ nature can not be fooled . ”

In ihrer Antwort ( PDF ) auf eine Kleine Anfrage der Fraktion Die Linke zur Rechtmäßigkeit von Online - Untersuchungen hat die Bundesregierung erstmals Details zum geplanten " Bundestrojaner " veröffentlicht .
Als " Bundestrojaner " wird inoffiziell der Teil eines Programmes bezeichnet , der Spyware - Code auf einen PC einschleust , damit eine Online - Durchsuchung durch die Strafverfolgungsbehörden oder Geheimdienste möglich ist .
Nach Auskunft der Bundesregierung sind für die Programmierung der Software zwei Programmierstellen notwendig , die teils aus laufenden Mitteln , teils von Mitteln aus dem Programm zur Stärkung der Inneren Sicherheit bezahlt werden .
Insgesamt soll das Tool zur Online - Durchsuchung nicht mehr als 200.000 Euro kosten .
Zur Frage der Rechtmäßigkeit einer solchen Rechnerdurchsuchung verweist die Bundesregierung auf die Auseinandersetzung , die derzeit am Bundesgerichtshof ( BGH ) geführt wird .
Anfang Dezember hatte ein Ermittlungsrichter am BGH Online - Durchsuchungen verboten .
Unmittelbar nach Bekanntwerden des Urteils hatte die Generalbundesanwältin Harms Beschwerde gegen das Urteil eingelegt .
Über diese Beschwerde ist noch nicht verhandelt worden .
Sollte der Beschwerde nicht stattgegeben werden , " wird zu prüfen sein , ob ein gesetzgeberischer Handlungsbedarf für eine spezielle Ermittlungsbefugnis der Strafverfolgungsbehörden besteht " , lautet die Auskunft der Bundesregierung .
Insgesamt lässt die Antwort der Bundesregierung keinen Zweifel daran , dass die Online - Durchsuchung ein unverzichtbares Instrument der Strafverfolger und Verfassungsschützer sein wird .
Als Vorteil gegenüber einer " offenen Durchsuchung " eines Rechners vor Ort wird die Tatsache genannt , dass die Beschuldigten keine Kenntnis von den gegen sie geführten Ermittlungen haben und damit nicht die " Aufdeckung von Täterstrukturen " erschweren oder gar vereiteln können .
" Während eine ' offene ' Durchsuchung regelmäßig eher am Ende eines Ermittlungsverfahrens steht , kann die Online - Durchsuchung in einem Stadium , in dem das Ermittlungsverfahren dem Beschuldigten noch nicht bekannt ist , dazu dienen , Ermittlungsansätze auch im Hinblick auf weitere Tatbeteiligte oder Tatplanungen zu gewinnen . "
Eine Online - Durchsuchung kommt somit selten allein .
In der Antwort der Bundesregierung heißt es auch , dass bislang in Deutschland keine Online - Durchsuchung durchgeführt wurde , weil das einzige bekannte , von einem Bonner Ermittlungsrichter angeordnete Verfahren nach Einspruch des BGH - Untersuchungsrichters gestoppt wurde .
" Verfahren , in denen Online - Durchsuchungen für Zwecke der Gefahrenabwehr durchgeführt wurden , sind der Bundesregierung nicht bekannt . "

Commentary No Need to Idle in Winter Winter idling is bad for the environment and is even bad for your car .
By Thom Oommen
Published February 09 , 2007
Winter has finally arrived despite our best efforts , willing or otherwise , to contribute to climate change ( and I was just getting used to riding my bike in relative comfort during winter . )
I suppose it's a good sign that we can still rely on some things in life .
One of the things I used to count on in winter as a boy was my father 's morning ritual .
No not shaving or showering , but just as common : winter idling .
You see , if my dad 's car did n't have a good twenty minutes of idling in the morning , the engine would stall as he drove along to work .
During the 1980s and earlier , winter idling was a necessity if one chose to drive .
I was n't alone ; we all witnessed this parental behaviour every day the temperature dropped below zero .
These memories stick with you and inform your choices later in life .
Maximum 30 Seconds of Idling
Unfortunately , today people still behave like it's the 1980s ( in more ways than one ) .
The myth of " essential " winter idling remains very powerful for many drivers .
Since 1990 , though , advances in technology have negated any technical need to idle in winter .
When was the last time you or someone you know stalled their car ?
It does n't happen any more , thanks to fuel injection and computerized engines .
The average car today has more processing power than the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed humans on the moon .
Natural Resources Canada recommends a maximum of 30 seconds of idling in winter , to get fluids moving , followed by consistent and steady driving ; if you gun it you 're more likely to stall .
For one thing , idling does n't actually get all a vehicle 's parts moving .
Only driving does that : a vehicle is more than an engine .
Even worse , excessive idling can corrode exhaust systems and foul spark plugs , which leads to decreased fuel efficiency .
Nobody enjoys a trip to the mechanic for no good reason .
Car ≠ Coat
Many people already know that from a technical standpoint , their vehicle does n't need to idle in winter .
The sole reason they idle is to warm the interior .
Is comfort a good justification for fuelling climate change or poor air quality ?
Do you want to breathe in all that exhaust or have your children do so ?
What health impacts might this have ?
I 'm still amazed to watch people casually clean the snow off their vehicles in a cloud of chemicals in the morning .
A car is not a coat .
If the steering wheel is cold , get some driving gloves .
If you 're cold when you get in , please ponder what you 're wearing .
Maybe that light jacket is n't enough - think about a thick coat , toque and scarf instead .
I assure you that well - dressed kids and even a bundled - up baby can handle a cold car in the morning .
When did Canadians get so soft ?
Time to Rethink Myths
With the City of Hamilton seriously pondering an anti-idling by - law , Hamiltonians would be advised to rethink some of the myths of and reasons behind winter idling .
I encourage you , dear reader , to pass on this information to your family and friends .
It 's the only way this wasteful behaviour will ever be changed .
Thom Oommen is passionate about building truly sustainable communities .
But far from technological solutions and other flights of fancy , he believes that the only way to build a just and ecologically responsible community is to embrace frugality and simplicity .
He is currently focusing on actively learning the skills that will enable him and his community to face an unknown future with a measure of confidence .

The Car Dealer Doldrums Indicator
What are Car - Sales Saying About a Recession ?
According to Floyd Norris of the NYT , potentially alot .
In his column in today 's Times , Norris shows the chart below .
It reveals the year - over - year rate of change in sales by new - car dealers on a trailing 12 month basis ( adjusted for inflation ) -- and compares them with recessions .
According to Norris , there is a surprisingly positive correlation when the figure is a negative 2 % or greater .
The indicators suggests a recession is either " under way or set to begin within a few months . "
According to the chart , it has never warned of a recession that did not occur :

Trailing 12 Month New Car Sales , US , Year - over - Year

Norris :
The rule — unveiled here for the first time — is that if the figure is down 2 percent or more , a recession is either under way or set to begin within a few months .
The figure fell to a negative 2.4 percent when June sales figures were released last week by the Census Bureau .
If things are miserable for America ’s new - car dealers , can a recession be averted ?
History says it cannot and suggests a downturn may have already begun .
The available data go back to 1968 , a period in which the American economy has recorded six recessions .
The “ dealer doldrums indicator , ” as we will call it , called five of them , missing the 1981 - 82 recession only because it was not persuaded that the 1980 downturn had ever ended .
It has never warned of a recession that did not occur .
The risk of using 12 - month figures is that by the time bad news is clear from new - car sales , it can be overwhelmingly obvious from other economic indicators .
But such long periods avoid the possibility of false readings because of the volatility of new - car sales .
The chart measures all sales by new - car dealers , which is how the retail sales statistics report the data .
So it includes their revenue from used - car sales , parts and service .
But it does not include sales by dealers who sell only used cars or repair garages that are not also car dealers .
Norris states that the " Dealers are hurting .
The rest of us may soon share their pain . "

I read yesterday in some of the financial news associated with Ford 's slowdown / shutdown of production that part of the overall effort was to reduce dealers in addition to production .
To me this indicates the dealer overhead and selling velocity required to keep a dealership making an economic profit ( stress economic and not accounting ) is anticipated to be a larger percent of the population .
While this is causal observation and not hard regression , it does support the sales downturn perspective outlined in your post as an indicator to negative GNP growth .

This is an Electric Monkey Pants Intergalactic News Network special report !
Porn - star Ron Jeremy has confessed to masterminding the attacks of September 11 , 2001 along with his long - lost brother Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
“ We did it , ” Ron Jeremy wrote in his confession , calling the mysterious collapse of the towers “ the money shot . ”
Also confessing was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( or “ KSM ” as he is known to lazy Americans ) .
KSM had long eluded capture by the Americans by disguising himself as a grizzly bear .
Later it was revealed that it was n’t a disguise ; he is just really , really hairy .
He twice escaped captivity by pretending to be a dog with rabies , but was recaptured while picking nits and lice out of his fur .
Calling themselves the Hairy Brothers of Destruction , Mr. Jeremy and KSM confessed to a long list of crimes against humanity .
Authorities also seized a hard drive containing details of several assassination plots ( including attempts to kill the Pope , Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter ’s gardener ) , and hundreds of gigs of midget porn , bestiality porn , and pictures of Ron Jeremy rubbing KSM with sandpaper in what appears to be an attempt at hair removal .
The deranged duo admitted to being tortured by federal agents , and hinted at Abu Ghraib - style torture involving being stacked in a pile of naked men and being led around on a leash .
They also indicated that they kind of liked it .
While enjoying a breakfast of bacon and eggs the confessed masterminds of 9/11 assured their interrogators that they were devout Muslims and that their confession was not coerced : “ Karl Rove did n’t call me and ask for a confession in exchange for 30 Brazilian hookers .
Nothing like that happened , at all ” Mr. Jeremy assured his captors , who then fed the revelations to several unquestioning , servile reporters , including this one .
KSM supplied a type - written note that listed all of the crimes the duo is responsible for masterminding .
The list includes :
the bombing of U.S. Cole
the decapitation of Daniel Pearl
the planting of explosives that brought down WTC 7
farting in the interrogation room — twice
the bombing of a nightclub in Bali , Indonesia
jump - starting Paris Hilton ’s career
the Democrats ’ strong showing in the November elections
happy - slapping
Abu - Ghraib ( specifically : getting the Americans caught )
Hurricane Katrina
eye - boogers
killing Anna Nicole Smith
causing President Bush to appear stupid and clueless on TV
the Hindenburg disaster
pimples
the estate tax
the illusion of global warming ( to scare hippies )
the Oklahoma City bombing
Watergate
killing Jesus Christ ( and Old Yeller )
Ron Jeremy supplied an identical list , but he crossed out “ Paris Hilton ” and wrote “ virneeral dizees ” , then crossed that out and wrote “ VD . ”
The above information was provided to reporters on the condition that we not mention Alberto Gonzales , the word “ impeachment ” or the many inconsistencies in the official 9/11 story for 3 weeks .
Naturally , we agreed because we just repeat whatever they say anyway .
[ ed. : wait ... were we supposed to repeat that last part ?... i'd better call karl .
hold till then ]
This has been an Electric Monkey Pants Intergalactic News Network ( EMPINN ) special report !
What 's a Surface ?
What 's a Manifold ?
Before we can even begin discussing what a nonorientable surface is , we must understand what a surface is .
This is not as trivial as it may seem .
A surface is actually a two - dimensional manifold .
So what�s a manifold ?
Basically , a manifold is a shape .
When we think of shapes we normally think about circles or squares or triangles , but we want our definition of a shape to be more broad .
After all , almost anything you can imagine has a shape , even though that shape may not have a specific name .
Shapes may also have different dimensions .
For example , a square has two dimensions , height and width , and a cube has three dimensions , height , width , and depth , but clearly both are shapes .
Thus a one - dimensional manifold ( or one - manifold ) is just a one - dimensional shape or a curve .
A two - dimensional manifold ( or two - manifold ) is just a two dimensional shape or a surface .
Now the following question may have popped up in your head : � Wait a minute !
A circle is a curve .
But I need two dimensions to draw a circle , so how can a circle be a one - manifold ? �
This is a very good question indeed .
However , when I say that a manifold is one - dimensional , I only mean that each tiny section of the manifold looks like a line .
Mathematicians would say that a one - manifold has the local topology of a line .
Likewise , a two - manifold has the local topology of a plane .
A three - manifold has the local topology of three - dimensional space .
This may still seem a little confusing but the following example may help :
Let�s say that the earth was completely smooth ( no mountains , hills , craters , buildings , etc. ) .
In other words , consider the earth as a perfect sphere .
Now imagine yourself walking on the earth .
How do you know it is a sphere ?
You know the earth is a sphere because scientists have proved by numerous experiments that it is a sphere .
However , from where you are standing the earth probably looks mighty flat .
In other words , locally the earth is flat .
This is what we mean when we say that a sphere ( remember that a sphere is only a surface , it is not a solid ball ) or any other two - manifold has the local topology of a plane .
Non-Orientable Surfaces
From now on , since we know what manifolds are , when convenient we will refer to surfaces as two - manifolds .
So let 's go on to a more important question for this course : � What does non-orientable mean ? �
Well , here is an answer : � A non-orientable manifold has a path which brings a traveler back to his starting point mirror - reversed .�
Huh ?
Before we discuss what that actually means , let �s talk about some orientable surfaces .
Consider the sphere .
Clearly this surface has no mirror - reversing effect because nobody on earth has ever returned mirror - reversed after a long journey .
( A mirror - reversed person would seem to have changed handedness and would see all of our writing backwards ) .
So presumably a sphere is orientable .
The sphere also has some nice properties .
You can walk in any direction on the sphere and you will end up where you started .
This also means that you cannot fall off of the sphere ( this is especially convenient for those of us who live on the earth ) .
When a surface or any manifold has these properties , we say that the manifold has no boundary .
But is n�t the sphere itself a boundary for the space it encloses ?
Remember that when we talk about two - manifolds we are only considering the surface itself .
For all we know , the space that a sphere encloses does not even exist .
Imagine that you are a two - dimensional being living in the surface of the sphere .
( Those of you who have read Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott should have no trouble visualizing this . )
You have no conception of the three - space that might exist outside of your world .
Your entire world simply looks like one infinite plane .
Therefore , a two - dimensional being living in the surface of the sphere would truly believe that his world had no boundary , even though it has a finite area .
Let�s now consider another orientable surface , the torus .
We usually think of a doughnut in association with a torus , but the following picture is also a torus :
We call this a flat torus for obvious reasons .
Although it does not look like a torus , it contains the instructions for building a torus .
Notice that if we glue the sides with corresponding arrows together , we will end up with a doughnut shape .
If we keep in mind that when you go off each side of the flat torus you return at the same spot on the opposite side , the flat torus will have the same properties as the folded torus .
In other words , the flat torus has the same topology as the folded torus .
For our purposes , it will be much easier to consider the flat torus than the folded torus , so from now on when we say �torus� , we mean �flat torus� .
Like the sphere , the torus has no boundary .
When we go off an edge , we return on the opposite side , so it is impossible to leave the surface .
What would we have if we changed the torus so that you could not go off the top or the bottom of the surface ?
Well , now we glue only the left and right sides together so we get a cylinder .
Since we are blocked off if we try to go off the top or the bottom , the cylinder does have a boundary .
In fact it has two boundaries , one for the top and one for the bottom .
This distinction will become important in a moment .
Here 's a model of a folded torus you can play around with , so you can get an idea of an orientable surface .
Use your mouse to rotate the object .
But now let�s change our torus diagram to look like this :
Notice that now the left and right sides of this surface are connected with a twist .
If I leave the box towards the top of the left edge , I will return towards the bottom of the right edge .
Furthermore , I will be mirror - reversed .
Although I am facing the same way I was before ( I am still facing the left edge ) , the hand that was formerly my left hand is now my right hand and vice versa .
Thus we have found our first nonorientable surface !
( Remember , when we talk of travelling in a surface , we 're talking about travelling inside the surface , not on top of it .
Imagine it as an infinitely flat animal travelling on a sphere ; essentially , she 's travelling in the surface .
In contrast , when we walk on a sphere , we 're walking on it ; unlike our flat friend , we can imagine moving up and down perpendicular to the ground . )
The surface we have just discovered is called a Moebius strip .
And the best thing about a Mobius strip is that we can actually build it .
( We will soon see that most nonorientable surfaces cannot be built in three - space ) .
It �s easy to build .
Just take a strip of paper and attach the ends with a single twist .
You should end up with something like the following picture :
Try rotating the picture with your mouse to get different views .
The Moebius strip ( also sometimes called a Mobius band ) has a boundary just like the cylinder , but it only has one boundary , not two .
If you trace along the edge of the Mobius strip you just built , you will cover the entire boundary , eventually returning to the place where you started .
Now that we have discovered one nonorientable surface we can create many more .
In fact , any surface ( or any manifold at all ) which has a Moebius band in its structure is nonorientable .
The following example may help convince you .
Here are the instructions for our next surface :
This surface is similar to the Moebius strip except that now the top and bottom are glued together as they were in the torus .
Likewise , we could also think of this surface as a torus with a Moebius strip in it .
However , if you try to build this surface you will find that it is impossible .
As it turns out , you cannot build this surface in three - space without having it intersect itself .
If we lived in the fourth dimension , we could build it .
This new surface is called a Klein bottle .
Although the Klein bottle cannot be built in three - space , we can project it into three - space from four - space using computers .
In fact , as long as we are content to have it intersect itself , we can even make three - dimensional models of those projections .
Here are two different projections of the Klein bottle generated by computers :
This is the usual projection of the Klein bottle .
( Like above , you can move this with your mouse . )
This is the " Figure 8 " projection of the Klein bottle .
( Like above , you an move this with your mouse . )
The Klein bottle has a mirror reversing effect just like the Moebius strip , but it also has the nice property of having no boundary so you can go off what looks to be the edge in the diagram without ever really coming to the edge .
We will consider one last nonorientable surface before moving onto three - manifolds .
The surface is called the real projective plane ( or just projective plane ) and it can be constructed in a variety of ways .
One way to think about it is to take the flat Klein bottle diagram and connect the top and bottom edges with a twist in addition to the left and right edges :
Another way to model the projective plane is to start with a hemisphere and connect each point on the rim to its corresponding point on the opposite side with a twist .
Here is a picture of what we mean by this :
Like the Klein bottle , the projective plane has no boundary and cannot be built in three - space without self - intersection .
Here are a few computer images of projective planes embedded in three - space .
You can click on the picture to learn some more about each projection from the Geometry Center :
The Crosscap The Roman Surface Boy's Surface
And Beyond : 3 - Manifolds
Up till now , we have only considered two - manifolds , but naturally there are nonorientable three - manifolds also .
However , it will be easier to consider an orientable three - manifold first .
When we first considered the torus , we used a rectangle to represent the space of our manifold .
Mathematicians would call the rectangle a fundamental domain for that space .
Likewise , we will use a cube as a fundamental domain when we consider most of the three - manifolds .
Consider a solid cube .
( It is important to stress that the cube is solid or that we are talking about the space inside of the cube and not just the cubical surface ) .
The cube itself is a three - manifold with a boundary on all sides .
However , it is a pretty boring space .
What if we connected the right wall to the left wall ?
Then when you walked through the right wall , you would return to the cube through the left wall .
Better yet , you could play catch with yourself .
Just throw a ball towards the right wall , turn around , and catch it as it comes through the left wall .
We could also connect the front wall to the back wall and the top wall to the bottom wall .
This new manifold is called a three - torus .
The three - torus has no boundary and therefore if you lived in a three - torus it would seem to be an infinite space .
In theory our universe could be a three - torus .
If this were the case , if you looked out in any direction far enough you would see yourself ( ignoring the fact that light travels at a finite speed ) .
Of course , we cannot build a three - torus in three - space , just as we can�t build a regular folded torus in the plane .
More generally , a manifold without boundary , which is not infinite , cannot be built in the same dimension that its local topology consists of .
What if we wanted to create a nonorientable three - manifold ?
How would we do it ?
In two dimensions we connected the edges of a rectangle with a flip .
We can do the same in three dimensions .
In fact there are two ways to cause a mirror reversing effect .
We could connect opposite faces of the cube with a side - to - side flip or an upside - down flip .
Let �s say we connected the front and back walls of our cube with a side - to - side flip .
Now , when you walked out the right side of the back wall , you would return on the left side of the front wall .
You would also be mirror - reversed .
What if we connected the front and back walls with an upside - down flip ?
Then , if you left the back wall standing on the floor , you would return through the front wall hanging from the ceiling ( this , of course , ignores gravity ) .
Again , you would also return mirror - reversed .
Naturally we could connect each pair of opposite walls with a flip of either sort making for an extremely confusing space to live in .
As an exercise , imagine connecting the walls of the cube in various ways , and then determine how you would return after leaving the cube through one of the faces .
Now you may be wondering what would happen if we connected a pair of opposite walls with both a side - to - side flip and an upside - down flip .
The interesting thing is that you would not return mirror - reversed at all .
This is because if you get mirror - reversed twice you will return to normal .
However , you will have made a 180 degree turn ( you will be upside down , but your right hand will still be on your right side ) .
Thus far we have only discussed connecting the opposite sides of our fundamental domains , but there is no reason that we could not connect the front wall of our cube to the right wall .
As you can see , this would open up numerous other possibilities for the shapes of manifolds .
There is in fact such a thing as projective three - space that has similar properties to the projective plane .
What Would It Be Like to Live On A . . . ?
In the intoduction and later in Chapter 6 , we presented fanciful stories about what it would be like to live in or on a non-orientable manifold .
But , as they say , a picture is worth a thousand words .
Here are three pictures describing what it would be like for a two - dimensional flat animal to live on ( remember , that means within the surface ) the three non-orientable surfaces we described above .
First , a two dimensional creature living in a Moebius strip .
Notice how the colors switch position when the creature gets flipped .
Next , the same two dimensional creature living on a Klein bottle .
This time , the colors get flipped only if the creature goes off to the sides ; it just comes around without flipping if it goes off the top or the bottom .
Finally , a slightly different example .
This ball is on a real projective plane .
The changing colors symbolize a switch in orientation .
Watch how the ball changes orientation regardless of which edge it goes off .
If you 're confused by these , imagine how confusing it would be if you were the crab or ball !
Devastating effects of a drug which left six healthy young men in intensive care during a disastrous drug trial in London , UK , have been replicated in a test tube .
The preliminary results were presented in London today and form part of an official 600 - page scientific report into the horrific trial in March 2006 , at Northwick Park Hospital in London ( see One drug trial , six men , disaster ) .
“ As far as we can determine , such an incident was entirely unprecedented in the history of clinical trials , ” said Gordon Duff of the University of Sheffield , UK , who chairs the expert scientific group which produced the report .
The six trial volunteers suffered multiple organ failure which almost killed them , after receiving injections of the drug TGN1412 , a monoclonal antibody designed to calm the immune system .
The drug was being trialled as a potential treatment for leukaemia , multiple sclerosis and arthritis .

Cytokine storm
Instead , their immune systems went into overdrive , attacking the men ’s internal organs .
Their bodies were flooded with signalling molecules called cytokines which mobilise the immune system and trigger widespread inflammation .
Amid this “ cytokine storm ” , white blood cells that normally tackle infections began multiplying rapidly and attacking the men ’s organs instead .
All were saved following transfer to the hospital ’s intensive care unit .
Since then , researchers have been at a loss to explain how the antibody – manufactured by the now - defunct company TeGenero of Germany – caused such devastating effects in people despite showing no obvious adverse effects when tested beforehand in monkeys and mice .
Tethered effect
The new results presented today suggest that to send immune cells berserk , the antibody has to be tethered to a “ surface ” in the body rather than be free - floating .
The team was only able to replicate the excessive cytokine response in the lab that the patients had experienced by effectively sticking the antibodies to a surface .
In all previous lab tests with the antibody – including those done prior to the trial by TeGenero – the antibody encountered immune cells in solution , which fails to produce the dramatic effect .
“ We ’ve developed an approach which mimics what was seen in the patients , ” says Stephen Inglis , director of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar , London , and head of the team which recreated the cytokine storm in a test tube .
“ Effectively , we immobilise the antibody in a particular way , and that ’s the trick that stimulates the immune response , ” says Inglis .
“ This business of immobilising it is mimicking something in the body , ” he added .
“ The effect was to cause the human immune cells , particularly CD4 cells , to release large amounts of cytokines and to begin to divide dramatically , ” says Inglis .
The result suggests that for the antibody to exert its effect , some form of tethering probably happens in the human body too , perhaps on the surfaces of blood vessels or organs .
Further tests are underway to find out more about what TGN1412 binds to , and where in the body .
Unique response
Crucially , the same tethering trick did not work when human cells were replaced with macaque monkey cells , suggesting that the response is unique to humans and explaining why no ill effects were seen in monkeys receiving the antibody .
“ We saw no ill effects at all , and nothing that could mirror what was seen in humans , ” says Inglis .
“ The implications are that we need to be careful interpreting [ apparently reassuring ] toxicological data from primates , ” he says .
Inglis said that if the test had been available prior to the disaster , it may have “ rung alarm bells ” if used with TGN1412 .
But he stressed that the test resulted from a huge effort to reproduce the effects seen in the patients , with resources not available to TeGenero .
“ It ’s taken a team of 20 scientists working on this for six months , and a hundred experiments , ” says Inglis .
He says that if the test is validated , it might be useful for screening other antibodies and therapies designed to have major effects on the immune system .
And the novelty of the reaction could improve our understanding of our uniquely human immune response mechanism .
The Duff report made 22 recommendations for measures to avoid similar disasters in the future as new and more potent “ biological ” therapies come forward for testing .
They include setting up databases – some available only to regulatory agencies – where companies and academic researchers could share clinical and pre-clinical data on new biological medicines , raising the alarm if they see adverse effects .
“ We think they should be shared worldwide , at least between regulators , ” says Duff .
In trials themselves , the expert panel recommends that doses should be given slowly and to only one volunteer initially , to check for adverse effects before any other volunteers receive it .
Clinicians involved in a trial should have some expertise on how the drug should work , and make preparations in advance for what might go wrong , they say .
The report also argues for creation of specialist , accredited centres where such trials should go ahead , with antidotes and intensive care readily available .
Your master password Site name Generated password
What is this ?
I hate passwords .
I mean , I do n't mind having really important ones be made - up and memorized but what about all those e-commerce and community sites that want me to create accounts ?
I end up using the same password at all of them and then I feel stupid knowing that one SQL Server exploit or disgruntled admin could cost me my whole identity .
So , this is a little Javascript program that will concatenate two fields and MD5 them .
The idea is that you choose one master password to secure all your others , and then generate passwords for each site , server , router , &c. by putting a completely obvious name for that resource in the " Site name " field .
Then just hit return and copy your new password so you can paste it into whatever site you 're registering at .
It 'll be different for every site , and undiscoverable by anyone who does n't know your master password  but you can always retrieve it by simply using this form again .
( Note that all this is done by your browser running the program that 's in the source of this page ; nothing is passed back to my server .
You can make your own local copy of this page , use it off - line , &c. )
You should be using this more recent version which uses SHA - 1 instead of MD5 and base64 instead of hex .
Here 's a bookmarklet version , which is pretty neat and works now on both http and https sites .
Zsolt Molnár has made a Google Gadget version .
Political humour is rarely a boxful of chuckles .
It largely consists of clever - clever point - scoring , weary cynicism , and lolly stick gags about the size of Prescott 's arse .
There 's surprisingly little anger , considering the piss poor state of the world - and when rage or passion does appear , it 's often elbowed all the jokes out of the way .
Mostly though , political satire seems to be stuck in a strange , woozy rut : half - heartedly sniping at the powers that be with an underpowered peashooter , breaking off every 10 minutes for a fag break and a shrug .
Three cheers then , for 24 co-creator Joel Surnow , who 's recently given birth to The Half Hour News Hour ( Fox News , Sky Channel 510 ) , a topical comedy show which manages to be angry , opinionated , and genuinely political all at once .
In fact , there are only two things wrong with it .
1 ) It 's dementedly right - wing .
2 ) Radiation sickness is funnier .
A lot of people think right - wingers are n't capable of being amusing at all .
Not true .
Mussolini looked hilarious swinging from that lamppost .
And besides , hardcore lefties are n't a barrel of laughs either .
They 're a crushing , life - depleting bore .
People who stand firmly to one side of the political spectrum tend by their very nature to be stiff , crotchety sorts with a persecution complex and an axe to grind .
These are not prime credentials for clown school .
For my money , the best satire floats somewhere in the centre - not in a non-committal sense , but a tactical one : positioned between the two sides , you 're capable of lashing out in either direction .
The first one to say something ridiculous gets a slap .
It 's the rational option .
Genuine satire ultimately consists of the outraged application of cold rationality to whoever deserves it the most .
The Half Hour News
Hour is n't rational .
It 's intended as a riposte to Comedy Central 's The Daily Show ( Mon - Fri , 8.30 pm , More4 ) , the show that made stars of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert .
The Daily Show is n't perfect .
Understandably , for a programme airing four times per week , it 's often hit and miss .
When it misses , it 's cringeworthy ; but when it hits , it 's laugh out loud funny .
It attacks both Republicans and Democrats , but leans more heavily on Republicans because , hey , they 're the ones in power .
This makes sense comedically : there are more jokes to be had in lampooning the governing party since their actions carry more weight .
And besides , it 's hard to generate giggles by attacking the underdog .
If Hilary Clinton were in charge , she'd be pilloried nightly .
But she is n't .
Bush is .
Rational viewers understand this .
Eye - swivelling nutrags do n't .
They believe the Daily Show is a far left propaganda tool .
Hence the advent of the Half Hour News Hour , which Fox claims offers " balance " by adopting an enraged conservative stance .
The end result , if the first episode is anything to go by , is a bizarre , unnatural beast : a topical comedy show that ignores the present government completely and concentrates its fury on environmentalists , civil rights campaigners , Barack Obama and Cindy Sheehan .
The set piece was a shockingly dismal skit starring right - wing talk radio hog Rush Limbaugh and joyless crypto fascist commentator Ann Coulter , who wandered on screen looking so haunted and drawn I briefly mistook her for a ghost and kicked my television from its stand in a blind panic .
Spewing all that negative hate speech must 've hollowed out her spirit , poor thing ; her eyes are now a portal to a world of infinite nihilistic oblivion - gaze into them too long and you can feel the air growing cold around you .
To be fair , there were one or two decent gags , but they felt like aberrations thrown up by the law of averages .
There is one thing to be said in the show 's favour : at least it HAS an agenda , which is unusual in modern comedy .
But an agenda is all it has .
It 's government - approved satire - as oxymoronic , pointless and wretched as church - sanctioned porn .
But probably easier to masturbate to , assuming you get off on abject desperation .
Everybody knows that Windows Live Search , Microsoft 's little search engine that could , lags far behind Google and Yahoo ! in the race to capture eyeballs .
Here 's one place where the software juggernaut 's offering leads the pack : referrals for sites that actively try to infect end users ' machines with some of the vilest malware known to man .
To see for yourself , type " veicolo commerciale noleggio " into Live.com and watch what gets returned .
The first result ( at the time of writing , anyway ) is for a site at b9n3q3.info/ yb6u46p76.html , which uses a Javascript to redirect users to another site .
This second site actively tries to install several varieties of malware , in some cases the nasty Trojan known as Rustock .
This return is just one of many malicious referrals Live.com makes when entering the above search term , which is Italian for " commercial vehicle rental . "
According to researchers at Sunbelt - Software , Live.com 's affair with malicious sites runs so torrid that malware - related returns on the search engine number in the thousands .
Terms that trigger similar results tend to be Italian phrases , including , to name a few , " adsl offerta toscana , " " istituto geografico italiano , " " dvd da scaricare " and " testi reggae . "
Sunbelt blogged here about the sludge fest two weeks ago , but Live.com has continued to spew the noxious results unabated .
Google and Yahoo long ago managed to filter most of the same sites from their returns .
" I do n't think it was very responsible to keep these malware sites up for so long , " says Francesco Benedini , a spyware researcher at Sunbelt .
" I 'm not saying Google and Yahoo ! do n't have a problem , but it 's much more invasive on Live.com . "
A Microsoft representative says in a statement that " to the extent that spammers are successful in essentially manipulating results , they will hurt the user experience on all search engines " .
That left us scratching our heads for a couple reasons .
For one , the same search terms do n't appear to generate malicious returns on Google or Yahoo ! , so how can the rep claim this is an industry - wide problem ?
And for another , what does spam have to do with this ?
We 're wondering if our inquiry got mixed up with someone else's .
Some of the crud being returned on Live.com is sneakier than others .
Many returned links , for instance one at www.lassi.com.es, do n't attempt to infect PCs using a US - based IP address .
Machines with IP addresses from Italy and possibly elsewhere are not so fortunate .
This is n't the first time Microsoft 's net properties have dished up unsavory offerings .
Last month the company admitted its Windows Live Messenger client displayed banner ads promoting an application blacklisted as a security risk .
Shortly after Microsoft made the admission , MSN Groups was caught displaying ads for a separate piece of software widely regarded as rogue . ®

Angry / negative people can be bad for your brain »
Animals love exercise ... why do n't we ?
Want to be a little smarter ?
Have a better memory ?
Stay mentally sharp ?
Improve higher brain function ?
Run .
Those who exercise have a mental advantage over those who do n't .
" ... exercisers showed significant improvements in the higher mental processes of memory and in " executive functions " that involve planning , organization , and the ability to mentally juggle different intellectual tasks at the same time .
" What we found so fascinating was that exercise had its beneficial effect in specific areas of cognitive function that are rooted in the frontal and prefrontal regions of the brain . "
The brain - boosting ( and prevention of brain decline ) effects of physical exercise have been studied nearly to death .
The confusing part is why so many humans do not exercise .
And this is where we can learn from our pets .
Take a healthy dog and put it in a confined area ( house , kennel , etc. ) .
Then take him out to a park or trail , and remove the leash .
What happens ?
Take a horse out of a stall or small paddock and turn him loose in a larger enclosure ( what we call " turning out " ) .
What happens ?
The photos on this page are an example of what my horses do every single day .
Take a human out of his work cubicle or off the couch and turn him loose outside .
What happens ?
Hmmm ... for far too many of us , nothing happens .
Or we turn around and walk right back in the door and head for the couch or the chair in front of our computer .
The one thing that usually does not happen is the kind of physical exuberance -- the sheer joy of being able to run and jump -- that so many other animals do .
Where did we lose that overpowering desire to run and jump ?
Obviously my lifestyle is quite different from my dog and my horses .
But of all the differences , two come to mind first :
1 ) Dogs do n't do television
2 ) Horses do n't run for cardio health , weight loss , brain fitness , blood pressure , or anything else but the love of moving .
I 'm not sure how to regain that .
I run several times a week , but not because it feels good to DO it , but because it feels good to HAVE DONE it .
It 's the post - run experience I 'm looking for , where I can stop for that double latte on the way home with less guilt , and where I have more energy for the rest of the day .
It 's for later that night , when I always sleep a little better on the days I run .
And of course it 's never too late
" If you think it 's too late to get started with a fitness routine , a 1999 study by Kramer and associates found that even previously sedentary people over age 60 could improve their mental processing abilities with exercise .
People who took part in the study walked rapidly for 45 minutes three days a week .
They significantly improved mental - processing abilities that decline with age , and particularly tasks that rely heavily on the frontal lobes of the brain . "
I 'm sure you 've realized that this entire post was just a barely - plausible excuse to show off some pictures of my horses , but that does n't mean it 's not valid .
Every day when I take my dog for a walk or play with the horses , I watch them tear around and think , " Why do I have to force myself to do what they do because they love it ? "
I did post a few tips last year in my fitness hacks for geeks post , but I 've added one more gadget to my personal toolkit -- the Garmin Forerunner 201 .
I absolutely love it ( although I wish it could store your altitude changes ; it 's great for pace and distance , but while it will display your current altitude , it does n't save it as part of your run / walk history ) .
One of these days , remind me to tell you all about how cool and special Icelandic horses are .
OK , if you insist ... Iceland has no natural predators for horses , so they 're far less afraid than virtually every other breed ( this is the same bloodline the Vikings brought to Iceland 1,000 years ago , and no horse has ever been allowed into Iceland since then ) .
This lets them use their brains for thinking , so they 're shockingly smart and fascinating to be with .
It was Tim O'Reilly who got me into these marvelous creatures ; he and his family live on a hill overlooking an Icelandic farm , and over time they found themselves falling in love with these horses and getting several of their own .
He introduced me to his horses , and it was love at first sight .
I spent the entire year after that learning about them and searching for one of my own .
They 're also the most comfortable horses to ride -- they have a special gait called a " tolt " that you could ride carrying a full glass of wine and not spill a drop .
The two in the photos are Andi and Kara , brother and sister , who remind me every day that I should get off my ass and run and leap and cause trouble .

I use it on my road bike going through the mountains all the time and it allows you to push your limits of courses you have already done by comparing them to each other .
So you will really kow if you did that stretch faster or slower than last time .

Kathy ,
Thank you for reminding me of how important this is .
My husband and I have lost 40 and 30 pounds respectively over the past year and you 've inspired me to write about the transformation and the importance of exercise .
It has changed our life .
If someone told you that there was a magic pill you could take that would prolong your life , prevent cancer , prevent diabetes , prevent stroke and heart attack , prevent depression , and prevent osteoperosis you would take it .
The side effects are profuse sweat about 30 minutes a day and infrequent growling of the stomach you would rush out to buy the pill .
It is n't a pill .
I 've just described exercise and healthy eating .
Kathy , you again show me why you are one of the best .
Thank you for this post !

Kids obviously love moving too .
The question is , what causes this to disappear in most people from childhood to adulthood ?

Top of the food chain complacency .
Ponder how a lion would react when released from confined spaces .
I can't picture it running around for fun .
And by becoming complacent , we open the door for others who are fitter , think faster , etc. to win before we can leave the couch .
Just as the lions lost out to a bunch of monkeys from the trees ...

Kathy ,
Thank you for a great post .
I think you gave the answer in your prior post and in the pictures -- exercise is more fun when we do it with other people .
You have two horses that can run with each other , kids play with each other , being face - to - face activates us in ways that being alone can't and the couple in the comment above probably exercise together .
So get with a friend , a spouse , like - minded people , join a comfortable gym or hire a personal trainer .
Regards ,
Mark Wilson

Dignity .
Adults are not allowed to move for no reason .
Exercise must have a goal , a distance or be a sport .
If an adult just runs wild in a circle or skips across the yard , unless they 're playing with a child , they will be admonished and possibly committed to the looney bin .
Even with a child , your behavior will be commented on .
Try it , run erratically down the street , you 'll be stopped and questioned , possibly arrested .
Jog or run in athletic gear with an apparent goal , no problem .
But to just run free .
To simply move for the sake of moving , without mindfulness , without purpose , society will act to stop you .
Being constrained makes movement work , would we move more if we could do it for no reason other than we felt like it ?

Excellent post !
It is indeed true that our physical fitness has a big impact on our brain ( after all , just one more part of our body ) .
I 've also observed when I turned vegetarian ( ovo- lacto , moving toward vegan ) that my level of energy increased significantly and it was like my brain had been fitted with brand new glasses , increasing thought clarity .
Very cool .

And it 's not just running .
Small variations in routine help too .
Do things a little differently : change your work environment , cycle to work instead of driving , or if you already cycle , try a different route , etc .

Why do we not move for the love of moving ?
While all the reasons given above ( dignity , obsessed with other things , etc. ) have a role to play , I think the more fundamental reason is that it's hard for us to move in a way that our mind - body loves .
We can get ourselves to move -- to walk around , to jog or run -- but there 's walking and there 's walking and there 's running and there 's running : the horses ' bodies are still built for running , or bodies have become adapted muscularly and otherwise to sitting .
For various reasons ( esp. sitting in chairs & not doing the right kinds of exercise - - or any as we grow older ) , our muscles and posture get " off " ( to be technical ) , making movement not fluid or fun to our mind - body .
The flow of movement is n't just mental but has certain physical prereqs to be fully enjoyed , because otherwise tight this and loose that hinder the flow of our movement , making it less enjoyable ( though this all goes largely unnoticed ) .
When some people see a hill , their mind - body sees the aches and pains -- or at least dreadful difficulty -- in getting up it , and so we have to force ourselves to go up it .
But once you unlearn some of those body habits and build up other body habits , your legs beg you to sprint when you see a hill in the park so much that if you can't because you 're too busy you want to cry .
And that is beautiful .
How to get there ?
I have n't found a single system that incorporates everything necessary .
Some ways I 've found of getting there :
1. Yoga 2 . Crossfit 3 . Intu-flow ( rmax.tv ) 4 .
http://kinestheticventures.com/tense_necks.pdf
5 . barefoot shoes ( have n't found good ones , maybe VIVO barefoot ) -- as your posture and muscles start from your feet and ( virtually all at least ) shoes mess up the interaction of our muscles and posture .

As a runner for more than 30 years , I agree that exercise is required to keep the mind fresh and body going .
The best program I have found so far is the FIRST Plan , a three day running routine , with two days recommended for cross training .
This provides a good balance for the overall physical conditioning .
That also leaves two days during the week to rest and keep up reading to add mind food like the good stuff here and elsewhere on the web .
BTW : FIRST comes out of the Furman Institute for Running and Sports Training and has been written up in Runner 's World a couple of times .
You can also find additional details on how I have been using it on my blog .

The main problem I see is that in the modern life style , the media encourages us to become passive watcher of sports related activities instead of actively participating them .
They spend millions of minutes of airtimes to show super bowl or a great movies about baseball instead of encouraging us to take part in them actively .

After years of expensive memberships at local gyms and painful hours of gerbil - like routines on the treadmill , I have found that the best way to get in shape , loose weight and become healthy was to quit my full - time job in marketing and become a horse logger in BC , Canada for the winter .
I lost over 13 lbs and gained huge muscle mass .
I highly recommend this for anyone interested in becoming healthy both physically and mentally .
Not to mention , you will have a whole new outlook on trees :)
Great pictures Kathy !

Kathy ,
What 's this about your Forerunner 201 not storing elevation data ?
Are you sure ???
My 301 ( mentioned back in your fitness hacks for geeks post ) sure does , and I thought the only difference was that the 301 has a heart rate monitor .
I think that may be a Mac limitation ? :-(
By the way , if you have n't already , you should DEFINITELY check out motionbased .com for storing your captured GPS data .
It 's very cool ( though it may not work well with Safari ... I know their super - cool map - player thingy only works in IE ) .
Check it out :
http://davewood.motionbased.com
( click on any of the activity names to see the elevation profile )
By the way ... it 's time for an upgrade .
Anyone who likes to ride ( cycling , that is ) , should check this thing out .
I gotta have one of these ! :-)

Turn off television : agreed ( and sometimes , turn off Internet too ;-) ) .
Run : not .
If you can , swim .
Otherwise , get an elliptical trainer , and use it .

When a set of slow , relaxed posture transitions can make the heart beat like a short , fevered run for a soon - to - be- missed , it makes you appreciate that physical excursion does n’t have to be un-enjoyable .
I find tai - chi to be a great way of re-learning how to experience movements , and begin to learn to enjoy them .
Of course the most effective form of exercise is the one which you discovered , enjoy and are good at .
Experimentation is somewhat costly and likely to fail for most mindsets , hence most people do n’t try .
Even when you know that the movement will be enjoyable when you are in the flow , it often is n’t at the beginning ( or the day after ) .
When the mind is in flow time is perceived to speed up , if this is the case then memory of the flow - time would be becoming less detailed than the long , aching stretches necessary to start , or the pain of stiff muscles after .
Perhaps horses have shorter memories ...

A lot of creatures are naturally sedentary .
Others are not .
Humans seem to be quite sedentary , with some of them being very sedentary ( these are the super - obese folks who are naturally diabetic ) .
Pigs are like this too : the only excercise they really want is somehow tied to getting food .
Some pigs have evolved to live through famine , and are like the diabetic - prone humans .
This makes sense , when you considered how humans evolved .
Europeans are very good at conserving energy , which reflects evolving to live well during an ice age .
Asking people to live like horses is quite silly , and wo n't work .
You like to run , so you do it .
Hamsters like to run in their wheel , so they do it .
Other humans like to eat a lot of calorie rich food and be lazy , so they do it ( as long as they can afford to ) .
Posted by : anonymouse | Apr 16 , 2006 9:13:35 AM
To some extent , humans do seek out exercise naturally .
I agree with Kathy about running - while I enjoy the feeling I get after a run , I do battle my own laziness where it comes to starting a run ( or finishing a run ) .
But my other main source of exercise - surfing - is something I do very naturally .
It 's actually the only thing I just sort of do .
If I have a few spare hours with nothing scheduled , I grab my board and go , regardless of conditions .
Motivation is rarely required ( and even then it's to get over fear , not laziness ) .
I do have to admit that for me , surfing * usually * is n't as rigorous as distance running ( though on a good day my arms may be drained from paddling ) , but it 's still exercise without motivational issues .
Posted by : Geoff B | Apr 16 , 2006 11:39:50 AM
It seems to me that Geoff 's point is the key -- it 's all about doing things that you enjoy doing anyway .
If you have to " make " yourself exercise , it will be very hard to stick with it .
But if you love playing ultimate frisbee or basketball or cycling or whatever , you 're going to do it because it 's FUN ... you 'll end in shape as a nice side effect of doing something you love .
That 's the way to go .
Posted by : Dave Wood | Apr 16 , 2006 4:51:53 PM
Honestly , most people do n't exercise because they 've forgotten _how_ .
Imagine how much time is spent sitting at your desk , reading , writing , talking in conversation .
Our jobs do n't call upon our physical skills , therefore they 're forgotten .
So what happens when someone finally realizes that their health is in decline and they need to get in shape ?
They join a gym .
And they become that " clueless " average Joe that does a couple of bench presses , and then does a couple leg extensions and then leaves 20 minutes later because he did n't have a clue where to begin .
A definitive plan is the only way to stay fit , and that is why I 'm developing RunFatBoy ( http://www.runfatboy.net ) .

I have a 4 years girl .
And I can not stop looking at her and wondering : where all my energy has gone ?
In the moment she is out the door , she is already running or jumping or climbing on something .
And she is loving it .
In the evening , when my only wish left is go to sleep , she is playing or running , or trying to deceive me not to put her pijamas on , and she is so full of joy and happy in every moment , and I look at her and wonder : one day I used to be the same , when exactly had I changed ?
More imporatant , what exactly had changed me ?

Everything you wrote about not exercising goes double at work .
Most workplaces treat employees ' bodies only as a means of carrying their heads from one meeting to the next .
This in spite of the fact that " A nine - month study of 80 executives found that those who worked out regularly improved their fitness by 22 % and demonstrated a 70 % improvement in their ability to make complex decisions as compared with non-exercisers . " ( article : http://www.fastcompany.com/feature/confidence.html).
It 's not hard to change work from 100 % sedentary to containing at least some physical movement , and it makes a big difference , which may also spill over into people 's private lives .
Posted by : Alexander Kjerulf | Apr 17 , 2006 2:20:26 AM
I think too many people do n't exercise because they see it as hard work .
They come to conclusion they need to lose weight , and so they force themselve to , say , go running and hate every minute of it .
I used to run , and hated it , so I started swimming and love every minute of it .
You can't keep me out of the pool ( I make excuses to get out of things so I can get to the pool ) while when it came to running any excuse was enough to put me off .
If you find a sport that you love and are " passionate " about you will stick at it no problem .
I think swimming is a good example because its such a technical thing - there is always something about your stroke that you can improve no matter how good you are , so you get those rewarding " I rule " moments from time to time ( along with the " I suck " periods when you realise you really have to change something you have been doing wrong for years ) !

My 13 year old daughter has autism , and so she basically does n't have the social emotions that restrict most people .
She just does n't care if she " fits in " or not .
She will happily run around giggling whenever she 's in an open space .
Sometimes this will seem appropriate like a park , and sometimes not , like the mall .
A stranger 's reaction to seeing a mostly full grown person act this way is usually one of three things : they smile , perhaps even a little enviously ( " I wish I could be so carefree " ) ; they scowl and look annoyed ( " Why does n't somebody do something about that wild kid ? " ) ; they try and pretend like its not happening .
Teenagers sometimes have a fourth reaction -- they mock her to their friends ( " Did you see that freaky kid run by ? " )
I think it is that development of those social instincts in puberty that govern this .
Little kids run around willy nilly , but teenagers only do it in limited situations , and adults basically never really let go , they require a structure to make it OK .
I think this is one of the reasons that owning a pet is so useful , it gives you a structure within which you can be as carefree without having to actually regress yourself .

Computer scientists from Texas A&M University and the University of California , Berkeley , have installed a robot in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge to help natural scientists from Cornell University 's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission find the rare ivory - billed woodpecker .
The computer scientists — Dr. Dezhen Song , assistant professor in Texas A& M 's Department of Computer Science , and Dr. Kenneth Y. Goldberg , professor in UC Berkeley 's departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences , and Industrial Engineering and Operations Research — developed the robot , Automated Collaborative Observatory for Natural Environments ( ACONE ) , to scan the skies near Brinkley , Ark. , for birds .
" If the system can catch any kind of bird , that 's a success for us , " Song said .
" But if it catches an ivory - bill , that 's a bonus . "
With a grant from the National Science Foundation , Song and Goldberg programmed ACONE to distinguish birds from other objects and only record the birds with its two digital cameras , Arecont Vision 's AV3100s .
" It 's a fast , flying object , " Song said .
" And also , the shape of the object — the shape of the bird — is n't regular .
It 's deformable , and from the lighting conditions , it 's very difficult to capture . "
The robot stores images of the birds it has recorded in the hard disks of its computer , Logic Supply Inc. 's S - 625 F .
The computer as well as the cameras are housed in weatherproof cases .
" If you put a normal computer out there , it would n't function very long because of the humidity and the rain , " Song said .
The hard disks are removed routinely from the computer by birdwatcher M. David Luneau , associate professor in the University of Arkansas at Little Rock 's Department of Engineering Technology .
Luneau enlists fellow birdwatchers to scrutinize the images stored in the hard disks for a shot of the ivory - billed woodpecker .
In addition to Luneau , the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. , Arkansas Game and Fish Commission , Audubon Arkansas , Nature Conservancy in Arkansas , U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Woodruff Electric Cooperative Corp. have volunteered to help Song and Goldberg install , maintain and power ACONE .
" You want to have these people help you , " Song said .
" Otherwise , you have a big problem . "
Song and Goldberg took interest in the search for the ivory - billed woodpecker after Goldberg read an article about the search in The New York Times .
Goldberg contacted the co-leaders of the search from Cornell 's Laboratory of Ornithology to volunteer systems he and Song were developing through their project , Collaborative Observatories for Natural Environments ( CONE ) .
" Cornell 's ornithology lab and Arkansas Game and Fish are crucial members of this team , " Goldberg said .
" They 've been leading the search in Cache River and have a deep understanding of the bird and this environment . "
Scott Henderson , director of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission , said he looks forward to continued cooperation among groups studying the ivory - billed woodpecker .
" It 's exciting for this agency to be involved in cutting - edge technology as we continue to research and understand what can be done to improve the habitat for this bird , " he said .
" We 're pleased to be working alongside our partners in this ambitious venture . "
CONE purposes to help natural scientists observe animals — whether birds or mammals — in the animals ' habitats .
Song and Goldberg have developed robots to webcast images of animals from the animals ' habitats to natural scientists ' computers .
In addition to the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge , they 've installed one of their robots in the Richardson Bay Audubon Sanctuary in California .
Song and Goldberg have considered sites in Alaska and Rwanda to observe polar bears and gorillas , respectively .
" Our goal is to use the emerging capabilities of computers and networks to better understand the natural world , " Goldberg said .
" It 's very exciting to work with researchers in fields beyond engineering . "
The ivory - billed woodpecker seemed to have disappeared sometime in the 1930s or 1940s .
In 2004 , it was reportedly spotted in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge .

Nanotechnology and the Pentagon 's 21st century military visions
( Nanowerk News ) Last Wednesday , a new report came out from the U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) , dryly titled " Defense Science Board 2006 Summer Study on 21st Century Strategic Technology Vectors " .
In what appears to be an even accelerating drive towards " game - changing technology " , the U.S. military is looking at the most leading edge technology R&D in universities and laboratories around the world , even some that have n't progressed beyond a vision yet , in order to identify enablers of superior surveillance and weapons technologies .
The goal of the study was to determine the operational military capabilities to support the national security objectives of the United States in the 21st century .
Based on this , the study then identified the science and technology requirements that will support those capabilities and compared it to current science and technology planning as well as transitioning those technologies to a capability .
In other words , the Defense Science Board , with a very mission - driven approach , tried to identify promising emerging technologies , such as nanotechnologies , and then recommended not only how to best exploit these technologies for military use , but how to accelerate the move from lab to battlefield .
The United States Defense Science Board , abbreviated as DSB , is a committee of civilian experts appointed to advise the Department of Defense on Scientific and Technical matters .
In their report , they specifically recommends ways that DoD can :
1 ) reestablish a tighter integration between DoD 's user and technology communities ,
2 ) enrich its capacity to recognize and exploit technology opportunities ,
3 ) establish robust processes to insert new capabilities into ongoing operations to meet an expected long term need , and
4 ) cut in half the time it normally takes to field major systems .
The report urges the Pentagon that it must keep abreast of the most rapidly changing and emerging technologies : " Synergistic combinations of these [ bio- , info - , nanotechnology ] could produce truly revolutionary capabilities in human performance enhancement , medical treatment and prophylaxis , miniaturization , life extension , robotics , and machine intelligence . "
It highlights the use of nanotechnology in R&D programs for clandestine tagging , tracking , and locating : " Nanotechnology , in particular , offers potential for devices that can endure for very long periods of time in close proximity to targets of interest and that can be delivered by clandestine means . "
And further : " A combination of nanotechnology , biology , and chemistry promises to provide significant increases in capability to conduct pervasive surveillance on a global basis . "
The report provides an example of what it terms the " bio - nano - info opportunity space . "
The rectangles indicate the individual technology area with an example military capability that might be developed using that particular technology .
The ovals represent capabilities that derive from the synergy of two or three of these high - rate - of - change technologies :
Examples in the Bio- , Nano- , Info Nexus ( Defense Science Board )
The report also encourages more speculative capabilities ; " more speculative domains such as ... devices in the micro and nano domains , molecular - scaled taggants , and micro delivery platforms , deserve investment . "
In the port city of Yokohama , south of Tokyo , there is a museum devoted entirely to noodle soup .
It may be Japan 's favourite foodie day out : one and a half million ramen fans visit the museum every year , and even on the wintry morning that I went the queue wound 50 yards down the street - young couples , mainly : cold , hungry and excited .
Inside the Yokohama Ramen Museum and Amusement Park they meet exhibitions on the evolution of soup bowls and instant noodle packets - more fascinating than you 'd think , but these are not the main event .
That 's deep in the basement , where there 's an entire street , done up to look like a raucous 1950s Yokohama harbour - front .
Every shop houses a different noodle restaurant , each a clone of one of the best noodle shops of Japan .
It 's a culinary Madame Tussauds .
The Japanese are sentimental about their noodle soup - it's the working - class food that nourished the nation in the bleak days after World War Two .
Ramen chefs are TV celebs , in a country that devotes more broadcast time to cookery than even we do .
I asked the young pilgrims just what they valued above all in ramen .
They sniffed the tangy air , Bisto - kid style : ' The basis of the experience is the broth , ' was the consensus .
In the great Japanese cod-Western Tampopo - the only movie to take noodle soup , sex and death with equal seriousness - a ramen guru announces that the key to Japan 's national dish is that ' the soup must animate the noodles ' .
What does chiefly animate Japanese soups and broths is an amino acid called glutamate .
In the best ramen shops it 's made naturally from boiling dried kombu seaweed ; it can also come from dried shrimp or bonito flakes , or from fermented soy .
More cheaply and easily , you get it from a tin , where it is stabilised with ordinary salt and is thus monosodium glutamate .
This last fact is of little interest to the Japanese - like most Asians , they have no fear of MSG .
And there lies one of the world 's great food scare conundrums .
If MSG is bad for you - as Jeffrey Steingarten , the great American Vogue food writer once put it - why does n't everyone in China have a headache ?
To begin to answer this we must go back to Japan a century ago .
Professor Kidunae Ikeda comes home from the physics faculty at the Tokyo Imperial University and sits down to eat a broth of vegetables and tofu prepared by his wife .
It is - as usual - delicious .
The professor , a mild , bespectacled biochemistry specialist , turns to Mrs Ikeda and asks - as spouses occasionally will - what is the secret of her wonderful soup .
Mrs Ikeda points to the strips of dried seaweed she keeps in the store cupboard .
This is kombu , a heavy kelp .
Soak it in hot water and you get the essence of dashi , the stock base of the tangy broths and consommés the Japanese love .
This is the professor 's ' Eureka ! ' moment .
Mrs Ikeda 's kombu is to lead him to a discovery that will make his fortune and change the nature of 20th - century food .
In time , it would bring about the world 's longest - lasting food scare , and as a result , kick - start the age of the rebel consumer .
It was an important piece of seaweed .
Professor Ikeda was one of many scientists at the turn of the century working on the biochemical mechanics which inform our perception of the world .
By 1901 they had drawn a map of the tongue , showing , crudely , the whereabouts of the different nerve endings that identify the four accepted primary tastes , sweet , sour , bitter and salty .
But Ikeda thought this matrix missed something .
' There is , ' he said , 'a taste which is common to asparagus , tomatoes , cheese and meat but which is not one of the four well - known tastes . '
He decided to call the fifth taste ' umami ' - a common Japanese word that is usually translated as ' savoury ' - or , with more magic , as ' deliciousness ' .
By isolating umami , Ikeda - who had picked up some liberal notions while studying in Germany - hoped he might be able to improve the standard of living of Japan 's rural poor .
And so he and his researchers began their quest to isolate deliciousness .
By 1909 the work on kombu was complete .
Ikeda made his great announcement in the august pages of the Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo .
He had isolated , he wrote , a chemical with the molecular formula C5H9NO4 .
This and the substance 's other properties were exactly the same as those of glutamic acid , an amino acid produced by the human body and present in many foodstuffs .
When the protein containing glutamic acid is broken down - by cooking , fermentation or ripening - it becomes glutamate .
' This study , ' concluded Professor Ikeda in triumph , 'has discovered two facts : one is that the broth of seaweed contains glutamate and the other that glutamate causes the taste sensation " umami " . '
The next step was to stabilise the chemical .
This was easy : mixing it with ordinary salt and water made monosodium glutamate - a white crystal soluble in water and easy to store .
By the time he published his paper , the professor had , wisely , already patented MSG .
He began to market it as a table condiment called Aji - no - moto ( ' essence of taste ' ) that same year .
It was an instant success , and when Kidunae Ikeda died in 1936 he was a rich man : he remains , as every Japanese schoolchild knows , one of Japan 's 10 greatest inventors .
The food chemicals giant Ajinomoto Corp , now owned by General Foods , pumps out a third of the 1.5 million tons of monosodium glutamate we eat every year - from India to Indonesia ' Ajinomoto ' means MSG .
Ikeda 's original paper muses a little about MSG and why it should excite the taste buds so , without arriving at any convincing conclusion .
Much more work has been done since .
We now know that glutamate is present in almost every food stuff , and that the protein is so vital to our functioning that our own bodies produce 40 grams of it a day .
Probably the most significant discovery in explaining human interest in umami is that human milk contains large amounts of glutamate ( at about 10 times the levels present in cow 's milk ) .
Babies have very basic taste buds : it 's believed that mother 's milk offers two taste enhancements - sugar ( as lactose ) and umami ( as glutamate ) in the hope that one or other will get the little blighters drinking .
Which means mothers ' milk and a packet of cheese 'n'onion crisps have rather more in common than you 'd think .
When you next grate parmesan cheese onto some dull spaghetti , what you will have done in essence is add a shed - load of glutamate to stimulate your tongue 's umami receptors , thus sending a message to the brain which signals ( as one neuro - researcher puts it ) ' Joy and happiness ! '
Supper is rescued - and your system has added some protein and fats to a meal that was all carbohydrate .
Ripe cheese is full of glutamate , as are tomatoes .
Parmesan , with 1200 mg per 100 grams , is the substance with more free glutamate in it than any other natural foodstuff on the planet .
Almost all foods have some naturally occurring glutamate in them but the ones with most are obvious : ripe tomatoes , cured meats , dried mushrooms , soy sauce , Bovril and of course Worcester sauce , nam pla ( with 950 mg per 100g ) and the other fermented fish sauces of Asia .
Your mate , Marmite , with 1750 mg per 100g , has more glutamate in it than any other manufactured product on the planet - except a jar of Gourmet Powder straight from the Ajinomoto MSG factory .
On the label , Marmite calls it ' yeast extract ' .
Nowhere in all their literature does the word ' glutamate ' appear .
I asked Unilever why they were so shy about their spread's key ingredient , and their PR told me that it was because it was ' naturally occurring ... the glutamate occurs naturally in the yeast ' .
As they put monosodium glutamate into production , Professor Ikeda and his commercial partners found that making stable glutamate from the traditional seaweed and salt was unnecessary .
They developed a much simpler and cheaper process using fermented molasses or wheat - eventually manufacturers realised that almost any protein can be broken down to produce it .
The product took off , immediately , and within a few years Ajinomoto ( which was now the company 's name ) was selling MSG across Asia .
The breakthrough to America came in the aftermath of World War Two .
Like pizza and vermouth , MSG was a taste American soldiers brought home with them .
They were n't aware that MSG was what they 'd liked in Japan - but the US Army catering staff noticed that their men enjoyed the leftover ration packs of the demobilised Japanese Army much more than they did their own , and began to ask why .
MSG arrived in America at a key moment .
Mass production of processed food was booming .
But canning , freezing and pre-cooking have a grave technical problem in common - loss of flavour .
And MSG was a cheap and simple additive that made everything taste better .
It went into tinned soups , salad dressings , processed meats , carbohydrate - based snacks , ice cream , bread , canned tuna , chewing gum , baby food and soft drinks .
As the industry progressed , it was used in frozen , chilled and dehydrated ready meals .
MSG is crucial in no - fat or low - fat food , where natural flavour is lost with the extraction of oils .
It 's now found in cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , and dietary supplements .
Ajinomoto Corp started manufacturing in the States in 1956 and in 1962 allied itself with Kellogg's .
MSG sells in the States in supermarkets , under the brand Ac'cent .
In Britain you will have to visit a Chinese supermarket for a supply of pure Gourmet Powder , but MSG plays a role - often in secret - in products on almost every shelf of the supermarket .
But MSG 's conquest of the planet hit a major bump in April 1968 , when , in the New England Journal of Medicine , a Dr Ho Man Kwok wrote a chatty article , not specifically about MSG , whose knock - on effects were to panic the food industry .
' I have experienced a strange syndrome whenever I have eaten out in a Chinese restaurant , especially one that served northern Chinese food .
The syndrome , which usually begins 15 to 20 minutes after I have eaten the first dish , lasts for about two hours , without hangover effect .
The most prominent symptoms are numbness at the back of the neck , gradually radiating to both arms and the back , general weakness and palpitations ...'
And so was born Chinese restaurant syndrome ( CRS ) and a medico - academic industry dedicated to the researching and publicising of the dangers of MSG - the foreign migrant contaminating American kitchens .
Shortly after Dr Ho came Dr John Olney at Washington University , who in 1969 injected and force - fed newborn mice with huge doses of up to four grams / kg bodyweight of MSG .
He reported that they suffered brain lesions and claimed that the MSG found in just one bowl of tinned soup would do the same to the brain of a two - year - old .
Other scientists were testing MSG and finding no evidence of harm - in one 1970 study 11 humans ate up to 147 grams of the stuff every day for six weeks without any adverse reactions .
At the University of Western Sydney the researchers concluded , tersely : ' Chinese restaurant syndrome is an anecdote applied to a variety of postprandial illnesses ; rigorous and realistic scientific evidence linking the syndrome to MSG could not be found . '
Science has still not found a convincing explanation for CRS : indeed , some researchers suggest it may well be to do with the other things diners have imbibed there - peanuts , shellfish , large amounts of lager .
Others say that fear of MSG is a form of mass psychosis - you suffer the symptoms you 've been told to worry about .
The fact is that , since the eighties , mainstream science has got bored of MSG .
Some research continues ; in 2002 , for example , New Scientist got very excited over a report that MSG might damage your eyesight , after Japanese scientists announced that they had produced retinal thinning in baby rats fed with MSG .
It turned out they were putting 20 grams of MSG in every 100g of rat food - an amazing amount , given that , in the UK , we adults consume about four grams of it each a week .
( One project took people who were convinced their asthma was caused by MSG and fed them up to six grams of it a day , without ill - effects ) .
However , at no time has any official body , governmental or academic , ever found it necessary to warn humans against consuming MSG .
But popular opinion has travelled - spectacularly - in the opposite direction to science .
By the early eighties , fuelled by books like Russell Blaylock 's Excitotoxins - The Taste That Kills , MSG 's name was utter mud .
Google MSG today , and you 'll find it blamed for causing asthma attacks , migraines , hypertension and heart disease , dehydration , chest pains , depression , attention deficit disorder , anaphylactic shock , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases and a host of diverse allergies .
Thus since 1968 the processed food industry has had its own nasty headache as a result of MSG .
Hundreds of processed products would have to be withdrawn if amino - acid based flavour - enhancers could not be used .
They would become , simply , tasteless .
By the 1980s a third of all Americans believed it was actively harmful .
Crisp - buying teenagers thought MSG made them stupid and spotty .
Mothers read that MSG could put holes in their children 's brains .
So the food industry employed its usual tactic in the face of consumer criticism : MSG was buried by giving it new names .
The industry came up with a fabulous range of euphemisms for monosodium glutamate - the most cheeky of all is ' natural flavourings ' ( however , the industry did remove MSG from high - end baby foods ) .
Nowadays the industry 's PR beats a big drum .
' Natural , Tasty , Safe ' is the slogan .
' Many people believe that monosodium glutamate is made from chemicals .
Monosodium glutamate is a chemical in the same way that the water we drink and the oxygen we breathe are chemicals , ' explains an MSG website .
MSG manufacturers are now pushing it as actively useful for health - a way to eat less salt - and they have pursued the celebrity route too .
Heston Blumenthal , of the Fat Duck in Bray , is among the eminent chefs the industry has enlisted for promotion of the umami principle at conferences across the world - although he uses traditional sources like kombu .
It 's not surprising that the MSG - makers are so busy on their product 's image , because MSG - phobia still shows no signs of subsiding .
This despite the fact that every concerned public body that ever investigated it has given it a clean bill of health , including the EU , the United Nations food agencies ( which in 1988 put MSG on the list of ' safest food additives ' ) , and the British , Japanese and Australian governments .
In fact , every government across the world that has a food licensing and testing system gives MSG - 'at normal levels in the diet ' - the thumbs - up .
The US Food and Drug Administration has three times , in 1958 , 1991 and 1998 , reviewed the evidence , tested the chemical and pronounced it ' genuinely recognised as safe .
However , there remains a body of respected nutritionists who are sure MSG causes problems - especially in children .
And parents listen .
Most doctors who offer guides to parents qualify their warnings about MSG - it may cause problems , it has been anecdotally linked with disorders .
But public figures like the best - selling nutrition guru Patrick Holford are powerful advocates against MSG .
He 's sure the science shows that MSG causes migraines and he is convinced of the dangers of the substance to children , particularly in the child - grabber snacks like Monster Munch and Cheesy Wotsits .
' I'm a practitioner and there 's no doubt that kids with behavioural problems react to MSG , ' he says .
' I 've given them the foods , and seen the different reactions .
Glutamate is a brain stimulant in the way that it is given , because it enhances sensory perception in the sense that things taste much better - and some kids become very hyperactive . '
Holford admits that he has not measured this hyperactivity , or tested MSG by itself on children - his statements are based on anecdotal comparison of the effects of plain crisps versus flavoured ones .
But there is some justice in his complaint that in all the acres of research on MSG , ' most is directed at the possible physiological effects , not the behavioural ones ' .
Eric Taylor , professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King 's College in London , is among the leading British experts on food additives and children 's behaviour .
He was a pioneer of ' elimination tests ' that examined food additives and their effect on children - establishing , for one , that the colouring tartrazine did contribute to hyperactivity .
Yet he does not think MSG is a culprit and he has never tested it .
Why ?
' There are so many substances , and there 's not much funding .
And , with MSG , there 's no reasonable physiological theorem to justify the research . '
The only investigation he has seen on children 's brains and MSG , conducted in the seventies , suggested that the substance might improve reading ability .
Patrick Holford , like many of MSG 's foes , also talks of its possible addictive properties and he cannot explain why ' natural ' glutamate , say in cheese or parma ham , should be any less addictive , or harmful , than glutamate that 's been industrially produced and stabilised with salt .
The anti-additive movement ( check out the excellent and informative www.truthinlabeling.org) admits that ' natural ' and ' industrially produced ' glutamate are chemically the same , and treated by the body similarly .
So why does n't anyone ever complain of a headache or hyperactivity after a four cheese and tomato pizza ( where there 's easily as much glutamate as in an MSG - enhanced chicken chow mein ) ?
Their answer is that the industrial fermentation process introduces contaminants .
This is possible , of course , but it ignores the fact that whole swaths of the planet - including East Asia , where I live - do not have any problem with MSG .
Here in Thailand , the phong chu rot sits on the table with the fish sauce and the chilli powder where you would have the salt and pepper .
MSG has had one unarguable effect on us - and it is a benign one .
It has made consumers look at the small print .
In turn this kick - started the organic food movement and other , more militant consumer power groups .
1968 was a good year for rebels , and the dawn of MSG - phobia coincides with the beginning of a great shift in middle - class consumers ' thinking - a withdrawal of our faith in the vast corporations that fed and medicated us .
After 1968 we began to question them and their motives .
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace came next .
It is now 37 years since Dr Ho Man Kwok named Chinese restaurant syndrome , and it's plain that the case against MSG remains unproven .
So either you conclude , as some will , that government , science and the mega - corporates of the food industry really are all in league with each other to poison us for profit .
Or , like me , you make a different decision .
Now , I have little faith in the food industry and I 'm as suspicious of food additives as the next person - I spend many hours fighting the grim battle to keep them from my children 's mouths .
But until new evidence emerges I am going to give MSG a conditional discharge .
But would I have it in the kitchen ?
Well , I did .
I bought a little bag of Ajinomoto from the corner shop on our Bangkok street and tried it , a gram ( the tip of a teaspoon ) at a time .
By itself it tasted of almost nothing .
So I beat up and fried two eggs , and tried one with MSG , one without .
The MSG one had more egg flavour , and did n't need any salting .
I tried the crystals on my son's leftover pieces of chicken breast ( definitely more chickeny ) .
I tried it in a peanut butter sandwich ( nothing ) .
On Weetabix with milk ( interesting , sort of malty ) and on Weetabix with milk and sugar ( thought I was going to be sick ) .
My friend Nic came round .
He told me about a Japanese restaurant he'd been to that gave him headaches and a ' weird tingling in the cheeks ' - until he told them to stop with the MSG .
Then he was fine , he said .
I nodded and I served him two tomato and chive salads ; both were made using the very same ingredients but I told him one plate of tomatoes was ' organic ' , the other ' factory - farmed ' .
The organic tomatoes were far better , we agreed .
These , of course , were the tomatoes doused with mono sodium glutamate .
Then we ate mascarpone , parma ham and tomato pizza .
Nic felt fine .
So did I .
I had ingested , I reckoned , a good six grams of MSG over the day , and probably the same again in free glutamate from the food - the equivalent of eating two 250g jars of Marmite .
I 've thrown the Ajinomoto out now .
It works , but it was embarrassing - a bit like having a packet of Bisto in the cupboard .
There is no need to have MSG in the kitchen .
If I want extra glutamate in my food I 'll use parmesan , or tomato purée , or soy sauce .
Or like Mrs Ikeda , boil up some kelp .
So you think you do n't eat MSG ?
Think again ...
Some of the names MSG goes under
monopotassium glutamate
glutavene

glutamic acid
autolyzed yeast extract
calcium caseinate

A plan has been released to raise the intercarrier compensation by a large group of state government and telecom providers .
This will increase the fees of your phonebill by $ 3.50 per month per phone , and even up to $ 10 in four years .
The Intercarrier compensation is for carriers who pass calls from one netwrok to another carriers netwrok .
The problem now is that with the increase in VoIP and cell phone calls the current system needs to be reformed , since these calls do n’t have that charge .
Bad news is that the Missoula Plan ( Missoula , AZ is where this was first discussed ) consists of increasing the subscriber line charge on all US phone bills .
Fortunately there is some resistance to this plan :
“ NARUC has not taken a position on the substance of the Missoula Plan , ” said the joint statement .
“ While the undersigned organizations and entities may not agree on every aspect of intercarrier compensation reform , they oppose the Missoula Plan .
The undersigned parties agree that the Missoula Plan does not serve the interests of consumers because it does not adequately address , and in many cases would exacerbate , problems with the current intercarrier compensation and universal service systems – e.g. , uneconomic regulatory distinctions and incentives for inefficiency .
The wide diversity of stakeholders listed below demonstrates that , as filed , the Missoula Plan is not the appropriate vehicle for reforming the intercarrier compensation system and should not serve as the framework for future discussions .
We look forward to the opportunity to participate in the FCC process to develop a plan that results in pro-competitive , pro-consumer intercarrier compensation reform . ”

The government 's measures were tougher than expected
That will mean the UK will achieve almost double its targets under the Kyoto Protocol , and bring it closer to its self - imposed target of a 20 % cut in CO2 by 2010 .
The surprise announcement comes the day after the French and German governments announced comparatively lax targets .
Based on last year 's figures , the Germans will cut emissions by just 0.6 % .
The UK Environment Minister David Miliband said he had already spoken to the European Commission to make sure that EU neighbours imposed the strictest possible cuts .
Tony Blair has taken flak recently for failing to match his international rhetoric on climate change with tough emissions cuts in the UK .
He is also concerned that the Conservative leader David Cameron has taken a clear lead in the polls on green issues .
Today 's announcement is expected to regain some of the government 's credibility on domestic climate policy .
Energy Review
The brunt of the emissions cuts will fall on electricity generators .
They are shielded from international competition .
Exporting industries will be allowed to emit as much carbon as they need .
The green group WWF called the policy a missed opportunity to put CO2 emissions back on track for the government 's promised 20 % cut .
The new policy will bring CO2 down by 16.2 % by 2010 .
Ministers said more measures would be announced in the forthcoming Energy Review .
Today 's announcement is expected by the government to increase electricity prices by 0.5 % for domestic users ( much less than the fluctuations following recent oil prices ) and 1.0 % for industry .
The business lobby group Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) said it risked Britain 's competitiveness .
But in this negotiation they appear to have been trumped by a group of business leaders brought together by Prince Charles .
They told the Prime Minister that tough carbon cuts would create jobs in a new low - carbon economy .
Greener than expected
A few months ago ministers said they would cut carbon at a level between three and eight million tonnes .
Today they announced that they have settled at the greenest end of that range - eight million tonnes .
It is not quite as big as it sounds because of recent changes in the sums .
But it is still bigger than most observers expected .
The cut was welcomed by the chairman of Shell UK , James Smith , one of the business leaders who went to meet Mr Blair .
The Conservatives broadly welcomed the policy , but the Liberal Democrats said it did not go far enough .
The government also announced the formation of a new low - carbon technology fund .
Mr Miliband said it would include new money .
Under the new business - emissions cap , power firms will have to bid at auction for 7 % of their emissions credits .
This could raise £ 150 million at current levels , but Mr Miliband would not promise it would swell the fund - this decision would be made by the Chancellor .
The UK 's technology investment is very low compared with its European neighbours .
National Security Adviser was Woodward 's source , attorneys say Larisa Alexandrovna and Jason Leopold Print This | Email This National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley was the senior administration official who told Washington Post Assistant Managing Editor Bob Woodward that Valerie Plame Wilson was a CIA officer , attorneys close to the investigation and intelligence officials tell RAW STORY .
Testifying under oath Monday to Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald , Woodward recounted a casual conversation he had with Hadley , these sources say .
Hadley did not return a call seeking comment .
Woodward said he was told that it was “ no big deal ” that former Ambassador Joseph Wilson was sent to Niger to investigate the veracity of the Bush Administration ’s claims that Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger .
According to the attorneys , he said Hadley dismissed the trip by saying his wife , a CIA officer who worked on WMD issues , had recommended him .

At the time , Hadley was working under then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice .
“ We think that Mr. Woodward was going to write a story about it , but discussed it with some other people within the Bush Administration and was told that it was n’t anything big , ” one attorney told RAW STORY .
Woodward did not return a call for this article .
He did not identify his source in an article in today ’s Washington Post , instead dubbing him a “ senior administration official . ”
The veteran Pulitzer Prize - winning reporter made his name investigating the Watergate burglary which eventually led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon .
Woodward got access to classified information
In his book , Plan of Attack , Woodward says he was given access to classified minutes of National Security Council meetings .
Both Rice and Hadley were major players in these meetings .
President Bush sat for lengthy interviews for his book , often speaking about classified information , Woodward later said .
The Post editor added that he was surprised by Bush ’s frankness .
" Certainly Richard Nixon would not have allowed reporters to question him like that , ” he said .
“ Bush 's father would n't allow it .
Clinton would n't allow it . ”
Hadley served as Deputy National Security Advisor during the first term of the Bush presidency under then - National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice .
Former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , who is now under indictment in Fitzgerald ’s case for obstruction of justice and perjury , along with Rice and Hadley , were members of the National Security Council and of the White House Iraq Group , which was tasked with selling the war in Iraq to the public .
In March 2003 , the White House Iraq Group began doing a work - up on Joseph Wilson .
Hadley was present at some of these meetings .
Hadley has previously drawn fire for a meeting in September 2002 with the head of Italian intelligence Nicollo Pollari , who was implicated in pushing bogus claims that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger .
Hadley denies they discussed uranium .
“ Nobody participating in that meeting or asked about that meeting has any recollection of a discussion of natural uranium , or any recollection of any documents being passed , ” he told reporters earlier this month .
Pollari had been trying to provide the CIA with evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program , citing the now debunked documents .
The CIA had previously rebuffed his claims , asserting they were unfounded .
Prior to the Iraq Niger claims , a strange meeting in late 2001 whose purpose is unknown links a former Iran Contra figure and Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar with Michael Ledeen , then an alleged consultant to the Under - Secretary of Defense , Douglas Feith .
Feith informs Hadley ( Hadley later claims that Ghorbanifar was not involved ) .
CIA director George Tenet later intervenes , and Hadley asks Ledeen to end the meetings .
The agency believed Ghorbanifar was a serial liar and barred its officers from engaging him ; the meetings continue regardless .
Timeline of events On Jan. 28 , 2003 , Bush claimed that Iraq had attempted to purchase uranium from Africa in his State of the Union address .
It is the very claim that Hadley had seen from Pollari and the very claim that the CIA rejected .
Two days later , the Washington Post reports that Hadley is acting as liaison between the White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee in helping to “ sift through intelligence with the help of the CIA , and trying to determine what can be released without damaging the agency ’s ability to gather similar information . ”
In March 2003 , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) discredits these documents as forgeries .
It is also in March that the US begins combat operations in Iraq .
According to sources , Woodward ’s meeting with Hadley occurs in mid-June of 2003 , around the same time that Libby begins to meet with New York Times ’ Judith Miller , who has since left the paper .
In early July , Wilson writes his New York Times op - ed , entitled “ What I did not find in Niger . ” The White House responds on two fronts , according to an article published at the time in the Washington Post .
“ Behind the scenes , the White House responded with twin attacks : one on Wilson and the other on the CIA , which it wanted to take the blame for allowing the 16 words [ on uranium ] to have remained in Bush 's speech .
As part of this effort , then - national security adviser Stephen J. Hadley spoke with Tenet during the week about clearing up CIA responsibility for the 16 words , even though both knew the agency did not believe Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger , according to a person familiar with the conversation .
A former senior CIA official said yesterday that Tenet 's statement was drafted within the agency and was shown only to Hadley on July 10 to get White House input .
Only a few minor changes were accepted before it was released on July 11 , this former official said .
He took issue with a New York Times report last week that said Rove and Vice President Cheney 's chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , had a role in Tenet 's statement . ”
Several days later , columnist Robert Novak outs Valerie Plame as a CIA operative .
On July 22 , Hadley takes full responsibility for the Niger claims in the President ’s State of the Union , even though Tenet had already done so on July 11 .
The same day , Pat Roberts ( R- KS ) , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , calls Hadley to testify in closed door hearings .
“ The chairman of a key congressional committee says he will look closely at new evidence that aides in the White House mishandled communications from the CIA casting doubts on information used by President George Bush to support his case for military action in Iraq , ” Voice of America reported .
Roberts has yet to complete the second stage of his investigation into prewar intelligence .
Clarification : Due to an editing error , the first edition of this article was unclear about whether Woodward was told Plame was covert .
Woodward was only told she was a CIA analyst .

Go to Grad School !
It ’s around the time of year when undergraduates start thinking about graduate school , so naturally it ’s the time of year for overheated blog posts on why going to grad school is meant to be a Very Bad Idea .
The latest of these is from Dean Dad , who wants to Stop the Cycle of Abuse , i.e. stop people going to grad school .
The reasons given are all fairly standard factoids – it ’s a huge opportunity cost , it takes forever , and the job market is awful .
None of these are good reasons , and it would be an awful decision to not apply to graduate schools because of posts like these .
Now it is true that going to grad school does block you off from doing many other things with your 20s , such as being a professional athelete .
But for many people grad school days are some of the most enjoyable of their lives , so the fact they last a while is hardly a major cost .
And the job market is , at least for a lot of grad students , much better than the horror stories you ’ll find on blogs suggest .
Here , for instance , are the placement records for recent years of the philosophy departments at Princeton , Rutgers , NYU and MIT , four of the best East Coast philosophy programs .
Note that these are the complete records – they include everyone who graduated , not just those who got headline jobs .
The records are fairly excellent I ’d say .
It might be noted that the job market in philosophy has generally been thought to be fairly weak over time period reported , and is much stronger nowadays .
( There are more jobs advertised this year in philosophy I think than ever before . )
Yet even over the lean years , the median student entering one of those programs ended up with a tenure - track job at a good - to - excellent university .
And to a certain kind of person , there ’s hardly a better job that can be imagined .
The compulsory hours are fewer than any other job around ( except perhaps as an NFL referee ) .
And while you do have to spend time on research , presumably the people who go into these fields do so because they enjoy them .
Life as an academic does consist of a fair amount of teaching , committee meetings , grading and so on .
But it also consists in a rather ridiculous number of “ I ’m getting paid to do this ! ” moments , which more than make up for it .
The payoff from being successful in this market , in other words , is pretty high .
And that ’s without mentioning the job security .
Now you might wonder why any of this is relevant .
After all , most grad students do n’t get to go to Princeton , Rutgers , NYU or MIT .
The important point here is that no one ever has to decide to go to grad school as such .
The big decision is whether to go to a particular graduate school that has offered you a ( hopefully funded ) place .
In other words , when you have to make the crucial decision , you may well be in position of crucial information ( i.e. that you ’re at a school with an excellent placement record ) that suggests your career prospects are very good .
There is a flipside to this of course , and that ’s that by the time you ’re accepted , you might know that your only grad school option is to go somewhere with a very poor placement record .
( Or a very poor record of competent advising , or poor morale among students , or what have you . )
At that stage , it is a very good idea to reconsider how strongly you want to go to graduate school .
Going somewhere that you might well not enjoy , that might not lead to much of a career , is a real gamble .
Of course there are very few schools from where no one has had a successful career , so it ’s not like you have to give up if you do n’t get into a top school .
But you should go in with eyes wide open , or not go in at all .
If you ca n’t get the data from the schools you ’re considering about how they ’ve done at placement in recent years , that ’s a reason to be suspicious of the school .
( Eyes wide open and staring into the void is not good . )
And you ’d have to think very hard before going somewhere without tuition wavers , or adequate stipends .
But again , those are the kinds of decisions that should be made in the light of your specific possibilities , not in virtue of generic data about what humanities graduate school in general is like .
I also suspect the opportunity costs of graduate school are not as great as the Dean suggests .
It ’s true that you are n’t going to be putting much into your retirement fund or home equity while in graduate school .
But academia is one of the best industries to be in if you want to choose your own retirement date .
A few years of rather relaxed part - time teaching at the end of your career can easily make up for some lost income at the start .
Over the long run , grad school will often be financially a perfectly acceptable deal .
It ’s hard to imagine too many people for whom going to grad school is the income - maximising path ( though I know some such people ) , but it ’s just as hard to imagine people who choose it purely on the basis of financial considerations .
The important take away point is that there ’s no stage in the process where you ever have to worry about how your experience will be using the ‘ typical graduate student experience ’ as any guide .
At this stage all you have to do are fairly non-committing things like taking the GRE and writing applications .
When you really have to make a decision you ’ll have a lot of information about what your grad school experience will be like , and what your long term prospects would be , and generic stories about what grad school as such is like will be of very little relevance to your particular case .
Hopefully you ’ll be in a position to know that your odds are well , well above average .
( Assuming that , like the children of Lake Woebegon , the readers of CT are all above average ! )
Quanta , the company manufacturing the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project 's XO laptops , plans to begin selling low - cost budget mobile computers for $ 200 later this year .
According to Quanta president Michael Wang , the company plans to leverage the underlying technologies associated with OLPC 's XO laptop to produce laptop computers that are significantly less expensive than conventional laptops .
The OLPC project , which hopes to bring inexpensive Linux - based laptops to the education market in developing countries , selected Quanta ( the laptop manufacturing company that produces mobile computers for HP , Dell , and Acer ) to produce the individual XO laptop units .
OLPC project founder Nicholas Negroponte says that OLPC has no plans to make XO laptops , which are " designed for the poorest and most remote children in the world , " available to ordinary consumers in developed countries .
OLPC plans to sell the laptops in bulk to governments , which will then distribute the hardware to school children .
Quanta 's announcement will be welcomed by the throngs of technology enthusiasts in the US and elsewhere who have expressed interest in acquiring one of the OLPC 's budget - friendly laptops for personal use .
Quanta plans to create a new " emerging PC " business unit to focus on establishing a new global market for low - cost computers .
Although few details are available at this time regarding the software that Quanta will ship with its own XO - like laptops , it is known that the company intends to use open source software .
Since virtually every element of the OLPC platform ( including the unique user interface ) is available under various open source licenses , Quanta could easily ship its own computers with the exact same software used on the XO .
With luck , Quanta 's increased involvement in the low - cost mobile computing market will allow the company to further decrease manufacturing costs and help the OLPC project reduce the XO 's total cost per unit .
This move by Quanta could also help make modern technology more accessible to underprivileged families around the world .

Has the worm turned ?
That ’s the question a lot of folks are asking about Google these days , not the least of which is John Heilemann , whose piece has opened up a great discussion in the comments area of my post about it .
As we often do , John and I beat this question around a bit this morning , and an interesting comparison came about .
John , who wrote an excellent book on Microsoft called Pride Before the Fall , reminded me that while most peg Microsoft ’s fall from its glory days to the attenuating DOJ trial of the late 1990s , the company ’s true fall from grace came before that trial , when first the digerati , then the company ’s potential partners started losing trust in Microsoft .
Why ?
John pegs it to a seminal 1997 Wall Street Journal article about the company in which Nathan Myhrvold ( former MSFT CTO ) speaks of his company taking a “ vig ” on nearly every transaction across the Internet .
A year or so before that article , while managing editor of Wired , I met with Nathan .
He pitched me his vision of Microsoft enabling – and profiting from – all commerce on the web ( I wrote the meeting up for HotWired , but ca n’t find the damn link … ) .
In any case , I recall Nathan taking out his wallet and slapping it on the table , and confidently predicting that anything you did with a wallet , Microsoft would own online .
I was struck by the arrogance of such a claim , and the confidence with which he made it ….
I really believed that Microsoft was going to own ecommerce , and it both scared and fascinated me .
Turns out , I was not alone .
As we discussed the finer points of the AAP lawsuit , John noted that Google is coming close to a “ worm turning ” moment – a moment when the world realizes that the company is * too powerful * and its ambitions are * too great . *
When such a genie arrives , it is very , very hard to put back in the bottle .
The one all encompassing difference , of course , is that Google has real competition – Microsoft in 1997 did not – but regardless , the cultural vibe is striking in its similarity .
Remember in 1995 , when Microsoft was literally at the top of its game , lauded on the covers of national magazines for saving the US economy via its launch of Windows 95 ?
When Gates and Co. were heralded as ushering in a new era of digitized possibility ?
I sure do .
In seven short years , Google has gone from a geeky startup with one good idea into an agenda - shaping player responsible for navigating complex relationships with world governments , the personal privacy of millions , major trade organizations , and hundreds of thousands of businesses small and large .
It ’s an extraordinary weight to bear , it seems to me .
It ’s the kind of position that requires a balanced mixture of leadership , will , and diplomacy .
There ’s very little room for the go - it - alone mentality which got the company to where it stands today .
Can the company shift its culture and avoid the fate which ultimately hobbled Microsoft ?
That , more than anything else , will define the next chapter in the company ’s fascinating story .
Yesterday Nightline featured a story about former AT&T technician and whistleblower Mark Klein .
While working at AT&T headquarters in San Francisco , Klein discovered ( and had the courage to speak out about ) a secret eavesdropping room that all of the company 's traffic was routed through .
With the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Mr. Klein went public back in April 2006 , but alleges John Negroponte and Michael Hayden pressured the LA Times to kill the story .

Should we really worry about our government spying on us ?
President Bush 's hand - selected secret " White House privacy board " assures us this week that everything is fine and dandy .
Nothing to worry about .
Case closed .
A White House privacy board is giving its stamp of approval to two of the Bush administration 's surveillance programs - electronic eavesdropping and financial tracking - and says they do not violate citizens ' civil liberties .
Democrats newly in charge of Congress quickly criticized the findings , which they said were questionable given some of the board members ' close ties with the Bush administration .
" Their current findings and any additional conclusions they reach will be taken with a grain of salt until they become fully independent , " said Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Miss. , who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee .
It 's nice to have responsible , liberty - protecting Democratic committee chairmen .
The rubber stamp Republicans would have rolled over and played dead after this White House stamp of approval .
Senator Leahy will surely need a tad more verification .
Longtime NSA insider Russell
Tice came forward in January 2006 about illegal spying as well .

I 've struggled a bit with the latest addition to this ' simple steps ' typography series .
Mostly because it's not so simple and it's a bit more of a grey area than the previous three articles .
Typographic hierarchy , put simply , is how different faces , weights and sizes of typefaces structure a document .
Some of these hierarchical devices are well - established conventions , such as cross heads and folios , so I 'm not going to touch on them in this post .
To keep it simple I 'm going to concentrate on two things - size and weight .
The first of which is size .
First off a bit of history .
Early typographers created their manuscripts by using one font , one size , one colour mostly , interspersed with hand painted illuminations .
The products of such typographers has a flat quality to the information , almost mesmeric .
Take a look at some early manuscripts and the typefaces themselves , especially the older Black letter styles , appear similar - m's look like u's , y's look like p's and so on .
As beautiful these manuscripts are , other than the illuminations , they are devoid of structure within the content .
There is no typographic hierarchy .
Evolution of the scale
In the sixteenth century , European typographers developed a series of typeface sizes , a scale ( the musical analogy is a good one - stick with me ) .
As shown in the diagram they are sizes we 're are all familiar with .
Six point through to Seventy - Two point type has remained pretty much intact for over four hundred years .
In fact , they are the default font sizes in many applications ( give or take a few . ) .
So , what 's so special about these sizes ?
Well , because this scale of sizes has been used for centuries , if set correctly , type set in this scale will appear more pleasing to the eye and therefore more legible .
An interesting point .
Originally the sizes in the scale were referred to by name instead of by point size .
here 's a few examples of some of the older names :
Alcohol can help people initially fall asleep , but leads to poor - quality sleep later in the night .
Escalated consumption of alcohol to aid sleep can lead to alcoholism .
Inaccurate sleep perceptions among alcoholics in early recovery may predict relapse to drinking .
Alcohol can initially have sleep - inducing effects among non-alcoholics , but once drinking becomes chronic , alcohol 's effects on sleep become much more negative in nature .
New findings indicate that individuals in early recovery from alcoholism who have inaccurate sleep perceptions are more likely to return to drinking .
Results are published in the December issue of Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research .
" The usual perception of alcohol 's effects on sleep in nonalcoholics is that it helps sleep , " explained Deirdre A. Conroy , the corresponding author who conducted the research while a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan .
" In truth , alcohol may help people fall asleep but it usually leads to poor quality sleep in the second half of the night and overall less deep sleep .
As people drink more regularly across nights to fall asleep , they become tolerant to the sedating effects of alcohol and subsequently use more alcohol each night to help fall asleep .
This escalation in drinking can lead to alcoholism . "
Conroy and her colleagues examined 18 individuals with insomnia ( 9 males , 9 females ) who were also in early recovery from alcohol dependence .
Each participant underwent polysomnography ( PSG ) for two nights , three weeks apart .
Participants also provided morning estimates of sleep onset latency ( SOL ) or the time it takes to fall asleep , wake time after sleep onset ( WASO ) , total sleep time ( TST ) , and sleep efficiency ( SE ) , a measure of sleep continuity .
After complete PSG results were recorded , participants were asked to give information about their drinking habits during two consecutive six - week follow - up periods .
" Our study suggests that in early recovery from alcoholism , people perceived that it took them a long time to fall asleep and that they slept through the night , " said Conroy .
" The reality was that it did not take them as long to fall asleep as they thought it did , and their brain was awake for a large portion of the night .
On average , the participants that were less accurate about how they were sleeping were more likely to return to drinking . "
" In other words , " added Timothy A. Roehrs , director of research at the Sleep Disorders and Research Center at Henry Ford Hospital , as well as professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit , " alcoholics perceive their sleep is disturbed and that is the reality .
The clinician should pay attention to the alcoholic 's sleep complaints as the complaint of poor sleep predicts relapse .
Previous studies had shown that PSG findings predict relapse ; this study now shows a complaint is sufficient . "
Conroy explained that poor sleep quality can lead to mood disturbances .
" If a recovering alcoholic is irritable because they are not getting quality sleep at night , they might be more vulnerable to return to drinking , " she said .
" [ Previous ] studies show that nonalcoholics with insomnia actually think they are sleeping worse than they are , so they may be more likely to seek appropriate treatment .
Our study shows that an alcoholic in early recovery has a lot of wakefulness in the night but they are not necessarily picking up on this .
It is important for the clinician working with the alcohol - dependent patient to have a differential of poor sleep quality in the back of their mind as a potential challenge for the patient throughout alcohol recovery . "
Conroy and her colleagues will next examine the specifics of sleep problems among alcoholics .
" Sleep across recovery from alcoholism may be more complex and variable over time than previously known , " she said .
" We plan to examine if sleep problems can be attributed to subtle disruptions in brain waves , in irregular biological rhythms , or both .
We will also examine if using cognitive behavioral therapy for alcohol - dependent patients with insomnia will reduce the rate of relapse . "

Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research ( ACER ) is the official journal of the Research Society on Alcoholism and the International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism .
Co-authors of the ACER paper , " Perception of Sleep in Recovering Alcohol Dependent Patients with Insomnia : Relationship to Future Drinking , " were : J. Todd Arnedt , Kirk J. Brower , Stephen Strobbe , Flavia Consens , Robert Hoffmann , and Roseanne Armitage of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , MI .
The study was funded by the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse .
" At this point in time , we are very focused on the software , not the phone , " The Australian Financial Review today quoted Kimber as saying during his speech at the Search Engine Room conference in Sydney .
Kimber said Google was keen on porting its search and other technologies to mobile devices , but it was not interested in entering the crowded handset market , as Apple has recently done with its iPhone .
This is highlighted by recent deals Google has made with manufacturers such as Samsung , resulting in its search software coming preloaded on certain handsets .
Extending Google 's search technology to mobile phones would allow it to serve advertising to a far wider audience - particularly those in developing countries who do not have access to a computer .
Kimber said mobile ads posed unique challenges but described them as being " extremely effective " .
In a telephone interview earlier this month , Dr Cerf , who is credited with being one of the founders of the internet , said " becoming an equipment manufacturer is pretty far from our business model " .
" On the other hand , we 're very interested in the platforms that other people are building .
We are quite eager to be part of the mobile revolution . "
A Google Australia spokesman said the company was focused on developing partnerships with existing industry players but did not confirm or deny that Google was developing a handset .
" Mobile is an important area for Google and we remain focused on creating applications and establishing and growing partnerships with industry leaders to develop innovative services for users worldwide , " he said .
Google 's latest comments are at odds with the slew of recent reports that suggested it was shopping a phone design to potential mobile phone manufacturing partners in Asia .
In a note to clients , sighted by Reuters , London - based phone analyst Richard Windsor wrote : " Google has come out of the closet at the CeBIT trade fair admitting that it is working on a mobile phone of its own .
" This is not going to be a high - end device but a mass - market device aimed at bringing Google to users who do n't have a PC . "
A US venture capitalist , Simeon Simeonov , wrote in a blog post earlier this month that there was " a team of about 100 people at Google working on the Google Phone " .
Simeonov said his " inside source close to the company " described the device as being a " BlackBerry - like , slick device " .
He added a number of recent mobile - related acquisitions made by Google backed up the rumours .
Samsung was widely rumoured to be Google 's manufacturing partner ; a photo published on the Engadget blog , which purported to be a prototype , showed a sparse touchscreen design similar to the iPhone .
But all of these rumours now appear to be quashed , bringing back memories from a year ago when Google was said to be building its own line of computers .
Those reports were soon proved false , and the product Google was working on turned out to be a free software pack .
Maybe I just hang out with some strange people but more than once I have heard people remark about the foolishness of spending thousands of dollars to buy a hermetically sealed water proof time capsule for a coffin , that is most likely not very eco-friendly .
When all you really need is a simple cardboard box .
It seems UK based Ecocoffins and Australia based Life Art have the answer .
They are makers of fine cardboard based coffins .
Given enough time anything you put into the earth is just going to rot away , so why fight nature .
Just drop yourself in one of these sturdy cardboard boxes ( if its good enough to ship that $ 10,000 flat screen TV its good enough to ship you ) and your ready for the great adventure in the sky .
Ecocoffin in particular makes a very green product .
They are made from cardboard , but are unlike any other cardboard coffin on the market .
Made from 90 % recycled material , a rigid honeycomb construction provides strength and stability whilst being 100 % biodegradable .
Our product has been tested at crematoria and at traditional burial sites and are suitable for both . ( via )
The natrual models from ecocoffin
The natural offerings from life art ( notice the handles , its a nice touch )
But who wants to go out in a plain looking box ?
Some of these things are very nice looking indeed .
Both companies allow you fully customise the coffins here are some interesting ones .
Or maybe you want to meet the great beyond wrapped in the logo of your favorite sports team .
The sky seems to be the limit here ( pun intended ) .
The price seems to be a lot lower than your average coffin , the I am sure cardboard will biodegrade faster than steal and wood .
Once you have your ecofriendly cardboard coffin you can be burried out in the woods under a tree ( my personal favorite ) to enjoy nature .
There is even a cardboard coffin blog to keep up to date with the latest eco - death related news .

“ We never saw such a protest , ” he said .
“ Everybody recognizes it is a new page . ”
Mr. Kasparov , 43 , is not Mr. Putin ’s only critic , but he may be the most prominent .
And he has brought to oppositional politics the same energy and aggression that characterized his chess , attacking Mr. Putin and the Kremlin — or the regime , as he repeatedly calls it — with language rarely spoken so bluntly in Russia .
“ This regime is getting out of touch with the real world , ” he said .
“ It ’s a deadly combination of money , power and blood — and impunity . ”
Such attacks have drawn the scrutiny of the authorities , though so far nothing worse ; someone who sounded angry that Mr. Kasparov had given up chess for politics attacked him with a chessboard in 2005 .
( “ I am lucky , ” he said at the time , “ that the popular sport in the Soviet Union was chess and not baseball . ” )
He now travels with bodyguards .
He hired them out of concern for hooligans , he said , not because other Kremlin critics have been killed , like the journalist Anna Politkovskaya , who was shot to death in Moscow last October .
“ If the state goes after you , ” he said , “ there ’s no stopping them . ”
THIS is not the place Mr. Kasparov expected to be when he resigned from the world of professional chess two years ago , quitting while still the highest - ranked player , if no longer the world champion .
He is a famous man and a wealthy one , the author of numerous books on chess and its lessons for life , who is now leading acts of civil disobedience in an uphill battle to protest Mr. Putin ’s policies .
Something is rotten in the heart of Washington ; and it lies in the vice - president 's office .
The salience of this case is obvious .
What it is really about - what it has always been about - is whether this administration deliberately misled the American people about WMD intelligence before the war .
The risks Cheney took to attack Wilson , the insane over - reaction that otherwise very smart men in this administration engaged in to rebut a relatively trivial issue : all this strongly implies the fact they were terrified that the full details of their pre-war WMD knowledge would come out .
Fitzgerald could smell this .
He was right to pursue it , and to prove that a brilliant , intelligent , sane man like Libby would risk jail to protect his bosses .
What was he really trying to hide ?
We now need a Congressional investigation to find out more , to subpoena Cheney and , if he wo n't cooperate , consider impeaching him .

The odds of economic meltdown
With interest rates and oil prices rising and consumers spending beyond their means , we may be headed for recession – and worse
Note :
This article by Brad DeLong , a professor of economics at UC Berkeley , originally appeared on Salon.com .
Forecasting recessions is a fool 's game .
If there is enough solid economic information to make it appear highly likely that a recession is coming — that production , employment and consumer demand will actually fall — then it is highly likely that there already is a recession .
Businesses are not stupid , and they do n't have to wait for economists to tell them what they already know .
By the time a gloomy forecast has been issued they 've probably already noticed a drop in consumer demand and responded by firing workers and reducing production .

So : Never say that a recession is coming .
Say only that a recession is here , or that there might be a recession on the way .
Which , in fact , is what I 'm saying today .
As of the beginning of August 2006 , a recession is not here , and I 'm not going to violate my own rule by saying one is coming .
But there is a good chance — for the first time since 2003 — that there might be a recession in progress six months from now .
Why ?
Three factors : 1 ) A Federal Reserve that finds itself with less inflation - fighting credibility than it thought it had ; 2 ) upward pressure on inflation from rising energy and , perhaps , import prices ; and 3 ) millions of middle - class homeowners who for too long have treated their houses as gigantic ATMs , using home equity loans and refinancing to generate extra spending money .
First , the Federal Reserve , now chaired by Bush appointee Ben Bernanke .
The Federal Reserve sets interest rates , and when it does it tries to hit the economy 's sweet spot : that point that produces maximum employment , purchasing power and growth without generating enough upward pressure on prices to produce expectations of inflation .
The Federal Reserve does this by pushing interest rates up and down .
Push interest rates up and businesses find it more expensive to expand capacity and production , causing them to cut back on investment spending .
Push interest rates up and households ' balance sheets deteriorate , causing them to cut back on consumption spending .
Push interest rates down and firms find it cheaper to expand capacity and production , and so they ramp up investment spending .
Push interest rates down and households find their balance sheets looking better and feel flush , expanding consumption spending .
There is one major complication : what Milton Friedman calls the " long and variable lags " in the system .
Every action the Federal Reserve takes now affects production , demand and inflation roughly 15 months in the future .
What the Federal Reserve has done in the past 15 months has not yet had a chance to affect the economy .
This leads to the Federal Reserve 's current dilemma .
The last two percentage points ' worth of increases in interest rates — increases in interest rates that will in the end make businesses cut back on investment spending and households feel pinched — have not yet had a chance to affect the economy .
Because of " long and variable lags , " they are still " in the pipeline . "
When they emerge from the pipeline they will slow the economy further .
By how much ?
Nobody is really sure .
In this situation it seems reasonable that the Federal Reserve should stop raising interest rates .
Waiting to see what the interest - rate increases of the past couple of years will do to the economy would be a prudent strategy .
Indeed , since last December the Federal Reserve has been quietly signaling that it is about to " pause , " to adopt such a wait - and - see strategy .
Yet so far it has not done so .
Why not ?
One important reason is that the Federal Reserve is scared that if it pauses too soon it will convince many observers that it is not truly serious about fighting inflation — and a central bank has a hard time fighting inflation if businesses , speculators and workers ever conclude that it is not truly serious .
The Federal Reserve is also unwilling to stop increasing interest rates because it is afraid of recession risk factor No. 2 : a rise in oil and import prices .
Those fears are justified .
Remember how the invasion of Iraq , besides bringing a golden age of democracy to the Middle East , was also supposed to produce $ 15 - dollar - per - barrel oil ?
Oil is now at $ 75 a barrel , and this rise in oil prices is putting upward pressure on prices in general .
As for import prices , they are vulnerable to a U.S. dollar that has been weakened by the Bush budget deficit and massive borrowing from China .
Suppose the dollar declines suddenly , which is not a far - fetched possibility .
Should the dollar fall by , say , 30 percent , and should importers raise their dollar prices in proportion , then the one - sixth of U.S. spending that is spending on imports will see prices rise by 30 percent .
Because 30 percent times one - sixth equals 5 percent , that would boost U.S. consumer prices by 5 percent nearly overnight .
Thus there are two big reasons for the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates , in spite of how much downward pressure on demand is still in the pipeline .
The Federal Reserve thinks it needs to do so in order to establish its long - term credibility , and there are the twin dangers of oil - and import price - triggered inflation to guard against .
Most likely the Federal Reserve 's continued raises in interest rates will not send the economy into recession .
But there is that chance , and the chance is raised from a low - probability possibility to a serious worry by the third factor : that home - as - ATM problem .
The unprecedented use of home loans to squeeze cash out of equity has allowed middle - class consumers to spend well beyond their means .
Someday this spending spree has to come to an end .
If it comes to an end suddenly , at a time when the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates a little too much , then we have our recession .
Make no mistake about it : The U.S. economy is close to the edge .
Retail sales in the second quarter were rising at only a 2.1 percent annual pace .
Business investment in equipment and software was falling .
Residential construction was falling .
Either households will continue spending beyond all reason , or businesses will start boosting investment , or exports will start booming , or there will be a recession sometime in the next year .
Figure the odds at 3 out of 10 .
What can be done to head off the danger ?
Unfortunately , very little .
The bag of macroeconomic tricks is empty .
In 2000 - 2001 the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates to the floor , boosting residential construction and consumer spending to offset the decline in high - tech investment , and turn the 2001 recession into a very small event indeed .
In 2002 - 2003 the short - run stimulative effect of the Bush tax cuts came online at exactly the right moment to offset fears of a deflationary spiral .
But today further fiscal stimulus would increase global imbalances — meaning , raise the trade deficit — and do more damage to confidence than it might do good in curing a recession .
And sharp reductions in interest rates would lower the value of the dollar and increase inflationary pressures from import prices in a way that the Federal Reserve does not dare allow .
The past 24 years have been an amazing run as far as the business cycle is concerned .
There have been only two recessions , and both of those were short and shallow .
But Ben Bernanke and Co. are now at real risk of presiding over the third .

Washington State Senator Eric Oemig has introduced into the Washington State Senate Senate Joint Memorial 8016 , calling for the impeachment of George W. Bush by the U.S. House of Representatives .
Recently Oemig said , “ What I ’ve gotten from [ Senate ] Leadership is an absolute committment that we will have a floor debate [ on impeachment ] . ”
Senator Oemig spoke with Impeachment Channel about the current status of this effort to initiative an investigation possibly leading to impeachment of the President and Vice President of the U.S .

Not surprisingly , prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee seized the opportunity to compare the assault to the September 11 attacks in the US only three months previously .
On December 14 2001 , the day after the attack on parliament , the Special Cell ( anti- terrorist squad ) of the Delhi police claimed it had tracked down several people suspected of being involved in the conspiracy .
The next day , it announced that it had " cracked the case " : the attack , the police said , was a joint operation carried out by two Pakistan - based terrorist groups , Lashkar - e-Taiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad .
Three Kashmiri men , Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani , Shaukat Hussain Guru and Mohammad Afzal , and Shaukat 's wife , Afsan Guru , were arrested .
In the tense days that followed , parliament was adjourned .
The Indian government declared that Pakistan - America 's closest ally in the " war on terror " - was a terrorist state .
On December 21 , India recalled its high commissioner from Pakistan , suspended air , rail and bus communications and banned air traffic with Pakistan .
It put into motion a massive mobilisation of its war machinery , and moved more than half a million troops to the Pakistan border .
Foreign embassies evacuated their staff and citizens , and tourists travelling to India were issued cautionary travel advisories .
The world watched with bated breath as the subcontinent was taken to the brink of nuclear war .
All this cost India an estimated pounds 1.1 bn of public money .
About 800 soldiers died in the panicky process of mobilisation alone .
The police charge sheet was filed in a special fast - track trial court designated for cases under the Prevention of Terrorism Act .
Some three years later , the trial court sentenced Geelani , Shaukat and Afzal to death .
Afsan Guru was sentenced to five years of " rigorous imprisonment " .
On appeal , the high court subsequently acquitted Geelani and Afsan , but upheld Shaukat 's and Afzal 's death sentence .
Eventually , the supreme court upheld the acquittals and reduced Shaukat 's punishment to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment .
However , it not just confirmed , but enhanced Mohammad Afzal 's sentence .
He was given three life sentences and a double death sentence .
In its judgment on August 5 2005 , the supreme court admitted that the evidence against Afzal was only circumstantial , and that there was no evidence that he belonged to any terrorist group or organisation .
But it went on to endorse what can only be described as lynch law .
" The incident , which resulted in heavy casualties , had shaken the entire nation , " it said , " and the collective conscience of the society will only be satisfied if capital punishment is awarded to the offender . "
Spelling out the reasons for giving Afzal the death penalty , the judgment went on : " The appellant , who is a surrendered militant and who was bent upon repeating the acts of treason against the nation , is a menace to the society and his life should become extinct . "
This implies a dangerous ignorance of what it means to be a " surrendered militant " in Kashmir today .
So , should Afzal 's life be extinguished ?
His story is fascinating because it is inextricably entwined with the story of the Kashmir Valley .
It is a story that stretches far beyond the confines of courtrooms and the limited imagination of people who live in the secure heart of a self - declared " superpower " .
Afzal 's story has its origins in a war zone whose laws are beyond the pale of the fine arguments and delicate sensibilities of normal jurisprudence .
For all these reasons it is critical that we consider carefully the strange , sad and utterly sinister story of the December 13 attack .
It tells us a great deal about the way the world 's largest " democracy " really works .
It connects the biggest things to the smallest .
It traces the pathways that connect what happens in the shadowy grottoes of our police stations to what goes on in the snowy streets of Paradise Valley , and from there to the malign furies that bring nations to the brink of nuclear war .
It raises specific questions that deserve specific , and not ideological or rhetorical , answers .
What hangs in the balance is far more than the fate of one man .
For the most part , the December 13 attack was an astonishingly incompetent " terrorist " strike .
But consummate competence appeared to be the hallmark of everything that followed : the gathering of evidence , the speed of the investigation by the Special Cell , the arrest and charging of the accused and the three - and - a - half - year - long judicial process that began with the fast - track trial court .
The operative phrase in all of this is " appeared to be " .
If you follow the story carefully , you will encounter two sets of masks .
First , the mask of consummate competence ( accused arrested , " case cracked " in two days flat ) , and then , when things began to come undone , the benign mask of shambling incompetence ( shoddy evidence , procedural flaws , material contradictions ) .
But underneath all of this - as several lawyers , academics and journalists who have studied the case in detail have shown - is something more sinister , more worrying .
Over the past few years the worries have grown into a mountain of misgivings , impossible to ignore .
The doubts set in as early as the day after the parliament attack , when the police arrested Geelani , a young lecturer at Delhi University .
His outraged colleagues and friends , certain that he had been framed , contacted the well - known lawyer Nandita Haksar and asked her to take on his case .
This marked the beginning of a campaign for the fair trial of Geelani .
It flew in the face of mass hysteria and corrosive propaganda that was enthusiastically disseminated by the mass media .
But despite this , the campaign was successful , and Geelani was eventually acquitted , along with Afsan Guru .
Geelani's acquittal blew a gaping hole in the prosecution 's version of the parliament attack .
The linchpin of its conspiracy theory suddenly tuned out to be innocent .
But in some odd way , in the public mind , the acquittal of two of the accused only confirmed the guilt of the other two .
There was bloodlust that had to be satiated .
When the government announced that Afzal , Accused No 1 in the case , would be hanged on October 20 2006 , it seemed that most people welcomed the news not just with approval , but with morbid excitement .
But then , once again , the questions resurfaced .
To see through the prosecution 's case against Geelani was relatively easy .
He was plucked out of thin air and transplanted into the centre of the " conspiracy " as its kingpin .
Afzal was different .
He had been extruded through the sewage system of the hell that Kashmir has become .
He surfaced through a manhole , covered in shit ( and when he emerged , policemen in the Special Cell pissed on him .
Literally . )
The first thing they made him do was a " media confession " in which he implicated himself completely in the attack .
The speed with which this happened made many of us believe that he was indeed guilty as charged .
It was only much later that the circumstances under which this " confession " was made were revealed , and even the supreme court was to set it aside , saying that the police had violated legal safeguards .
From the very beginning there was nothing pristine or simple about Afzal 's case .
His story gives us a glimpse into what life is really like in the Kashmir Valley .
It is only in the Noddy Book version we read about in our newspapers that security forces battle militants and innocent Kashmiris are caught in the crossfire .
In the adult version , Kashmir is a valley awash with militants , renegades , security forces , double - crossers , informers , spooks , blackmailers , blackmailees , extortionists , spies , both Indian and Pakistani intelligence agencies , human rights activists , NGOs and unimaginable amounts of unaccounted - for money and weapons .
There are not always clear lines that demarcate the boundaries between all these things and people ; it is not easy to tell who is working for whom .
Truth , in Kashmir , is probably more dangerous than anything else .
The deeper you dig , the worse it gets .
At the bottom of the pit are the Special Operations Group and Special Task Force ( STF ) , the most ruthless , indisciplined and dreaded elements of the Indian security apparatus in Kashmir , which play a central role in the Afzal story .
Unlike the more formal forces , they operate in a twilight zone where policemen , surrendered militants , renegades and common criminals do business .
They prey upon the local population , particularly in rural Kashmir .
Their primary victims are the thousands of young Kashmiri men who rose up in revolt in the anarchic uprising of the early 1990s and have since surrendered and are trying to live normal lives .
In 1989 , when Afzal crossed the border to be trained as a militant , he was only 20 .
He returned with no training , disillusioned with his experience .
He put down his gun and enrolled himself in Delhi University .
In 1993 , without ever having been a practising militant , he voluntarily surrendered to the Border Security Force .
Illogically enough , it was at this point that his nightmares began .
His surrender was treated as a crime and his life became hell .
Afzal 's story has enraged Kashmiris because what has happened to him could have happened , is happening and has happened to thousands of young Kashmiri men and their families .
The only difference is that their stories are played out in the dingy bowels of interrogation centres , army camps and police stations where they have been burned , beaten , electrocuted , blackmailed and killed , their bodies thrown out of the backs of trucks for passers - by to find .
Whereas Afzal 's story is being performed like a piece of medieval theatre on the national stage , in the clear light of day , with the legal sanction of a " fair trial " , the hollow benefits of a " free press " and the all pomp and ceremony of a so - called democracy .
In documents submitted to the court , Afzal describes how , in the months before the attack on parliament , he was tortured in the camps of the STF - with electrodes on his genitals and chillies and petrol in his anus .
He talks of how he was a constant victim of extortion .
He mentions the name of Deputy Superintendent of Police Devinder Singh , who said he needed him to do a " small job " for him in Delhi .
( Singh has subsequently admitted on record to having tortured Afzal in exactly the ways Afzal has described . )
Afzal has also said that from the time he was arrested up to the time he was charged ( a few months ) , his younger brother Hilal was held in illegal confinement in a police camp in Kashmir .
As ransom .
Even today , Afzal does not claim complete innocence .
It is the nature of his involvement that is being contested .
For instance , was he coerced , tortured and blackmailed into playing even the peripheral part he played ?
In a gross violation of his constitutional rights , from the time he was arrested and right through the crucial phase of the trial when the real work of building up a case is done , Afzal did not have a lawyer .
He had nobody to put out his version of the story , or help him or anyone else sift through the tangle of lies and fabrications and propaganda put out by the police .
Various individuals worked it out for themselves .
Today , five years later , a group of lawyers , academics , journalists and writers has published a reader ( December 13th : The Strange Case of the Parliament Attack , published by Penguin India ) .
It is this body of work that has fractured what , only recently , appeared to be a national consensus interwoven with mass hysteria .
Through the fissures , those who have come under scrutiny - shadowy individuals , counter - intelligence and security agencies , political parties - are beginning to surface .
They wave flags , hurl abuse , issue hot denials and cover their tracks with more and more untruths .
Thus they reveal themselves .
The essays in the Penguin book raise questions about how Afzal , who never had proper legal representation , can be sentenced to death without having had an opportunity to be heard , without a fair trial .
They raise questions about fabricated arrest memos , falsified seizure and recovery memos , procedural flaws , vital evidence that has been tampered with , false telephone records , false testimonies , legal lacunae , material contradictions in the testimonies of police and prosecution witnesses , and the outright lies that were presented in court and published in newspapers .
They show how there is hardly a single piece of evidence that stands up to scrutiny .
And then there are even more disturbing questions that have been raised , which range beyond the fate of Afzal .
Some of these are critical for a country that is claiming to be a responsible nuclear power .
Here are 13 questions for December 13 :
Question 1 : For months before the attack on parliament , both the government and the police had been saying that parliament could be attacked .
On December 12 2001 , the then prime minister , AB Vajpayee , warned of an imminent attack .
On December 13 it happened .
Given that there was an " improved security drill " , how did a car bomb packed with explosives enter the parliament complex ?
Question 2 : Within days of the attack , the Special Cell of the Delhi police said it was a meticulously planned joint operation of Jaish - e - Mohammad and Lashkar - e - Taiba .
They said the attack was led by a man called " Mohammad " who was also involved in the hijacking of flight IC - 814 in 1998 .
( This was later refuted by the Central Bureau of Investigation . )
None of this was ever proved in court .
What evidence did the Special Cell have for its claim ?
Question 3 : The entire attack was recorded live on CCTV .
Two Congress party MPs , Kapil Sibal and Najma Heptullah , demanded in parliament that the CCTV recording be shown to the members .
They said that there was confusion about the details of the event .
The chief whip of the Congress party , Priyaranjan Dasmunshi , said , " I counted six men getting out of the car .
But only five were killed .
The closed circuit TV camera recording clearly showed the six men . "
If Dasmunshi was right , why did the police say that there were only five people in the car ?
Who was the sixth person ?
Where is he now ?
Why was the CCTV recording not produced by the prosecution as evidence in the trial ?
Why was it not released for public viewing ?
Question 4 : Why was parliament adjourned after some of these questions were raised ?
Question 5 : A few days after December 13 , the government declared that it had " incontrovertible evidence " of Pakistan 's involvement in the attack , and announced a massive mobilisation of almost half a million soldiers to the Indo - Pakistan border .
The subcontinent was pushed to the brink of nuclear war .
Apart from Afzal 's " confession " , extracted under torture ( and later set aside by the supreme court ) , what was the " incontrovertible evidence " ?
Question 6 : Is it true that the military mobilisation to the Pakistan border had begun long before the December 13 attack ?
Question 7 : How much did this military standoff , which lasted for nearly a year , cost ?
How many soldiers died in the process ?
How many soldiers and civilians died because of mishandled landmines , and how many peasants lost their homes and land because trucks and tanks were rolling through their villages and landmines were being planted in their fields ?
Question 8 : In a criminal investigation , it is vital for the police to show how the evidence gathered at the scene of the attack led them to the accused .
The police have not managed to show how they connected Geelani to the attack .
And how did the police reach Afzal ?
The Special Cell says Geelani led them to Afzal .
But the message to look out for Afzal was actually flashed to the Srinagar police before Geelani was arrested .
So how did the Special Cell connect Afzal to the December 13 attack ?
Question 9 : The courts acknowledge that Afzal was a surrendered militant who was in regular contact with the security forces , particularly the STF of Jammu and Kashmir police .
How do the security forces explain the fact that a person under their surveillance was able to conspire in a major militant operation ?
Question 10 : Is it plausible that organisations such as Lashkar - e - Taiba or Jaish - e - Mohammad would rely on a person who had been in and out of STF torture chambers , and was under constant police surveillance , as the principal link for a major operation ?
Question 11 : In his statement before the court , Afzal says that he was introduced to " Mohammed " and instructed to take him to Delhi by a man called Tariq , who was working with the STF .
Tariq was named in the police charge sheet .
Who is Tariq and where is he now ?
Question 12 : On December 19 2001 , six days after the parliament attack , police commissioner SM Shangari identified one of the attackers who was killed as Mohammad Yasin Fateh Mohammed ( alias Abu Hamza ) of the Lashkar - e - Taiba , who had been arrested in Mumbai in November 2000 and immediately handed over to the Jammu and Kashmir police .
He gave detailed descriptions to support his statement .
If police commissioner Shangari was right , how did Yasin , a man in the custody of the Jammu and Kashmir police , end up participating in the parliament attack ?
If he was wrong , where is Yasin now ?
Question 13 : Why is it that we still do not know who the five " terrorists " killed in the parliament attack are ?
These questions , examined cumulatively , point to something far more serious than incompetence .
The words that come to mind are complicity , collusion , involvement .
There is no need for us to feign shock or shrink from thinking these thoughts and saying them out loud .
Governments and their intelligence agencies have a hoary tradition of using strategies such as this to further their own ends .
( Look up the burning of the Reichstag and the rise of Nazi power in Germany in 1933 ; or Operation Gladio , in which European intelligence agencies created acts of terrorism , especially in Italy , in order to discredit militant groups such as the Red Brigades . )
The official response to all of these questions has been dead silence .
As things stand , Afzal 's execution has been postponed while the president considers his clemency petition .
Meanwhile , the Bhartiya Janata party ( now in the opposition ) announced that it would turn " Hang Afzal " into a national campaign .
But it does not seem to have taken off .
Now other avenues are being explored .
The main strategy seems to be to create confusion and polarise the debate on communal lines .
In the business of spreading confusion , the media , particularly television journalists , can be counted on to be perfect collaborators .
On discussions , chat shows and " special reports " , we have television anchors playing around with crucial facts , like young children in a sandpit .
Torturers , estranged brothers , senior police officers and politicians are emerging from the woodwork and talking .
The more they talk , the more interesting it all becomes .
One character who is rapidly emerging from the shadowy periphery and wading on to centre - stage is deputy superintendent Devinder Singh .
He was showcased on the national news ( CNN - IBN ) , in what was presented as a " sting " operation with a hidden camera .
It all seemed a bit unnecessary , however , because Singh has been talking a lot these days .
He has done recorded interviews , on the phone as well as face to face , saying exactly the same shocking things .
Weeks before the sting operation , in a recorded interview with Parvaiz Bukhari , a freelance journalist , he said , " I did interrogate and torture him [ Afzal ] at my camp for several days .
And we never recorded his arrest in the books anywhere .
His description of torture at my camp is true .
That was the procedure those days and we did pour petrol in his ass and gave him electric shocks .
But I could not break him .
He did not reveal anything to me despite our hardest possible interrogation ...
He looked like a ' bhondu ' [ fool ] those days , what you call a ' chootya ' [ idiot ] type .
And I had a reputation for torture , interrogation and breaking suspects .
If anybody came out of my interrogation clean , nobody would ever touch him again .
He would be considered clean for good by the whole department . "
This is not an empty boast .
Singh has a formidable reputation for torture in the Kashmir Valley .
On TV , his boasting spiralled into policy - making .
" Torture is the only deterrent for terrorism , " he said .
" I do it for the nation . "
He did not bother to explain why or how the " bhondu " that he tortured and subsequently released allegedly went on to become the diabolical mastermind of the parliament attack .
Singh then said that Afzal was a Jaish militant .
If this is true , why was the evidence not placed before the courts ?
And why on earth was Afzal released ?
Why was he not watched ?
There is a definite attempt to try to dismiss this as incompetence .
But given everything we know now , it would take all of Singh 's delicate professional skills to make some of us believe that .
The official version of the story of the parliament attack is very quickly coming apart at the seams .
Even the supreme court judgment , with all its flaws of logic and leaps of faith , does not accuse Afzal of being the mastermind of the attack .
So who was the mastermind ?
If Afzal is hanged , we may never know .
But LK Advani , the leader of the opposition , wants him hanged at once .
Even a day 's delay , he says , is against the national interest .
Why ?
What is the hurry ?
The man is locked up in a high - security cell on death row .
He is not allowed out of his cell for even five minutes a day .
What harm can he do ?
Talk ?
Write , perhaps ?
Surely , even in Advani's own narrow interpretation of the term , it is in the national interest not to hang Afzal ?
At least not until there is an inquiry that reveals what the real story is and who actually attacked parliament ?
A genuine inquiry would have to mean far more than just a political witch - hunt .
It would have to look into the part played by intelligence , counter - insurgency and security agencies as well .
Offences such as the fabrication of evidence and the blatant violation of procedural norms have already become established in the courts , but they look very much like just the tip of the iceberg .
We now have a police officer admitting - boasting - on record that he was involved in the illegal detention and torture of a fellow citizen .
Is all of this acceptable to the people , the government and the courts of India ?
Given the track record of Indian governments ( past and present , right , left and centre ) it is naive - perhaps utopian is a better word - to hope that today 's politicians will ever have the courage to institute an inquiry that will , once and for all , uncover the real story .
A maintenance dose of pusillanimity is probably encrypted in all governments .
But hope has little to do with reason .

The Bush administration never drew up a comprehensive plan for rebuilding Iraq after the March 2003 invasion , which contributed to a severe shortage of skilled federal workers in Baghdad and to the mismanagement of the country ’s oil money , according to a new government report .
“ There was insufficient systematic planning for human capital management in Iraq before and during the U.S. - directed stabilization and reconstruction operations , ” said Stuart W. Bowen Jr. , the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction , in a new “ lessons learned ” report released yesterday .
“ The practical limitations ensuing from this shortfall adversely affected reconstruction in post - war Iraq . ”
The Pentagon ’s initial plans for reconstruction crumbled when it encountered an unexpected foreign and domestic insurgency that looted the country , sabotaged electric and water service , and killed hundreds of Americans and Iraqis in 2003 after the ouster of dictator Saddam Hussein .
The administration reacted by quickly establishing the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , directed by L. Paul Bremer , and pumped billions of dollars of United Nations - held oil cash into Baghdad .
But , Mr. Bowen concluded in a report focusing on the CPA ’s staffing , “ [t ] he unanticipated post - war collapse of virtually all Iraqi governing structures , substantially hindered coalition efforts to develop and rapidly execute an effective reconstruction program . ”
The report was the latest in a series of audits and updates from Mr. Bowen to document how the Bush administration oversaw more than $ 30 billion in Iraq cash — the Development Fund for Iraq ( DFI ) — and about $ 24 billion in U.S. taxpayer money for reconstruction .
Mr. Bowen ’s investigators found significant fraud in the disbursement of millions of DFI dollars that the CPA failed to safeguard .
The new Iraqi government controls the fund and says that as much as $ 1 billion alone was stolen by Iraqis inside the Defense Ministry .
Mr. Bowen has not found significant fraud in the administering of the U.S. funds , he has said .
His report quotes a “ senior Department of Defense official ” as saying that “ the U.S. government was not systemically structured to execute overseas reconstruction and stabilization programs . ”
The pre-invasion planning , the official said , “ naturally focused on military requirements . ”
The Pentagon since has made post - conflict stability concerns a major part of contingency planning right alongside preparing for the war itself , according to a new policy directive .
“ There was no existing contingency organization to lead the reconstruction and relief process , ” Mr. Bowen said .
He quoted a State Department official as saying : “ We have no contemporary doctrine for occupying another country . ”
The Pentagon did not name someone to head the reconstruction effort ( then called the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance ) until January 2003 , just two months before the March invasion .
Retired Army Lt. Gen. Jay Garner said he was not able to start staffing the organization until February .
When the CPA took over that May , the deteriorating security environment made it all the more difficult to recruit federal workers .
“ The ability and willingness of U.S. government agencies to provide detailers to CPA had declined , ” according to the report .
“ The coalition nations have millions of the most talented individuals in the world , ” said retired Rear Adm .
David Oliver , who directed CPA ’s budget .
“ We needed , and did not have , several thousand of them .
Our partners sent some of the best and brightest .
The United States did not proportionally provide . ”

A FEDERAL minimum wage is an idea whose time came in 1938 , when public confidence in markets was at a nadir and the federal government ’s confidence in itself was at an apogee .
This , in spite of the fact that , with the 19 percent unemployment and the economy contracting by 6.2 percent in 1938 , the New Deal ’s frenetic attempts had failed to end , and perhaps had prolonged , the Depression .
Today , raising the federal minimum wage is a bad idea whose time has come , for two reasons , the first of which is that some Democrats have a chronic and evidently incurable disease – New Deal Nostalgia .
Witness Nancy Pelosi’s “ 100 hours ” agenda , a genuflection to FDR ’s 100 Days .
Perhaps this nostalgia resonates with the 5 percent of Americans who remember the 1930s .
Second , the president has endorsed raising the hourly minimum from $ 5.15 to $ 7.25 by the spring of 2009 .
Besides , there would be something disproportionate about the president vetoing this feel - good bit of legislative fluff after not vetoing the absurdly expensive 2002 farm bill , or the 2005 highway bill larded with 6,371 earmarks , or the anti-constitutional McCain - Feingold speech - rationing bill .
Democrats consider the minimum - wage increase a signature issue .
So , consider what it says about them :
Most of the working poor earn more than the minimum wage , and most of the 0.6 percent ( 479,000 in 2005 ) of America ’s wage workers earning the minimum wage are not poor .
Only one in five workers earning the federal minimum live in families with household earnings below the poverty line .
Forty percent of American workers are salaried .
Of the 75.6 million paid by the hour , 1.9 million earn the federal minimum or less , and of these , more than half are under 25 and more than a quarter are between 16 and 19 .
Many are students or other part - time workers .
Sixty percent of those earning the federal minimum or less work in restaurants and bars and are earning tips – often untaxed , perhaps – in addition to their wages .
Two - thirds of those earning the federal minimum today will , a year from now , have been promoted and be earning 10 percent more .
The federal minimum wage has not been raised since 1997 , so 29 states with 70 percent of the nation ’s work force have set minimum wages of between $ 6.15 and $ 7.93 an hour .
Because aging liberals ( clinging to the moral clarities of their youth ) also have Sixties Nostalgia , they are suspicious of states ’ rights .
But regarding minimum wages , many have become Brandeisians , invoking Justice Louis Brandeis ’ thought about states being laboratories of democracy .
But wait .
Ronald Blackwell , the AFL - CIO ’s chief economist , tells The New York Times that state minimum wage differences entice companies to shift jobs to lower - wage states .
So : states ’ rights are bad , after all , at least concerning – let ’s use liberalism ’s highest encomium – diversity of economic policies .
The problem is that demand for almost everything is elastic :
When the price of something goes up , demand for it goes down .
Obviously were the minimum wage to jump to , say , $ 15 an hour , that would cause significant unemployment among persons just reaching for the bottom rung of the ladder of upward mobility .
But suppose those scholars are correct who say that when the minimum wage is low and is increased slowly ( proposed legislation would take it to $ 7.25 in three steps ) , the negative impact on employment is negligible .
Still , because there are large differences among states ’ costs of living , and the nature of their economies , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) sensibly suggests that each state should be allowed to set a lower minimum .
But the minimum wage should be the same everywhere : $ 0 .
Labor is a commodity ; governments make messes when they decree commodities ’ prices .
Washington , which has its hands full delivering the mail and defending the shores , should let the market do well what Washington does poorly .
But that is a good idea whose time will never come again .

Spartel Island now lies 60 m under the sea in the Straits of Gibraltar , but some think it once lay above water .
The finding adds weight to a hypothesis that the island could have inspired the legend recounted by the philosopher Plato more than 2,000 years ago .
Evidence comes from a seafloor survey published in the journal Geology .
Marc -André Gutscher of the University of Western Brittany in Plouzané , France , found a coarse - grained sedimentary deposit that is 50 - 120 cm thick and could have been left behind after a tsunami .
Shaken sediments
Dr Gutscher said that the destruction described by Plato is consistent with a great earthquake and tsunami similar to the one that devastated the city of Lisbon in Portugal in 1755 , generating waves with heights of up to 10m .
Some think the Atlantis legend was inspired by real events
It was found to date to around 12,000 years ago - roughly the age indicated by Plato for the destruction of Atlantis , Dr Gutscher reports in Geology .
Spartel Island , in the Gulf of Cadiz , was proposed as a candidate for the origin of the Atlantis legend in 2001 by French geologist Jacques Collina - Girard .
It is " in front of the Pillars of Hercules " , or the Straits of Gibraltar , as Plato described .
The philosopher said the fabled island civilisation had been destroyed in a single day and night , disappearing below the sea .
Sedimentary records reveal that events like the 1755 Lisbon earthquake occur every 1,500 to 2,000 years in the Gulf of Cadiz .
But the mapping of the island carried out by Dr Gutscher failed to turn up any manmade structures and also showed that the island was much smaller than previously believed .
This could make it less likely that the island was inhabited by a civilisation .
Unlike the first communication , the second communication was a set of instant messages that contained sexually explicit statements and were reportedly generated three years ago .
Last week , ABC News first reported these sexually explicit instant messages which led to Representative Foley 's resignation .
These sexually explicit communications warrant a criminal referral in two respects .
Let me say a few words about important values we must demonstrate while all of us serve in government .
First , we must always maintain the highest ethical standards .
We must always ask ourself ( sic ) not only what is legal , but what is right .
There is no goal of government worth accomplishing if it cannot be accomplished with integrity .
Therefore , I also request that the Department undertake an investigation into who had specific knowledge of the content of any sexually explicit communications between Mr. Foley and any former or current House pages and what actions such individuals took , if any , to provide them to law enforcement .
I request that the scope of your investigation include any and all individuals who may have been aware of this matter - be they Members of Congress , employees of the House of Representatives , or anyone outside the Congress .
UPDATE
The letter sent by Denny Hastert yesterday to Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonalzes was sent with the intent of stemming the tide of this Foley cover - up scandal by enabling Hastert and friends to hide behind the fact that there is now a pending DOJ criminal investigation which they requested .
But Hastert 's letter should have the precise opposite effect .
The letter itself is actually one of the most incriminating and scandalous actions to be revealed in this story yet , and demonstrates just how deeply corrupt and amoral the trappings of one - party rule have made the Republicans in Washington .
Whenever someone exposes wrongdoing on the part of Beltway Republicans , their reaction has been to attack and threaten those who expose the wrongdoing .
When Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill published a book with Ron Suskind which revealed that the administration was planning to attack Iraq long before 9/11 , they began immediately threatening O'Neill with a criminal investigation over documents they claimed he improperly took .
When The New York Times exposed the President 's illegal eavesdropping , they threatened a criminal investigation of the reporters and editors who published the story .
And now Hastert is attempting to depict as the real criminals those who exposed the conduct of the House GOP leaders in the Foley scandal .
The letter sent by Hastert to the DOJ yesterday does not ask for an investigation into the issue at the heart of this scandal -- namely , whether GOP House leaders failed to take action against Foley despite having ample reason to suspect strongly , if not fully know about , Foley 's predatory behavior with underage pages .
To the contrary , Hastert 's letter has two overriding and clear purposes : ( 1 ) to exclude this wrongdoing engaged in by Hastert and the GOP House leadership from the DOJ investigation ; and ( 2 ) to demand instead a criminal investigation into the parties responsible for the disclosure of the Foley story generally and the wrongdoing of Hastert and company specifically .
For that reason , Hastert 's letter is plainly designed to bolster the cover - up , to intimidate those who have revealed information about this scandal , and to deter those who might come forward with more information .
The letter worsens the scandal because it itself is corrupt .
The central premise of Hastert 's letter is that " there are two different and distinct communications " between Foley and the pages : ( 1 ) the emails Foley sent to the page which caused the page to object to them as " sick " and caused his parents to complain -- emails which Hastert outrageously continues to dismiss as merely " over friendly " and " not sexual in nature " ; and ( 2 ) the " sexually explicit instant messages "
Foley exchanged with pages .
Contrary to Hastert 's initial false denials , it is now beyond dispute that Hastert was fully informed months ago about category ( 1 ) -- the emails -- as well as about the reaction of the page and his parents .
But Hastert claims not to have been aware of category ( 2 ) ( the IMs ) until this week .
For that reason , Hastert 's letter seeks a criminal investigation only with regard to individuals who had specific knowledge of the IMs .
But it does not ask for an investigation -- and , in fact , would expressly exclude an investigation -- into the actions or inaction of anyone ( such as Hastert and several other key GOP Congressmen ) who knew about the e-mails sent by Foley along with other information strongly suggesting that Foley was a predator .
Thus , Hastert has overtly excluded from his request for an DOJ investigation the key issue at the heart of this scandal -- namely , whether House GOP leaders had reason to suspect that Foley was a predator and yet failed to investigate or take action .
The premise of Hastert 's letter is that the only issue worth investigating is whether someone specifically knew of the more explicit IMs , and that anyone who did not know of those IMs by definition has done nothing wrong , even if -- as is true for Hastert -- there was ample other information they knew of regarding Foley 's conduct .
This is how Hastert defines what ought to be investigated ( emphasis added ) : Hastert has defined the relevant issues in such a way as to ensure that he and his House allies would be excluded from the investigation just as long as they managed to avoid learning about the IMs specifically .
But the scandal here is that Hastert and friends deliberately avoided investigating the glaring signs that Foley was sexually pursuing pages .
If Hastert avoided learning about the IMs , it is because he and his House allies purposely chose to look the other way .
Hastert 's letter seeks to reward himself for that failure by proclaiming from the start that anyone who did not discover the IMs should be deemed from the beginning to have done nothing wrong -- even if they did not learn of the IMs because they avoided looking into this matter , and even if they had ample other reason to suspect that Foley was a predator but did nothing .
Hastert is one of the key figures at the center of this scandal .
Why would anyone think that he of all people can define the terms of what the investigation ought to include ?
And who is going to let him get away with defining the issues here with the express intent of excluding himself and his allies and their core wrongdoing from the investigation ?
And given that it is the President 's closest and most loyal political allies whose conduct is at the heart of this scandal , is anyone really going to trust Alberto Gonzales ' DOJ to conduct a real investigation or play along with the charade that everything is taken care of now that Gonzales is on the case and that there is therefore no reason for anyone to do anything futher ?
It is critical to keep in mind what this scandal is about and what it is not about .
It is true that there are legal and criminal aspects to this scandal , but legal issues here are secondary at most .
This is not a case involving complex federal criminal statutes or debates over whether enough evidence can be compiled demonstrating that GOP House leaders broke the law .
Instead , the issue is one of political corruption and lack of character -- the fact that the GOP House leadership is so devoted to preservation of its own power that they are willing to do anything , no matter how corrupt or repugnant , to cling to that power .
The behavior of the GOP House leadership here is reprehensible and intolerable even if they are able to avoid criminal prosecution for it .
That point , after all , was supposedly the centerpiece of Republican rule in Washington , according to the President :
Even worse than Hastert 's deliberate exclusion of the real issue here from the scope of the investigation he requested is the real purpose of his letter -- which is to trigger a criminal investigation and prosecution by the Bush - controlled Justice Department of those in the media and elsewhere who revealed to the American public that the GOP House leadership was protecting a predator in their midst .
This is what Hastert requested the DOJ investigate : While excluding himself from the investigation , Hastert wants it known that anyone who had knowledge of Foley 's IM 's -- in the media , watchdog groups , or even other pages and their families -- will be subject to this DOJ investigation if they failed to come forward earlier .
With the issuance of Hastert 's letter , everyone with additional information about Foley 's activities will think twice , at least , about coming forward now , which is a central reason why Hastert wrote and then released this letter .
As this reader email sent to TPM ( and to me ) astutely pointed out , Hastert 's letter is plainly designed to advance the original cover - up -- not to get to the bottom of what happened here -- by : ( a ) excluding the conduct of Hastert and his allies from the DOJ investigation ; ( b ) enabling him to block a real investigation by the Ethics Committee or an outside investigator by claiming that the DOJ is now investigating ; ( c ) triggering a " lock - down " of information on the Hill by enabling or forcing members and staffers not to speak further about a " pending DOJ investigation " ; ( d ) intimidating those who exposed Hastert and his allies by triggering a criminal prosecution against them ; ( e ) transforming the issue from Hastert and company 's reckless and reprehensible cover - up to whether federal criminal laws were violated ; and ( f ) deterring and intimidating those who might come forth with more information about Foley by creating the fear that they , too , will now be investigated by the DOJ .
Political leaders -- especially ones whose party controls all facets of the government -- have the ability to engage in wrongdoing and then use the power of their office to conceal that wrongdoing .
That is why -- especially when we live under one - party rule -- we critically depend upon watchdogs , whistle - blowers and the media to expose that wrongdoing .
That is the only line of defense the public has to prevent political leaders from concealing their misconduct .
Our system of government depends on exposure of that sort .
We simply cannot tolerate political officials who get caught engaging in wrongdoing thereafter using the power of their offices to intimidate , threaten and prosecute those who expose their misconduct or disclose politically embarrassing information about them .
But that is exactly what Hastert is trying to accomplish with his letter .
It is truly scandalous in itself that having been caught ignoring a predator in his party for purely political reasons , Hastert 's first reaction is to try to induce Alberto Gonazles 's Justice Department to use its vast law enforcement powers to pursue those who exposed him , thereby intimidating others who might come forward with more information .
That is thuggish behavior of the worst kind , but it is what the administration and their allies have done time and again against anyone in the media or elsewhere who acts to expose their misconduct .
The media should not be deceived into thinking that Hastert 's letter is some sort of effort to have the Justice Department find out what happened here .
The intent is the opposite .
Hastert 's letter should be understood and reported as what it is -- an effort to advance his cover - up and prevent his actions from undergoing real scrutiny .
That is what corrupt political leaders instinctively do : they block examination of their conduct and intimidate those who would expose their wrongdoing .
That is what the Bush administration and their allies have been doing for the last five years over and over and over and it is plainly what Hastert is trying to do here . : Credit to Nancy Pelosi , who sees exactly what Hastert is up to and is emphatically pointing it out , just as she ( and the media ) should be doing : " Jennifer Crider , a spokeswoman for Ms. Pelosi , said Mr. Hastert seemed ' more concerned by who revealed the Republican leadership ’s cover - up of Mr. Foley ’s Internet stalking ” than about the pages . ' "
More than any of my math songs , this one has gone through ( and been published in ) many versions ( thanks to helpful suggestions by folks like Art Benjamin — thanks , Art ! ) so this version may differ from the one in the journal you happen to be looking at .
Here is the version I consider friendly to more audiences and it won an international songwriting contest sponsored by the National Museum of Mathematics in honor of “ Pi Day of the Century ” , 3/14/15 :
“ American Pi ”
lyric © 1997 - 2015 Lawrence Mark Lesser ; all rights reserved
Prologue : A long , long time ago I can still remember
How that math sure used to make me smile .
And I knew if I had my chance , I would ace geometry class
And make my parents happy for a while .
But some math books made me shiver --
Dry procedures , all delivered :
Nothing past the rational , and nothing transcendental .
I ca n’t remember if I cried , reading 3.14159 …
But something touched me deep inside
The day I learned of pi… so :
CHORUS : Find , find the value of pi , starts 3.14159 ...
A good ol ' fraction you may hope to define ,
But the decimal never dies , never repeats or dies … .
In the Bible we do see the circle ratio appears as 3 ,
Or a little more ....
That genius Archimedes found with polygons , an upper bound
Of 22/7 for sure !
The Chinese got it really keen : three - five - five over one thirteen !
More joined the action with continued fractions .
In the 1700s , my oh my , the English coined the symbol π ,
Then Lambert proved that you and I can’t find rational pi .
He started singing ..... ( Repeat Chorus )
Late 1800s , Lindemann shared why a circle ca n’t be squared
But some folks tried anyway --
Like the Indiana doctor who said pi was 4 or 3.2
And thought his proof should be a law someday .
The Indiana congressmen
Read his paper there and then
A bill got through the House by a vote unanimous !
But in the end , the statesmen cried , “ It ’s not for us to decide ! ”
So the bill was left to die like the quest for rational pi .
Let ’s try singing .... ( Repeat Chorus )
And here is a longer version :
“ American Pi ”
lyric © 1997 - 2015 Lawrence Mark Lesser ; all rights reserved
May be sung to the tune of Don McLean ’s “ American Pie ”
Prologue : A long , long time ago I can still remember
How that math sure used to make me smile .
And I knew if I had my chance , I would ace geometry class
And make my parents happy for a while .

Good ol ’ boys gave it a try ,
But the decimal never dies , the decimal never dies … .
In the Bible we do see the circle ratio appears as three ,

Find , find the value of pi
Twice 11 over 7 is a mighty fine try
A good ol ’ fraction you might hope to supply ,
But the decimal never dies , never repeats or dies …
Late 1800s , Lindemann shared why a circle ca n’t be squared

Find , find the value of pi
Buffon ’s needle popped the bubble of that ol ’ doctor ’s try
A good ol ’ fraction could not be supplied
‘ Cause the decimal never dies , never repeats or dies … .
That doctor ’s pi in the sky dreams may not look so extreme
‘ Cause we long believed
Deductive systems could be complete and there was one true geometry .
Now when it comes to pi , we test the best machines to find
Many trillion places that so far lack pattern ’s traces .
It ’s great when we can truly see math as human history --
That adds curiosity ...... easy as pi !
Let ’s all try singing .....
Find , find the value of pi

A good ol ’ fraction you might hope to define
But the decimal never dies , never repeats or dies …..

フセインが12月30日、バクダッドで絞首刑に処せられた。その最後の様子をCNNは以下の記事で伝えている。
" Hussein buried in same cemetery as sons " （訳：息子と同じ墓地に葬られるフセイン）
http://megalodon.jp/?url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/12/31/hussein.funeral/index.html&date=20070102020854
ところが、この報道に対して、イラクに住むリバー・ベントと名乗る女性が激しく批判を繰り広げている。ここで注目すべきは、リバー・ベントは通常の意味でのジャーナリストではなく、たんにテレビでフセインの処刑を見た、一介の視聴者であるという点だ。もし彼女がイラクのどこにでもいる視聴者と一線を画する部分があったとすれば、それは彼女が英語によってブログを書き継いでいたことだろう。
「 リンチ（私刑）．．．」（日本語訳）
http://megalodon.jp/?url=http://www.geocities.jp/riverbendblog/&date=20070102021055
" A Lynching ... " （原文英語 ）
[ http://megalodon.jp/?url=http://www.riverbendblog.blogspot.com/&date=20070102021341
世界最大級の報道機関であるCNNと、市井のイラク人の書くもののどちらの言い分が信用に足るものか、ここでは両者の記事を読み比べてみようと思う。
まずCNNは、目撃者の証言として判事ムニール・ハッダードの以下のような言葉を伝えている。
（拙訳）縄の輪がフセインの首の回りに締められたので、執行者のうちの1人は「ムクタダ・アッ＝サドル万歳」と叫びました、そうアダッドが言いました。（中略）彼が死ぬ前に、フセイン（スンニ派）は1つの最後のフレーズを口にしました。ばかにした調子で「ムクタダ・アッ＝サドル」と言いました。
（原文 ）Hussein , a Sunni , uttered one last phrase before he died , saying " Muqtada al - Sadr " in a mocking tone , according to Haddad 's account .
これに対して、リバー・ベントは以下のように反論する。
（翻訳サイトから）リークされたビデオでは、「ムクタダ・アッ＝サドル万歳」と大声で言ったのは死刑執行人ではなかった。どう、これがマーリキー政権のもうひとつの救いようのない下劣さよ。彼らは自分たちに好都合な野次馬たちを処刑の場に居合わさせていたのよ。マーリキーは、彼らは「裁判の証人たち」だと主張したけど、彼らは明らかに野次るための人間だった。
サダムの首の周りに輪縄が巻きつけられるとすぐに、彼らは唱和し始めた。「モハンマドと彼の家族の上に神のご加護あれ．．．」その他うまく聞き取れなかったけれど（でもとても組織的だった）、続いて「ムクタダ、ムクタダ、ムクタダ！」と。彼らのひとりがサッダームに大声で叫んだ。「地獄へ行け… 」
( アラビア語で ) 。サッダームは軽蔑して下を向いて言った。「ヒヤ ハイル マルジャラー… ? 」
「 それがおまえの男らしさか?」というような意味だ。
（原文 ）From the video that was leaked , it was not an executioner who yelled " long live Muqtada al - Sadr " .
See , this is another low the Maliki government sunk to - they had some hecklers conveniently standing by during the execution .
Maliki claimed they were " some witnesses from the trial " , but they were , very obviously , hecklers .
The moment the noose was around Saddam 's neck , they began chanting , in unison , " God 's prayers be on Mohamed and on Mohamed 's family … "
Something else I did n't quite catch ( but it was very coordinated ) , and then " Muqtada , Muqtada , Muqtada ! "
One of them called out to Saddam , " Go to hell … " ( in Arabic ) .
Saddam looked down disdainfully and answered " Heya hay il marjala… ? " which is basically saying , " Is this your manhood … ? " .
つまり、彼女の報告によれば、フセイン自身は「ムクタダ・アッ＝サドル」などと言ってはいない。また、かなり一方的な立場の人を多く集めたなかで刑が執行されたことが伺える。これはCNNの報道では分からないことだ。また、分からないことと言えば、（これは引用部分外だが）刑の執行は本来なら血で汚してはならないイスラムの祭事期間の最初の日におこなわれた。これは信仰深い市民の心を乱すには十分なことのはずだが、やはりCNNはじめ各報道機関はこれについて一言もふれていない。
さて、CNNはつづけて、上記の他に「フセインは恐怖にかられていた」と語る目撃者もいたと言う。それがイラクの国家の安全アドバイザー、ムワーファク・アッ＝ルバーイだ。彼は以下のように言ったという。
（拙訳） 「彼は、壊れた人間でした」アッ＝ルバーイが言いました。「彼は怖がっていました。彼の顔には恐れを見ることができました」
（原文 ）" He was a broken man , " al - Rubaie said .
" He was afraid .
You could see fear in his face . "
このアッ＝ルバーイの証言について、リバー・ベントは以下のように反論する。
（翻訳サイトから）ムワーファク・アッ＝ルバーイは「サッダームは弱々しく怯えていた」と言った。ルバーイは違う私刑を見たらしい。なぜなら、リークされたビデオによれば、彼は全く怯えていなかったもの。彼の声は震えてなどいなくて、黒い覆面を被るのを拒否した。
彼は、運命を享受しているように見え、野次られている時には相変わらず挑戦的に見えた。
（原文 ）Muwafaq Al Rubai was said he was " weak and frightened " .
Apparently , Rubai saw a different lynching because according to the video they leaked , he did n't look frightened at all .
His voice did n't shake and he refused to put on the black hood .
He looked resigned to his fate , and during the heckling he looked as defiant as ever .
両者の記事を読み比べる限り、私にはリバー・ベントの言うことの方が本当のことを伝えているように思える。なによりも、彼女の言葉は単純でストレートで、作為が感じられない。彼女は見たままを書いているに過ぎないのだろう。一方でCNNは取材の常道として多くの証言を集めようとしている様子は分かるが、それは全体を俯瞰するためと言うよりも、自分の主観を裏付けるためのように思えるのである。もちろん、このように感じること自体、私の主観であるには相違ないが。
さて、では日本の新聞では、これについてどのように報じているのか。
幹部らが報道機関に語った話によると、元大統領はイスラム教の聖典コーランを持って刑に臨んだ。目隠しは拒み、執行直前に「神は偉大なり。国家は勝利に満ち、パレスチナはアラブのものだ」と叫んだという。
立ち会ったイラク政府のルバイエ国家安全保障担当顧問は米ＣＮＮテレビに「彼はすっかり弱っていた。おびえが顔に出ていた。奇妙なまでに従順だった」と証言した。米国人は立ち会わず、イスラム教の聖職者も呼ばれなかったという。
マリキ首相のアスカリ政治顧問によると、元大統領は「最後の言葉」を問われると「神は偉大なり。イラクは勝利するだろう。パレスチナはアラブのものだ」と叫んだという。米誌ニューズウィーク電子版によると、元大統領は覆面姿の執行人に絞首台に導かれながら「こいつらはテロリストだ」とつぶやいたとされる。
後ろ手にされた元大統領は、男の説明に何事かを答えた後、ゆっくりと前へ進む。黒い布を首に巻き付けられ、その上から太い麻縄をかけられた。元大統領は死刑囚の恐怖を取り除くために使われる黒いフードをかぶることを拒否したという。
ロイター通信によると、元大統領は執行の際「アラーのほかに神はなし」と、イスラム教の決まり文句を口にした。 米 ＣＮＮテレビによると、元大統領はイスラム教の聖典コーランを持参し、刑に臨んだ。米軍管理区域外で、米国人の立ち会いはなく、イラク人によりすべてが執り行われた。立ち会った当局者は死刑執行の後、遺体の周りで踊っている人々もいたと話した。
絞首台に立たされた元大統領は執行人らの罵（ののし）りに捨てぜりふを吐くなど、最後まで余裕を見せた。
映像では、太いロープを首に巻かれた元大統領が「おお神よ」とつぶやくと、複数の人物が大声で「ムクタダ、ムクタダ」と叫ぶ。高位法学者の父をフセイン政権に殺害されたイスラム教シーア派強硬指導者ムクタダ・サドル師を指すとみられる。これに対し元大統領は大きな笑みを浮かべながら、「この雑魚が」と応じた。
元大統領はこの直後、「アッラーのほかに神はなし。ムハンマドはアッラーの使徒である」とのイスラム教の信仰告白を繰り返し、２回目の「ムハンマド」を言った時に絞首台が落ちた。映像は、執行関係者が携帯電話カメラなどで私的に撮影したものとみられる。
CNNほどではないにしても、リバー・ベントが書くような「一方的な雰囲気」については、各紙はいずれも報じていないことに注意したい。むしろイラク政府が報じてほしいような記事だと言えるかも知れない。
私たちの世界で報じられることの多くは、（自戒をこめて書くのだが）誤解に基づく勘違いの所産だ。なぜなら我々人間は「見たいようにしか見ない」動物であるからだ。このことを、報じる側も読む側も、今一度肝に銘じる必要があるだろう。
以上、年頭に当たって、思うところを述べてみた。
Martin Hoffert ’s reddening face reflected either excitement or frustration – or perhaps both – as he explained why the United States desperately needs new sources of energy to avoid economic collapse and stave off the worst effects of global warming .
“ We need to try everything ! ” Hoffert said in an interview at New York University , where he is an emeritus professor of physics .
He described the issue of sustainability as a problem for humankind that requires broad technological solutions for both energy security and climate change .
While some of Hoffert ’s proposals sound like science fiction – satellites that would collect solar energy and beam it down to Earth , for instance – publications like Scientific American and Nature have turned to him as a climate science and energy expert .
Hoffert also testified before the House Committee on Government Reform in a September hearing on climate change technology .
In his testimony , he argued for a government - led program to find new energy sources that would be the modern - day equivalent of the “ Manhattan Project , ” which built the first atomic bomb , or the Apollo program that sent Americans to the moon during the 1960s .
“ Government has a role in funding until entrepreneurs take over , ” Hoffert said , referring to what he calls the “ Valley of Death ” period when a technology is too risky to attract private investment .
He has repeatedly called for the government to spend $ 10 - 20 billion annually to develop new sustainable energy sources , and believes that current technologies are inadequate for coping with future energy shortages and global warming .
Other scientists , however , say that the government should emphasize using current technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions associated with the global warming trend .
“ The best way to get a revolution in energy is to start with carbon mitigation , ” said Stephen Pacala , the director of the Princeton Environmental Institute , referring to projects that capture carbon dioxide or offset its production .
Pacala and Hoffert disagree on how quickly carbon dioxide emissions will rise , with Hoffert predicting a rise that will happen too fast for current carbon mitigation technologies to handle .
Hoffert ’s fervent belief in future engineering solutions arise partly from his unwavering passion for technology .
“ I ’m a geek , I love that stuff , ” he said .
At 68 , Hoffert has recently taken up the hobby of flying radio - controlled airplanes , something he wanted to do since age 13 .
Hoffert began his career as an aerospace engineer , but soon found himself attracted to environmental issues .
Working first at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Science and later at NYU in the 1970s , Hoffert became convinced that fossil fuel shortages and global warming , two crises just taking shape , could be a “ stimulus for alternative energy . ”
“ Energy and the environment are two sides of the same problem , ” Hoffert said .
His determination to pursue that problem has led him to cross disciplinary boundaries between physics , engineering , climatology , and eventually to enter the political arena arguing for new energy policies .
“ The average scientist says what is , and Marty says what ought to be , ” said Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution ’s Department of Global Ecology .
Caldeira , a climate expert who regards Hoffert as a scientific and personal mentor , speculated that the political difficulty of creating massive programs has lead other scientists to endorse more modest measures like curbing greenhouse gas emissions with expansions of existing technology .
But he said that Hoffert sees the consequences of climate change as disastrous and difficult to prevent without sweeping changes .
The Bush administration has embraced Hoffert ’s argument for future technological solutions , but primarily as an excuse to avoid carbon mitigation .
Hoffert , Caldeira and Pacala all disagree with the administration ’s current lack of action .
Pacala explained that while he and Hoffert emphasize different energy technologies , they both encourage a combination of immediate action and research on future energy solutions .
Hoffert sees the challenge of preventing climate change as a continuing opportunity both to further technologies like solar power and to overhaul the nation ’s electrical grid for improved efficiency and reduced vulnerability .
“ When I was a kid , I wanted others to listen to me because I thought I had all the right answers , ” Hoffert confided .
He ’s still talking to anyone who will listen .
Mr Bush does not face re-election in November - or ever .
Come January 2009 he is expected to be " clearing brush " full - time on his Texas retirement ranch .
But those who thought he would sit out this week 's Labour Day campaign season kick - off were way off target .
Despite his record low job approval ratings , he apparently believes his coat - tails can sweep others to victory .
That looks like an Iraq - sized gamble .
Bin Laden 's political comeback was sealed by no less than 17 name checks during a Bush speech in Washington on Tuesday .
Since declaring after the September 11 2001 attacks that he wanted him " dead or alive " , Mr Bush had tended to avoid mention of the al - Qaida leader for fear of reminding Americans of his failure to catch him .
Now the president has changed course , reportedly at the behest of Karl Rove , his chief strategist , and started talking up the global menace represented by the " enemy leader " .
In another positional shift , he asserted that Bin Laden , his followers and emulators were " not madmen ... they kill in the name of a clear and focused ideology , a set of beliefs that are evil but not insane " , he said .
That made them even more scary .
A threatening Bin Laden videotape released just before polling day in the 2004 presidential election is believed to have boosted Mr Bush 's lead over his opponent , John Kerry , by several points .
Perhaps the White House is calculating that the " Osama factor " will work for Republicans again as the Democrats attempt to exploit growing voter worries about terrorism .
Iraq is emerging as another deeply polarising issue compared with two years ago , when Democratic leaders were split and voters gave Mr Bush the benefit of the doubt .
The president used Bin Laden 's own words to justify his view that post - invasion instability was an integral part , rather than a principal cause , of the spreading " war on terror " .
" He [ Bin Laden ] calls it ' a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam ' , " Mr Bush said .
" For al - Qaida , Iraq is not a distraction from their war on America .
It is the central battlefield where the outcome of this struggle will be decided . "
On this last idea , both he and Bin Laden clearly agree .
Most Democrats now say Iraq was a disastrous blunder that has bred more terrorists and alienated Muslim opinion while weakening the US 's focus on the jihadis .
New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd was more scathing than most : " Instead of just admitting he bollixed [ sic ] up Iraq , W and his henchmen are ratcheting up , fusing enemies willy - nilly , running around giving speeches with the simplistic , black - helicopter paranoid message :
All those scary Arabs are in league to knock us off . "
In Tuesday 's speech , one of a series , Mr Bush portrayed the fight against Sunni Muslim extremists typified by al - Qaida in the starkest terms .
Their aim , he said , was nothing less than the destruction of America and the establishment of " a violent political utopia across the Middle East where all would be ruled according to their hateful ideology " .
Likening Bin Laden to Hitler , he said the aim was to " terrorise us and cause our economy to collapse " .
A report today published by the Chatham House thinktank offers a less alarmist assessment .
Like other recent studies , it concludes that al - Qaida has " lost support on the Muslim street " while " US - led globally coordinated security measures have seriously undermined al - Qaida 's communication , finance and recruitment networks " .
It also suggests that " al - Qaida 's image as a global player has been unintentionally enhanced by the US and its allies " .
The White House 's critics say the congressional campaign is witnessing a return of the scare tactics that have characterised the Bush years .
Democrats have been encouraged by polls suggesting they could regain control of the House of Representatives .
And public confidence in the Republicans ' ability to handle national security issues has fallen sharply since 2002 .
So now the battle over who can best protect America grows mean and dirty .
But the absurdity is that while one part of the Home Office has patiently collaborated across Whitehall on preventative strategies to stop human trafficking , and how to protect the intensely vulnerable individuals caught up in the trade , another part of the Home Office has put forward a package of measures on migration which include a proposal to do the exact reverse .
It 's the kind of one step forward , one step backward form of policy making which leaves campaigners in despair .
The place to understand the issue properly is at the support organisation for domestic migrant workers , Kalayaan .
Its offices are in a little alley tucked behind the beautiful stucco houses of Holland Park that gleam with wealth .
As London 's plutocracy booms , fuelled by the influx of an international elite , the stories of the women I met there represent the seamy underside of London 's new position as global metropolis .
Take Maggie .
A young west African woman , she came to the UK three years ago with her employers .
She looked after their children every day until late in the evening but was never paid - her employers claimed she had to pay back her air fare .
In addition , her employers made her go out to work as a cleaner every day - and took her wages .
Maggie opens her diary where she has kept an account of the thousands of pounds she has had to give them .
What trapped her in this forced labour was that her employers refused to hand over her passport unless she paid £ 4,000 .
A few months ago she ran away .
Or take Rina .
An Indian woman with a broad smile and a tragic story of abuse in two families .
Long hours , little food to eat and even , she admits , rape in her last job .
But with her extended family in India dependent on her remittances , she can't return home .
She now cares for an elderly woman with dementia seven nights a week .
She has nowhere to live and spends the days on the street or in the local church .
These are the kinds of women that the government 's proposal will affect .
It 's a few thousand perhaps - but the proposal is likely to lead to gut - wrenching suffering because it affects one of the most vulnerable forms of employment - domestic migrant work .
Hidden in the privacy of the home , cut off from any kind of wider social contact , these women have working lives that are impossible to regulate .
They often work punishingly long hours for low pay and little food : 60 - or 70 - hour weeks are common .
With little knowledge of the UK , they are dependent on their employers to ensure that their visa and tax status is legal and it's a dependence some employers ruthlessly use to exploit them .
All of this the government seemed to have recognised back in 1998 when , after years of campaigning and with a lot of backbench support , the new Labour government pushed through a small but crucially important measure for these domestic migrant workers : they were given that most basic of employment rights - the right to change their employer .
They no longer had the bleak choice of remaining with abusive and exploitative employers , or facing illegality and deportation .
Providing they were still in full - time domestic work , they could renew their 12 - month visas and stay in the UK .
As Maggie 's and Rina 's cases illustrate , this protection still does n't prevent abusive employment , but at least it provides a legal option to leave it .
Wind the tape on nine years and even this minimum protection is to be withdrawn this autumn .
The thinking is that such unskilled labour is no longer required from outside the EU and that the new accession countries can provide cheap domestic labour .
But the government is not going to stop all non-EU domestic migrant work - that might compromise the attractiveness of the UK to those rich , often highly skilled employers who bring them in ( the same consideration weighed on Tory policy in the 90s ) .
So the nonsensical compromise proposal in the government 's Making Migration Work for Britain policy is that domestic migrant workers can come to the UK with their employers but they can't change jobs - and they can only stay for six months .
The thinking is that that 's enough time to train up an eastern European before sending the Indonesian or Sri Lankan nanny home .
The policy may make sense in the corridors of the Home Office , but it ignores the fact that there is a growing demand for carers in the UK , for both children and older people , and young eastern Europeans do n't fill all the vacancies , particularly for the difficult work of caring for those with dementia .
Meanwhile the supply of migrant workers in the developing world desperate for such work is enormous .
With both a strong demand and an equally buoyant supply , the fear is that the policy will simply force employment underground into all the problems of exploitation that dogged it through the 80s and 90s .
Such is the difficulty of recruiting flexible decent childcare or elder care , employers will be prepared to dodge the immigration rules and migrant domestic workers will find themselves trapped in illegal employment .
The desperate stories of Maggie and Rina are evident in millions of households across the world ; one of the most valuable exports of many developing countries is the caring labour of women .
Remittances from nationals working abroad are worth more to some countries than aid .
But this trade of care is almost always accompanied by virtually zero employment protection - old stereotypes about this being women 's work and not real labour still linger .
In 1998 , Britain was regarded as a pioneer for the modest measure it introduced .
Canada is one of several countries which has attempted to provide some protection since .
Nine years on , Barbara Roche , who implemented the measure as a Home Office minister after campaigning for such women as an MP in opposition , wonders how the history could be forgotten and the progress reversed .
At a point when we are trying to reckon with the history of 200 years ago , it would make a nonsense of our professed good intentions if we can't stretch our memory back less than a decade .
Perhaps it 's so easy to forget the plight of these women because the Maggies and Rinas are invisible - indistinguishable on the street or supermarket , and most of the time , discreetly working behind front doors .
Just remember that the polish on London 's mansions ' brass knobs and the scrupulously scrubbed front steps were done by someone .

Women Want To Connect .
Men Want To Score. by Eric Disco
The music is banging .
Everybody is partying .
People dancing on tables .
The place is madness .
Spring Break Miami .
And it ’s St. Patrick ’s Day on top of that .
It does n’t get any crazier than this .
And then I see her .
She has dark hair , almost a latin look .
With a tight striped grey shirt .
Our eyes meet .
I watch as she walks past .
I want her so bad .
I stroll over to the bar to grab a drink .
And then I see her .
A different girl .
She ’s wearing a tight black dress .
Long dark hair .
Carrying on on the dance floor .
My friend pulls me outside .
And then I see her .
A different girl …
Yeah , it pretty much goes on like this all night .
I ’m a guy .
It would n’t take that much for one of these cuties to pull me into the bathroom and have sex with me right there .
Ha ha ha , I ’m a slut , as the guys would joke .
Women though , do n’t seem to be geared the same way .
In her book , The Female Brain , Louann Brizendine talks about the difference between the female and male brain :
When girls and boys first hit their teen years , estrogen floods the female brain , females start to focus intensely on their emotions and on communication –talking on the phone and connecting with their girlfriends at the mall .
At the same time , as testosterone takes over the male brain , boys grow less communicative and become obsessed about scoring –in games , and in the backseat of a car …
Connecting through talking activates the pleasure centers in a girl ’s brain .
Sharing secrets that have romantic and sexual implications activates those centers even more .
We ’re not talking about a small amount of pleasure .
This is huge .
It ’s a major dopamine and oxytocin rush , which is the biggest , fattest neurological reward you can get outside of an orgasm .
Dopamine stimulates the motivation and pleasure circuits in the brain .
Estrogen at puberty increases dopamine and oxytocin production for girls .
Oxytocin is a neurohormone that triggers and is triggered by intimacy .
Intimacy releases more oxytocin , which reinforces the desire to connect , and connecting then brings a sense of pleasure and well - being .
What am I trying to say , guys , you gotta chat up the ladies if you want to sleep with them ?
Not quite .
I ’m a guy .
I know I ’m a hornball .
I ’ve got sex on the brain .
Every other minute I ’m thinking about it .
And get me around other guys and I get caught up in the need to score .
I ’m a guy and love to accomplish things and prove myself , including sleeping with women .
I ’m seduced by the idea of a guy who can walk into a club and leave with any woman he wants .
Part of my brain says to me “ Now THAT’S an accomplishment ! ”
It ’s easy to get drunk on sex and ego gratification .
Sex is great .
It ’s AWESOME .
But actually having feelings for someone – that ’s the good stuff .
The most passionate sex I ’ve had pales in comparison to having a true deep yearning desire for the woman I ’m with .
It pales in comparison to connecting in a deep and genuine way .
Telling her something I ’ve never told anyone before .
Maybe something I never realized about myself .
Feeling like that person is unique out of every other girl out there .
That she is irreplaceable .
Maybe if I could remember that for a minute I could stop being the dog that I am .
As the DJ continues to spin and the party intensifies , I start to feel tired .
Perhaps I ’m tired of the casual hookups .
Perhaps I want something more , I think to myself as I turn toward the door .
And then I see her .

President Bush confirmed Sunday that he would be sending thousands of new support troops to Iraq and Afghanistan , in addition to the previously announced “ surge ” of 21,500 combat troops .
At a news conference in Colombia , Bush said that an increase in support troops for Iraq had been anticipated from the start , and that his initial figure referred only to combat troops .
“ Those combat troops are going to need some support , ” Bush said .
“ And that ’s what the American people are seeing in terms of Iraq , the support troops necessary to help the reinforcements do their job .
My hope , of course , is that Congress provides the funding necessary for the combat troops to be able to do their job , without any strings attached . ”
Late Saturday , while Bush was in Uruguay , the White House released the text of a request from the president to Congress to provide funding for the additional support troops , including a previously unannounced boost of 3,500 troops for Afghanistan .
Those troops would be in addition to the 3,200 - member brigade combat team whose deployment in Afghanistan has been extended .

National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the $ 3.2 billion requested in the letter would pay for the 3,500 troops for Afghanistan , as well as the deployment to Iraq of 2,400 combat support troops , 2,200 military police and 129 troops for provincial reconstruction teams .
“ In terms of Afghanistan , I did announce , as a result of a review of our policy , an additional 3,200 troops , ” Bush explained during the news conference .
“ But in addition to that , the troops that you ’re referring to are going to be part of a training and embedding mission that I did also discuss during that strategy , although I did n’t have any details of the troops . ”
“ In quantum mechanics , you typically have arguments about locality and non-locality , ” Yuji Hasegawa tells PhysOrg.com .
“ But in our experiment we are testing correlation between degrees of freedom . ”
Hasegawa , a scientist affiliated with the Atominstitut der Österreichischen Universitäten and PRESTO at the Japan Science and Technology Agency , feels that the most recent experiment undertaken by him and his colleagues will offer a new way to look at questions involving quantum information processing .
The results of the experiment appear in Physical Review Letters with the title “ Quantum Contextuality in a Single - Neutron Optical Experiment . ”
Hasegawa explains that photons are most often used in quantum information technology , but that he hopes that this recent experiment , which is fundamental in nature , will contribute to the consideration of different quantum systems , including neutrons , for quantum information processing .
Hasegawa and his colleagues , Rudolf Loidl and Matthias Baron from the Atominstitut and from the Institut Laue Langevin in France , and Gerald Badurek and Helmut Rauch at the Atominstitut , suggest that noncontextual theories involving neutrons are clearly violated with the results of this experiment .
This most recent experiment is related to a paper published in 2003 in the journal Nature .
In the previous paper , Hasegawa and his colleagues address Bell - like inequalities found in neutrons .
However , with this new experiment the Kochen - Specker theorem is tackled , looking at quantum contextuality :
“ We use a neutron interferometer , and the Schrödinger equation represents our phenomena .
We wanted to show a contradiction in noncontextual theories .
We wanted to show a prediction in quantum mechanics .
There ’s a contradiction in Kochen - Specker with photons , and we wanted to show it with neutrons . ”
Hasegawa explains that the experiment took place at Institut Laue Langevin ( ILL ) in France , with the largest reactor in the world , and made use of polarized neutron beams split inside the interferometer .
With some manipulation , observations of three separate products were measured .
After the analysis was performed , the values were found to be outside the limits predicted by noncontextual hidden variable theory .
The contradiction was found .
There is no way to obtain a completely ideal experimental situation , Hasegawa admits , but the interferometer was key to the experiment .
“ Our neutron interferometer experiment is one of the best suited for such a fundamental experiment . ”
He also points out that single neutrons were used .
“ Instead of two particles as usually used in two - photon entanglement experiments , ” Hasegawa says , “ we used two degrees of freedom in single particles . ”
Even though entanglement between different particles is considered essential for their use in quantum information processing , this does not appear to be the case with single - neutrons .
With the use of entanglement between degrees of freedoms in this experiment , Hasegawa believes that single particles are good candidates for quantum information processing : “ This neutron case is completely different from the photon case , ” he says .
“ They have mass and spins and obey Schrödinger equation .
This experiment shows that they can probably be used for information processing as well as for fundamental research in quantum mechanics just like photons . ”
Hasegawa continues : “ I hope that this fundamental experiment can help with further technical development in quantum information processing . ”

Patrick Dempsey noticed that a Grey ’s Anatomy crewmember looked pale , and he asked him what was wrong .
The man said that he felt dizzy , but that he would be ok shortly .
Dempsey told him that he was calling an ambulance right away , and it ’s a good thing , because the guy had a life - threatening blood clot in his leg !
CALLING DR .
McDREAMY !
Just days before PATRICK DEMPSEY got attacked and choked by costar ISAIAH “ Dr. McJealous ” WASHINGTON on the “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” set , Dempsey spotted a crewmember hanging onto a pole , looking white as a doc ’s smock !
“ What ’s wrong ? ” he asked – and when the guy admitted he was dizzy and could n’t feel his legs , the star yelled to a staffer : “ Call an ambulance … NOW ! ”
The stricken guy protested , but Dempsey and a crewmember carried him to a lounge chair .
Paramedics arrived swiftly , took vital signs … and hustled him to Emergency .
Turns out he was seriously ill , suffering from a blood clot in his leg that could have traveled and killed him if he had n’t gotten fast treatment .
( Good work , McDreamy !

Twenty - three years ago , an American philosophy professor named James Flynn discovered a remarkable trend : Average IQ scores in every industrialized country on the planet had been increasing steadily for decades .
Despite concerns about the dumbing - down of society - the failing schools , the garbage on TV , the decline of reading - the overall population was getting smarter .
And the climb has continued , with more recent studies showing that the rate of IQ increase is accelerating .
Next to global warming and Moore 's law , the so - called Flynn effect may be the most revealing line on the increasingly crowded chart of modern life - and it's an especially hopeful one .
We still have plenty of problems to solve , but at least there 's one consolation :
Our brains are getting better at problem - solving .
Unless you happen to think the very notion of IQ is bunk .
Anyone who has read Stephen Jay Gould 's The Mismeasure of Man or Howard Gardner 's work on multiple intelligences or any critique of The Bell Curve is liable to dismiss IQ as merely phrenology updated , a pseudoscience fronting for a host of racist and elitist ideologies that dare not speak their names .
These critics attack IQ itself - or , more precisely , what intelligence scholar Arthur Jensen called g , a measure of underlying " general " intelligence .
Psychometricians measure g by performing a factor analysis of multiple intelligence tests and extracting a pattern of correlation between the measurements .
( IQ is just one yardstick . )
Someone with greater general intelligence than average should perform better on a range of different tests .
Unlike some skeptics , James Flynn did n't just dismiss g as statistical tap dancing .
He accepted that something real was being measured , but he came to believe that it should be viewed along another axis : time .
You can't just take a snapshot of g at one moment and make sense of it , Flynn says .
You have to track its evolution .
He did just that .
Suddenly , g became much more than a measure of mental ability .
It revealed the rising trend line in intelligence test scores .
And that , in turn , suggested that something in the environment - some social or cultural force - was driving the trend .
Significant intellectual breakthroughs - to paraphrase the John Lennon song - are what happen when you 're busy making other plans .
So it was with Flynn and his effect .
He left the US in the early 1960s to teach moral philosophy at the University of Otaga in New Zealand .
In the late ' 70s , he began exploring the intellectual underpinnings of racist ideologies .
" And I thought : Oh , I can do a bit about the IQ controversies , " he says .
" And then I saw that Arthur Jensen , a scholar of high repute , actually thought that blacks on average were genetically inferior - which was quite a shock .
I should say that Jensen was beyond reproach - he 's certainly not a racist .
And so I thought I 'd better look into this . "
This inquiry led to a 1980 book , Race , IQ , and Jensen , that posited an environmental - not genetic - explanation for the black - white IQ gap .
After finishing the book , Flynn decided that he would look for evidence that blacks were gaining on whites as their access to education increased , and so he began studying US military records , since every incoming member of the armed forces takes an IQ test .
Sure enough , he found that blacks were making modest gains on whites in intelligence tests , confirming his environmental explanation .
But something else in the data caught his eye .
Every decade or so , the testing companies would generate new tests and re-normalize them so that the average score was 100 .
To make sure that the new exams were in sync with previous ones , they'd have a batch of students take both tests .
They were simply trying to confirm that someone who tested above average on the new version would perform above average on the old , and in fact the results confirmed that correlation .
But the data also brought to light another pattern , one that the testing companies ignored .
" Every time kids took the new and the old tests , they did better on the old ones , " Flynn says .
" I thought : That 's weird . "
The testing companies had published the comparative data almost as an afterthought .
" It did n't seem to strike them as interesting that the kids were always doing better on the earlier test , " he says .
" But I was new to the area . "
He sent his data to the Harvard Educational Review , which dismissed the paper for its small sample size .
And so Flynn dug up every study that had ever been done in the US where the same subjects took a new and an old version of an IQ test .
" And lo and behold , when you examined that huge collection of data , it revealed a 14 - point gain between 1932 and 1978 . "
According to Flynn 's numbers , if someone testing in the top 18 percent the year FDR was elected were to time - travel to the middle of the Carter administration , he would score at the 50th percentile .
When Flynn finally published his work in 1984 , Jensen objected that Flynn 's numbers were drawing on tests that reflected educational background .
He predicted that the Flynn effect would disappear if one were to look at tests - like the Raven Progressive Matrices - that give a closer approximation of g , by measuring abstract reasoning and pattern recognition and eliminating language altogether .
And so Flynn dutifully collected IQ data from all over the world .
All of it showed dramatic increases .
" The biggest of all were on Ravens , " Flynn reports with a hint of glee still in his voice .
The trend Flynn discovered in the mid-'80s has been investigated extensively , and there 's little doubt he 's right .
In fact , the Flynn effect is accelerating .
US test takers gained 17 IQ points between 1947 and 2001 .
The annual gain from 1947 through 1972 was 0.31 IQ point , but by the '90s it had crept up to 0.36 .
Though the Flynn effect is now widely accepted , its existence has in turn raised new questions .
The most fundamental :
Why are measures of intelligence going up ?
The phenomenon would seem to make no sense in light of the evidence that g is largely an inherited trait .
We 're certainly not evolving that quickly .
The classic heritability research paradigm is the twin adoption study : Look at IQ scores for thousands of individuals with various forms of shared genes and environments , and hunt for correlations .
This is the sort of chart you get , with 100 being a perfect match and 0 pure randomness :
The same person tested twice : 87
Identical twins raised together : 86
Identical twins raised apart : 76
Fraternal twins raised together : 55
Biological siblings : 47
Parents and children living together : 40
Parents and children living apart : 31
Adopted children living together : 0
Unrelated people living apart : 0
After analyzing these shifting ratios of shared genes and the environment for several decades , the consensus grew , in the '90s , that heritability for IQ was around 0.6 - or about 60 percent .
The two most powerful indications of this are at the top and bottom of the chart : Identical twins raised in different environments have IQs almost as similar to each other as the same person tested twice , while adopted children living together - shared environment , but no shared genes - show no correlation .
When you look at a chart like that , the evidence for significant heritability looks undeniable .
Four years ago , Flynn and William Dickens , a Brookings Institution economist , proposed another explanation , one made apparent to them by the Flynn effect .
Imagine " somebody who starts out with a tiny little physiological advantage :
He 's just a bit taller than his friends , " Dickens says .
" That person is going to be just a bit better at basketball . "
Thanks to this minor height advantage , he tends to enjoy pickup basketball games .
He goes on to play in high school , where he gets excellent coaching and accumulates more experience and skill .
" And that sets up a cycle that could , say , take him all the way to the NBA , " Dickens says .
Now imagine this person has an identical twin raised separately .
He , too , will share the height advantage , and so be more likely to find his way into the same cycle .
And when some imagined basketball geneticist surveys the data at the end of that cycle , he 'll report that two identical twins raised apart share an off - the - charts ability at basketball .
" If you did a genetic analysis , you 'd say : Well , this guy had a gene that made him a better basketball player , " Dickens says .
" But the fact is , that gene is making him 1 percent better , and the other 99 percent is that because he 's slightly taller , he got all this environmental support . "
And what goes for basketball goes for intelligence : Small genetic differences get picked up and magnified in the environment , resulting in dramatically enhanced skills .
" The heritability studies were n't wrong , " Flynn says .
" We just misinterpreted them . "
Dickens and Flynn showed that the environment could affect heritable traits like IQ , but one mystery remained :
What part of our allegedly dumbed - down environment is making us smarter ?
It 's not schools , since the tests that measure education - driven skills have n't shown the same steady gains .
It 's not nutrition - general improvement in diet leveled off in most industrialized countries shortly after World War II , just as the Flynn effect was accelerating .
Most cognitive scholars remain genuinely perplexed .
" I find it a puzzle and do n't have a compelling explanation , " wrote Harvard 's Steven Pinker in an email exchange .
" I suspect that it 's either practice at taking tests or perhaps a large number of disparate factors that add up to the linear trend . "
Flynn has his theories , though they 're still speculative .
" For a long time it bothered me that g was going up without an across - the - board increase in other tests , " he says .
If g measured general intelligence , then a long - term increase should trickle over into other subtests .
" And then I realized that society has priorities .
Let 's say we 're too cheap to hire good high school math teachers .
So while we may want to improve arithmetical reasoning skills , we just do n't .
On the other hand , with smaller families , more leisure , and more energy to use leisure for cognitively demanding pursuits , we may improve - without realizing it - on - the - spot problem - solving , like you see with Ravens . "
When you take the Ravens test , you 're confronted with a series of visual grids , each containing a mix of shapes that seem vaguely related to one another .
Each grid contains a missing shape ; to answer the implicit question posed by the test , you need to pick the correct missing shape from a selection of eight possibilities .
To " solve " these puzzles , in other words , you have to scrutinize a changing set of icons , looking for unusual patterns and correlations among them .
This is not the kind of thinking that happens when you read a book or have a conversation with someone or take a history exam .
But it is precisely the kind of mental work you do when you , say , struggle to program a VCR or master the interface on your new cell phone .
Over the last 50 years , we 've had to cope with an explosion of media , technologies , and interfaces , from the TV clicker to the World Wide Web .
And every new form of visual media - interactive visual media in particular - poses an implicit challenge to our brains :
We have to work through the logic of the new interface , follow clues , sense relationships .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , these are the very skills that the Ravens tests measure - you survey a field of visual icons and look for unusual patterns .
The best example of brain - boosting media may be videogames .
Mastering visual puzzles is the whole point of the exercise - whether it's the spatial geometry of Tetris , the engineering riddles of Myst , or the urban mapping of Grand Theft Auto .
The ultimate test of the " cognitively demanding leisure " hypothesis may come in the next few years , as the generation raised on hypertext and massively complex game worlds starts taking adult IQ tests .
This is a generation of kids who , in many cases , learned to puzzle through the visual patterns of graphic interfaces before they learned to read .
Their fundamental intellectual powers were n't shaped only by coping with words on a page .
They acquired an intuitive understanding of shapes and environments , all of them laced with patterns that can be detected if you think hard enough .
Their parents may have enhanced their fluid intelligence by playing Tetris or learning the visual grammar of TV advertising .
But that 's child 's play compared with Pokémon .

Its Time to Tell the Truth About the Health Benefits of Low - Dose Radiation by James Muckerheide muckerheide@comcast.net ( Full text of article from Summer 2000 21st Century ) Scientific Data Biased by Early Health Physics Goals How the LNT Myth Was Supported Radon : Misrepresenting the Data The Case of the Radium Dial Painters Occupational Studies Show No Adverse Effects The Case of BEIR V , 1990 Japanese Survivors Study More Misrepresentation : Fluoroscopy of Women with TB Evidence of Beneficial Effects Ignored or Suppressed Stimulating Health Benefits on the Cellular Level Time for Extreme Corrective Action How Radiation Is Measured Research Needed on Low - dose Radiation As a Treatment for AIDS Notes Metropolitan Edison
The myth that radiation is dangerous no matter how low the dose , has scared people about all things nuclear .
Here , a tour of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant .
Low - dose radiation is documented to be beneficial for human health but , for political reasons , radiation is assumed to be harmful at any dose .
Radiation - protection scientists , and others , who cover up the data that contradict present policy should be investigated for misconduct .
Low - dose radiation has been shown to enhance biological responses for immune systems , enzymatic repair , physiological functions , and the removal of cellular damage , including prevention and removal of cancers and other diseases .
Research on low - level radiation has also shown it to have no adverse effects .
Yet , current radiation protection policy and practice fail to consider these valid data , instead relying on data that are poor , ambiguous , misrepresented , and manipulated .
With no regard for the cost to scientific truth , and to taxpayers , radiation policy is based on the linear no -threshold ( LNT ) concept , that holds that radiation at any levels above zero is deleterious .
In the LNT view , the known damaging effects of high - dose radiation are linearly extrapolated down the dose scale .
LNT contradicts the scientific evidence , which shows that there is a radiation threshold , below which there is no harm and , in fact , there is benefit for human health , a process known as hormesis .
In defiance of this evidence , radiation - protection policy relies on falsification of the actual science research and reporting .
Such malfeasance warrants scientific misconduct investigations for the results promulgated by some radiation protection - funded scientists .
If we are to contribute to the health of the worlds population , we need to apply the data on the benefits of low - dose radiation in clinical settings .
Unfortunately , the research funded by the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) , and other research in the area of radiation - protection fail to address these essential biology and medicine objectives .
Therefore , research and data assessments must be conducted by independent researchers and organizations that are not dependent on radiation - protection - controlled funding , directed to address the health and medical science .
In particular , the U.S. National Institutes of Health Study Section on Radiation Research reviews , and therefore controls , most of the Federal radiation - related research , instead of relevant research being controlled by the specific disciplines , for example , immunology , genetics , and so on .
Since this Study Section is made up of current radiation protection - oriented researchers , it has substantially rejected research that pursues the relevant topics on the role of radiation in medicine , biology , and health .
It must be disbanded .
Biological and health research on radiation should be considered in the relevant biology and medicine research areas .
It is necessary to have organizations doing radiation research whose primary interest is in the health and successful treatment of real patients .
Further , independent assessment of the data must incorporate the scientists and analysts who have documented for decades that radiation health effects data can not be linear .
Rule - makings by government agencies must be conducted where conclusions on radiation health effects can be accountable , instead of hidden in unaccountable proceedings that fail even to respond to critical science and scientists ; such rule - making must also be subject to formal appeals for arbitrary and capricious agency decisions .
The beneficial results of low - level radiation can be readily confirmed by researchers committed to understanding the underlying role of radiation in health and medicine .
But radiation research journals and their peer - reviewers , dominated by radiation - protection - funded scientists , constrain publication of results that contradict radiation protection objectives .
Scientific Data Biased by Early Health Physics Goals
The bias against recognition of the benefits of low - dose radiation is not new .
In a March 1996 meeting at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) , Charles Willis of the NRC stated , as reported in the transcript : 1 . . .
[ I ] ts clear to many of us that we are not seeing the predicted ill effects at low doses , as has been pointed out to you .
I personally came to this hormesis observation fairly late in the game .
It wasnt until 1958 that I was working with the laboratory [ Oak Ridge National Laboratory ] situation where we were doing experiments with below background levels of radiation , taking the potassium - 40 out and seeing what the effects would be on the cellular level when we saw that the cells looked good but they didnt function .
So we couldnt publish the results , another ill effect of the paradigm about the linear hypothesis .
Potassium is an element that is essential to life .
However , about 0.012 percent of natural potassium is a radioactive isotope , potassium - 40 .
Potassium was processed to separate the potassium - 40 from natural potassium at Oak Ridge to conduct radiobiology experiments in the 1950s .
Dr. Willis confirms that radiation research , funded for radiation - protection objectives , supported the linear no - threshold concept by suppressing contrary scientific data , and that this activity dates back more than 40 years , to the 1950s .
At that time , animal studies using separated potassium were also conducted .
The animals were stated to have done poorly ,  but they recovered when the extracted potassium - 40 or natural potassium was added .
Such potential bias in radiation protection - based research and results should be confirmed or refuted , if we are serious about putting to use the benefits of low - dose radiation for human health .
The organisms placed in the potassium without potassium - 40 were biologically deficient .
This finding is consistent with those of a numerous and wide variety of experiments with organisms that have been shielded from background radiation .
For example , organisms grown on glass slides were repeatedly found to grow differently .
It was eventually found that those grown on slides that had lower thorium content , and hence lower radiation , were deficient .
The LNT precludes this accident from being known .
But , it will be known .
And those who suppressed the knowledge will also be known .
It has been extensively and consistently confirmed that supplemental radiation , above the natural background level , stimulates organisms , enhancing their growth and increasing their mean lifespans .
These experiments confirm that any data that contradict the LNT have not been adequately considered by radiation protection agencies and scientists .
In addition , many scientists who have been interested in conducting such research , and in publishing such results , were constrained in their efforts .
Such experience was reported by Dr. Jake Spalding of Los Alamos National Laboratory to Senator Pete Domenici in 1999.2
Such experience was also reported by Prof. Dr. Gunnar Walinder , the pre-eminent Swedish radiation scientist , about the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ( UNSCEAR ) in his 1995 book .
3
Walinder stated bluntly :  I do not hesitate to say that the LNT is the greatest scientific scandal of the 20th Century .
4
Among the many experiments showing the benefits of low - dose irradiation were those with laboratory animals that had whole immune systems ; it was found that at doses below tens of rads , to doses of thousands of rads , the animals had increased average lifespan and no adverse effects .
For example , Dr. Egon Lorenz of the National Cancer Institute reported in Manhattan Project records that mice were irradiated with 4.4 , 1.1 , 0.11 , and 0.044 [ rads ] per 24 - hr day .
...
Male mice conceived and living continuously under exposure to 4.4 r/24 - hr day up to total doses of over 2,000 r are comparable with non-irradiated mice as far as weight , coat , and activity are concerned .
Mammary tumor incidence is not significantly changed in mice exposed for 10 - 15 months to doses ranging from 4.4 to 0.44 r per 24 - hr day .
...
Subsequent generations , Lorenz said , living under exposure of 1.1 and 0.11 r per 24 - hr day show no damage to chromosomes as evidenced by the raising of 5 to 6 generations with normal litter size and an apparently normal life span .
5 Notwithstanding this reality , by 1950 , Dr. Lorenz states :
 It is well - known that absorption of ionizing radiation by tissues is connected with damage , no matter how small the dose ,  in a study that showed that whole mice had longer lifespans than controls in research that exposed the mice to chronic radiation at 0 . 11 r/day , or about 40 r/ year .
6 Marshall Brucer , M.D. , states with respect to the Manhattan Project : 7
Their first experiment , raising mice in an atmosphere of uranium dust , showed exposed mice lived longer than controls .
They set up an arbitrary Maximum Permissible Dose ( MPD ) after proving that mice in radiation fields 10 times the MPD lived longer than controls .
After World War II , Brucer writes , about 20 articles per year mentioned hormetic effects but : Health Physicists soon learned that their livelihood depended on scaring the pants off Congress .
Every Genetics budget meeting opened its request for funds with an anti-nuclear litany .
During the 1960s and 1970s about 40 articles / year described hormesis .
In 1963 , the AEC [ Atomic Energy Commission ] repeatedly confirmed lower mortality in guinea pigs , rats , and mice irradiated at low dose .
In 1964 , the cows exposed to about 150 rads after the Trinity A - bomb in 1946 were quietly euthanized because of extreme old age .
In 1981 , T.D. Luckey revived a very obvious radiation hormesis .
No experimental evidence of damage at low doses existed ; self - serving extrapolations from high dose - data dominated health physics . 7
In the May 1961 Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , Dr. Hugh Henry , then at Oak Ridge , reported on all low - dose studies ( defined as  to about 1 rad per day ! ) , saying that the results show consistent life - lengthening vs. neither life - shortening , nor genetic effects .
8
He reports on early animal studies that had hormetic effects from internal doses , for example , for uranium and plutonium injections , and feeding of uranium compounds , and for external ( gamma and X - radiation ) .
Life - lengthening was regularly found , and radiologists and others with relatively high doses had no adverse health effects .
Henry concludes :
The preponderance of data better supports the hypothesis that low chronic exposures result in an increased longevity than it supports the opposite hypothesis of decreased longevity .
...
Increased vitality at low exposures to materials that are toxic at high exposures is a well - recognized phenomenon .
Voluminous , credible peer - reviewed scientific literature data exist .
Dr. T.D. Luckey , Professor Emeritus of the University of Missouri School of Medicine , presents a great deal of that literature , with more than 2,000 references.9 , 10 Yet , the regulatory agencies ignore this evidence .
How the LNT Myth Was Supported
In 1996 , the Department of Energy investigated allegations about the now - accepted fact that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory mega - mouse studies presented false data on genetic effects , starting in 1951 .
The lab under - reported the numbers of mutations in the control animals .
International programs have now abandoned the mouse data , and are assessing the potential effects of radiation for genetic diseases something that was never before indicated .
An Oak Ridge geneticist and statistician , who is a member of UNSCEAR , and who had access to the original data and the expertise to analyze them , identified these deficiencies .
This geneticist also alleged that the misrepresentations of the data seemed to have been intentional .
This allegation was rejected by Oak Ridge .
However , the other instances of failing to report scientific data indicate possible confirmation of practices of misrepresenting research in the 1950s .
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission , the Department of Energy , and the Congress , should formally inquire about these allegations , and whether contrary data were adequately considered in reviews , research results , and support for research .
In 1971 , after the Federal Appeals Court  Calvert Cliffs decision ,  that found the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) Environmental Impact Statement to be inadequate , the AEC contracted for the  Argonne Radiological Impact Program ,  to improve the basis for assessing low - level radiation health effects .
Dr. Norman Frigerio analyzed U.S. cancer rates by average background radiation doses for each state , applying the linear no -threshold models .
His results were found to contradict the LNT :
There were consistently lower cancer rates in high - background - radiation states .
This finding has since been consistently confirmed .
11 In 1973 , although Dr. Frigerio had been contracted by the AEC itself to address the regulatory issues of low - level radiation effects in response to a court action AEC and radiation science policy interests terminated the study , and the results were not published .
This study was presented at a 1976 conference on natural radioactivity , sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
12 But , Dr. Walinder reports , these results were suppressed in the 1977 UNSCEAR report .
The same results were similarly arbitrarily dismissed in the report of the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations Committee ( BEIR III ) in 1980 , with no scientific inquiry .
The AEC termination of the Argonne National Laboratory s radiation program should be investigated .
The program plan was to continue , to obtain more accurate radiation dose data , to apply the analysis at the more definitive correlation at the county level .
The result was expected to confirm the preliminary inverse correlation results .
Dr. Frigerio and others stated that it was because of the nature of the results , contradicting the LNT , that the study was terminated .
Total populations with significant dose differences are the ideal test of the LNT , but here , again , we see that analysis is suppressed .
The results of the Argonne study , however , have been confirmed in analysis of EPA radiation data of high versus low background radiation states .
Conferences on natural background radiation consistently report the lack of health effects , and even the existence of beneficial effects , in high - background exposed populations .
The high - background whole - body radiation doses show no adverse health effects , to take just one example , in a stable Chinese peasant population of more than 70,000 , living for generations in high radiation areas .
The natural radioactivity source in high background areas is millions of times greater , it should be noted , than the radioactivity allowed to be released from nuclear facilities or nuclear waste sites .
The cost to the public for this overprotection ,  is massive .
How Radiation Is Measured Radiation  dose ,  or exposure ,  is a measure of energy absorbed per unit of mass .
There are two sets of units used , the older units having been renamed .
For equivalent tissue damage from different types of radiation , the rem was defined as rad equivalent manor rad times a quality factor .
For gamma and beta radiation , the quality factor for most significant energies is 1 , so rad and rem are taken as equal in these cases .
For alpha rays and neutrons , the quality factor is greater , indicating that there is more damage from the same absorbed energy .

Radon : Misrepresenting the Data
In the 1980s , Dr. Bernard Cohen , at the University of Pittsburgh , personally undertook natural background radiation studies similar to those terminated by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1973 ( and by AECs successors , ERDA and later DOE , and the NRC ) .
He tested the LNT using the significant lung cancer data compared with variations in residential radon .
Initially , he found that lung cancer incidence in the high - radon area of Cumberland County , Pennsylvania , was lower than the Pennsylvania average .
13
Many other studies found similar results .
Because radon data did not exist at the county level , Dr. Cohen obtained at least 100 radon measurements in the 16 large counties with the lowest lung - cancer rates , and the 25 counties with the highest rates .
14
He also found identical results in the various random counties in which 450 university physics professors at 101 universities supported his effort to obtain residential radon measurements .
Dr. Cohen then succeeded in a private effort to do , for radon and lung cancer , what the U.S. government had terminated with the Frigerio study measuring radon in 272,000 homes in the most populated U.S. counties .
These data also consistently found inverse results , in dozens of independent studies of , for example , all - rural  counties , all urban counties , and so on .
15 Dr. Graham Colditz of Harvard University , a world renowned epidemiologist , contributed to an interim analysis of the data by counties .
He confirmed the validity of the epidemiological analysis of these data .16 Dr. Cohen also acquired all Environmental Protection Agency and state radon data .
These data showed an inverse relationship : the higher the radon levels , the lower the incidence of lung cancer .
In the full data set , the inverse correlation exceeds 20 standard deviations , compared with the predictions of BEIR IV .
The chance of error is equivalent to one in all the electrons in the universe !
Any confounding factor must be : ( 1 ) much greater than smoking , ( 2 ) inversely correlated with radon , and ( 3 ) unrecognized .
This is inconceivable except for one postulate : Radon doses at the range of normal background levels stimulate lung tissue functions to protect against lung cancer .
Radiation - protection interests ignore the confirmed results of Cohen et al. by alleging simply that they are ecological studies  ; these critics provide no scientific basis to refute the data .
In fact , there is no documented scientific criticism of Dr. Cohens results , just general rationalizations of highly unlikely reasons why one study might not be valid .
In fact , Dr. Cohen as produced dozens of separate studies that are consistent .
Nevertheless , radiation protection interests use unfounded statements to misrepresent to the public that Dr. Cohens data have been refuted .
Dr. Kenneth Bogen at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory independently compared 1950 - 1954 lung cancer mortality for women of ages 40 to 80 and 60 to 80 ( who had smoked little ) , by county , with EPA county environmental ( not residential ) radon data .
He also confirmed the inverse correlation between lung cancer and radon .
Dr. Bogens biological model applies cellular response data to show that the inverse relationship is consistent with known biological responses .
17 Prof. Dr. Werner Schuttmann , of the former East Germany , and Prof. Dr. Klaus Becker of Berlin , Germany , both documented research results that show that women in the very high radon uranium mining areas of Saxony , Germany , who have negligible smoking , have significantly lower lung cancer rates than women in lower radon areas .
18 The Health Physics Journal denied publication of the Schuttmann and Becker article , however , as a result of comments by reviewers that contained such non-scientific statements as ,  this is just another ecological study ,  and everyone knows that Dr. Cohens studies are erroneous .
19 LNT supporters erroneously claim that case - control studies are better .
However , the accuracy of such studies is completely dependent on the ability to know individual doses .
This is true in most case - control studies where doses / exposures are measured and controlled .
However , in most radon case - control studies , individual doses are poorly known .
Residential radon measurements are used .
Therefore , dose groups  are only statistical estimates , without knowing individual doses .
Further , with the small numbers in the sample , combined with the uncertainty of the correlation , there are wide errors .
Unlike large population studies , case - control cannot produce accurate or replicable dose - response results .
In fact , in contrast , the nature of statistics provides statistical power in large ecological studies , because these apply rigorous statistics that more accurately represent mean doses compared with lung cancer rates .
In addition , the uncertain doses in most radon case - control studies produce much greater bias in the higher - dose region .
The high - dose group is likely to include persons who have low - doses , while it is unlikely that the low - dose group will have persons with high - doses .
Therefore , the high - dose group will have a bias toward excess cancers that will seem to be shown to result from low radon exposures .
In addition , case - control studies do not adequately address cases in the very low - radon regions , where the well - documented effects in Dr. Cohens data ( as well as those in other , more definitive population studies ) , demonstrate that increased lung cancer is expressed .
However , despite all the problems with case - control studies , it has been shown that they do not contradict the results reported by Dr. Cohen and others .
When using a small representative population to produce a substantive basis to apply it to a large population , there can be a reason , or reasons , why the small population does not accurately represent the whole population .
This is a confounding factor .
For example , the age distribution of the small population might be different from that of the whole population .
If the difference can be quantified , such as in producing an age - adjusted  analysis , the confounding factor can be taken into account .
Drs. Fritz Seiler and Joe Alvarez have shown that a dose - response model specifying confounding factors  is necessary to determine a risk ( for example , the lung cancer risk from radon ) .
In that case , a model with any confounding factors  must correct for systemic errors in applying the specific small - population data to the whole population .
However , Seiler and Alvarez demonstrate that Cohens results , as confirmed by others , show the actual relationship for the whole U.S. population .
Therefore , a precise model and any confounding factors  are irrelevant to predict the relationship to the whole population .
EPA , and BEIR IV and VI , substantially misrepresent the data on the risk of residential radon for lung cancer in the United States and the world .
The Case of the Radium Dial Painters
In 1974 , the pre-eminent radium health effects researcher , Dr. Robley Evans of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , rigorously demonstrated in an article in the Health Physics Journal , that BEIR in 197220 had misrepresented the data on the health effects of radium in order to produce a linear no - threshold result from extremely non-linear data .
21 On Evanss retirement in 1970 , the Center for Human Radiobiology ( CHR ) was established at the Argonne National Laboratory .
In 1981 , Dr. Evans gave the  Invited Summary  at an international conference in which it was reported that in thousands of cases of radium dial painters worldwide , there were still no occurrences of bone cancer or nasal carcinoma in individuals who had ingested less than 250 microcuries of radium - 226 , which produced an estimated dose of 1,000 rad to the bone .
A report on these data was published in 1983 .
Dr. Evans told the conference : 22
The studies of the radium cases during the past dozen years . . . have continued to show no radiogenic tumors , or other effects , in hundreds of persons whose effective initial body burden was less than about 50 microcuries of Ra-226 , and whose cumulative skeletal average dose is less than about 1,000 rad .
In 1983 , DOE initiated termination of this program , which had been established for the life of the dial painters , while more than 1,000 individuals were still alive .
It may be that this message was received by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation ( RERF ) , which was established to follow the Japanese A - bomb survivors for life .
The reports of the RERF produce consistently biased data .
It is significant that systemic intake of 50 microcuries of radium - 226 is about 125,000 times the annual ingestion of 5 picocuries / liter allowed by the EPA in its drinking water limits .
The EPA is even proposing reductions in these limits , which will require even greater public water supply expenditures under EPA program control .
If , instead , the EPA were to mandate a moderate revision in its limit by a factor of 4 , this would essentially eliminate the need for monitoring for radium in drinking water , and eliminate significant unnecessary costs , while still providing a safety margin of 30,000 ( times 50 picocuries ) to a person who drinks 1.1 liters per day of that water .
In the 1990s , follow - up after another decade confirmed the original radium dial - painter health effects results .
Dr. Robert Thomas , a long - time radiobiology researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory , a program manager at DOE , and the last Program Director of the Center for Human Radiobiology at the Argonne National Laboratory , showed that the log- normal distribution of cancers projected a threshold of 400 rad without even considering the total absence of cancers in the large population with doses below 1,000 rad.23 Work by Dr. Evans , and Dr. Constantine Maletskos and others , similarly established that such a threshold was valid .
24 Further analysis by Dr. Robert Rowland , former Director of the Center for Human Radiobiology , has more conclusively determined that a threshold exists .
Rowland states :25
Today we have a population of 2,383 cases for whom we have reliable body content measurements .
. . .
All 64 bone sarcoma cases occurred in the 264 cases with more than 10 Gy , while no sarcomas appeared in the 2,119 radium cases with less than 10 Gy .
To contradict these objective results , in an analysis used in BEIR IV to misrepresent the actual data , Drs. Charles Mays and Raymond Lloyd selected , first , a wide low - dose group range that included no cancers , and , second , a wide dose - group range that included the lowest dose with cancer ; from this , they manufactured a linear result .
In the Federal Register in 1991 , the EPA explicitly favored duplicity in the matter , by responding to a recommendation by its Science Advisory Board ( SAB ) that the radium dial painter data be used to establish the radium limits in water , as follows : 26 EPA policy is to assess cancer risks from ionizing radiation as a linear response .
Therefore , use of the dial painter data requires either deriving a linear risk coefficient from significantly non-linear exposure - response data , or abandoning EPA policy .
Simply put , science is irrelevant in this campaign to mislead the public about the hazards of radium , and radiation generally .
It was after a notorious radium poisoning case in 1932 , that the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) achieved control of radiation from Congress .
Well - known Philadelphia industrialist and socialite Eben Byers , died from a massive overdose of radium ingested in large quantities over three years .
The Byers case had great publicity and created great public fear of radiation .
The truth is that Byers did not die of cancer .
Bone necrosis led to removal of his jaw and other interventions that put a gruesome image on the radiation effects .
The FDA did not then assess the dose effects to the thousands of persons who had also used radium and other radiation sources in more moderate amounts ; or acknowledge that Byers had been the victim of the equivalent of a drug overdose .
The amount of radium that Eben Byers ingested daily is about 2,000,000 times the current EPA limits , based on drinking 1 liter / day at 5 picocuries per liter ( pCi/l ) .
The threshold for latent bone cancers from ingesting radium by the dial painters is more than 125,000 times the annual limits from drinking water at 5 pCi /l .
After the Byers case , Dr. Edna Johnson , and others , suppressed well - known data on the stimulatory effects of low doses of ionizing radiation , especially , a 1936 report for the National Research Council , to claim that radiation is harmful at low doses . 
Occupational Studies Show No Adverse Effects
One of the largest and most thorough studies of the effects of low - level radiation on nuclear industry workers is the Nuclear Shipyard Workers Study , funded by DOE but never published .
This 10 - year , $ 10 - million study of 39,004 nuclear workers , carefully matched with 33,352 non-nuclear workers , from a population of 108,000 nuclear workers in a total population of about 700,000 workers , was completed in 1987.27
After pressure on the DOE , which had chosen not to publish the data and conclusions , the Department finally , in 1991 , issued a contractors report on the study , with a two - page press release .
The radiation workers in the study were exposed to external cobalt - 60 .
They had good radiation dosimetry and records in the Nuclear Navy program controlled by Admiral Hyman Rickover .
They had limited confounding work experience .
Nevertheless , these data were kept out of BEIR V , even though the Technical Advisory Panel Chairman for the Nuclear Shipyard Workers Study and the Chairman of BEIR V were the same person , Dr. Arthur Upton .
Instead , BEIR V used other non-published sources , just as such sources have been used in the 1998 draft National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements ( NCRP ) SC1 - 6 report , also chaired by Dr. Upton.28
In the summary , the Nuclear Shipyard Workers Study reports that the high - dose mortality rate of the nuclear workers was 0.76 that of the non-nuclear workers in the control group .
Of special significance is the fact that the summary report did not include all cancer ,  mortality , which is a most common factor , and of most interest in any such study .
However , Myron Pollycove , M.D. , of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , documented that the all cancer mortality in the detailed tables is also statistically significantly lower among nuclear workers than among the non-nuclear workers .
After long negotiations , Dr. Genevieve Matanoski , Principal Investigator for the shipyard worker study , received another substantial contract from DOE in 1994 , and retired as Head of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University .
Now , more than 5 years later ( and about 12 years since the completion of the study ) , no papers have been published .
There is no report to Congress , the shipyard workers , radiation protection agencies , or to the public .
There is substantial concern about the integrity of the data , which have been kept under wraps .
Further , this most definitive nuclear workers study was not included in a study of all 
U.S. , U.K. , and Canadian nuclear workers , contracted by DOE with the International Association for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) .
29 The IARC study included only 95,000 U.S. , U.K. , and Canadian nuclear workers , and suppressed the more definitive nuclear shipyard workers study .
IARC even misrepresents its own data to claim that its results support the LNT .
This IARC study , using only the weaker , early nuclear worker data , was then proclaimed as a  definitive study ,  and a public relations campaign was launched , before the data were published , to claim that the IARC study is the best evidence of the linear dose - response to low doses . 
( Ironically , this may be true , to the extent that the study shows , yet again , that no evidence exists for a low - dose linear dose - response ! )
The IARC claim rests on data for one cancer , leukemia ( absent chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) with 119 deaths in a total of 15,825 deaths in the study .
One data point in the small highest - dose group at more than 40 cSv ( centi- sieverts ) shows 6 observed deaths vs. 2.3 expected deaths .
The 116 leukemia deaths in the six dose groups below 40 cSv show no excess leukemia .
The IARC analysis discounts data points in the four data groups that are below the controls .
This enables the IARC analysts to produce a trend analysis in which the 6 vs. 2.3 deaths data point alone causes a positive slope .30
These data are then made to seem statistically valid by applying Monte Carlo modelling of 5,000 trials .
The manipulated data are then used to support the LNT .
This is highly questionable as science , as policy - making , or as ethics .
The IARC , along with the international ( IRCP ) and national ( NRCP ) committees on radiation protection , and other radiation protection organizations , then mounted a public relations campaign to widely disseminate these conclusions , before the actual data were published .
Once the report was published , reviewers found that the data do not support the claims .
The NCRP and others know this fact .
Actually , as Dr. Don Luckey has shown , the full data of the workers in this study demonstrate a hormetic effect , consistent with many other nuclear worker vs. non-nuclear worker dose - response studies .
31
With small numbers of cases in dozens of specific cancers , it is more surprising that no other cancers reflect the 1 in 20 possibility of exceeding the normal range of statistical significance .
Dr. Warren Sinclair , President Emeritus of the NCRP and a controlling influence in NCRP , ICRP , UNSCEAR , and the National Research Council / Board of Radiation Effects Research ( BRER ) , however , misrepresents the IARC report as vindicating  the LNT hypothesis .
Not only does this misrepresent the data , but such a conclusion is contradicted by the lack of health effects in millions of people ( 1 ) exposed to moderate radiation doses , which are often much more well defined , especially from medical workers and patients , and ( 2 ) to high - dose natural background radiation sources .
However , the NCRP and radiation protection interests claim that this is  the best study to confirm that the LNT is valid .
The ICRP / NCRP / BRER group would not use it so consistently if there were any obviously better studies to support the LNT hypothesis .
On that basis alone , the LNT can be seen as refuted .
Dr. Luckey summarized the major nuclear worker vs. non-nuclear - worker studies .
He shows that the nuclear workers have 52 percent of the cancer rate in comparable non-exposed workers , in 7 million person - years of exposure !
32 Dr. Luckey notes that , as with other natural nutrients ( for example , vitamins and minerals ) , supplementation is warranted to provide for deficiencies that affect human health .
In this case , supplementation of a radiation deficiency  is warranted .
31
These data further indicate the need to confirm the beneficial effects of low - dose radiation .
Unfortunately , such research objectives are not supported , and in fact , are constrained , by the radiation - protection interests .
The Case of BEIR V , 1990
It is important to consider that BEIR V primarily relies on the Radiation Effects Research Foundation Japanese survivor studies .33
Six other primary studies are identified as used for model fitting  ( pp. 162-3 ) , and these studies are claimed to support the LNT .
However , even these few studies have substantial contradictory evidence that BEIR V does not address .
Some have internal contrary data .
Some are criticized in the literature .
For some , other equivalent populations show contradictory results , and stronger studies of other populations produce contrary results .
In some cases , arbitrary non-scientific statements dismiss contradictory data without justification .
Some populations , especially medically exposed persons , have greater doses than those that BEIR V identifies as data sets used for model fitting ,  but they are not included in the BEIR analysis , as they are now not included in the draft NCRP SC1 - 6 report .
Many do not have high - dose effects to project a straight line to zero dose .
Finally , some significantly exposed populations , especially medically exposed populations , of potential significance to assessing radiation health effects , are not studied by the radiation - protection interests ; for example , populations who live in areas of high natural background radiation , and persons who use and work at radium and radon spas .
Japanese Survivors Study
The Radiation Effects Research Foundation ( RERF ) studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivor data at low doses have been substantially questioned , without resolution .
This is especially true since the Department of Energys arbitrary reassignment of the RERF from the National Academy of Sciences to a DOE - recruited and selected investigator at Columbia University .
Many independent studies of the RERF data contradict the RERF analyses , even when limited to using the RERFs own processed data in the absence of the ability to access the raw data .
Even BEIR
V consultants were unable to obtain the data to undertake an independent analysis .
Some of the RERF data show more evidence of hormetic effects than adverse effects at low doses .
However , critical analyses are not considered by radiation protection interests in BEIR V or NCRP SC1 - 6 .
Certainly however , in the first instance , the conditions of doses to persons exposed directly to an atomic bomb , and confounding factors of survivors , both before and after the bombing , are of no significance to the assessment of the health effects of chronic low - dose exposures to environmental contamination .
Use of the RERF results for the assessment of health effects is well known to be inappropriate , because the exposure does not apply to radiation protection for workers or for the public exposed to chronic and highly fractionated and low dose - rate radiation , especially for extreme costly cleanup and decommissioning standards .
Virtually all analysts , including the RERF researchers ( as expressed at the November 1997 International Atomic Energy Agency conference in Seville , Spain ) , have stated that the instantaneous gamma and neutron atomic - bomb - exposed population is not relevant to the assessment of effects for low - dose rate and low - dose exposures .
In his book mentioned above , Dr. Gunnar Walinder also reports on the expectation of UNSCEAR members that the RERF data would be manipulated to produce expected  results that support the LNT .3
It is also common knowledge that BEIR V states that there are no adverse effects below a high dose , but then presumes a straight line from the high dose to zero .
For example , for colon cancer , BEIR states that :
In the atomic - bomb survivors there is no excess cancer evident in doses below about 1.0 Gy. 
Nevertheless , BEIR applies the linear model down to zero .
This presumes effects of radiation to doses of less than 0.0001 Gy , with a radiation protection policy specifying that even 0.00001
Gy should not be ignored in assessing collective dose and regulatory controls ( for example , as in the NCRP Report 121 ) .
Relative to significant populations with good dosimetry and relatively unconfounded results for example , among medical patients and practitioners the Japanese survivor results are both highly questionable and largely meaningless to the assessment of low - dose , low - dose - rate radiation health effects for radiation - protection policies .
They do indicate some agreement with high - dose rate exposure results in animals and humans , which have demonstrated beneficial effects at low to moderate doses .
More Misrepresentation : Fluoroscopy of Women with TB
The individuals in the Canadian fluoroscopy study of breast cancer in women with tuberculosis , by Miller et al. , 34 is the second largest exposed group listed in the BEIR V data sets as the set used for fitting the data .
As noted , this study explicitly misrepresents its own data to report a linear dose - response in the literature and BEIR V . A plot of this data was presented to the NCRP annual meeting by Dr. E.W. Webster in April 1992 .
It has been published elsewhere in the literature , and is contained in the Radiation , Science , & Health  Data Document , 34 and in the 1995 Nuclear News article,35 both of which are referenced in the draft NCRP report .
Below about 30 cGy ( centi- grays ) there is a highly statistically significant reduction in breast cancer .
This reduction is by one - third in the largest group with a mean dose of 15 cGy , which is 2.7 standard deviations below zero risk .
This equates to 10,000 fewer cancers in 1 million women at 15 cGy , instead of the false statement that 900 excess cancers are expected .
( This is consistent with other evidence of reduced breast cancer from low - dose radiation exposure , for example , in the studies by Makinodan .
36 )
In the Canadian study , a straight line is projected from the high - dose data through zero .
This forces a linear relationship , despite the dataa consistent way data have been misrepresented in many studies .
( See figure ) Nevertheless , BEIR V also applies this false straight line in its report , which is presumably the reason to use the Canadian study at all .
BEIR does not include more substantial studies that fail to show any adverse effects that can be claimed to support the LNT .
NCRP members continued to claim that this study supports the LNT in 1995 and 1996 , using this widely known false straight line to zero .
An inquiry is needed to establish whether the authors intended to report the data inaccurately .
In 1996 , an update of the study was published by Dr. Geoffrey Howe , the second author of the original Canadian study .37 ( DOE recruited Dr. Howe to Columbia University , and reassigned the Radiation Effects Research Foundation study to him from the National Academy of Sciences . )
Howe then claimed that the data now fail to show the hormetic effect .
However , in Howes analysis , the large low - dose groups are collapsed to one low - dose group of 1 to 49 cGy .
This effectively obfuscates the data from the largest groups at 15 cGy ( 10 to 19 cGy ) and 25 cGy ( 20 to 29 cGy ) and 0 - 9 cGy , and from the 30 - 39 cGy , and 40 - 59 cGy groups .
When challenged on this conclusion at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences in 1997 , Dr. Howe stated only that the low - dose groups were not informative .
He responded similarly at a meeting at Chalk River , Canada .
However , the low - dose groups in the Canadian study had the largest number of cases , with the smallest errors .
The draft NCRP SC 1 - 6 report states that the later paper by Howe refutes  the 1989 study .
It also states that this is confirmed by a yet later paper by Howe ( cited as  1998 , in press ) , but the report does not provide an explanation or scientific basis for this statement .
It was later determined that the paper was never published and was never in press . 
The NCRP report makes this uninformative , dismissive comment to this most significant study ( judged so even by BEIR V , which has the same person as chairman as the NCRP SC 1 - 6 ) , which has been extensively assessed and referenced by scientists who question the LNT , and who introduced it explicitly to the NCRP Committee .
The 1989 Miller study is even actively suppressed in the 1994 UNSCEAR Report , Appendix B , as described by Dr. Pollycove in an NRC transcript .
However , the NCRP report is filled with voluminous data of limited , or no applicability to assess adverse health effects , or even biological effects in whole organisms all data , of course , to support the LNT .
Note also that Dr. Howe published an analysis of lung cancer in these women .
38
They have significantly lower lung cancer at doses below about 2 Gy ( 200 rad ) than the low - dose group , consistent with many other studies , as presented by Drs. Harald Rossi , a member of the BEIR III committees and ICRP , and Marco Zaider , who reviewed all relevant data , finding that lung cancer is lower with exposure to low to moderate doses , from X - rays and other sources .
39 Evidence of Beneficial Effects Ignored or Suppressed
The data on the beneficial effects of low - dose radiation , including uses of radiation in the first half of the century , have not been studied or considered by the regulatory bodies charged with radiation policy making .
The health and medical benefits to patients who receive significant low and moderate diagnostic exposures are not considered , as with the Canadian fluoroscopy breast cancer study .
In order to properly assess low - dose effects , all studies should analyze the dose range below the level at which adverse effects are demonstrated .
The biological evidence that organisms in below - normal radiation background have demonstrated adverse health effects has also not been considered , or even confirmed and evaluated .
But more important , the data on many organisms that have demonstrated beneficial effects from supplemental radiation , including the prevention and elimination of cancer and other diseases , are not considered .
The extensive evidence that low - dose radiation stimulates immune responses is not considered , including the many documented sources in the UNSCEAR 1994 report .40
Such research has indicated the mechanisms of successful treatment of some cancers by stimulating the immune system using low - dose radiation ( both alone and in combination with traditional high - dose cancer therapy ) .
Such results have been reported by Dr. Sadao Hattori41 from the work of Drs. Sakamoto and Miyamoto42 and Dr. Takai43 in Japan , and others .
As noted by Dr. Hattori , funding for this research is constrained by radiation - protection interests that prevent such government support of medical research .
44 Private investment in research is constrained by the lack of potential profits in medical applications that would potentially provide health care , and even cancer cures , by low - cost low - dose radiation treatments vs. pharmaceuticals , for example , for chemotherapy , genetic research ,  and so on .
These research opportunities can also produce highly successful research careers , whether or not there are successful and cost - effective treatments of real patients .
Low - dose total body irradiation and half - body irradiation has successfully treated and prevented some cancers , as documented in Japan and elsewhere .
That breast cancer and other cancers have been prevented or treated should be data to be investigated , not suppressed .
It is costing the public hundreds of billions of dollars in environmental cleanup alone , to control radioactivity sources that are far below natural background radioactivity .
But this radiation protection policy may have even greater costs to women with breast cancer , and to millions of others with cancers and other diseases that may be readily preventable or treatable at low cost , with inconsequential side effects ,  by low - dose radiation treatment .
There is also substantial reason to believe that low dose radiation treatments will be effective against HIV / AIDS .
In addition , research is constrained on the millions of persons who have used radium and radon balneology ( http://www.radonmine.com) for health and medical applications throughout the world .
Such research that has been performed is not considered in establishing radiation - protection policy , as with the radium dial - painters and others with high radium burdens .
The positive medical results of such practices are also not considered at great cost and to the detriment of the public in resolving the role of radiation and health .
Stimulating Health Benefits on the Cellular Level
The biological justification claimed for the LNT model is that a single ionizing photon or particle can damage DNA in a cell , and that this damage can lead to cancer .
But an adult body is impacted by about 15,000 nuclear rays or particles every second there are more than a billion such events every day from natural sources .
And each day , the DNA in each cell loses approximately 5,000 purine bases , because the bodys normal heat breaks their linkages to deoxyribose .
More damage is caused by normal cell division and DNA replication .
But the most damage a million DNA nucleotides in each cell damaged each day is caused by free radicals created in the normal process of metabolism , resulting from routine eating and breathing and the stress of heat and exercise .
46 Radiation causes more double breaks per event in the DNA than normal metabolism does , and these are harder to repair than single breaks .
But even given this difference , the mutations ( unrepaired or misrepaired damage ) from metabolism outnumber those caused by natural radiation by 10 - million - fold .
47
There are a large variety of anti-oxidants that prevent damage , enzymes that continually repair damaged nucleotides in DNA , and removal processes to eliminate those it cannot repair .
48
Even high - level radiation adds only a few more mutations to the millions that are occurring from metabolism .

The mice that lied ?
Whether deliberate or not , the control group data on radiation and mice were tampered with .
Here , mice from the experimental colony at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s , used for examining the long - term hereditary effects of radiation .
 Hundreds of billions of dollars are now being uselessly expended , solely on the basis of LNT - justified radiation protection policies , while the public is misled to believe that these expenditures are protecting public health . 
The effect of low - level radiation , which is not strong enough to degrade the bodys tissue repair capacity , is suggested by how the body reacts to low levels of other potential toxins .
When small quantities of disease bacteria or toxic metals are taken into the body , the result is to stimulate the immune system .
One effect is that subsequent attacks by this toxin , in larger amounts , are more effectively countered .
Radiation works in an equivalent way .
Numerous studies have shown that low - dose radiation enhances immune functions , enzymatic repair capabilities , and cell removal functions , and stimulates cellular and DNA repair mechanisms .
This improved immune response affects the entire spectrum of metabolic damage .
Therefore , if and when the bodys defenses are degraded , low - dose radiation improves the general protection , repair , and removal of damaged DNA and cells .
As discussed above , organisms and animals at low - level natural background radiation or sub- ambient radiation levels , consistently show higher cancer rates and other physiological deficiencies .
They recover when returned to normal background radiation levels or when they are provided supplemental radiation from external sources .
Therapeutically , the work in Japan , and in the United States , has shown that 10 to 15 cGy full - body or half - body X - ray doses , delivered in 1 to 2 minutes , several days apart , stimulate the bodys defense mechanisms .
Specific immune responses were sufficiently definitive in animal studies to justify clinical trials for cancer suppression in human beings , by Dr. Sakamoto and associates .
The patients were generally far - advanced cases , therefore not ideal candidates for immune function stimulation .
However , individual cases were successful , and a long - term clinical trial on non-Hodgkins lymphoma patients has confirmed that the group that received low - dose radiation substantially outlived the control group at 5 years and 10 years .
49 ( See figure ) New initiatives are under way to establish the role of radiation in health , rather than to maintain the constraints of committees and research committed solely to radiation protection .
More is needed .
However , existing voluminous radiobiology and epidemiology data provide sufficient bases to refute the LNT , and to find that low - dose radiation does not constitute a public health hazard , and to determine that it is beneficial .
Directed research is necessary to better understand the precise mechanisms , to quantify the various levels and conditions at which these benefits exist , and to more precisely establish the levels and conditions at which human exposure can be considered safe .
But those levels are at least many multiples of average natural background radiation for chronic exposure .
Research Needed on Low - dose Radiation As a Treatment for AIDS
There is every indication that low - dose radiation could be successfully used to treat HIV / AIDS .
Because AIDS is an immune deficiency disease , and because strong and enhanced immune response has succeeded in preventing full - blown AIDS in persons with HIV , it can be expected that the stimulating effect of low - dose radiation will suppress the development of AIDS in persons whose immune systems are degrading .
It is known that low - dose radiation , in conjunction with small amounts of inactivated tumor cell antigen , have dramatic successes in preventing and retarding tumor development .
Such an effect can be reasonably anticipated , and should be researched , for use with HIV vaccines .
Another indication of success with immune system stimulation comes from a case in California , where a transplant patient received a low radiation dose to help prevent rejection of a transplanted organ from a baboon .
Although the transplant failed , the patient was in remission for an extended period of time , which was hypothesized to be in response to the low - dose irradiation stimulation .
...
Time for Extreme Corrective Action
Hundreds of credible scientific studies , reported in the peer - reviewed literature , during the 50 years since the Manhattan Project studies , demonstrate beneficial responses to low - level radiation .
With more than 2,000 studies going back more than 100 years , research has consistently demonstrated beneficial health effects and biological responses .
50 The LNT has been substantially contradicted .
However , these data are shown to be systematically ignored and actively suppressed , and their research terminated , by the radiation - protection interests that control radiation science policy and scientific reviews .
To the contrary , no evidence of adverse effects for human beings exists in hundreds of studies in low - , moderate , and even high - radiation - dose populations that in any way confirm the LNT premise .
The LNT hypothesis is a fiction , maintained by a closed , biased , interest group at massive cost to the taxpayers , electric ratepayers , and medically insured public .
Its cost will be even higher for future generations , because of the resultant constraints on the human benefits of nuclear technologies .
Hundreds of billions of dollars are now being uselessly expended , solely on the basis of LNT - justified radiation protection policies , while the public is misled to believe that these expenditures are protecting public health .
Appropriate extreme corrective actions are needed : ( 1 ) There must be an immediate deferral of the massive expenditures of the site cleanup programs , pending an urgent preliminary scientific review , which must be led by persons who are not committed to , or who do not have conflicts of interest in , the funds that support the LNT .
( 2 ) The numerous cases of scientific misconduct must be documented , and formal allegations made for adjudication .
( 3 ) BEIR VII must be terminated , along with the NCRP SC 1 - 6 biased radiation protection policy reviews , and the NIH Radiation Research Study Section , and the Board of Radiation Effects Research of the National Research Council .
Reviews and research must be conducted by experts within applicable specialized disciplines , in accordance with current epidemiological , medical , and biological knowledge and applications .
( 4 ) The evidence exists to justify the conduct of low - dose radiation clinical trials , which should include HIV / AIDS applications ; and research must be conducted to optimize medical treatment modalities and radiation doses .
( 5 ) For radiation protection purposes , radiation risks  must be objectively quantified , considering the fact that , like vitamins and minerals , ionizing radiation is essential to life , and that we live in radiation - deficiency conditions .
( 6 ) Engineering design and operations must be revised to produce cost - effective and , therefore , highly economically competitive nuclear technologies , for energy ( with heat , desalination , and other applications ) , and for medicine , industry , agriculture , space , and other applications , with special consideration for expedited applications for China and Second - and Third - World countries .
The indirect costs of constraints on nuclear energy , food irradiation , nuclear medicine , and other nuclear technologies essential to development of a sustainable world economy , including the suppression of health and medical benefits , are greater than the direct costs that are estimated at greater than $ 2 trillion worldwide .
The benefits of radiation technologies can substantially alleviate pending conflicts over oil , food , water , and other resources .
Such benefits can also reduce environmental degradation in a world population that is growing at the rate of the total U.S. population every three years , and can help fulfill the growing expectations for individuals in the developing world .
Knowledgeable scientists and analysts are providing the extensive evidence on the data and questioning the process of controlling research and results , and scientific reviews .
Radiation health effects and radiobiology expertise and technologies must be reoriented to develop the enormous opportunities to provide the cost - effective health benefits and environmental and energy capabilities , and to reduce potential world conflicts , for the world our grandchildren will inherit .

But some buyers just freeload .
( The Internet has a way of encouraging this behavior . )
They can search the M.L.S. for a house with no brokerage firm listed , meaning it 's being sold by the owner , and then work out a no-commission deal directly with that owner .
So you can see where this is headed .
If agents want to protect their commissions , they have to restrict access to the M.L.S. to sellers who are working with them , not going it alone .
Local realty groups have tried suing agents or brokerage firms that put " for sale by owner " listings in the M.L.S. , accusing them of copyright infringement .
Those agents have countersued , charging restraint of trade .
Then two years ago , the Realtors association found what it thought was a better solution .
It passed rules that essentially allowed a local M.L.S. service to block access to the listing service to any brokerage firm who discounted commissions or who posted listings for homeowners who intended to sell their own houses .
The antitrust division of the Justice Department cried foul .
This month it sued the Realtors ' trade group , asserting that the rules stifled competition and hurt consumers .
The Realtors changed the rules just as the federal case was filed .
But J. Bruce McDonald , deputy assistant attorney general , said that the group 's policies continued to discriminate against innovative brokers and " stifle competition at the expense of home buyers and sellers . "
In a news release , the Realtors association said it was " at a loss to understand " the Justice Department 's legal action .
" Many of the changes incorporated in the new policy are in direct response to concerns they have raised over the course of the two - year investigation , " it said .
The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have successfully fought state real estate boards that tried to limit consumer choices by imposing service requirements or forbidding commission rebates , but the fight goes on .
Realtors have lobbied for and won state laws that prohibit commission rebates to buyers and require minimum levels of service , like requiring that an agent handle all negotiations or house showings .
Federal regulators can't fight that .
Aaron Farmer , a discount real estate broker in Austin , Tex. , has battled local and state realty boards to offer cheaper services .
The Justice Department and the F.T.C. intervened to help him .
Nevertheless , he has had to raise his fees to $ 700 from $ 600 because of the minimum service levels required by a law recently passed by the Texas Legislature .
( Eight states have enacted such laws , accepting the real estate industry 's argument that they are needed to protect consumers . )
" All of these fights are over the M.L.S. , " he said .
" They do n't want price wars . "
But price wars are coming .
No doubt about that .
Here are a few suggestions on how to take advantage of the changing environment to sell your home with minimum services from -- and fees to -- a broker :
Set the price Being a nosy neighbor is still the best way to know the market .
Walk though every open house and find out later what the house sold for .

“ Even with primitive materials , one can work small wonders ” Matt 17 comments Latest by Carlos N. Molina
Ten years before Walt Disney gave the world Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , German filmmaker Lotte Reiniger and her collaborators created The Adventures of Prince Achmed , a gorgeous animated feature that uses cut out silhouettes and dramatic backgrounds to tell its story .
“ The paper animations of Lotte Reiniger ” gives some insight into the process .
Using scissors and masses of black paper , she fabricated paper silhouettes of extraordinary delicacy and subtlety , each as graceful as a little black dress .
Her use of silhouette capitalized on both the strength and fragility of paper , but more important , Reiniger made paper move … Walter Schobert , curator of the German Film Museum in Frankfurt , numbers it among the “ greatest films of the 20th century ” …
Though inspired by shadow theater , Reiniger ’s figures appear to have none of the stiffness of their non-film predecessors .
“ Film is movement , ” she noted , often comparing filmmaking to ballet .
“ It ’s the combination of curves and diagonals that gives ballet and animation their sweet tenderness and their striking directness . ”
While using literal light and shadow , Reiniger also relied on the shadings of music : the fine variations in her animations often parallel the tone and stress of musical notes rather than the hiccoughs of flip - book style animating techniques .
She rather modestly noted that , “ even with primitive materials , one can work small wonders . ”
The Achmed film offers a striking contrast to the computer animations coming from studios today , as this reviewer notes :
These characters are often more fun to watch than those found in the most finely detailed computer animation from Pixar .
Especially good is the African Sorcerer , whose insectile body goes through incredible contortions as he scuttles through the scenery or transforms into various terrifying creatures .
Reiniger ’s film also offers stunningly dramatic visuals that make very effective use of background color .
In one notable scene , the prince watches Peri Banu and her maidens as they shed their magic flying cloaks to bathe in a lake .
This enchanting interlude is heart - stopping in its ethereal black - on - blue beauty .
For a modern taste of paper craftsmanship , check out Peter Callesen ’s magic A4 papercut series .
It ’s further proof that great ideas glow even when tools and materials are basic .
Many music fans have marveled at the sight of a dozen musicians improvising a blues song during an impromptu jam session .
Without much discussion or practice , all the participants seem to know instinctively when to change chords and how to draw the song to a close .
In actuality , however , these musicians knew all along what their ' improvised ' song would sound like - it 's a standard musical form called a 12 bar blues progression .
Musicians learn the 12 bar blues progression much like dancers learn basic time steps .
This allows amateur musicians to play along with more experienced professionals and know precisely what chords to play .
Man playing a guitar
In order to understand how a standard 12 bar blues progression works , it might be helpful to examine the three main elements - twelve bars , blues , and progression .
Twelve bars refers to a length of musical time called a measure .
Almost all blues music is written in 4 /4 time , which means a quarter note receives a full beat and four of these beats comprise a measure .
In sheet music notation , measures are designated with vertical bars , so many musicians refer to measures informally as bars .
The total length of a 12 bar blues progression is twelve measures , although the progression is generally repeated until the song has ended .
There are variations of a 12 bar blues progression which only use 8 bars before repeating .
Blues refers to the actual style of the song .
Blues music has a unique rhythm pattern which most musicians use to control their playing .
Although blues are written in 4/4 , the actual rhythm is more of a syncopated backbeat .
Instead of the standard ONE two three four / TWO two three four regularity of most 4 / 4 compositions , blues music uses a driving rhythm : " BOM ba BOM ba BOM ba BOM / BOM ba BOM ba BOM ba BOM " .
This syncopated , driving rhythm gives a 12 bar blues progression its signature feel and earthy sound .
Progression refers to the chord changes made during a 12 bar blues riff .
Most blues songs use three chords - in musical terminology they are the tonic , sub - dominant and dominant seventh .
A blues song can be in any key , but generally the musicians agree on keys easiest for guitarists to play , such as E , A , or D .
Once the overall key has been determined , musicians follow a standard pattern when changing chords .
The first four measures are in the tonic chord of the key - if the song is in the key of D , the tonic chord is D major .
The lead singer sings a plaintive lyric about his or her life : " Woke up this morning / Wind howling at my door . "
After the fourth measure , the band ramps up to the sub - dominant chord ( in this case G major ) and the singer repeats this line with more urgency : " I said I WOKE UP this MOOORNING / wind HOWLING at my DOOR . "
The band then returns to the original tonic chord ( D major ) and plays two more measures .
The last measures are played and sung differently .
A new lyric is introduced by the singer which puts a twist on the original line : " Do n't know if I can make it / Ca n't seem to find the floor . "
At the same time , the band shifts to a dominant chord ( A major ) with an extra note called a seventh added .
This added note creates tension which can only be released by returning to the sub - dominant ( G major ) or the tonic ( D major ) .
In most 12 bar blues progressions , the band plays one measure of the dominant seventh , then steps down to one measure of the sub - dominant ( G major ) and then finally back to the original tonic ( D major ) .
The blues progression is harder to explain than it is to actually perform .
As the singer begins the new lyric , the musicians play the dominant seventh chord for tension , the sub - dominant for some release of that tension and the tonic to start the entire progression over again .
It is a federal crime to provide false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive , legislative , or judicial branch , with some limited , but important , exceptions . *

Â§ 1001 .
Violation of Section 1001 can result in up to five years in prison .
It is similar to perjury , but one does not need to be under oath , so its application is broader and , in a very specific way , insidious .
Read on to find out why .
The vast majority of applications of this statute are entirely fair and reasonable .
But there is one circumstance where it can be exploited to reach unfair results .
This is known as the “ Exculpatory No ” Doctrine .
This doctrine descibes a situation where a federal agent asks if you committed a crime , and you have , but you say “ no . ”
This situation falls within the literal reading of the statute .
It is a simple syllogism : “ No ” is a statement .
That statement was false .
Therefore , you have made a false statement , which brings you under the aegis of Section 1001 .
There are a multitude of problematic situations which may arise if the Exculpatory “ No ” is considered a false statement , many of which have been laid down by a concerned Justice Ginsburg in Brogan v. United States .
Let ’s examine some of the particular issues that flow from this application .
First , this gives a sickening degree of power to prosecutors or federal agents to generate felonies .
This can take multiple forms .
A prosecutor may already know and have proof of Person A ’s guilt , although Person A does not know that the prosecutor has such strong evidence .
The prosecutor can purposesly ask Person A questions about his involvement with criminal enterprises assuming he will deny involvement like any normal and rational person would .
Soon as Person A says “ No , ” he just tacked on potentially five more years to his sentence .
What purpose does this serve ?
The prosecutor was not misled by Criminal A ’s falsehood .
In this scenario it is purely an ancillary crime which seems to serve no public good besides allowing prosecutors to arbitrarily increase someone ’s sentence .
Another hypothetical : A prosecutor can only prove two of the four elements necessary to convict Person B of a crime .
Without proof of the remaining elements , there can be no conviction .
The prosecutor feels she knows that he is guilty , despite the fact she does not have enough proof , so she decides to trick him into committing a Section 1001 felony so she can mete out some punishment .
The prosecutor asks Person B about whether he committed the elements she does have proof for and Person B predictably denies any involvement .
Now the prosecutor has a federal felony on her hands , creating it out of thin air , and she can achieve her desired punishment without having to actually prove anything about the underlying crime .
This strikes me as even less fair than the previous example .
Instead of adding on more time , prosecutors can manipulate the alleged criminals into committing a new crime and then use the new crime as a substitute for what they could n’t prove otherwise .
A second concern is that federal agents and prosecutors can lull people into exclaiming exculpatory “ no ’s ” by creating informal situations in which the alleged criminal will not realize the severity of his actions .
In this scenario , a federal agent stops by to chat with Person C about alleged corruption at their workplace .
Person C gives the federal agent the information he wants to know , but leaves out any details about his own involvement .
At the end of the interview , which seems to Person C to be about others , not about himself , the federal agent asks if Person C was involved in any illegal shenanigans at the office .
Person C , thinking that he is not the subject of the investigation and does not want to implicate himself for no reason , denies any participation .
The federal agent , knowing all along that Person C was involved , has just tricked Person C into committing another felony .
Now , if Person C knew that there were severe consequences to his lying , he may have evaded the question entirely or refused to answer or even told the truth .
If Person C was able to have an attorney present who understood the consequences of saying “ no , ” he could have advised his client to proceed differently .
It was only the lulling effect of the informal chat that tricked Person C into denying involvement , while in a more formal setting , like a deposition , Person C would have been able to make more educated choices .
Does it strike you as unfair that a five year prison sentence could hinge on such vagarities ?
Finally , Section 1001 can be used as a way to create federal jurisdiction when there was previously none .
Federal jurisdiction is created in one of two ways : you either have litigants from multiple states or you have someone charged with a federal crime .
Otherwise , claims are litigated at the state level .
In this final scenario , someone is convicted of violating a state law , but the FBI comes in to question the person .
If that person denies their involvement when they really were involved , all of a sudden there is a federal felony and the federal government , with all its resources , can now prosecute .
Venue and jurisdiction battles are frequently fought because where a case is litigated can confer specific advantages or disadvantages depending on the nature of the case .
Section 1001 gives the federal government an ace up its sleeve to bring matters otherwise fully within a state ’s jurisdiction to the federal district courts .
Until the Supreme Court ruled on the issue in Brogan , most federal circuits created an exception for “ exculpatory no ” situations .
Those judicial creations are no longer valid .
Luckily , the Department of Justice does not prosecute Section 1001 violations in these circumstances according to their internal guidelines .
They understand that there are troubling overtones to such prosecutions that seem to strike at a fundamental unfairness .
In other specific circumstances , the Fifth Amendment would protect one , and it seems illogical to deny similar protections in more informal situations .
But DoJ guidelines are merely that , guides for their attorneys .
They do not have the force of law and never will .
Congress should amend the statute to explicitly carve out an exception for “ exculpatory no ” scenarios in order to preserve some portion of whatever fairness remains in the criminal justice system .
* The two exceptions are for certain statements made by parties or attorneys in judicial proceedings and certain statements made in connection with Congressional hearings .

Taking the subjective nature of deciding what is or is n't " green , " and the moving target that is the definition of " green " this week and you have a recipe for disaster .
The social investing community also suffers from the hubris that it can separate the good guys from the bad guys .
The dark secret of " social investing " is that it is neither art nor science :
It 's image and impulse .
It reflects perceptions , not performance .
One of the deep flaws in investing strategies like " Socially Responsible Investing " or " Green Investing " is less about an intrinsic strategic flaw ( though these exist too ) than the nexus between the decision to add non-financial criteria to an investment process and human nature .
The general miasma created by focusing on how " green " an investment is ( or is n't ) or how " socially responsible " it is ( or is n't ) clouds clear decision making .
This is because these criteria are political , and therefore subject to the whim of policy and public opinion .
I have , of course , discussed this before on Going Private , quoting , among others , Jon Entine who said :
Over the last 5 months I have seen more and more " NFD " deals .
NFD is my quick and dirty term for " Non-Financial Drivers , " or , when including my likely opinion on the viability of the opportunity : " No Fucking Deal . "
These include all of the " Socially Responsible " or " Green " deals that have come across our bow at Sub Rosa .
( Ethanol has been increasingly common but fuel cells , hybrid part manufacturers , hydrocarbon reclamation and solar have have been appearing with increasing frequency too ) .
Since joining Sub Rosa , I have had occasion to review any number of NFDs .
A common theme in major " green " or " socially responsible " projects is that when someone finally bothers to study the larger impact of the technology or product it becomes painfully obvious that the product or technology is either astonishingly impractical or has a more substantial negative impact on , e.g. , the environment than the " non-Green " alternatives already in the marketplace .
If this pattern appears regular in SRI or Green projects , I believe it is because of this miasma effect .
It is , however , easy to avoid the miasma effect .
Ask what the pricing mechanism is for the product .
Is it the market , or something else that is setting pricing ?
Let 's take an example .
Trying to get back into the swing of work I have been researching hybrid cars , a project I began last spring related to some parts manufacturers we were considering acquisitions of .
Some interesting things came out .
Ford , for example , was at one point taking losses on every hybrid they sold .
I have n't seen recent data but I suspect not much has changed .
Consumers simply wo n't pay the $ 5,000 - $ 6,000 premium for a hybrid just " because , " or at least not enough of them will do so to make the product even a break - even proposition .
What was Ford thinking ?
Why would this be ?
No matter , the savings on gasoline make up the premium cost .
Nope .
Not for a long while .
The Toyota Prius is among the fastest at returning savings to the user .
It takes 5 years and then how much can one expect ?
$ 80.00 .
Well , it 's worth it .
Buying a hybrid will reduce your impact on the environment and if it takes 5 years to break even , well , that 's just fine is n't it ?
Sure , it would be , if that were true .
It is n't .
In fact , the major hybrids are really quite unfriendly when you use real metrics to evaluate them .
In this case , energy cost per mile over the lifetime of the vehicle .
CNW Market Research has done a comprehensive study ( updated with 2006 model recently ) on the " dust - to - dust " energy costs for everything from extracting and refining raw materials to manufacture , assembly , testing , delivery , driving during the life of the car and even disposal .
This is , of course , the metric that should have been used to justify hybrids in the first place ( since savings on fuel costs certainly did n't make their manufacture rational ) .
The study is intensely detailed ( a great deal of time is spent modeling how long a vehicle remains with its first owner and how many times it changes hands before being disposed of , for instance , as each incremental transfer is additional energy expenditure ) .
Read the 400 page report , absorb the " energy cost per mile " figures and some interesting things emerge :
Actual consumption of gasoline is generally less than one third of the total energy consumption in the lifetime of a vehicle
The 2006 model hybrid with the lowest energy impact during its life cycle is the Toyota Prius that consumes $ 2.965 per mile during its life
The 2006 model hybrid with the highest energy impact during its life cycle is the Ford Escape that consumes $ 3.540 per mile during its life
For many hybrid vehicles 25 % to 30 % of the life cycle energy expenditure is consumed in raw material production and manufacture - this is much higher than in non -hybrid vehicles .
For foreign built cars this means that emissions in the country of use ( the United States , say ) are not being eliminated , but rather transferred to the country of manufacture .
Next time a hybrid driver looks smug feel free to remind them that they are likely dumping their emissions into the second or third world .
What kind of pig subjugates the peoples of Mexico and endangers their health to look " green " for their suburban neighbors and smirks about it ?
Federal ( and state ) subsidies mean that this energy use and emissions transfer is part of United States monetary policy ( and California is exploiting Mexico ) .
Remembering that the hybrids consume $ 2.965 - $ 3.540 of energy per mile during their life cycle it is interesting to consider these figures for other popular vehicles :
Ford Escape : $ 3.540
Porsche Boxter : $ 3.388
Toyota Land Cruiser : $ 3.354
Maserati An : $ 3.219
BMW 5 Series : $ 3.197
Cadillac Escalade : $ 3.197
Corvette : $ 3.196
Toyota Prius : $ 2.965
Lincoln Navigator : $ 2.943
Porsche 911 Carrera 4 : $ 2.806
Lincoln Town Car : $ 2.661
Range Rover Sport : $ 2.602
Porsche Cayenne : $ 2.539
BMW X3 : $ 2.513
Hummer H3 : $ 2.069
Interestingly , most large SUVs have a fairly significantly lower lifetime energy impact than do any of the hybrids .
What a wonderful " Green " investment strategy .
Hybrid cars .
Hybrids are such a horrible mess because they mix all the elements required to destroy the market forces .
Subsidies , state and federal .
Green investing .
Substantial research and development to avoid spending money on gasoline , which the market has actually left quite cheap , at the expense of a more expensive product .
( Hint : use cheap resources until they are not cheap anymore ) .
Gas has to hit $ 6.00 per gallon before today 's hybrids show any cost savings to their owners inside of three years .
Even the most basic sensitivity analysis would expose this .
We can only reason that the likes of Ford either expected $ 6.00 per gallon in the near future , or simply disregarded the economic analysis in favor of a political one .
Is it any surprise that the resulting product is more expensive in every way worth measuring than its conventional counterparts ?
Should n't be if you were paying attention .
What you need to ask yourself is ;
What would the Dalai Lama do … if he were a Navy seal .
Once upon a time there was a programmer called Sisyphus and he trudged into work and toiled all day , back and forth , back and forth .
No matter where he went , people did one crazy thing after another and it really got to him , ‘ cos he cared y’know .
If only people would do things properly and not run around like headless chickens as soon as the project got put under any pressure .
Oh and thinking things through a bit more , that would be good to .
So anyway Sisyphus is waiting for the build to complete and reading a few blogs , picking up a few tips , that kind of thing .
When he comes across a couple of articles :
The Path to Happiness
The first article was about the Dalai Lama and how the Chinese totally fell out with him ‘ cos he would n’t go work for them , and then they moved in and would n’t give him any space to breathe , and there was all this unpleasantness and now he ca n’t go home anymore .
And this is really bad ‘ cos , he is the spiritual leader of his people and they need him , especially with the Chinese an’ all .
But is he glum , is he downcast , no he is one of the happiest people around and very mellow , but sharp too .
And so people ask him , how is it that even when life sucks your always happy ?
So he says , In identifying one ’s mental state as the prime factor in achieving happiness :
“ We do n’t need more money , we do n’t need greater success or fame , we do n’t need the perfect body or even the perfect mate – right now , at this very moment , we have a mind , which is all the basic equipment we need to achieve complete happiness . ”
Human happiness and human satisfaction must ultimately come from within oneself .
It is wrong to expect some final satisfaction to come from money or from a computer .
Your happiness is a product of your mind not the universe around it .
Changing your mind can be difficult , but with effort it can be done .
Strive sincerely and you can be happy independently of your situation .
Order out of Chaos
The second quote is from the Navy Seals mantra when training for close quarters combat ( an unexpected source ) , somewhat different than the first .
“ Fast is slow .
Slow is fast . ”
Watch your fields of fire , pick your targets , aim centre mass , squeeze the trigger .
The faster you go , the more mistakes you make .
The more mistakes you make , the deeper in the shit you will be .
Go slow .
Try not to make mistakes .
Be one with the battle yet transcend it .
Float above the action , survey the scene , target immediate threats , and dispatch them with ruthless efficiency .
Basically it says that if things are going very fast , slow it down .
Concentrate on the immediate issues and deal with them with ruthless efficiency in a calm and precise nature .
Do n’t try to do everything at once , you ’ll can ’t , you will fail .
So …
If you wish to keep your head , while all around you are losing theirs , then follow the Dalai Lama and the Navy Seals :
Slow down , float above the situation and move serenely through the chaos with a happy smile on your face .

US Representative Peter King ( Republican , New York ) , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , has called the New York Times " treasonous " for informing the public about another secret Bush Administration counter - terrorist program , the Associated Press reports .
" We 're at war , and for the Times to release information about secret operations and methods is treasonous , " King reportedly told the wire service .
King has also called for the US Department of Justice ( DoJ ) to investigate the Times and prosecute the reporters , editors and publisher on any and all charges they can dream up .
The program in question uses vast amounts of data supplied by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( Swift ) , a Belgium - based hub for international bank transactions .
It receives transaction messages from approximately 200 countries , and the USA has been sifting the data in search of patterns indicating terrorist financing .
The US has used broad subpoenas to obtain the data , as Swift is not set up to provide targeted information .
US Treasury secretary John Snow said Swift officials volunteered to give the US access to the entire database .
US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales hastened to add that the program is perfectly legal .
And in terms of US law , Gonzales , who has been an apologist for torture and mass wiretapping , might be telling the truth for a change .
The International Emergency Economic Powers
Act of 1977 authorises the President to initiate financial investigations of this nature , although perhaps not with the sort of broad , electronic dragnet approach in use at the moment .
Still , there does n't seem to be much risk for the White House under US law .
As for the laws of other countries whose citizens have been affected , that is another matter entirely .
According to Reuters , the Belgian government has already launched an investigation into the data transfer , which may be illegal under local law .
It 's possible that other countries will follow suit .
The European Commission is reportedly backing away from any regulatory responsibility , citing a lack of appropriate legislation , and pushing the issue back into the hands of member states .
The wind - up could be that Swift will find itself regulated to death , although a whitewash seems the more likely outcome .
In the context of secret , CIA - run prisons in Poland and Romania , and numerous CIA rendition flights through European airports , neither of which has been investigated adequately , this massive exposure of banking data does not appear destined to become much of a cause .
Fortunately for the Bush Administration , Europe appears quite content to know as little as possible about US interference in its various institutions . ®
Today , Tim Berners - Lee , director of the W3C and inventor of the Web , has responded to a call for comments from the US Copyright Office , regarding a proposal to restrict users to only one vendor browser in order to submit forms to that office .
He raises a number of practical issues , suggesting that use of standards is the obvious solution .
He makes it clear that he is not attacking IE :
The failing of the proposed implementation of the preregistration system is its lack of support for standards , not its choice of software .
He mentions security issues , which can and have arisen in connection with all browsers .
As it happens , there was one yesterday involving IE , and some responded to the fact that there is currently no patch for it by suggesting that you use a different browser at least temporarily .
More information on it here , including the suggestion to turn off ActiveX and use it on " trusted " web sites only .
ActiveX again .
Yet web designers will sometimes tell you they can't live without it .
Some of us would much rather , please .
I personally would trade a little less whizbang for a lot more security .
But when a warning like yesterday 's comes up , and a government site requires IE - only , then what do you do ?
You 'll notice he sent it by hand , as well as putting it on the Web .
That is because tomorrow is the deadline , and they require paper letters , not email .
I 'm thinking the Copyright Office might like to compare the paper letter with the one on the Web .
If they do , they will notice that the one they got on paper will type out where the links are to the references ; on the Web , all you have to do is click .
Just a suggestion .
*******************************
22 August 2005 By Hand and on the Web at http://www.w3.org/2005/08/22-w3c-prereg-standards-comments.html "
Office of the General Counsel
U.S. Copyright Office
James Madison Memorial Building , Room LM - 401
101 Independence Avenue , SE. , Washington , DC 20559-6000 In Re : 37 CFR Part 202 [ Docket No. RM 2005 - 9 ]
The United States Copyright Office has requested 1 comment on whether a requirement that certain online forms be submitted only through the use of a single vendor 's World Wide Web browser , to the exclusion of any other hardware or software product or service designed to conform with Web standards .
Such a policy , even if implemented for a short time , would impose a number of practical barriers on those seeking to exercise their pre-registration rights .
The proposed system would be contrary to at least the spirit of Federal information policy adopted by the E - Government Act of 2002 , as well as important OMB management directives regarding Federal Enterprise Architecture and the directive to use voluntary consensus standards .
At the outset , we would like to stress that nothing in this letter should be construed as a criticism of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , which is one of the leading browsers in the field .
We would write the same letter if the choice was to offer support solely for Mozilla Firefox , Safari , or any other product .
The failing of the proposed implementation of the preregistration system is its lack of support for standards , not its choice of software .
As a background to the Copyright Office 's decision to attempt to offer services over the Web without the use of standards , it is important to keep in mind the Web was born and achieved widespread use only because of a commitment to open , vendor - neutral standards .
The early Web faced the threat of fragmentation through the actions of competing browser vendors .
These actions actually jeopardized the broader adoption of the technology .
In response to this threat , we created the World Wide Web Consortium as a global organization , currently over 390 members , for the purpose of enabling the ongoing development of Web standards .
Since those early days in 1994 , we have witnessed the creation of tremendous opportunities , technical , social , and commercial , the world over , in large part due to the commitments of corporate and not - for - profit entities to the development of technical standards that may be implemented in diverse settings and for diverse purposes .
Since then , those content providers , software vendors and service providers who have adopted a standards - based strategy have seen benefits not possible with a proprietary approach .
Proposed Single - Vendor Preregistration Service Will Exclude Large Classes of Potential Users From a practical perspective , the single - vendor restriction will deny preregistration benefits entirely to broad classes of creators of covered copyrighted works .
The flaw in the proposed implementation of the preregistration system lies in the failure to rely on voluntary consensus standards that are widely adopted and readily suited to the task identified by the Copyright Office .
To illustrate the disadvantages of departing from standards - based solutions , we will consider the impact of the specific design proposed in the Supplementary Notice .
While a large proportion of the marketplace uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer to browse the Web , certain classes of users will find it either impossible or extremely inconvenient to do so .
Of the three popular desktop computing platforms in use at the present -- Microsoft Windows , Apple Mac OS , and Linux / Unix -- the latest versions of Internet Explorer are only available for the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems .
2
In some cases , users or their institutions may curtail the use of a browser temporarily or permanently based on flaws in the particular software product .
So even though a user may have a software platform which would support Internet Explorer , that service may be disabled for some reason .
Note that this is not a problem unique to Internet Explorer .
Various browsers have suffered security breaches and the response , often , is to stop using that browser either permanently or until the security bug is fixed .
During that time , the user would be entirely unable to use the preregistration system .
A standards - based strategy would ensure that users can continue to access Copyright Office services notwithstanding the transient security problems that are inevitable for any single piece of software and have plagued all of the popular browsers at one time or another .
While one generally considers the Web to be a service used from a desktop or laptop computer , today 's Web applications are become increasingly mobile and reliant upon browsers written for cell phones , PDAs and other non-PC devices .
Many of these devices come with standards - compliant Web browsers , but users often have no choice whatsoever in the type of browsing software installed .
Some mobile devices are available with mobile versions of Internet Explorer , but many are not .
The NPRM specifically cites the need to preregister movie dailies .
It is easy to imagine that one would want to make such registration immediately upon completing a film shoot .
In that case , the most practical and timely option might be to access the Copyright Office PRE form from a mobile Web - enabled cellphone or PDA .
Restricting access to Internet Explorer only would then unfairly exclude those creators from the benefits of preregistration .
One of the distinct benefits of online access to government services is the increased opportunities it offers to people with disabilities .
The policy of requiring use of a particular software product for accessing Copyright Office services , however , could put Web users with disabilities at a significant disadvantage .
Users with disabilities often must augment their browsing software with special assistive software and / or hardware ( " assistive technology " ) .
The combination of assistive technology and Web browser that a given individual with disabilities has installed and configured may or may not be based on Internet Explorer , given the varied accessibility features of mainstream browsers .
In addition , some individuals with disabilities rely on alternative browsers ( for instance , " talking browsers " ) that are designed to meet their specific needs .
Users with disabilities rely on a standards - based Web to ensure that services they access on the Web will be usable through the variety of mainstream software and specialized assistive technologies that they use .
A single - vendor strategy such as that proposed here will force many disabled users to re-tool their software and hardware environment , or face exclusion from the preregistration services .
The practical effect of this exclusion will not only be on content creators themselves , but also on any employees of content creation firms whose job it is to make preregistration submissions .
Single Vendor Service is Contrary to Federal Information Policy
In addition to the numerous practical impediments that the proposed vendor - specific , non-standard implementation will pose , we believe that the strategy of designing a government Web service around a specific piece of software as opposed to seeking conformance with existing and widely used voluntary industry standards is contrary to Federal information policy .
Congressional enactments like the E - Government Act of 2002 clearly encourage " the use of the Internet and emerging technologies within and across Government agencies to provide citizen - centric Government information and services " .
3
In implementing the policies of the E - Gov Act , the Office of Management and Budget has stated that agency policy should seek to minimize " burden on business by re-using data previously collected or using XML or other open standards to receive transmissions " .
4
The recommended strategy is to " employ ' smart ' buying practices to reduce acquisition and support costs , including software asset management ; and increase the use of standards - compliant software " .
4 According to longstanding policy ( see OMB Circular A - 119 5 ) , standards compliance entails using " voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government - unique standards except where inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical . "
We can see no reason why a standards - compliant solution is impractical .
If it is , there is nothing in the NPRM that explains why .
Hence , we believe that the Copyright Office should reconsider its proposal to implement a single vendor solution and instead pursue a standards - based policy .
This will ensure that all eligible beneficiaries will have access to Copyright Office services , and that the Office is compliant with Federal law and policy , and it is likely to save the Office money in the long run .
Respectfully submitted , /s/ Tim Berners - Lee , Director , World Wide Web Consortium /s/ Daniel J. Weitzner , Technology and Society Domain Leader , World Wide Web Consortium Notes 1 The Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking " seeks information whether any potential preregistration filers would have difficulties using Internet Explorer ( version 5.1 or higher ) to file preregistration claims . "
More generally , " in the interest of achieving support for browsers in the Office 's preregistration processing environment , this notice inquires whether ( and why ) an eligible party who anticipates preregistering a claim on the electronic - only form will not be able to use Internet Explorer to do so , or will choose not to preregister if it is necessary to use Internet Explorer .

Some may consider the use of Internet Explorer on the Macintosh platform impractical as Microsoft announced in 2003 that it stopped development of Internet Explorer for the Macintosh .

今回 のDyne:Bolicの外面は、昨年レビューしたバージョン1.4.1からほとんど代わっていない。アプリケーションメニュー表示順の変更、一部のアプリケーションの入れ換え、各アプリケーションの安定版へのアップグレードが行われている程度だ。大きな変更点は、2.xリリースが新しいdyne:IIコアをベースにしていることで、このコアはスクラッチから書き起こされている。この新たなコアにより、Dyne:Bolicのカスタマイズ版の作成が容易になっている。
Dyne: Bolicは 、Linux From Scratchの手順を使って一から構築されている。このディストリビューションは、あらゆる面で開発者による調整が施されている。Dyne:Bolic 2.4.2は、カスタムのLinuxカーネル2.6.18上で動作し、デスクトップマネージャは最新のXfce 4.4だ。カスタムアプリケーションメニューでは、目的別にアプリケーションを探せる。例えば、ストリーミングビデオ用のアプリケーションを見つけ出すには、「 Video」 →「 Stream」を選択すればよい。オーディオについても同様のサブメニューが用意されており、オーディオとビデオの両メニューともに再生、実行、記録/編集、ストリームという4つの主要機能に基づいて各アプリケーションがリストされている。
収録アプリケーショ ン
Dyne: Bolicには、ビデオおよびオーディオ再生用にXine、XMMS、AmaroK、StreamTunerがパッケージングされている。平均的なディストリビューションには見られないものとして、オーディオ制作用のArdour、ポッドキャストのような録音素材を編集するためのAudacity、楽曲作成のHydrogen、リアルタイムビデオ編集のFreeJ、インターネットで配信するオーディオのミキシングやストリーミングのためのMuSEといった専門的なオーディオおよびビデオアプリケーションがある。
Dyne: Bolicには、USBまたはFireWireポートに接続されるTVチューナカードやカメラのようなデバイスの認識を可能にするドライバも含まれている。あいにくテストに使えるTVチューナカードは手元になかったが、マウス、デジタルカメラ、携帯電話などUSB経由のデバイス接続はうまくいった。ビデオデバイスからのビデオの転送が終わるとすぐに、Cinelerraを使った編集作業やAvidemuxを使ったDVDへの書き込み準備ができるようになる。
Dyne: Bolicには、イメージマニピュレータも用意されている。画像の作成および編集用としてビットマップ画像向けのGIMPとベクタグラフィック向けのInkscapeのほか、3Dオブジェクトのモデリングとゲーム開発用の強力なアプリケーションBlenderもバンドルされている。
Dyne:Bolicのデスクトップ（クリックで拡大）
これらの専門的なアプリケーションに加えて、Dyne:Bolicにはいくつかの汎用アプリケーションもパッケージングされている。Ted、Nedit、Nanoといったシンプルなテキストエディタのほか、ワープロのAbiWord、デスクトップパブリッシングのScribusもある。そのほか、WebブラウザFirefox、IRCクライアントX-Chat、インスタントメッセージングクライアントGaim、電子メールソフトThunderbirdとMutt、P2Pファイル共有ソフトのBitTorrent、KTorrent、Gnutella、Nicotineなども含まれている。
Dyne : Bolic 1.4.1とは異なり、この最新版にはゲームが1つも入っていない。その代わり、WebページエディタのNvu、さらに高度なものとしてGTK2インタフェース作成用のGladeやFLTKユーザインタフェース向けのFluidといったいくつかの開発用アプリケーションが存在する。
Dyne: Bolicの使用法
Dyne:Bolicは、ライブCDとしての利用を想定して作られているが、データをハードディスク上に保存することもできる。Dyne:Bolicを起動する途中で、FAT、NTFS、ext3などあらゆるタイプのハードディスクパーティションの検出とマウントが行われる。Dyne:BolicにはSambaやLinNeighborhoodも含まれているため、FATやNTFSのパーティションをネットワーク経由で簡単にマウントすることができる。
このディストリビューションは私のデスクトップマシンの1台にあるATI Radeonカードを検出したので、もしやと思って試してみたのだが、Xサーバはやはり1024×768の解像度でしか動作しなかった。有線のイーサネットカードは問題なく動作するが、私のノートPCのPCMCIA無線アダプタは、いったん抜いて挿し直さないとうまく動作しなかった。
きちんと動作するようになれば 、Dyne:Bolicで作業環境と設定の保存を行うのは簡単だ。NESTという小さなアプリケーションがあるので、これを使えばパーティションとUSBメモリのどちらにでもワークスペースと設定を保存できる。また、Advanced Encryption Standard（AES）によるデータの暗号化も可能だ。
CDドライブを解放したければ、ライブCDから700MBのdyne/ディレクトリを他のパーティションにコピーすることで、このディストリビューションをPC内に「格納（dock）」できる。それでも、ブート処理を開始するにはこのCDが必要になる。ただし、ハードディスクのマウントが終わり次第その格納先（ドック）が検出されるため、そこでCDを取り出せばハードディスクからブートを続けられる。このドックを使えば、システムとアプリケーションの双方の読み込み時間が大幅に短縮される。
Dyne: Bolicで新しいアプリケーションを追加するには、いくつかの方法がある。Dyne:Bolicの開発者は、インストール作業を不要にするアプリケーションモジュールを用意してくれている。例えば、OpenOffice.orgをインストールするには、そのモジュールをダウンロードして/dyne/modulesディレクトリに置くだけでよい。OpenOffice.orgのほかにも、多数のゲーム、アプリケーション開発、無線のスケジューリングやブロードキャストアプリケーションSoma Suiteのものなど、数々のモジュールが存在する。モジュールが用意されていないアプリケーションが必要な場合は、RPMパッケージまたはDEBパッケージによるインストールが可能だ。
Dyne: Bolicには、目立った問題点が見当たらなかった。バージョン1.4.1に比べて不足を感じるのは、ゲーム機のXbox上でブートしてOpenMosixクラスタの一部として実行する機能が省かれたことくらいだ。付随するマニュアルには、Dyne:Bolicと収録アプリケーションの素晴らしい紹介があり、それぞれのWebサイトや興味深い記事へのリンクも記されている。
Dyne: Bolicは、自らもアーティストである人々（オーディオおよびビデオ用の収録ツールのいくつかはこのディストリビューションの主任開発者が手がけたもの）によってまとめられている点も大きな魅力だ。創造性を表現するアーティストにふさわしいアプリケーションが揃っており、それらのインストールや設定に煩わされることもない。Dyne:Bolicの開発者は、このディストリビューションをスクラッチから作り上げることで、ハードウェア要求を低く抑えている。実際、Dyne:Bolicは非常に無駄の少ない作りなので、CPUがCeleron 1.4GHzでメモリが256MBしかない私のノートPCのメインディストリビューションとして利用している。
これまでにポッドキャストの自作、ラジオ局の運営、映画の編集などをやってみたいと思ったことがある人にとっては、1枚のCDに収められたフリースタジオとしてDyne:Bolicが役立つだろう。

Sirens wail , and Rosa Estrada charges down a dirt path , down the side of a mud bank , then picks her way silently across the stinking , swampy earth .
" Get under the bushes ! " someone barks in a whisper in the blackness of the night .
" Immigration is coming ! "
Twenty Mexicans scramble to the ground , crouching among thick branches and brambles .
" Hello , this is border patrol , " booms a voice in English .
Red and blue lights streak the sky overhead .
In Spanish : " Are you Mexicans ?
It 's too dangerous to cross the river .
Remember your kids and families at home . "
Ms. Estrada lies still , breathing quietly .
She is not on her way to " El Norte . "
About 700 miles from the US - Mexican border , she has paid $ 18 at a park in the central state of Hidalgo that offers a simulated experience of a migrant crossing .
Welcome to Mexico's take on adventure tourism , a five - hour trek that goes well past midnight .
Residents pay to walk in mud past their ankles , balance on ledges – in pitch black – that drop steeply , and sprint across corn fields , kicking up dirt and rocks as they run from fake US border patrol officers dressed in camouflage .
The park was begun by the Hñahñu , an indigenous community in El Alberto that has been decimated by immigration to the US .
Bernardino Martin , El Alberto's municipal leader , says the attraction has been criticized by some people as a training ground for would - be illegal immigrants .
But , he says , the purpose is to pay homage to those who must leave Mexico to earn money for their families , and , above all , to generate more employment so the rest of the community can stay put .
" It has been interpreted badly by some , " says Mr. Martin .
" It is misunderstood .
This is so my neighbors prosper , so that no one else is forced to go . "
No lights , no talking
" Come on , let 's go !
Be quiet , and turn your flashlights off , " yells someone in the group taking the " tour " on a recent night .
The pack walks the river 's edge , then heads up a mountain and dashes into a gulch as immigration officers fan across the road ahead .
" We have you surrounded ! " the officers yell .
" We will let out the dogs . "
Ahead , another group of migrants , who are actually actors from the community , tries to run past the officers but are caught and threatened with deportation .
Gun shots ring out .
The pack behind them moves forward silently , until they find a tunnel and wait patiently .
" It 's an adrenaline rush , " says Alfredo Trejo , an accountant from Tlalnepantla , in the state of Mexico .
Some 3,000 Mexicans like Mr. Trejo have paid for this tour , called the Caminata Nocturna , or Night Hike , since it began two - and - a - half years ago .
Far from picking up tips on how to cross the desert , Trejo and a group of family and friends came out of curiosity : " Someone recommended it ; they said it was fun . "
Others , like Estrada , feel a certain empathy .
She 's been on this " tour " three times , and each time brings a new family member or friend .
" We get so immersed in our lives that we forget how much other people suffer , " says Estrada , from Mexico City , who came with eight family members this time , including her 12 - year - old son .
" I do n't want this to just be fun for him .
I want him to take home the message . "
" Run ! " someone yells , and the group tears off to the road , piling into pickup trucks that barrel down the street and let out passengers at the next " safe " crossing .
Nestled in the mountains of Hidalgo , the town counts 2,200 residents , but more than half of those have left for the US .
Those who stay make sponges and purses out of maguey fibers .
They also run rappelling trips and offer camping in Parque EcoAlberto .
But most people head to Las Vegas , at least temporarily , to find better jobs in construction .
Perhaps it 's no surprise , then , that they have brought a slice of the culture of Vegas home with them .
The Night Hike is part adventure , part environmental lecture , and part history lesson .
On a recent night the pollero , or smuggler , who is named " Poncho , " leads participants in a rendition of the Mexican national anthem .
The group stops next to the Tula River , and participants learn about the spiritual beliefs of the Hñahñu .
" Poncho , " who is really Alfonso Martinez , asks them to pick up two rocks : one with negative vibes and one with positive .
The negative rocks are hurled into the river .
The positive rocks are placed into pockets .
" We want to teach about our community , so that it is respected , " says Mr. Martinez , who , like all other residents , is giving a year of community service at Parque EcoAlberto .
" Then we can start to address the massive inequality in Mexico . "
But it 's clear that most come for the thrill .
The community tries to keep it as realistic as possible , though the park 's employees , many of whom have crossed illegally into the US several times , say it 's nowhere near the real thing .
Will they build a wall if one is constructed across the US border ?
" No way , " says Martin .
Message to son :
Think twice
Eduardo Vazquez , Estrada 's husband , says that he never wanted to go to the US .
" I always thought you have to make it here first . "
But his brother crossed 15 years ago , and this experience has underscored the risks .
" It gives you a social conscience . "
He had another motive , he says , putting his arms around his son , Eduardo : that he never attempt the real thing by himself .
His ploy seems to have worked .
Kids were fighting to keep pace in the back .
One whined , " Are n't we there yet ? "
As the tour winds down , participants lay down in exhaustion on the cold earth .
They are dirty .
One man had fallen into a rushing stream .
Several were limping .
There was no attempt to simulate the entrance into the US .
But these Mexicans got something even better :
They got to go home .

I 'm no exception to the lying - human - scumbag rule ; in fact I probably tell more lies than most .
Usually they are bog - standard white lies - compliments , mainly , although pretty much any statement that implies I give a toss about anyone other than myself is almost certainly untrue .
I 'd also class the majority of my facial expressions as white lies : occasional looks of concern , fixed masks of rapt concentration , smiles , you name it - all absolute bloody lies .
If it were socially acceptable to do so , I 'd walk around looking as blank as a Cyberman .
Balls to the lot of you .
Fend for yourselves .
My favourite kind of lie is the pointless but plausible lie ; the odd nugget of needless fiction dropped into conversation just for the hell of it .
For instance , whenever anyone I know returns from a holiday abroad and asks if anything interesting happened while they were gone , it amuses me to claim , for no reason whatsoever , that the actress Pauline Quirke died while performing a hang - gliding stunt on This Morning .
In my experience , this is just conceivable enough for them to swallow it whole .
They 'll only discover the truth months or maybe years later , the next time they see her on TV , and by then they 've forgotten who lied to them in the first place - the idiots .
It 's a fun little game .
Even though you rarely get to see the fruits of your labour first - hand ( since you 're long gone before the penny drops ) , pointless fibbing fleetingly makes your life seem 4 % more interesting than it actually is , so I wholeheartedly recommend it .
To get you started , here are four brief examples for you to sow as you see fit .
1 . Next time you go to the cinema with someone who knows nothing about the film , whisper , " I bet I can work out which one 's the android before you , " just as it starts .
They 'll spend the rest of the film studying the cast in completely the wrong way .
I tried this out recently when watching the movie Crash with someone , and it improved it a thousandfold .
2 . Text a friend at random saying : " Wahey !
I 'm in a HELICOPTER ! "
Someone did this to me once ; it worked a treat .
Try it now .
Go on .
3 . When passing a cemetery , nonchalantly claim Sherlock Holmes is buried there .
The number of people who fall for this is frankly astounding .
4 . You and a friend are listening to an unfamiliar song on the radio .
Before it finishes , say , " I can't believe this is Charles Dance - the man 's lost his mind " , then maintain that it is Charles Dance , it really bloody is , honestly , you read about it somewhere .
Keep the pretence up as long as you can , despite their protestations , even if it 's a woman singing .
Say he 's recorded it for a cow charity .
Get angry if they do n't believe you .
They will eventually .
They always do .
Anyway , there you go .
Now get lying .
It 's good for you .
